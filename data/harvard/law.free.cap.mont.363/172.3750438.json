We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">\u00b62 Because many of LeMay\u2019s issues and arguments in these three causes of action overlap, we have consolidated them into this one Opinion in which we address the following five issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred when it denied LeMay\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds of outrageous government conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">\u00b64 2. Whether LeMay received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred when it denied LeMay\u2019s motion to withdraw his nolo contendere pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court erred when it denied LeMay\u2019s motion to suppress for lack of particularized suspicion to conduct an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b67 5. Whether the District Court erred when it denied LeMay\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of state criminal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b68 LeMay moved to Fairview, Montana, in June 2009. He testified at his sentencing hearing that he loves to ride motorcycles and that he had hoped to open a repair shop in the area. According to LeMay, immediately upon moving to Fairview, he began to receive tickets from law enforcement officers who mistakenly believed he was part of a motorcycle gang. He claims that in a matter of a few months, he received approximately 40 tickets for various offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b69 This appeal concerns various traffic and criminal offenses allegedly committed by LeMay on July 11 and 15, and August 26,2009. The facts giving rise to each of these offenses, as reported in the Affidavit and Application for Permission to File an Information in each case, are detailed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">DA 10-0538 (District Court Cause No. DC 09-48)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u00b610 On July 11, 2009, Donna Goff of the Richland County Coalition Against Domestic Violence reported to law enforcement officers that an individual named Bryan was leaving threatening notes under the door of Laurie Ketterling at the Sunrise Inn in Sidney, Montana. Goff also reported that this Bryan rides a motorcycle. Later that evening, Ketterling twice called the Richland County Law Enforcement Center regarding LeMay. In the first call, Ketterling stated that LeMay was on his way to her room to physically harm her. In the second call, Ketterling reported that LeMay was outside her room.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">\u00b611 When Sheriffs Deputy Michael Lange arrived on the scene, he saw LeMay pull out of the motel parking lot on his motorcycle. Lange conducted an investigative stop wherein he determined that LeMay was under the influence of alcohol. Because LeMay failed various field sobriety tests, he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs (DUI) in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. LeMay consented to provide a blood sample, which, upon testing by the state crime lab, revealed that his BAC was 0.14. Since it was determined that LeMay had five prior convictions for DUI between 1977 and 2002, this offense was charged as a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">DA 10-0535 (District Court Cause No. DC 09-31)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">\u00b612 On July 15,2009, Fairview Police Officer Richard Hollenbeck saw an individual on a motorcycle make an illegal U-turn as it left the Waterhole No. 3 Saloon. Officer Hollenbeck followed the motorcycle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>and made a traffic stop. Officer Hollenbeck noted at that time that the individual\u2019s pupils were pin-pointed, he smelled strongly of alcohol, he had trouble keeping his balance when he got off the motorcycle, and he had trouble finding his driver\u2019s license in his wallet. Eventually the individual produced a North Dakota driver\u2019s license identifying him as LeMay. Officer Hollenbeck administered a preliminary alcohol screening test which showed that LeMay\u2019s BAC was 0.185. LeMay was charged with felony DUI -under \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. In addition, the North Dakota Department of Transportation confirmed that LeMay did not have a Class M motorcycle license; thus he was also charged with Operating a Motorcycle Without Motorcycle Endorsement, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a761-5-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">DA 10-0536 (District Court Cause No. DC 09-39)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b613 On the evening of August 26, 2009, Officer Hollenbeck noticed a motorcycle driving without its lights, and traveling 37 mph in a 25 mph zone. When Officer Hollenbeck initiated a traffic stop, the motorcyclist identified himself as LeMay\u2019s son. Officer Hollenbeck cited him for speeding, operating without lights, operating without insurance, and displaying a suspended driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b614 As Officer Hollenbeck was sitting in his patrol car writing the last citation, LeMay arrived at the scene and approached the patrol car. Officer Hollenbeck got out of the car. As he did so, he told LeMay that he was close enough and that he should stop. LeMay refused and approached to within a foot of Officer Hollenbeck. Officer Hollenbeck ordered LeMay to back up, but again LeMay refused. Because LeMay was behaving in an agitated manner, Office Hollenbeck radioed for backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b615 Officer Hollenbeck handed LeMay\u2019s son copies of the four citations, and told him that because the motorcycle\u2019s lights were defective, the motorcycle would have to be towed. LeMay began arguing with Officer Hollenbeck telling him that he could not tow his son\u2019s motorcycle. According to Officer Hollenbeck, LeMay used threatening, profane, and abusive language, and would not leave when instructed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u00b616 When LeMay approached Officer Hollenbeck with his fists clenched, Officer Hollenbeck told LeMay that he was under arrest for obstructing a peace officer. Officer Hollenbeck instructed LeMay to turn around and place his hands in the small of his back, but LeMay refused. When Officer Hollenbeck attempted to place handcuffs on LeMay\u2019s wrists, LeMay jerked away from Officer Hollenbeck and attempted to pull something out of his right rear pocket, which Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Hollenbeck believed to be a butterfly knife. After a struggle, Officer Hollenbeck managed to get the weapon away from LeMay and get him into the patrol car. At that time, Officer Hollenbeck identified the weapon as a pocket-sized Schrade multi-tool.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b617 LeMay was charged with Disorderly Conduct, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA; Obstructing a Peace Officer, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-7-302, MCA; Assault, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-201, MCA; Resisting Arrest, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a745-7-301, MCA; and Assault on a Peace Officer, a felony, in violation of \u00a745-5-210, MCA. The State later added a charge of Assault with a Weapon, a felony, in violation of \u00a745-5-213, MCA, as an alternative for the charge of Assault on a Peace Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"A6E\">\u00b618 Originally, Jeff Nehring acted as LeMay\u2019s counsel in all three cases, but eventually, the court appointed Ali Moulton to represent LeMay on the charges in Cause Nos. 09-39 and 09-48. Nehring continued to represent LeMay in Cause No. 09-31 regarding one felony DUI charge and the charge of failure to have the proper motorcycle endorsement. Nehring filed several motions which the District Court applied to all three cases. These motions included a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction; a motion to dismiss for outrageous government conduct; and a motion to suppress for lack of particularized suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"AMM0\">\u00b619 In the first motion, LeMay argued that he is Indian and that since Richland County is Indian Country, the State of Montana does not have jurisdiction over him. On the second motion regarding outrageous government conduct, LeMay claimed that based on the numerous tickets he has received since moving to Fairview, he is being racially profiled and illegally harassed by law enforcement officers. As to the third motion, pertaining specifically to Cause No. 09-31, LeMay argued that Officer Hollenbeck lacked particularized suspicion to perform an investigative stop because LeMay did not make an illegal U-turn as Officer Hollenbeck claimed. LeMay\u2019s motions were denied by the District Court in one-page orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b620 On March 31,2010, LeMay entered into a plea agreement wherein he agreed to plead nolo contendere to all of the charges while reserving his right to appeal. However, prior to sentencing, LeMay filed a motion to withdraw his nolo contendere pleas in all three cases. Attached to his motion was a handwritten letter outlining the reasons he wished to withdraw his pleas. In his letter, LeMay claimed that during the scuffle with Officer Hollenbeck on August 26,2009, Officer Hollenbeck slammed LeMay\u2019s head against the patrol car aggravating a prior brain injury. LeMay contends that because of this aggravated brain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>injury, he was unable to comprehend the legal proceedings. He further contends that he was not aware that he had pled guilty and that counsel must have entered a guilty plea on the charges without his consent. LeMay also claimed that his counsel and Officer Hollenbeck committed perjury, that the County Attorney\u2019s office had a conflict of interest, and that he was denied his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b621 Prior to the sentencing hearing on August 31, 2010, the District Court heard argument on LeMay\u2019s motion to withdraw his nolo contendere pleas. At that time, LeMay also informed the court that he was not happy with his legal representation. The court denied LeMay\u2019s motion to withdraw his pleas and ordered that the parties proceed with the sentencing hearing. LeMay objected and stated that he was not ready for sentencing as he thought his nolo contendere pleas would be withdrawn and that he was no longer represented by counsel. The court informed LeMay that it had not dismissed LeMay\u2019s attorneys and that they were still present in court and able to represent him. After inquiring of counsel whether they were prepared to cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses, the court proceeded with sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b622 On September 3, 2010, the District Court entered one combined written Judgment and Sentence for all three cases. For his felony convictions, the District Court sentenced LeMay to 13 months with the Department of Corrections (DOC) for placement in an appropriate correctional facility or program followed by five years with DOC along with a $1,000 fine on each of his DUI convictions. The five years on each charge was suspended upon conditions. On his conviction for Assault with a Weapon, LeMay was sentenced to eight years with the DOC with all of that term suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b623 As to LeMay\u2019s misdemeanor convictions, LeMay was fined $500 on his convictions for both Assault and Obstructing a Peace Officer, and sentenced to six months in the Richland County jail on each charge with both terms suspended. On his conviction for Resisting Arrest, LeMay was sentenced to six months in the Richland County jail with all but 30 days suspended. On his conviction for Disorderly Conduct, LeMay was fined $100. And, on his conviction for Operating a Motor Vehicle without a Motorcycle Endorsement, LeMay was fined $85. In addition, the court ordered that LeMay\u2019s sentences on each of his convictions were to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u00b624 LeMay now appeals the court\u2019s Judgment and Sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">ISSUE 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">\u00b625 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied LeMay\u2019s motion </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>to dismiss on the grounds of outrageous government conduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b626 LeMay argues on appeal that the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss on the grounds of outrageous government conduct because law enforcement officers illegally harassed and racially profiled him. LeMay asks this Court, as he did the District Court, to consider expanding the theory of outrageous government conduct to fit this case because, according to LeMay, all of his charges stem from illegal racial profiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b627 \u2018The denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case presents a question of law which we review de novo.\u201d <em>State v. Roundstone, </em>2011 MT 227, \u00b6 11, 362 Mont. 74, 261 P.3d 1009 (quoting <em>State v. Knowles, </em>2010 MT 186, \u00b6 23, 357 Mont. 272, 239 P.3d 129).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\n<em>B. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\u00b628 The United States Supreme Court first articulated the defense of outrageous government conduct in <em>United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 93 S. Ct. 1637 (1973), wherein an undercover narcotics agent investigating the defendant and his confederates supplied the defendant with one of the ingredients necessary to manufacture methamphetamine. Although the ingredient was a legal substance, it was difficult to obtain. Based on evidence obtained by the narcotics agent, the defendant was convicted of three counts of unlawfully manufacturing and selling methamphetamine. <em>Russell, </em>411 U.S. at 424-27, 93 S. Ct at 1639-40. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the conviction concluding as a matter of law that a defense to a criminal charge may be founded upon \u201can intolerable degree of governmental participation in the criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>411 U.S. at 424, 93 S. Ct at 1639. Thereafter, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">While we may some day be presented with a situation in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction, the instant case is distinctly not of that breed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-10\"><em>Russell, </em>411 U.S. at 431-32,93 S. Ct at 1643 (internal citation omitted). \u00b629 Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Russell, </em>both state and federal courts have limited the defense of outrageous government conduct to \u201cextreme cases in which the government essentially manufactured the crime or generated new crimes merely for the sake of pressing criminal charges against the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Ditton, </em>2006 MT 235, \u00b6 34, 333 Mont. 483, 144 P.3d 783 (citing <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>Williams-Rusch, </em>279 Mont. 437, 445, 928 P.2d 169, 174 (1996) <em>overruled in part on other grounds by City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, 290 Mont. 148, 965 P.2d 866).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b630 The allegedly outrageous government conduct in this case centers on LeMay\u2019s claims that he was harassed by law enforcement officers because they mistakenly believed that LeMay was a white supremacist and a member of an outlaw biker gang. It is on that basis that LeMay argues that he was racially profiled.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b631 \u201c\u2018Racial profiling\u2019 means the detention, official restraint, or other disparate treatment of an individual solely on the basis of the racial or ethnic status of the individual.\u201d Section 44-2-117(8)(c), MCA. This statute prohibits racial profiling by law enforcement officers. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">(2) The race or ethnicity of an individual may not be the sole factor in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">(a) determining the existence of probable cause to take into custody or arrest an individual; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">(b) constituting a particularized suspicion that an offense has been or is being committed in order to justify the detention of an individual or the investigatory stop of a motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">(3) Each law enforcement agency shall adopt a policy on race-based traffic stops that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">(a) prohibits the practice of routinely stopping <em>members of minority groups </em>for violations of vehicle laws as a pretext for investigating other violations of criminal law ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">Section 44-2-117, MCA (emphasis added). In addition, \u00a744-2-117(8)(a), MCA, defines a \u201cminority group\u201d as an individual of \u201cAfrican American, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, or Middle Eastern descent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">\u00b632 In this case, although LeMay is Native American, he does not base his claim of racial profiling on his Native American heritage. Instead, he claims that he was racially profiled because law enforcement officers believed him to be a white supremacist and a member of a biker gang. To demonstrate that, LeMay refers to a letter introduced at sentencing written by Officer Hollenbeck wherein that officer notes that Ttjhere have been numerous unconfirmed reports that Lemay [sic] is a White Supremacist, and also involved with the Banditos Motorcycle Gang.\u201d These, however, are not minority groups that \u00a744-2-117, MCA, was designed to protect. And, contrary to his claim that he was profiled because he is a biker, the deputy county attorney pointed out that of the three members of the Fairview Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Department, two of the officers are themselves bikers.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b633 Moreover, LeMay does not claim that any government agent participated in or manufactured any of the criminal activity which led to his charges or convictions, nor does he claim that any government agent generated new crimes merely for the sake of pressing criminal charges against him. LeMay never ties his conduct of riding his motorcycle with a BAC of 0.14 in one instance and 0.185 in another instance, or his riding his motorcycle without a motorcycle endorsement, to any alleged police misconduct. Furthermore, he has failed to show that the alleged police misconduct violated his constitutional rights relating to the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b634 LeMay contends that the State should be barred from prosecuting him based on law enforcement\u2019s outrageous actions. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that prosecution should be barred \u201c\u2018only when the government\u2019s conduct is so grossly shocking and so outrageous as to violate the universal sense of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>710 F.2d 535, 539 (9th Cir. 1983) (quoting <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>548 F.2d 782, 789 (9th Cir. 1976), <em>cert denied, </em>430 U.S. 965, 97 S. Ct. 1644 (1977)). That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\n<em>C. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b635  We conclude that LeMay has not demonstrated outrageous conduct in accordance with the above principles. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err when it denied LeMay\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds of outrageous government conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">ISSUE 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\u00b636 <em>Whether LeMay received ineffective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">\u00b637 LeMay contends that both of his counsel failed to provide him with effective assistance because they failed to investigate the case against him or his assertions that he was being racially profiled and illegally harassed by the law enforcement community in Fairview.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">\u00b638 A defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes mixed questions of law and fact which this Court reviews de novo. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861 (citing <em>State v. Racz, </em>2007 MT 244, \u00b6 13, 339 Mont. 218, 168 P.3d 685).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">\n<em>B. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">\u00b639 The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee individuals the right to counsel in criminal prosecutions. We have adopted the two-part test articulated by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), to analyze ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Under that test, a defendant must prove (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Racz, </em>\u00b6 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b640 A defendant must satisfy both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Adams v. State, </em>2007 MT 35, \u00b6 22, 336 Mont. 63, 153 P.3d 601). Hence, if a defendant makes an insufficient showing regarding one prong of the test, there is no need to address the other prong. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Adams, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b641 We clarified in <em>Whitlow </em>that the proper standard for evaluating defense counsel\u2019s performance is to determine whether counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12, 20. We also clarified in <em>Whitlow </em>that the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and is based on sound trial strategy still remains. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21. \u2018To establish prejudice, the defendant must show \u2018a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Howard, </em>2011 MT 246, \u00b6 22, 362 Mont. 196, 265 P.3d 606 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068).</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">\u00b642 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are appropriate for consideration on direct appeal when they are capable of resolution by examining the record alone. <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>In re Petition of Hans, </em>1998 MT 7, \u00b6 41, 288 Mont. 168, 958 P.2d 1175). To make this determination, we must ask why counsel did or did not perform as alleged, and if the record explains why, we will address the issue on direct appeal. <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b643 Because the record in the case <em>sub judice </em>explains why counsel acted as they did, we are able to address this issue on direct appeal. We note first that LeMay\u2019s belief that his counsel provided ineffective assistance because they failed to pursue a claim of outrageous government conduct ignores the fact that counsel did pursue such a claim by filing a motion to dismiss and lengthy supporting brief. The reasons counsel did not go further in pursuing that claim are explained in the transcript of the April 5, 2010 change of plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u00b644 During that hearing, the District Court asked LeMay whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>had any communication problems with his attorneys. LeMay responded that he did have problems as he had <em>\u201ca </em>different reality about how the defense should be presented.\u201d He maintained that he had asked not only his attorneys, but the deputy county attorney to investigate his claims. When the court asked counsel for clarification, Nehring replied that LeMay was referring to Officer Hollenbeck who was the arresting officer on two of the three criminal matters involving LeMay and that LeMay wanted Officer Hollenbeck\u2019s conduct investigated. When the court asked Nehring if he had any communication problems with his client, Nehring responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">Obviously, Mr. LeMay has made some requests that as an attorney I think it\u2019s more appropriate for an investigating agency to look into other than myself, and that\u2019s where I believe some of the reference of miscommunication is that he would like me to do things that I don\u2019t really see as my role as the attorney ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADZ\">When asked the same question by the court, Moulton agreed with Nehring\u2019s assessment of the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b645 T. R. Halvorson, the deputy county attorney, added the following regarding LeMay\u2019s claim of outrageous government conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">[LeMay would] like to have that investigated and he\u2019s trying to communicate that it is broader than just Officer Richard Hollenbeck. There are others certainly in that Department, maybe-elsewhere in the government in Fairview besides the police department. I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to get across. As far as I can see, they are not impediments to his pleading or carrying out his agreement, and these investigations can go forward, and in a meeting that he and Mr. Nehring and I had back when Mr. Nehring was the attorney for him on all three cases we met in my office; we looked on the web site of the attorney general; we showed [LeMay] where the Criminal Investigation Bureau contact information is. That\u2019s the outlet that I was aware of that he could be referred to; whether he\u2019s done that or not, I don\u2019t know, but we did try to help him find where he could do this with an independent investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u00b646 Halvorson made similar statements prior to the sentencing hearing when the District Court heard argument on LeMay\u2019s motion to withdraw his nolo contendere pleas. At that time, Halvorson stated the following regarding a discussion that occurred during one of the plea negotiation meetings with LeMay and his counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">I found the page of the Montana Department of Justice website for the Criminal Investigation Bureau where a person could make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>a complaint or request an investigation when it appears that local authorities for some reason are not doing what they should. I printed that page out and in the presence of Mr. Nehring and gave him that page. I said that because I\u2019m part of the local government that you distrust it\u2019s not going to settle your mind if I investigate Officer Hollenbeck and decide that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.... You go to this centralized Department of Justice Bureau and it\u2019s better to have them investigate from the outside, so I gave him that.... I said there\u2019s your on ramp if you want to get an investigation of Officer Hollenbeck, and it appeared that then he was satisfied and he had no more complaints that I wasn\u2019t investigating Hollenbeck or Mr. Nehring wasn\u2019t investigating Hollenbeck or Ms. Moulton wasn\u2019t investigating Hollenbeck.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b647 Even if counsel were able to do more to investigate LeMay\u2019s claims of outrageous government conduct, it would not have changed the fact that LeMay drove his motorcycle with a BAC of 0.185 in one instance and 0.14 in another instance, or that he did not have a motorcycle endorsement on his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\n<em>C. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b648  Based on the foregoing, we conclude that LeMay has failed to demonstrate that his counsels\u2019 conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, or that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsels\u2019 allegedly unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Accordingly, we hold that both Nehring\u2019s and Moulton\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">ISSUE 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b649 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied LeMay\u2019s motion to withdraw his nolo contendere pleas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\u00b650 LeMay argues that his nolo contendere pleas were not made knowingly or voluntarily because he is suffering from a traumatic brain injury that affected his comprehension of the proceedings. LeMay also argues that he should be allowed to withdraw his pleas because he received ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to investigate the case against him or his assertions that he was being racially profiled and illegally harassed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">\u00b651 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea de novo, because the issue of whether a defendant entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>a plea voluntarily is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>State v. Robinson, </em>2009 MT 170, \u00b6 10, 350 Mont. 493, 208 P.3d 851 <em>(citing State v. Swensen, </em>2009 MT 42, \u00b6 9, 349 Mont. 268, 203 P.3d 786).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\n<em>B. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b652 A court may for good cause permit a defendant to withdraw a plea of guilty and substitute a not guilty plea. <em>State v. McFarlane, </em>2008 MT 18, \u00b6 11, 341 Mont. 166, 176 P.3d 1057 (citing \u00a746-16-105(2), MCA). \u2018Good cause\u201d includes the involuntariness of the plea, but it may also include other criteria such as claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 17, 327 Mont. 352, 114 P.3d 254; <em>Hans v. State, </em>283 Mont. 379, 410, 942 P.2d 674, 693 (1997), <em>overruled in part and on other grounds by Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861). We stated in <em>McFarlane </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">Tw]here a defendant is represented by counsel during the plea process and enters his plea upon the advice of counsel, the voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel\u2019s advice was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\"><em>McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting <em>Hans, </em>283 Mont. at 411, 942 P.2d at 693). \u00b653 Relying on <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 90 S. Ct. 1463 (1970), we also stated in <em>McFarlane:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">\u2018TW]e will not overturn a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea if the defendant was aware of the direct consequences of such a plea, and if his plea was not induced by threats, misrepresentations, or an improper promise such as a bribe.\u201d <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 32. When determining if a defendant entered a plea voluntarily and whether a district court erred in denying a motion to withdraw a plea, we examine \u201ccase-specific considerations.\u201dThese considerations include the adequacy of the district court\u2019s interrogation, the benefits obtained from a plea bargain, the withdrawal\u2019s timeliness, and other considerations that may affect the credibility of the claims presented. <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2005 MT 234, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 24, 328 Mont. 397, 121 P.3d 521.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-9\"><em>McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">\u00b654 In this case, the record from the April 5, 2010 change of plea hearing indicates that the District Court explained to LeMay what a nolo contendere plea entailed and LeMay indicated that he understood.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">THE COURT: Okay. I understand that you\u2019re going to be pleading nolo contendere, but do you understand that even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>pleading nolo contendere under the eyes of the law is viewed as if you pled guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">THE COURT: You won\u2019t have to explain to me what you did that makes you believe you are guilty of any offense to which you plead guilty, but after entering a plea of nolo contendere, other people looking at what happened here today will treat it, treat you, as if you are guilty of the offenses to which you enter a plea of nolo contendere. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">[LeMay]: Yeah, yes I do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b655 The record also reveals that the court thoroughly questioned LeMay before accepting his nolo contendere pleas on each charge. Hence, we conclude that LeMay was well aware of the consequences of his nolo contendere pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u00b656 In addition, LeMay failed to provide any medical evidence to support his contention that the scuffle with Officer Hollenbeck aggravated LeMay\u2019s prior brain injury and affected his comprehension of the proceedings. Furthermore, prior to the sentencing hearing, when the District Court heard argument on LeMay\u2019s motion to withdraw his pleas, Halvorson, the deputy county attorney, pointed out that LeMay \u201cwas himself personally present and verbally participating in the give and exchange\u201d regarding extensive plea negotiations \u201cthat lasted for hours.\u201d Halvorson also stated regarding those plea negotiations that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alr\">[LeMay] was engaged. In fact, he raised contentions and issues himself at these meetings that the attorneys didn\u2019t raise that provided the State with reasons to give him the considerations you see in these [Plea] Agreements. This is kind of an unusual Agreement you\u2019re looking at here for this district, but he gave reasons that motivated the State to accept that we should give him these considerations. He knew exactly what he wanted and he understood how to get it. He was effective in his participation and in fact obtained the considerations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\n<em>C. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u00b657  We conclude that LeMay understood the consequences of his nolo contendere pleas and that he failed to establish good cause to support withdrawal of those pleas. Accordingly, we hold that LeMay\u2019s nolo contendere pleas were voluntarily entered and we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">ISSUE 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">\u00b658 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied LeMay\u2019s motion </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>to suppress for lack of particularized suspicion to conduct an investigative stop.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b659 LeMay contends that the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress because, according to LeMay, he did not make an illegal U-turn; thus Officer Hollenbeck did not have sufficient facts to form a particularized suspicion of wrongdoing to conduct an investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b660 We review the denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the lower court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Flynn, </em>2011 MT 48, \u00b6 6, 359 Mont. 376, 251 P.3d 143 (citing <em>State v. Larson, </em>2010 MT 236, \u00b6 15, 358 Mont. 156, 243 P.3d 1130). Findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if they are based upon a misapprehension of the evidence or if our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been made. <em>Flynn, </em>\u00b6 6, (citing <em>Weer v. State, </em>2010 MT 232, \u00b6 7, 358 Mont. 130, 244 P.3d 311).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\n<em>B. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u00b661 Both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. These constitutional protections extend to investigative stops of vehicles by law enforcement officers. <em>Flynn, </em>\u00b6 7 (citing <em>Larson, </em>\u00b6 19). Under Montana law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">[i]n order to obtain or verify an account of the person\u2019s presence or conduct or to determine whether to arrest the person, a peace officer may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Section 46-5-401(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">\u00b662 Hence, to establish particularized suspicion for a stop, the State must show that the officer possessed (1) objective data and articulable facts from which the officer can make certain reasonable inferences, and (2) a resulting suspicion that the person to be stopped has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense. <em>Brown v. State, </em>2009 MT 64, \u00b6 20, 349 Mont. 408, 203 P.3d 842. \u2018Whether particularized suspicion exists is evaluated under the totality of the circumstances and requires consideration of the quantity or content of the information available to the officer and the quality or degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>reliability of that information.\u201d <em>City of Missoula v. Moore, </em>2011 MT 61, \u00b6 16, 360 Mont. 22, 251 P.3d 679 (citing <em>State v. Rutherford, </em>2009 MT 154, \u00b6 12, 350 Mont. 403, 208 P.3d 389).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b663 We pointed out in <em>Flynn </em>that when we first adopted the particularized suspicion standard for vehicular stops, we recognized that the inquiry turned on what the officer knew, observed, inferred, and ultimately suspected, not what the defendant later testified to. <em>Flynn, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>State v. Gopher, </em>193 Mont. 189, 193-94, 631 P.2d 293, 296 (1981)). Thus, we stated in <em>Flynn </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">[a] defendant\u2019s subsequent, valid explanation for conduct that objectively appeared suspicious may affect his or her ultimate liability for a charged offense, but it cannot affect the validity of a stop properly based on particularized suspicion. The particularized suspicion inquiry is a fact based assessment of the objective quantity, content and reliability of information available to the officer. An officer in the field need not consider every possible innocent explanation or legal exception before concluding that particularized suspicion exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\"><em>Flynn, </em>\u00b6 11 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b664 In this case, Officer Hollenbeck stopped LeMay on Montana State Highway No. 200, a north-south road known as Ellery Avenue in the town of Fairview. Officer Hollenbeck stopped LeMay for making an illegal U-turn after he observed LeMay on his motorcycle in the northbound lane of Ellery Avenue drive across the double-yellow center line then turn left into the southbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\u00b665 LeMay argues that he did not make an illegal U-turn because he was not northbound on Ellery Avenue prior to crossing the double-yellow center line. LeMay maintains that his motorcycle was parked with the rear wheel against the curb; thus when he drove from his parked position across the double-yellow center line of Ellery Avenue he was proceeding west prior to turning left into the southbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"A2S\">\u00b666 However, LeMay conceded that he crossed the two-lane divided roadway and travelled through the double yellow lines to make a left-hand turn. This by itself was an unusual turn or movement sufficient to establish particularized suspicion. In <em>Weer, </em>we held that particularized suspicion for an investigative stop existed where the officer testified he saw the defendant swerve within his own lane and drive onto, but not over, the double-yellow center line on a two-lane highway. <em>Weer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\u00b667 LeMay cites to \u00a761-8-328(4), MCA, to support his contention that he did not perform an illegal U-turn. Section 61-8-328(4), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>provides that it is not a violation of the law for a person to \u201cturn a vehicle left across a lane marked with two yellow lines into a public or private parking lot, private road, private driveway, or roadway if the turn can be made safely and if the person does not hinder the flow of oncoming traffic.\u201d That is not what LeMay was doing, however. The undisputed facts in this case show that LeMay was not turning <em>\u201cinto </em>a public or private parking lot, private road, private driveway, or roadway [emphasis added].\u201d Rather, he was turning wholly upon and within Ellery Avenue. LeMay made a turn resulting in his making a 180-degree change of direction from the lawful direction where he started, i.e., he reversed from northbound to southbound by crossing the double-yellow center line.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b668 Moreover, LeMay acknowledged that several \u2018No U-turn\u201d signs were posted throughout Ellery Avenue. A statutory or city ordinance violation alone establishes a particularized suspicion for a valid investigative stop. <em>See Rutherford, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\n<em>C. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b669  We conclude that based on the totality of the circumstances, Officer Hollenbeck had sufficient facts to form a particularized suspicion of wrongdoing to initiate an investigative stop. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err when it denied LeMay\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">ISSUE 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">\u00b670 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied LeMay\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of state criminal jurisdiction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\u00b671 LeMay contends that the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for lack of state criminal jurisdiction because he is Indian and Richland County is Indian Country. Hence, he maintains that his alleged crimes are covered by federal law thereby divesting the State of Montana of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">\u00b672 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>In re Estate of Big Spring, </em>2011 MT 109, \u00b6 20, 360 Mont. 370, 255 P.3d 121 (citing <em>Cooper v. Glaser, </em>2010 MT 55, \u00b6 6, 355 Mont. 342, 228 P.3d 443). A district court must determine whether the complaint states facts that, if true, would vest the court with subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Big Spring, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>Meagher v. Butte-Silver Bow City-County, </em>2007 MT 129, \u00b6 13, 337 Mont. 339, 160 P.3d 552). The district court\u2019s determination is a conclusion of law that we review for correctness. <em>Big Spring, </em>\u00b6 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>(citing <em>Zempel v.

McCormick, </em>986 F.2d 303 (9th Cir. 1993), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that \u201cIndian country criminal jurisdiction is allocated among federal, state, and tribal courts depending on the subject matter of the crime, the persons involved in the crime, and the locus of the crime.\u201d <em>LaPier, </em>986 F.2d at 304 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b674 In the instant case, it is not necessary for this Court to determine whether LeMay is affiliated with a particular Tribe since his claim of lack of state criminal jurisdiction fails based on the locus of his crimes. Most of LeMay\u2019s crimes at issue in this appeal occurred in the town of Fairview (one DUI occurred in Sidney). Both Fairview and Sidney are in Richland County, Montana. In its brief opposing LeMay\u2019s motion, the State provided ample evidence via maps, town plats and certificates of survey to show that the town of Fairview is an independently incorporated city of the State of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b675 Furthermore, we determined long ago that \u2018ho part of Richland County lies within the boundaries of\u2018Indian Country\u2019 <em>....\u2019\u2019In re Diserly, </em>140 Mont. 219, 220, 370 P.2d 763, 763 (1962). Like LeMay, the defendant in <em>Diserly </em>was apprehended in Fairview. He entered a plea of guilty to the crime of forgery in the District Court and was sentenced to a term in the Montana State Prison. The defendant in <em>Diserly </em>subsequently petitioned this Court for habeas corpus alleging that he was an Indian ward attached to the Fort Peck Indian Reservation and that his conviction was illegal because the State did not have criminal jurisdiction over him regardless of the location of the crime charged. We disagreed and denied his petition. <em>Diserly, </em>140 Mont. at 220, 370 P.2d 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\n<em>C. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\u00b676  Whether or not LeMay is affiliated with a federally recognized Tribe, his crimes were not committed within Indian Country as he alleged. Accordingly we hold that the District Court did not err when it denied LeMay\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of state criminal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">\u00b677 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER, MORRIS, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
