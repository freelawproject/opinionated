We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b62 Western Tradition Partnership (WTP), Champion Painting and Montana Shooting Sports Foundation (MSSF) sued the Montana Attorney General and the Commissioner of Political Practices seeking a declaration that \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA, violated their freedom of speech protected by the United States and Montana Constitutions by prohibiting political expenditures by corporations on behalf of or opposing candidates for public office. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment along with briefs and supporting materials. The District Court declared the statute unconstitutional, granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and denied summary judgment to the State defendants. The District Court enjoined enforcement of the statute and denied the motion of Champion and MSSF for an award of attorney fees. The State appeals the order of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, and Champion and MSSF cross-appeal from the denial of their request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u00b63 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on summary judgment using the same standards as the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. Where there are cross- motions for summary judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the district court is not called upon to resolve factual issues, but only to draw conclusions of law, we review to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>Bud-Kal v. City of Kalispell, </em>2009 MT 93, \u00b6 15, 350 Mont. 25, 204 P.3d 738. Accordingly, a moving party is entitled to summary judgment when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Town &amp; Country Foods v. City of Bozeman, </em>2009 MT 72, \u00b6 12, 349 Mont. 453, 203 P.3d 1283. Statutes enjoy a presumption of constitutionality, and a decision on the constitutionality of a statute is subject to plenary review. <em>City of Billings v. Albert, </em>2009 MT 63, \u00b6 11, 349 Mont. 400, 203 P.3d 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b64 Section 13-35-227, MCA, was originally enacted as an initiative by the Montana voters in 1912. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">(1) A corporation may not make a contribution or an expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate or a political party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">(2) A person, candidate or political committee may not accept or receive a corporate contribution described in subsection (1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">(3) This section does not prohibit the establishment or administration of a separate segregated fund to be used for making political contributions or expenditures if the fund consists only of voluntary contributions solicited from an individual who is a shareholder, employee or member of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">(4) A person who violates this section is subject to the civil penalty provisions of 13-37-128.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Section 13-37-128, MCA, provides the sanction for a violation of \u00a713-35-227, MCA, and allows the Commissioner of Political Practices to recover a civil penalty up to $500 or triple the amount of the unlawful expenditure. A corporation may establish a separate segregated fund called a political committee or PAC to make political expenditures \u2018if the fund consists of only voluntary contributions solicited from an individual who is a shareholder, employee, or member of the corporation. Section 13-35-227(3), MCA. Montana lawrequires that all political communications must include the name and address of the person or entity that paid for the communication. Section 13-35-225, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">\u00b65 Champion Painting, Inc., is incorporated under the laws of Montana. It is a single proprietor painting and drywall business with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>no employees or members, and its sole shareholder is Kenneth Champion. It is the only business corporation in this action. Mr. Champion is personally active in county and state politics, supporting and opposing candidates through blogs, letters to the editor, and speeches. Champion states that he wants to speak on political issues as a spokesman for his corporation and wants to spend corporation funds to independently support or oppose candidates. He believes that doing so would be prohibited by \u00a713-35-227(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b66 MSSA is a voluntary association of persons who support and promote firearm safety, shooting sports, education, shooting facilities and Second Amendment rights. It was incorporated in 1990 to provide liability shelter for its officers and directors. It has no employees or shareholders and its funding comes primarily from member dues and donations from other organizations. MSSA is led by its founder Gary Marbut, who is active in Montana politics on behalf of the Association. He and the MSSA have operated a political committee under Montana law for over ten years and publicize its grading and endorsements of political candidates in state and national elections. Marbut believes that the MSSA \u2018has a political presence in Montana, and a political reputation that carries some weight with the Montana public by virtue of our long history of activism in Montana.\u201dNonetheless Marbut wants to use MSSA member dues to support or oppose candidates and believes that \u00a713-35-227(1), MCA, prohibits MSSA from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b67 Western Tradition Partnership is an entity incorporated in Colorado in 2008 and registered to do business in Montana. WTP reveals no more than that about itself in this case. Evidence presented by the State in District Court and not refuted by WTP is that its purpose is to act as a conduit of funds for persons and entities including corporations who want to spend money anonymously to influence Montana elections. WTP seeks to make unlimited expenditures in Montana elections from these anonymous funding sources. WTP\u2019s operation is premised on the fact, or at least the assumption, that its independent expenditures have a determinative influence on the outcome of elections in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b68 Upon the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the District Court considered whether \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA, violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to the extent that it restricts WTP, MSSA or Champion from making independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>corporate expenditures on behalf of candidates.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court applied <em>Citizens United v. F.E.C., </em>130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010) and determined that \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA, impacts the corporations\u2019 political speech protected by the United States Constitution. The District Court then considered whether the State had demonstrated a compelling interest for the restriction on speech, and whether the restriction is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. While it answered both questions in the negative, the District Court did not conduct a detailed analysis of the compelling interest question. Instead, it concluded that <em>\u201cCitizens United </em>is unequivocal: the government may not prohibit independent and indirect corporate expenditures on political speech.\u201d (Quoting <em>Minn. Chamber of Comm. v. Gaertner, </em>710 F. Supp. 2d 868 (D. Minn. 2010)). The District Court specifically did not address whether \u00a7 13-35-227, MCA, violated the Montana Constitution, and further noted that the decision had \u201cno effect on direct corporate contributions to candidates or to any existing or future disclosure laws that might be enacted.\u201d Those aspects of Montana law are therefore not at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">\u00b69 We take note that Western Tradition appears to be engaged in a multi-front attack on both contribution restrictions and the transparency that accompanies campaign disclosure requirements. In addition to this case, it is currently engaged in separate litigation in the same District Court involving the Montana laws on campaign spending disclosures. <em>Western Tradition Partnership v. Gallik, </em>Cause BDV 2010-1120 (Mont. 1st Jud. Dist. Ct.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In another action filed in United States District Court in September, 2011, WTP, under its new name of American Tradition Partnership, and with others, challenges the constitutionality of most of the limits and disclosure requirements contained in \u00a713-37-216, MCA. <em>Lair, et al., v. Gallik, et al., </em>United States District Court for the District of Montana, Billings Division. Ironically, perhaps, WTP argued in the District Court and in its oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>presentation to this Court on appeal that their compliance with these same disclosure laws that it now seeks to invalidate should remedy any concerns regarding the potential corrupting influence of its unlimited corporate expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b610 The District Court erroneously construed and applied the <em>Citizens United </em>case. That case considered the constitutionality of Federal statutes and regulations that prohibited corporations from \u201celectioneering\u201d (making a communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office) within 30 days of a primary election or 60 days of a general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b611 <em>Citizens United </em>was a case decided upon its facts, and involved \u201cunique and complex\u201d rules that affected 71 distinct entities and included separate rules for 33 different types of speech in Federal elections. Since 1975, the Federal Election Commission adopted 568 pages of regulations, 1,278 pages of explanatory materials, and 1,771 advisory opinions to implement and enforce the Federal law. The FEC adopted a two-part, 11-factor test in response to the holding in a single Supreme Court decision. If parties want to avoid litigation and possible penalties they must either refrain from political speech or seek an advisory opinion. All of this, the Supreme Court found, allows the FEC to \u201cselect what political speech is safe for public consumption by applying ambiguous tests.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 895-96. The Court determined that the law was \u201can outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b612 A premise of <em>Citizens United </em>was that First Amendment protections extend to corporations. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 899. The Court additionally determined that the option for a corporation to spend through a separate PAC was not a sufficient alternative because of the burdensome, extensive, and expensive Federal regulations that applied. The Federal law allowed corporations to form a separate segregated fund (sometimes called a political action committee or PAC) as long as the funds were limited to donations from stockholders or, in the case of unions, its members. The Court found the regulations governing the organization of PACs to be \u201conerous\u201d restrictions that might not allow a corporation to establish a PAC in time to make its views known in a current campaign. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898. Therefore, because the Federal laws and regulations severely restricted speech, their constitutionality could be maintained only upon a showing that they further a compelling governmental interest and are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u00b613 The Court found that the Government did not claim that corporate expenditures had actually corrupted the political process and concluded that \u201cindependent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 909. However, if elected officials do succumb to improper influences from independent expenditures, \u201cthen surely there is cause for concern.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">\u00b614 The Court determined that the government had not provided a compelling interest to justify the speech restrictions at issue. The Court considered and rejected arguments that preventing the distorting effect of large expenditures; preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption; or protection of dissenting shareholders were sufficient interests to support the Federal restrictions. Therefore, finding no compelling interest for the Federal restrictions on corporate political speech through independent expenditures, the Court found an impermissible contravention ofthe First Amendment. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b615 While <em>Citizens United </em>was decided under its facts or lack of facts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it applied the long-standing rule that restrictions upon speech are not per se unlawful, but rather may be upheld if the government demonstrates a sufficiently strong interest. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898; <em>Federal Election Comm. v. Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc., </em>479 U.S. 238, 251-52, 107 S. Ct. 616, 624 (1986); <em>Bluman v. Federal Election Commission, </em>2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86971 (D. D.C. 2011) (upholding Federal ban against campaign contributions by foreign citizens). The Supreme Court in <em>Citizens United </em>applied the highest level of scrutiny to the restrictions at issue there, requiring the government to demonstrate a compelling interest, although the level of evidence needed to satisfy heightened scrutiny will vary with the \u201cnovelty and plausibility of the justification raised.\u201d <em>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em>528 U.S. 377, 391, 120 S. Ct. 897, 906 (2000). Therefore, the factual record before a court is critical to determining the validity of a governmental provision restricting speech. The Dissents assert that <em>Citizens United </em>holds unequivocally that no sufficient government interest justifies limits on political speech. We disagree. The Supreme Court held that laws that burden political speech are subject to strict scrutiny, which requires the government to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>prove that the law furthers a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to that interest. The Court, citing <em>Wisconsin Right to Life v. FEC, </em>551 U.S. 449, 464, 127 S. Ct. 2652, 2663-64 (2007), clearly endorsed an analysis of restrictions on speech, placing the burden upon the government to establish a compelling interest. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898. Here the government met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b616 In this case both sides moved the District Court for summary judgment. The WTP parties conducted no discovery in the case and presented two brief affidavits, one from the MSSF and one from Mr. Champion in support of summary judgment. The State presented a more extensive record consisting of the deposition transcripts of both Mr. Champion and Mr. Marbut of the MSSF, along with seven affidavits and attached exhibits. The plaintiffs did not contest any of this evidence. Nonetheless, the District Court failed to give adequate consideration to the record in determining whether the State had demonstrated a compelling interest for the restrictions imposed by \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA. We do so now because, unlike <em>Citizens United, </em>this case concerns Montana law, Montana elections and it arises from Montana history.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b617 First, the depositions of Marbut (on behalf of MSSF) and Champion demonstrate that both have been very active politically in Montana on a range of issues that concern them. Neither could demonstrate any material way in which Montana law hindered or censored their political activity or speech. Mr. Marbut, on behalf of MSSF, has been an active fixture in Montana politics and in the legislative process for many years. He stated that he believed that while Montana law allowed MSSF to obtain and spend donations from other organizations on political activities, it did not allow MSSF to use dues paid by its members for the same purposes. No such distinction appears in Montana law, and the affidavit of the Commissioner of Political Practices affirms his construction of Montana law that it places no such restriction on MSSF. MSSF, therefore, failed to demonstrate that its speech was impaired by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b618 Similarly, Mr. Champion described his many political activities both on a local and state level. He affirmed that he regularly speaks, blogs, and meets with others, and has run for public office. His complaint was that he believed that Montana law prohibits him from telling his audiences and readers that his company, Champion Painting, also supports his views. Mr. Champion believes that a candidate endorsement by 'Champion Painting, Inc.\u201d would be more persuasive than his personal endorsement, and that if his business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>spends money on political events he will enjoy \u2018tax benefits.\u2019\u2019However, in Champion\u2019s case he is the sole shareholder and derives his livelihood from the money he pays himself from the corporation. While the statute forbids the expenditure of Champion Painting\u2019s corporate funds to support or oppose candidates, the burden upon Kenneth Champion, as a sole shareholder, to establish a political committee to advocate for his corporation\u2019s interests and expend funds that he will decide to contribute, are particularly minimal. We conclude, under these facts, Champion\u2019s political speech was similarly not materially impacted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\">\u00b619 WTP, as noted, has been terse in its explanations of its organization, funding, activities, and intent. It claims to be a foreign corporation but it is not a business corporation. Its purpose, according to un-rebutted evidence submitted to the District Court by the State, is to solicit and anonymously spend the funds of other corporations, individuals and entities to influence the outcome of Montana elections. In a promotional presentation directed to potential donors, WTP represented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">There\u2019s no limit to how much you can give. As you know, Montana has very strict limits on contributions to candidates, but there is no limit to how much you can give to this program. You can give whatever you\u2019re comfortable with and make as big of an impact as you wish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">Finally, we\u2019re not required to report the name or the amount of any contribution that we receive. So, if you decide to support this program, no politician, no bureaucrat, and no radical environmentalist will ever know you helped make this program possible. <em>The only thing we plan on reporting is our success to contributors like you who can see the benefits of a program like this. You can just sit back on election night and see what a difference you\u2019ve made.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Western Tradition Partnership, <em>2010 Election Year Program Executive Briefing. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b620 Organizations like WTP that act as conduits for anonymous spending by others represent a threat to the \u201cpolitical marketplace.\u201d <em>Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc., </em>479 U.S. at 264, 107 S. Ct. at 631. Echoing that theme, the State presented evidence that WTP has operated in disregard for and without complying with Montana law, unlike MSSF and Champion. Because WTP has not disclosed its operation, it is difficult to determine how it might be impacted by \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA, but given the evidence presented below we will assume there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>a direct impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b621 Second, a material factual distinction between the present case and <em>Citizens United </em>is the extent of the regulatory burden imposed by the challenged law. As noted above, the Court in <em>Citizens United </em>emphasized the length, complexity and ambiguity of the Federal restrictions, including the power of the FEC to determine what speech is \u201csafe for public consumption,\u201d and the difficulty of establishing a PAC as an alternative to direct corporate spending. In contrast, under Montana law a political committee can be formed and maintained by filing simple and straight-forward forms or reports. <em>(See e.g. </em>\u00a7\u00a713-37-201 and -210; 13-35-402, MCA.) Mr. Marbut in his deposition described that MSSF has established its own political committees and used them to actively participate in the Montana political process over a period of years. The evidence submitted by the State in the District Court similarly demonstrates that corporations, through their political committees organized under Montana law, are and have been a substantial presence and active participants in Montana politics. The many lobbyists and political committees who participate in each session of the Montana Legislature bear witness. Under the undisputed facts here, the political committee is an easily implemented and effective alternative to direct corporate spending for engaging in political speech. This alternative is available to any corporation in Montana, and to MSSF and Champion, as well as WTP should they choose to comply with existing Montana law. In the case of MSSF the evidence shows that it has in fact effectively used the political committee form for years and there is no showing that it could not continue to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b622 Third, the Montana law at issue in this case cannot be understood outside the context of the time and place it was enacted, during the early twentieth century. (Montana became a state in 1889.) Those tumultuous years were marked by rough contests for political and economic domination primarily in the mining center of Butte, between mining and industrial enterprises controlled by foreign trusts or corporations. These disputes had profound long-term impacts on the entire State, including issues regarding the judiciary, the location of the state capitol, the procedure for election of U.S. Senators, and the ownership and control of virtually all media outlets in the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b623 Examples of well-financed corruption abound. In the fight over mineral rights between entrepreneur F. Augustus Heinze and the Anaconda Company, then controlled by Standard Oil, Heinze managed to control the two State judges in Butte, who routinely decided cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>in his favor. K. Ross Toole, <em>Montana, An Uncommon Land, </em>196-99 (Univ. of Okla. Press 1959) the Butte judges denied being bribed, but one of them admitted that Anaconda representatives had offered him $250,000 cash to sign an affidavit that Heinze had bribed him. Toole, <em>Montana, An Uncommon Land, </em>204.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\">\u00b624 In response to the legal conflicts with Heinze, in 1903 Anaconda/Standard closed down all its industrial and mining operations (but not the many newspapers it controlled), throwing 4/5 of the labor force of Montana out of work. Toole, <em>Montana, An Uncommon Land, </em>206. Its price for sending its employees back to work was that the Governor call a special session of the Legislature to enact a measure that would allow Anaconda to avoid having to litigate in front of the Butte judges. The Governor and Legislature capitulated and the statute survives. <em>See e.g. Patrick v. State, </em>2011 MT 169, \u00b6\u00b6 17-23, 361 Mont. 204, 257 P.3d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b625 W. A. Clark, who had amassed a fortune from the industrial operations in Butte, set his sights on the United States Senate. In 1899, in the wake of a large number of suddenly affluent members, the Montana Legislature elected Clark to the U. S. Senate. Clark admitted to spending $272,000 in the effort and the estimated expense was over $400,000. Complaints of Clark\u2019s bribery of the Montana Legislature led to an investigation by the U. S. Senate in 1900. The Senate investigating committee concluded that Clark had won his seat through bribery and unseated him. The Senate committee \u201cexpressed horror at the amount of money which had been poured into politics in Montana elections ... and expressed its concern with respect to the general aura of corruption in Montana.\u201d Toole, <em>Montana, An Uncommon Land, </em>186-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b626 In a demonstration of extraordinary boldness, Clark returned to Montana, caused the Governor to leave the state on a ruse and, with assistance of the supportive Lt. Governor, won appointment to the very U. S. Senate seat that had just been denied him. Toole, <em>Montana, An Uncommon Land, </em>192-93. When the Senate threatened to investigate and unseat Clark a second time, he resigned. Clark eventually won his Senate seat after spending enough on political campaigns to seat a Montana Legislature favorable to his candidacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b627 After the Anaconda Company cleared itself of opposition from Heinze and others, it controlled 90% of the press in the state and a majority of the legislature. C. B. Glasscock, <em>The War of the Copper Kings, </em>290 (Grosset &amp; Dunlap, N.Y. 1935). By 1915 the company, after having acquired all of Clark\u2019s holdings as well as many others, \u201cclearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>dominated the Montana economy and political order... [and] local folks now found themselves locked in the grip of a corporation controlled from Wall Street and insensitive to their concerns.\u201d Michael Malone and Richard Roeder, <em>Montana, a History of Two Centuries, </em>176 (Univ. of Wash. Press, Seattle 1976). Even at that time it was evident that industrial corporations controlled the state \u201cthus converting the state government into a political instrument for the furthering and accomplishment of legislation and the execution of laws favorable to the absentee stockholders of the large corporations and inimical to the economic interests of the wage earning and farming classes who constitute by far the larger percentage of the population in Montana.\u201d Helen Fisk Sanders, <em>History of Montana, </em>Vol. 1, 429-30 (Lewis Pub. Co. 1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b628 In 1900 Clark himself testified in the United States Senate that &lt;'[m]any people have become so indifferent to voting\u201d in Montana as a result of the \u2018large sums of money that have been expended in the state....\u201d Toole, <em>Montana, An Uncommon Land, </em>184-85. This naked corporate manipulation of the very government (Governor and Legislature) of the State ultimately resulted in populist reforms that are still part of Montana law. In 1906 the people voted to amend the state Constitution to allow for voter initiatives. Not long thereafter, in 1906 this new initiative power was used to enact reforms including primary elections to choose political candidates; the direct election of United States Senators; and the Corrupt Practices Act, part of which survives as \u00a7 13-35-227, MCA, at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b629 The State of Montana was still contending with corporate domination even in the mid-20th century. For example, the Anaconda Company maintained controlling ownership of all but one of Mont ana\u2019s major newspapers until 1959. Writing in 1959, historian K. Ross Toole so noted and described the state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">Today the influence of the Anaconda Company in the state legislature is unspectacular but very great. It has been a long time since the company showed the mailed fist. But no informed person denies its influence or the fact that the basic use to which it is put is to maintain the status quo-feo keep taxes down, not to rock the boat. New of the company personnel either in Butte or in New York remember F. Augustus Heinze, or even for that matter, [U. S. Senator] Joseph M. Dixon, but it would be foolish for anyone to deny that the pervasive influence of the Anaconda Company in Montana politics is part and parcel of the Montana heritage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Toole, <em>Montana, An Uncommon Land, </em>244. A study of Montana in the early 1970s concluded that corporate influence of the Anaconda Company had been \u201creplaced by a corporate power structure, with interlocked directorates, the same law firms and common business interests\u201d among the Anaconda Company, Montana Power Company, Burlington Northern Railway and the First Bank System. Malone and Roeder, <em>Montana, a History of Two Centuries, </em>290. History professor Dr. Harry Fritz, in his affidavit presented in the District Court, affirmed that the \u201cdangers of corporate influence remain in Montana\u201d because the resources upon which its economy depends in turn depend upon distant markets. He affirmed: \u201cWhat was true a century ago is as true today: distant corporate interests mean that corporate dominated campaigns will only work \u2018in the essential interest of outsiders with local interests a very secondary consideration.\u2019\u201d While specific corporate interests come and go in Montana, they are always present. Montana\u2019s mineral wealth, for example, has historically been exported from the State, and that is still true today. <em>Commonwealth Edison Co. v. State of Montana, </em>189 Mont. 191, 196, 615 P.2d 847, 850 (1980), <em>aff'd, </em>453 U.S. 609, 101 S. Ct. 2946. The corporate power that can be exerted with unlimited political spending is still a vital interest to the people of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\">\u00b630 Furthermore, in the evidence presented below the State demonstrated aptly how even small expenditures of money can impact Montana elections. The State submitted affidavits from two respected and experienced politicians and public servants. Bob Brown, a Republican, served in the Montana House of Representative, in the Montana Senate, as the Montana Secretary of State and as an unsuccessful candidate for Governor. He retired in 2010 as a Senior Fellow at the Center for the Rocky Mountain West and the Mansfield Center, at the University of Montana. Mike Cooney, a Democrat, served in the Montana House of Representatives, in the Montana Senate, as the Montana Secretary of State, and also as an unsuccessful candidate for Governor. Both affirmed that Montana, with its small population, enjoys political campaigns marked by person-to-person contact and a low cost of advertising compared to other states. They affirmed that allowing unlimited independent expenditures of corporate money into the Montana political process would drastically change campaigning by shifting the emphasis to raising funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b631 Cooney, for example, ran his first state legislative campaign for $750 as a \u201cgrassroots\u201d effort that he believed could have been derailed by an opposing expenditure of even a couple of thousand dollars. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Brown affirmed that Montana politics are more susceptible to corruption than Federal campaigns, and that infusions of large amounts of corporate independent expenditure on just media coverage \u201ccould accomplish the same type of corruption of Montana politics as that which led to the enactment of\u2019 \u00a7 13-35-227, MCA. Cooney recounted his experience from his most recent campaign when he found that voters were concerned that they \u201cdidn\u2019t really count\u201din the political process unless they can make a material financial contribution, and that special interests therefore hold sway. This is much the same sentiment described by W. A. Clark to the United States Senate committee over a century ago, quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b632 The State also presented the affidavit of Edwin Bender of the National Institute on Money in State Politics. He confirmed that under Montana law corporations can now make unlimited contributions (in amount) for independent expenditures from their corporate PACs to support or oppose candidates, directly to ballot measure committees, and to support or oppose ballot measures, and can make unlimited expenditures on lobbyists. Corporations can make contributions with the same limits as all donors from their PACs to candidates and to party committees. Bender also affirmed the low cost of political races in Montana, in comparison to other states,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with all legislative and statewide candidates for office raising a total of around $7 million in 2008. In that year the average candidate for the Montana House raised $7,475 and the average candidate for the Montana Senate raised $13,299. This makes it possible for direct political spending by corporations to significantly affect the outcome of elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b633 Bender also affirmed that studies of election spending in the United States show that the percentage of campaign contributions from individual voters drops sharply from 48% in states with restrictions on corporate spending to 23% in states without. Evidence presented in the District Court showed that in recent years in Montana, corporate independent spending on ballot issues has far exceeded spending from other sources. He provided an extensive 2010 joint study by the Hofstra University School of Law, the Brand\u00e9is Center at the NYU School of Law and the National Institute on Money in State Politics that concluded that polling shows that 3 of 4 Americans believe that campaign contributions affect judicial decisions in states where judges are elected. <em>The New Politics of Judicial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>Elections 2000-2009, </em>Charles Hall ed., Justice at Stake Campaign, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b634 Laws that impact speech in some way must be evaluated by using the proper level of scrutiny. This is determined by the type of speech that the law affects and the type of burden that the law imposes. <em>Davis v. Fed. Election Comm., </em>554 U.S. 724, 737, 128 S. Ct. 2759, 2770 (2008). Laws that place severe burdens on fully protected speech are subject to strict scrutiny, <em>Arizona Free Enterprise Club v. </em>Bennett,_ U.S._, 131 S. Ct. 2806, 2816-17 (2011), while laws that place only a minimal burden or that apply to speech that is not fully protected receive intermediate scrutiny. <em>Davis, </em>554 U.S. at 737, 128 S. Ct. at 2771.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b635 Montana law has long incorporated a requirement of a compelling state interest in evaluating cases involving claims that governmental action infringes upon constitutional rights. The Montana Constitution, Art. 2 \u00a7 10, expressly incorporates the standard for evaluating issues affecting the right of individual privacy. <em>Montana Hum. Rights Div. v. City of Billings, </em>199 Mont. 434, 439-40, 649 P.2d 1283, 1286 (1982); <em>St. James Comm. Hosp. v. District Court, </em>2003 MT 261, \u00b6 4, 317 Mont. 419, 77 P.3d 534. Under Montana law the government must demonstrate a compelling interest when it intrudes on a fundamental right, and determination of a compelling interest is a question of law. <em>State v. Pastos, </em>269 Mont. 43, 47, 887 P.2d 199, 202 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u00b636 Based upon the background of \u00a713-35-227(1), MCA, the State of Montana, or more accurately its voters, clearly had a compelling interest to enact the challenged statute in 1912. At that time the State of Montana and its government were operating under a mere shell of legal authority, and the real social and political power was wielded by powerful corporate managers to further their own business interests. The voters had more than enough of the corrupt practices and heavy-handed influence asserted by the special interests controlling Montana\u2019s political institutions. Bribery of public officials and unlimited campaign spending by the mining interests were commonplace and well known to the public. Referring to W. A. Clark, but describing the general state of affairs in Montana, Mark Twain wrote in 1907 that Clark \u2018is said to have bought legislatures and judges as other men buy food and raiment. By his example he has so excused and so sweetened corruption that in Montana it no longer has an offensive smell.\u201dMark Twain, <em>Mark Twain in Eruption, </em>72 (Harper &amp; Bros. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">\u00b637 The question then, is when in the last 99 years did Montana lose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the power or interest sufficient to support the statute, if it ever did. If the statute has worked to preserve a degree of political and social autonomy is the State required to throw away its protections because the shadowy backers of WTP seek to promote their interests? Does a state have to repeal or invalidate its murder prohibition if the homicide rate declines? We think not. Issues of corporate influence, sparse population, dependence upon agriculture and extractive resource development, location as a transportation corridor, and low campaign costs make Montana especially vulnerable to continued efforts of corporate control to the detriment of democracy and the republican form of government. Clearly Montana has unique and compelling interests to protect through preservation of this statute. \u00b638 While Montana has a clear interest in preserving the integrity of its electoral process, it also has an interest in encouraging the full participation of the Montana electorate. The unrefuted evidence submitted by the State in the District Court through the affidavit of Edwin Bender demonstrates that individual voter contributions are diminished from 48% of the total raised by candidates in states where a corporate spending ban has been in place to 23% of the total raised by candidates in states that permit unlimited corporate spending. The point is illustrative of Montana, a state where citizens generally support candidates with modest campaign donations. In the case of ballot issues, where corporations may make unlimited donations, the characteristics of donors are markedly different from those who give to candidates. In 2004, for example, 97 institutional donors gave 95% of the total money raised in ballot initiative campaigns, while 760 individual donors accounted for the remaining 5%. Similarly, in 2008, 34 institutional donors gave 95% of the total money donated to ballot campaigns. Moreover, unlimited corporate money would irrevocably change the dynamic of local Montana political office races, which have historically been characterized by the low-dollar, broad-based campaigns run by Montana candidates. At present, the individual contribution limit for Montana House, Senate and District Court races is $160, and for Supreme Court elections it is $310. Section 13-37-216, MCA, as adjusted as provided in (4). With the infusion of unlimited corporate money in support of or opposition to a targeted candidate, the average citizen candidate would be unable to compete against the corporate-sponsored candidate, and Montana citizens, who for over 100 years have made their modest election contributions meaningfully count would be effectively shut out of the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b639 Montana also has a compelling interest in protecting and preserving its system of elected judges. In this State, the people elect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the Justices of the Supreme Court, the Judges of the District Courts, and most lower court judges as well. Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a78; \u00a73-2-101, MCA; and \u00a7 3-5-201, MCA. Judicial elections are nonpartisan. Section 13-14-111, MCA. When only an incumbent is running for a judicial seat, the voters can approve or reject the candidate. Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a78 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\">\u00b640  The people of the State of Montana have a continuing and compelling interest in, and a constitutional right to, an independent, fair and impartial judiciary. The State has a concomitant interest in preserving the appearance of judicial propriety and independence so as to maintain the public\u2019s trust and confidence. In the present case, the free speech rights of the corporations are no more important than the due process rights of litigants in Montana courts to a fair and independent judiciary, and both are constitutionally protected. The Bill of Rights does not assign priorities as among the rights it guarantees. <em>Neb. Press Assoc. v. Stuart, </em>427 U.S. 539, 561, 96 S. Ct. 2791, 2803 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b641 Clearly the impact of unlimited corporate donations creates a dominating impact on the political process and inevitably minimizes the impact of individual citizens. As to candidates for political office, \u00a713-35-227(1), MCA, is designed to further the compelling interest of the people of Montana in strong voter participation in the process. While corporations have first amendment rights in political speech, they do not have the vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b642 The importance of and compelling interest in an independent judiciary is reflected as a matter of policy in Montana\u2019s Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">An independent, fair and impartial judiciary is indispensable to our system of justice. The United States legal system is based upon the principle that an independent, impartial, and competent judiciary, composed of men and women of integrity, will interpret and apply the law that governs our society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Mont. Code of Judicial Conduct, <em>Preamble. </em>Montana expects its judges to act to promote \u201cpublic confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary\u201d and to \u201cavoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.\u201d Mont.

A. T. Massey Coal Co., Inc., </em>556 U.S. 868,_, 129 S. Ct. 2252, 2266-67 (2009) (quoting <em>Republican Party of Minn. v. White, </em>536 U.S. 765, <em>122 S. </em>Ct. 2528 (2002)). The Court also recognizes the importance of state codes of judicial conduct, which \u201cserve to maintain the integrity of the judiciary and the rule of law.\u201d <em>Caperton, </em>556 U.S. at_, 129 S. Ct. at 2266. States have a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in preventing judges from activities that \u201cwould undermine actual impartiality, as well as its appearance.\u201d <em>Bauer v. Shepard, </em>620 F.3d 704, 711 (7th Cir. 2010) (upholding limits on judges acting in posts of political leadership and delivering political speeches). \u2018The state certainly has a compelling state interest in the public\u2019s trust and confidence in the integrity of our judicial system.\u201d <em>Simes v. Ark. Judicial Discipline and Disability Comm., </em>247 S.W.3d 876, 882 (Ark. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\u00b644  Montana judicial elections would be particularly vulnerable to large levels of independent spending, both in terms of fairness and in terms of the public perception of impartiality. Litigants appearing before a judge elected after a large expenditure of corporate funds could legitimately question whether their due process rights were adversely impacted. In the 2008 contested election for Chief Justice of the Montana Supreme Court, evidence presented by the State in the District Court indicated that the total expenditure for media advertising was about $60,000. It is clear that an entity like Massey Coal, willing to spend even hundreds of thousands of dollars, much less millions, on a Montana judicial election could effectively drown out all other voices. The historic Heinze-Anaconda conflict noted above illustrates the obvious negative and corrupting effects of a \u201cbought\u201d judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">\u00b645 Sandra Day O\u2019Connor recently wrote in her introduction to <em>The </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>New Politics of Judicial Elections </em>that the \u201ccrisis of confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary is real and growing.\u201d The Executive Summary in that same report noted a study of the nation\u2019s ten most costly judicial elections shows the extraordinary spending power of \u201csuper spender groups,\u201d which are mostly corporate funded. Montana is not immune from such influence and has a compelling interest in precluding corporate expenditures on judicial elections based upon its interest in insuring judicial impartiality and integrity, its interest in preserving public confidence in the judiciary and its interest in protecting the due process rights of litigants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\">\u00b646 As discussed above, the statute has no or minimal impact on MSSF and Champion. Because of this minimal impact, the State is not required to demonstrate a compelling interest to support \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA. It is required only to demonstrate the less exacting sufficiently important interest. For the same reasons discussed above with regard to the compelling state interest, the statute is clearly supported by important governmental interests. Therefore, as to MSSF and Champion, it passes constitutional muster as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b647 Finally, \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA, is narrowly tailored to meet its objectives. The statute only minimally affects entitles like MSSF and Champion. Even if it applies directly to WTP, WTP can still speak through its own political committee/PAC as hundreds of organizations in Montana do on an ongoing basis. Unlike the Federal law PACs considered in <em>Citizens United, </em>under Montana law political committees are easy to establish and easy to use to make independent expenditures for political speech. As the Bender affidavit submitted by the State in District Court confirms, corporate PACs can make unlimited independent expenditures on behalf of candidates. The difference then is that under Montana law the PAC has to comply with Montana\u2019s disclosure and reporting laws. And as noted earlier, corporations are allowed to contribute to ballot issues in Montana, which is a significant distinction because ballot issues often have a direct impact on corporate business activities within Montana but present less danger of corruptive influences that have concerned Montana voters since 1912. The statute only addresses contributions regarding candidates for state political office.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b648  <em>Citizens United </em>does not compel a conclusion that Montana\u2019s law prohibiting independent political expenditures by a corporation related to a candidate is unconstitutional. Rather, applying the principles enunciated in <em>Citizens United, </em>it is clear that Montana has a compelling interest to impose the challenged rationally-tailored statutory restrictions. We reverse the District Court and enter summary judgment in favor of the Montana Attorney General and the Commissioner of Political Practices and against WTP, MSSF and Champion.

In my view, the State of Montana made no more compelling a case than that painstakingly presented in the 90-page dissenting opinion of Justice Stevens and emphatically rejected by the majority in <em>Citizens United. </em>Though I believe <em>Citizens United </em>requires us to affirm the District Court, we must in any event anticipate the consequences should the Court\u2019s holding today be reversed. Rather than inventing distinctions in what I fear will be a vain attempt to rescue Montana\u2019s Corrupt Practices Act, I would construe the statute in a manner to preserve what remains of its constitutionality and to further the legislature\u2019s underlying intent to prevent corruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u00b650 Citizens United holds unequivocally that Tn]o sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.\u201d 130 S. Ct. at 913. Just as unequivocally, however, it allows the government to impose disclaimer and disclosure requirements on political speech because, while such requirements \u201cmay burden the ability to speak, ... they \u2018impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,\u2019 ... and \u2018do not prevent anyone from speaking[.]\u2019 \u201d 130 S. Ct. at 914 (citations omitted). Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel acknowledged during oral argument that disclosure requirements are the means by which to address the State\u2019s compelling interest in preserving the integrity of the election process. And the Amicus Curiae Brief from the Center for Competitive Politics described disclosure mandates as among the \u201cconstitutional tools\u201d available to states in the wake of <em>Citizens United. </em>In light of <em>Citizens United\u2019s </em>clear directive that the State cannot prohibit corporate expenditures, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>review and construction of the challenged statute should focus on preserving disclosure requirements as applied to such expenditures in order to protect the overriding interest in preventing corruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\">\u00b651 This Court attempts to construe statutes in a manner that avoids unconstitutional interpretation. <em>Oberson v. USDA, </em>2007 MT 293, \u00b6 14, 339 Mont. 519, 171 P.3d 715. If a law contains both constitutional and unconstitutional provisions, the Court first will examine the legislation to determine if there is a severability clause. <em>PPL Mont., LLC v. State, </em>2010 MT 64, \u00b6 131, 355 Mont. 402, 229 P.3d 421 <em>(citing Finke v. State, </em>2003 MT 48, \u00b6 25, 314 Mont. 314, 65 P.3d 576). In the absence of such a clause, the Court considers \"whether the integrity of [the law] relies upon the unconstitutional provision or whether the inclusion of [the] provisions acted as inducement to its enactment.\u201d <em>Finke, </em>\u00b6 26. If the unconstitutional provisions are stricken, the law must be complete in itself and still capable of execution in accord with legislative intent. <em>Finke, </em>\u00b6 26. Though \"the presumption is against the mutilation of a statute,\u201d <em>Sheehy v. Pub. Emp. Retirement Div., </em>262 Mont. 129, 142, 864 P.2d 762, 770 (1993), if the offending provisions may be removed without frustrating the purpose or disrupting the integrity of the law, the Court will strike only those provisions of the statute that are unconstitutional. <em>Mont. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Greely, </em>193 Mont. 378, 380-81, 632 P.2d 300, 302 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b652 Plaintiffs seek a ruling invalidating subsection (1) of \u00a713-35-227, MCA. That subsection prohibits a corporation from making \u201ca contribution or an expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate or a political party.\u201d Subsection (2) of the statute, not challenged here, prohibits a person, candidate, or political committee from accepting or receiving a corporate contribution. Subsection (3) of the same statute allows \u2018the establishment or administration of a separate, segregated fund to be used for making political contributions or expenditures if the fund consists only of voluntary contributions solicited from an individual who is a shareholder, employee, or member of the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b653 Section 13-35-227(3), MCA, when read in the context of Montana\u2019s overall campaign finance scheme, expresses the legislature\u2019s intent to provide citizens and shareholders with information about sources of funds used in support of candidates and ballot issues. Under <em>Citizens United, </em>the State clearly may not require corporate independent expenditures to come from a fund consisting only of \"voluntary contributions\u201d as the language of \u00a713-35-227(3), MCA, now provides. Subsection (1) of the statute still could be preserved by allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>corporate expenditures under that subsection to be made from a \u201cseparate segregated fund\u201d as prescribed by subsection (3), without applying the now-invalid requirement that \u201cthe funds consisto only of voluntary contributions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b654 I would therefore hold that the Commissioner constitutionally may extend Montana\u2019s disclosure and reporting laws to independent expenditures by corporate entities made on behalf of candidates or political committees, just as the Commissioner has done for corporate expenditures on ballot issue campaigns. Without such a holding, and given that the Montana Legislature will not meet in general session prior to the next election, Montana voters may be left in the dark if \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA, is invalidated by the nation\u2019s highest court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b655 Applying \u00a7 13-35-227(3), MCA, in a constitutionally-permitted fashion to expenditures from a corporate treasury will further the government\u2019s interest in disclosure requirements and will not disrupt the statute\u2019s integrity. As noted by the Majority, only part of the original Corrupt Practices Act survives in \u00a713-35-227, MCA. Opinion, \u00b6 28. The statute has been amended numerous times in its 100-year history. Subsection (3) was added in 1979. 1979 Mont. Laws ch. 404, 1011. The statute\u2019s most recent modification was in 2003, after federal courts invalidated the law\u2019s prohibition against corporate contributions and expenditures in ballot issue campaigns. <em>Mont. Chamber of Com. v. Argenbright, </em>28 F. Supp. 2d 593, 600-01 (D. Mont. 1998), <em>aff'd, </em>226 F.3d 1049, 1052 (9th Cir. 2000). Although neither the original Act nor most of its amendments have included a severability clause, applying the statute in the fashion I suggest is consistent with the <em>Finke </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b656 Through the years, while legislative history is scant, the legislature\u2019s palpable intent was to prevent corruption in Montana elections. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 22-28. Prohibition of corporate contributions has been one means to achieve that goal; disclosure has been another. State Senator Miles Romney, sponsor of the 1975 amendment that first introduced the ban on corporate spending in ballot issue campaigns, commented in part that \u201ceveryone should know who is giving how much\u201d and statements of contributions would facilitate that knowledge. Mont. H. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on SB 97, </em>at 5 (Mar. 7, 1975). Through its various iterations, inducement for the legislation has been the legislature\u2019s desire to prevent corruption in elections. Absent constitutional authority for an outright ban on corporate spending, prohibiting application of the \u201cvoluntary contributions\u201d clause to expenditures made under subsection (1) will further, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>frustrate, the accountability that fosters prevention of corruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">\u00b657 Construing the statute to preserve its requirement for a separate segregated fund from which corporate expenditures are made will facilitate disclosure under requirements promulgated by the Montana Commissioner of Political Practices. The Affidavit of Dennis Unsworth, submitted by the State before the District Court, described the disclosure process in place at the present time for corporate spending on ballot issue measures. Unsworth stated that independent expenditures from a corporate treasury to support or oppose a ballot measure must be reported on the Commissioner of Political Practices\u2019 Form C-4. The C-4 form is for \u2018incidental political committees,\u201d which are defined in the Commissioner\u2019s rules as \u201ca political committee that is not specifically organized or maintained for the primary purpose of influencing elections but that may incidentally become a political committee by making a contribution or expenditure to support or oppose a candidate and/or issue.\u201d Admin. R. M. 44.10.327(2)(c). The only other types of political committees are \u201cprincipal campaign committees\u201d and \u2018independent committees,\u201d both of which are committees specifically organized to support or oppose various candidates or issues. An independent committee includes a Political Action Committee. Admin. R. M. 44.10.327(2)(b)(i). Thus, the Commissioner\u2019s rules treat corporate treasury expenditures as expenditures by \u2018incidental committees\u201d because the entities do not exist for the specific purpose of supporting or opposing candidates, ballot issues, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b658 The integrity and purpose of the law can be salvaged by permitting the Commissioner to apply \u2018incidental committee\u201d status to a separate fund in a corporation\u2019s treasury from which election-related expenditures are made. This would ensure that corporate contributions are on the same footing, and are given the same public daylight, as contributions from individuals, political action committees, and political parties. <em>See generally, </em>\u00a713-37-225, MCA; Admin. R.

Regardless of the ultimate fate of Montana\u2019s ban on corporate political expenditures, state disclosure requirements should be applied to all expenditures by corporate entities \u2018in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate or a political party.\u201d Section 13-35-227(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AUm\">\u00b660 In conclusion, I believe it is our unflagging obligation, in keeping with the courts\u2019 duty to safeguard the rule of law, to honor the decisions of our nation\u2019s highest Court. \u201cAmericans today accept the [United States Supreme] Court\u2019s role as guardian of the law.

Since \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA, imposes just such a ban, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to uphold the statute in its entirety.

INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b662 The Supreme Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> could not have been more clear in <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election </em>Commission,_U.S._, 130 S. Ct. 876 (2010): corporations have broad rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to engage in political speech, and corporations cannot be prohibited from using general treasury funds for this purpose based on antidistortion, anticorruption, or shareholder-protection interests. The language of the <em>Citizens United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>majority opinion is remarkably sweeping and leaves virtually no conceivable basis for muzzling or otherwise restricting corporate political speech in the form of independent expenditures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A97\">\u00b663 As a result, the critical question presented in the case now before us is simply this: Has the State of Montana identified a compelling state interest, not already rejected by the Supreme Court, that would justify the outright ban on corporate expenditures for political speech effected by \u00a7 13-35-227(1), MCA? Having considered the matter, I believe the Montana Attorney General has identified some very compelling reasons for limiting corporate expenditures in Montana\u2019s political process. The problem, however, is that regardless of how persuasive I may think the Attorney General\u2019s justifications are, the Supreme Court has already rebuffed each and every one of them. Accordingly, as much as I would like to rule in favor of the State, I cannot in good faith do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">\u00b664 The Court, on the other hand, views the matter differently. The Court concludes that Montana may bar corporations from using general treasury funds for political <em>speech-Citizens United </em>notwithstanding-because \u2018Montana has unique and compelling interests to protect.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 37. What \u201cunique\u201d interests render Montana exempt from <em>Citizens </em>United? One searches the Court\u2019s Opinion in vain to find any. The Court states that Montana has \u201ca clear interest in preserving the integrity of its electoral process\u201d and \u201can interest in encouraging the full participation of the Montana electorate.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38. Yet, Montana is hardly unique in this regard. Every state in the Union is interested in preserving the integrity of its electoral process and in encouraging the full participation of its electorate. The Court asserts that Montana has interests in \u201cprotecting and preserving its system of elected judges,\u201d \u201cpreserving the appearance of judicial propriety and independence so as to maintain the public\u2019s trust and confidence,\u201d and \u201cprotecting the due process rights of litigants.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 39, 40, 45. But surely every state with an elected judiciary has these same interests. The Court also cites \u2018the compelling interest of the people of Montana in strong voter participation in the process.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 41. Again, however, the people of Montana are certainly not the only people in the United States with a compelling interest in strong voter participation. \u00b665 The fact is that none of the interests identified by the Court are unique to Montana. What the Court is really saying is that Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>has a unique history and unique qualities which make Montana uniquely susceptible to the corrupting influence of unlimited corporate expenditures. Indeed, the Court points to Montana\u2019s history involving the Copper Kings-their bribery of public officials, their manipulation of state government, and their control over local judges in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 22-28. Based on this history, the Court concludes that Montana voters \u2018had a compelling interest to enact the challenged statute in 1912.\u2019\u2019Opinion, \u00b6 36. Furthermore, the Court concludes that the dangers of corporate influence and domination still exist in Montana. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 29-31. In fact, the Court asserts that Montana is \u201cespecially vulnerable to continued efforts of corporate control to the detriment of democracy and the republican form of government.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 37. According to the Court, this is owing to Montana\u2019s sparse population, dependence upon agriculture and extractive resource development, location as a transportation corridor, and low campaign costs. Opinion, \u00b6 37. Given these characteristics, the Court opines that unlimited corporate money would \u2018irrevocably change the dynamic of local Montana political office races, which have historically been characterized by the low-dollar, broad-based campaigns run by Montana candidates.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38. Moreover, the infusion of unlimited corporate money in support of or opposition to a targeted candidate would \u201ctninimize[ ] the impact of individual citizens\u201d in the political process and leave the average citizen \u201ceffectively shut out of the process.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 38, 41. Accordingly, the Court holds that Montana may flat-out prohibit direct political spending by corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b666 Respectfully, I cannot agree that this \u2018Montana is unique\u201d rationale is consistent with <em>Citizens United. </em>And I seriously doubt this rationale is going to prevail in the Supreme Court when this case is appealed, as it almost certainly will be. For one thing, a fair reading of the <em>Citizens United </em>majority opinion, coupled with a fair reading of the separate concurring and dissenting opinions, leads inescapably to the conclusion that every one of the Attorney General\u2019s arguments-and this Court\u2019s rationales adopting those arguments-was argued, considered, and then flatly rejected by the Supreme Court. Moreover, even accepting the propositions that Montana experienced an egregious period of corporate domination and political corruption at the turn of the 20th century, that Montana citizens understandably became fed up with the heavy-handed influence and corrupt practices of special interests at the time, and that Montana to this day remains especially vulnerable to continued efforts of corporate control, what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Court and the Attorney General have failed to recognize is this fundamental point: a ban on corporate speech is not a constitutionally permissible remedy for these problems. This should be abundantly clear from the following passage in <em>Citizens </em>United:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-3\">If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern. We must give weight to attempts by [the legislative branch] to seek to dispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law, however, must comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that <em>more speech, not less, </em>is the governing rule. <em>An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is not a permissible remedy.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">130 S. Ct. at 911 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b667 The federal law struck down in <em>Citizens United </em>(2 U.S.C. \u00a7441b, <em>as amended by </em>\u00a7203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002) prohibited corporations from expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates and from broadcasting electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a general election. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 887, 897. The Montana law at issue here is even more categorical, prohibiting corporations from <em>ever </em>using general treasury funds for political advocacy. Section 13-35-227(1), MCA (\u201cA corporation may not make a contribution or an expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate or a political party.\u2019). If the federal law is facially unconstitutional, as the Supreme Court held, then I cannot envision any possibility that the Montana law will survive the predictable appeal of this Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b668 Unquestionably, Montana has its own unique history. No doubt Montana also has compelling interests in preserving the integrity of its electoral process and in encouraging the full participation of its electorate. And Montana may indeed be more vulnerable than other states to corporate domination of the political process. But the notion argued by the Attorney General and adopted by the Court-fehat these characteristics entitle Montana to a special \u2018ho peeing\u201d zone in the First Amendment swimming pool4s simply untenable under <em>Citizens United.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b669 Admittedly, I have never had to write a more frustrating dissent. I agree, at least in principle, with much of the Court\u2019s discussion and with the arguments of the Attorney General. More to the point, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>thoroughly disagree with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Citizens United. </em>I agree, rather, with the eloquent and, in my view, better-reasoned dissent of Justice Stevens. As a result, I find myself in the distasteful position of having to defend the applicability of a controlling precedent with which I profoundly disagree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b670 That said, this case is ultimately not about my agreement or disagreement with the Attorney General or our satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the <em>Citizens United </em>decision. Whether we agree with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the First Amendment is irrelevant. In accordance with our federal system of government, our obligations here are to acknowledge that the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the United States Constitution is, for better or for worse, binding on this Court and on the officers of this state, and to apply the law faithful to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b671 Granted, there are some in the legislative and executive branches of government who would call-and, in fact, have called-for Montana to thumb its nose at the federal government, to disregard federal law, and to boldly ignore the Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2). <em>See e.g. </em>Mike Dennison, <em>Bills Test State\u2019s Power to Nullify Fed Laws, </em>Helena Independent Record (Feb. 13,2011). Regardless of those views, however, all elected officials in Montana-legislative, executive, and judicial-are sworn to \u201csupport, protect and defend the constitution of the United States.\u201dMont. Const, art. Ill, \u00a73. Obviously, this means in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretations of the United States Constitution. Thus, when the highest court in the country has spoken clearly on a matter of federal constitutional law, as it did in <em>Citizens United, </em>the highest court in Montana-fehis Court-is not at liberty to disregard or parse that decision in order to uphold a state law that, while politically popular, is clearly at odds with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. This is the rule of law and is part and parcel of every judge\u2019s and justice\u2019s oath of office to \u201csupport, protect and defend the constitution of the United States.\u201d In my view, this Court\u2019s decision today fails to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b672 The Supreme Court has emphatically rejected the notion that corporate political speech may be restricted based on interests in protecting against political and campaign corruption, safeguarding the ability of individual citizens to compete and participate in the political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>process, and preserving judicial integrity and impartiality. It makes no sense whatsoever that a state may rely on these very same interests-despite their rejection by the Supreme Court-as grounds for muzzling corporate speech simply because the state\u2019s history, demographics, economics, and elections are in some way \u201cunique.\u201d It also makes no sense that, on one hand, the First Amendment protects corporate expenditures for political speech at the federal level and, apparently, throughout the rest of the country<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but that, on the other hand, this First Amendment protection magically evaporates at Montana\u2019s borders because of a law adopted 100 years ago to address a very fact-specific situation. <em>See </em>Larry Howell, <em>Once Upon a Time in the West: </em>Citizens United, Caperton, <em>and the War of the Copper Kings, </em>at 6-16 (under the heading \u2018The Montana Situation\u201d) (available at http://mtlr.org). Indeed, if the Supreme Court countenances this Court\u2019s approach of restricting corporate political speech rights based on population density, the existence of \"mineral wealth,\u201d a history of \u2018low-dollar, broad-based campaigns,\u2019\u2019and past experience with \u2018heavy-handed influence\u201d asserted by corporations, then there shortly will be nothing left of <em>Citizens United </em>at the state level. Due to its unpopularity, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision will be \u201cstate-lawed\u201dinto oblivion. While this would be a good thing in the view of many, my point here is that the Supreme Court clearly did not intend, with the broad, sweeping, and unqualified language it used, to allow the holding of <em>Citizens United </em>to be circumvented through \u201cuniqueness\u201d stratagems.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\">\u00b673 Therefore, and with all due respect to my colleagues, I believe this Court is simply wrong in its refusal to affirm the District Court. Like it or not, <em>Citizens United </em>is the law of the land as regards corporate political speech. There is no \u2018Montana exception.\u201d The proof of the Court\u2019s error is found in a comparison of the rationales provided in the Court\u2019s Opinion with the statements by the Supreme Court rejecting those rationales. I begin with an analysis of the <em>Citizens United </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>II. <em>CITIZENS UNITED</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b674 A significant portion of the <em>Citizens United </em>decision is devoted to the threshold question whether the Supreme Court should even be deciding the constitutional matters that it ultimately does decide. Indeed, the five Justices in the majority-justice Kennedy joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito-eonsumed numerous pages attempting to explain why they were (1) addressing a claim that Citizens United had expressly dismissed in the district court (its facial challenge to the law\u2019s constitutionality), (2) deciding the case on grounds that arguably were broader than necessary to resolve Citizens United\u2019s claim, and (3) overruling prior precedents notwithstanding the doctrine of stare decisis. <em>See Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 888-96, 911-13 (majority opinion); 130 S. Ct. at 917-25 (Roberts, C.J., &amp; Alito, J., concurring). With regard to these issues, the dissent-Justice Stevens joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor-accused the majority of simply being \u201cunhappy with the limited nature of the case before us,\u201d of having \u201cdisdain\u201d for the prior precedents, and thus of \u201cchanging] the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 932, 938. The dissent also criticized the majority\u2019s determination to invalidate the statute on facial grounds, not only because this approach is \u201c \u2018contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint\u2019 \u2019\u2019and has the secondary effect of\u2018implicitly striking down a great many state laws as well,\u201d but also because the record before the Supreme Court was \u201cnonexistent.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 932-33. Whereas Congress had crafted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) \u2018in response to a virtual mountain of research on the corruption that previous legislation had failed to avert,\u201d the majority \u2018how negates Congress\u2019 efforts without a shred of evidence on how \u00a7203 or its state-law counterparts have been affecting any entity other than Citizens United.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 933. The dissent argued that \u2018it is the height of recklessness to dismiss Congress\u2019 years of bipartisan deliberation and its reasoned judgment on this basis, without first confirming that the statute in question was intended to be, or will function as, a restraint on electoral competition.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 969. Finally, the dissent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>argued that the case could have been decided on various narrower grounds, <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 936-38, and that the majority had failed to give proper deference to the doctrine of stare decisis, 130 S. Ct. at 938-42. On this latter point, the dissent observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-3\"><em>[sJtare decisis </em>protects not only personal rights involving property or contract but also the ability of the elected branches to shape their laws in an effective and coherent fashion. Today\u2019s decision takes away a power that we have long permitted these branches to exercise. State legislatures have relied on their authority to regulate corporate electioneering, confirmed in <em>[Austin v. Mich. Chamber of Commerce, </em>494 U.S. 652, 110 S. Ct. 1391 (1990)], for more than a century. The Federal Congress has relied on this authority for a comparable stretch of time, and it specifically relied on <em>Austin </em>throughout the years it spent developing and debating BCRA. The total record it compiled was <em>100,000 pages </em>long. Pulling out the rug beneath Congress after affirming the constitutionality of \u00a7203 six years ago shows great disrespect for a coequal branch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 940 (emphasis in original, footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b675 While I believe the <em>Citizens United </em>dissent makes a persuasive argument that the majority need not and should not have rendered such a broad constitutional holding, the fact remains that the majority did so, striking down the federal law as facially invalid. Thus, my focus hereafter is on what the majority specifically held regarding corporate independent expenditures on political speech. I approach this in step-by-step fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">A. The First Amendment Applies to Political Speech by Corporations</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b676 The First Amendment provides that \u2018Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d This protection extends to corporations and to the context of political speech. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>S. Ct. at 899, 900. Political speech does not lose First Amendment protection simply because its source is a corporation. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 900. The identity of the speaker is not decisive in determining whether speech is protected; corporations and other associations, like individuals, contribute to the discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas that the First Amendment seeks to foster. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 900. The Supreme Court \u2018has thus rejected the argument that political speech of corporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply because such associations are not \u2018natural persons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">B. Section 441b Burdens Corporate Political Speech</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b677 The law at issue (2 U.S.C. \u00a7441b, as <em>amended by </em>\u00a7203 of the BCRA) prohibits corporations and unions from using general treasury funds to make independent expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates. It also prohibits the broadcast of electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a general election. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 887, 897. This prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is a ban on speech. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898. It is true that corporations and unions may establish a \u201cseparate segregated fund\u201d (known as a political action committee or PAC) for purposes of express advocacy or electioneering communications. The moneys received by the PAC are limited to donations from stockholders and employees of the corporation or, in the case of unions, members of the union. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 887-88. Nevertheless, \u00a7441b \u2018is aban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 897. This is because \u201c[a] PAC is a separate association from the corporation. So the PAC exemption from \u00a7 441b\u2019s expenditure ban does not allow corporations to speak.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 897 (citation omitted). Furthermore, Tejven if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to speak-and it does not-the option to form PACs does not alleviate the First Amendment problems with \u00a7 441b. PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">C. Standard of Review: Strict Scrutiny</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u00b678 \u201cWhile it might be maintained that political speech simply cannot be banned or restricted as a categorical matter,\u2019\u2019the following standard \u201cprovides a sufficient framework for protecting the relevant First Amendment interests in this case.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Laws that burden political speech are subject to strict scrutiny, which requires the government to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">D. The Governmental-Function Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b679 The First Amendment prohibits restrictions that distinguish among different speakers, allowing speech by some but not others. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898. Hence, the government \u201cmay commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 899. The Supreme Court has upheld a narrow class of speech restrictions that operate to the disadvantage of certain persons, but these rulings were based on \u201cthe proposition that there are certain governmental functions that cannot operate without some restrictions on particular kinds of speech\u201d-e.g., the function of public school education, the penological objectives of the corrections system, and the capacity of the government to discharge its military responsibilities. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 899. This interest is not applicable here because the corporate independent expenditures at issue would not interfere with governmental functions. Quite the contrary, \u2018it is inherent in the nature of the political process that voters must be free to obtain information from diverse sources in order to determine how to cast their votes.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">E. The Antidistortion Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b680 The Supreme Court in <em>Austin v. Mich. Chamber of Commerce, </em>494 U.S. 652, 110 S. Ct. 1391 (1990), found a compelling governmental interest in preventing \u201c\u2018the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\u2019s support for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 903 (quoting <em>Austin, </em>494 U.S. at 660, 110 S. Ct. at 1397). The concerns in this regard are that corporations can \u201cuse resources amassed in the economic marketplace to obtain an unfair advantage in the political marketplace,\u201d and that corporate wealth can \u201cdominat[e]... the political process\u201d and \u201cunfairly influence elections\u201d when it is deployed in the form of independent expenditures. <em>Austin, </em>494 U.S. at 659, 660, 110 S. Ct. at 1397, 1398 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b681 The problem with this \u201cantidistortion rationale,\u201d however, is that it is inconsistent with the First Amendment. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 904-08. For one thing, \u201c \u2018the concept that government may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 904 (alteration omitted) (quoting <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 48-49, 96 S.

The First Amendment\u2019s protections do not depend on the speaker\u2019s \u201cfinancial ability to engage in public discussion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 904 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b682 Additionally, the antidistortion rationale interferes with the \u201copen marketplace\u201d of ideas protected by the First Amendment by permitting the government to ban the political speech of millions of associations of citizens. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 906-07. Most of these are small corporations without large amounts of wealth-a fact which belies the argument that the statute at issue is justified on the ground that it prevents the \u201cdistorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 907. In any event, political speech is indispensable to decision-making in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 904. \u2018Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic views. On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 912. By suppressing the speech of manifold corporations, both for-profit and nonprofit, the government prevents their voices and viewpoints from reaching the public and advising voters on which persons or entities are hostile to their interests. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 907. In so doing, the government muffles the voices that best represent the most significant segments of the economy and deprives the electorate of information, knowledge, and opinion vital to its function. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 907. When the government seeks to use its power \u201cto command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought. This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>F. The Anticorruption Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">\u00b683 The Government argues that corporate political speech may be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance. The <em>Buckley </em>Court found this interest sufficiently important to allow limits on <em>contributions. Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908 (citing <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 25, 96 S. Ct. at 638). But when the <em>Buckley </em>Court examined a ban on <em>independent expenditures, </em>it found \u201cthat the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption is inadequate to justify [the ban].\u201d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 45, 96 S. Ct. at 647. For the reasons which follow, that holding is reaffirmed here. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b684 \u201c\u2018The hallmark of corruption is the financial <em>quid pro quo: </em>dollars for political favors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 910 (quoting Fed. <em>Election Commn. v. Natl. Conservative Political Action Comm., </em>470 U.S. 480, 497, 105 S. Ct. 1459, 1468 (1985)). \u201c[C]ontribution limits,... unlike limits on independent expenditures, have been an accepted means to prevent <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 909. Not only can large direct contributions be given to secure a political <em>quid pro quo, </em>the scope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908 (citing <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 26-27, 96 S. Ct. at 638). Thus, limits on direct contributions are permissible to ensure against the reality or appearance of <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b685 Independent expenditures, in contrast, have a substantially diminished potential for abuse. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908. By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 910. \u201c \u2018The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a <em>quid pro quo </em>for improper commitments from the candidate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908 (quoting <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 47, 96 S. Ct. at 648). Limits on independent expenditures, therefore, \u201chave a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government\u2019s interest in preventing <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b686 \u201cWhen <em>Buckley </em>identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited to <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 909. Two years later, the Supreme Court purported to leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>open the possibility that corporate independent expenditures could be shown to cause corruption. <em>See First Natl. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765,788 n. 26,98 S. Ct. 1407, 1422 n. 26 (1978). However, \u201cwe now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b687 The fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 910.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u2018Favoritism and influence are not ... avoidable in representative politics. It is in the nature of an elected representative to favor certain policies, and, by necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who support those policies. It is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing those political outcomes the supporter favors. Democracy is premised on responsiveness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\"><em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 910 (ellipsis in original) (quoting <em>McConnell v. Fed. Election Commn., </em>540 U.S. 93, 297, 124 S. Ct. 619, 748 (2003) (Kennedy, J., Rehnquist, C. J., &amp; Scalia, J., dissenting)). The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. As noted, an independent expenditure is, by definition, political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate. The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials. This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse to take part in democratic governance because of additional political speech made by a corporation or any other speaker. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b688 In sum, the hallmark of corruption is the financial <em>quid pro quo: </em>dollars for political favors. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 910. The government has a sufficiently important interest in preventing <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption or the appearance of it. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 909. Indeed, a <em>quid pro quo </em>arrangement would be covered by bribery laws. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908. Independent expenditures, however, \u201cdo not lead to, or create the appearance of, <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption. In fact, there is only scant evidence that independent expenditures even ingratiate. Ingratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 910 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>(citation omitted). Therefore, \u2018independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 909. Of course, if elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent expenditures, surrender their best judgment, and put expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern; but in attempting to dispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences, \u2018ta]n outright ban on corporate political speech ... is not a permissible remedy.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\">G. The Shareholder-Protection Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b689 The Government argues that corporate independent expenditures can be limited in the interest of protecting dissenting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate political speech with which they do not agree. The First Amendment, however, does not allow the government to restrict corporate speech based on a shareholder\u2019s disagreement with the political views of the corporation. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 911. There is, furthermore, little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by shareholders through the procedures of corporate democracy. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">H. Foreign Influence</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b690 \u2018We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation\u2019s political process.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">I. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b691 Based on the foregoing, the Supreme Court overruled its decision in <em>Austin. </em>\u2018We return to the principle established in <em>Buckley </em>and <em>Bellotti </em>that the Government may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker\u2019s corporate identity. <em>No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.\u201d Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 913 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that BCRA \u00a7203\u2019s restriction on electioneering communications and 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441b\u2019s prohibition on the use of corporate treasury funds for express advocacy were both invalid. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 913. The Supreme Court (with only Justice Thomas dissenting) then went on to uphold BCRA\u2019s disclaimer and disclosure provisions against an as-applied constitutional challenge. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 913-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">III. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">\u00b692 Before examining this Court\u2019s rationales upholding \u00a713-35-227(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>MCA,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it is necessary to dispel some misconceptions regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b693 First, the Court asserts that neither Gary Marbut, the founder of Montana Shooting Sports Association (MSSA), nor Kenneth Champion, the sole shareholder of Champion Painting, Inc., has demonstrated \u201cany material way\u201d in which Montana law has hindered or censored their political activity or speech. Opinion, \u00b6 17. Of course, Marbut and Champion are not parties to this lawsuit, and their speech rights are not at issue here. Hence, whether Marbut and Champion, <em>as individuals, </em>have been hindered or censored in their political activity or speech is totally irrelevant. The question is whether the speech rights of MSSA and Champion Painting, <em>as incorporated entities, </em>have been infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b694 Second, the Court asserts that MSSA has failed to demonstrate that its speech has been impaired by \u00a7 227 because Montana law places no restriction on MSSA to spend its members\u2019 dues on political advocacy. Opinion, \u00b6 17. As support for this, the Court cites the affidavit of former Commissioner of Political Practices Dennis Unsworth. What Unsworth specifically says, however, is this: TMSSA] has been and continues to be free to spend its member dues and donations from its treasury regardless of its corporate status, as long as it complies with the filing requirements described above <em>and meets the criteria for a voluntary association.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The affidavit of Mary Baker, program supervisor in the Office of the Commissioner of Political Practices, likewise states that \u201cthere is nothing in Montana\u2019s campaign finance laws that would prohibit [MSSA] from registering itself as a committee and making independent expenditures from its corporate treasury, <em>if it meets our office\u2019s criteria for a voluntary association.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) According to Unsworth\u2019s affidavit, those criteria are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">A voluntary association that incorporates can spend its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>members\u2019 dues and donations on campaign contributions and independent expenditures from its treasury, if it: (1) is formed for the express purpose of promoting political ideas, and could not engage in business activities; (2) has no shareholders or other persons affiliated so as to have a claim on its assets or earnings; (3) is not established by a business corporation, and does not accept contributions from business corporations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-3\">\u00b695 Contrary to the Court\u2019s implication, there has been no determination in this case that MSSA in fact meets the criteria of a \u201cvoluntary association.\u201d And one of the exhibits attached to Unsworth\u2019s affidavit indicates that MSSA does <em>not </em>satisfy the criteria. The exhibit is an \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d issued by former Commissioner Linda Vaughey on September 25, 2003, in which she addresses whether the nonprofit corporation People for Responsible Government (PRG) may engage in political activities in connection with candidates for public office. Vaughey starts with the premise that \u00a7227 \u201cappears on its face to prohibit all corporations, including nonprofit corporations, from making contributions or expenditures in connection with candidates, other than through separate, segregated funds.\u201d Vaughey then observes that, based on <em>Fed. Election Commn. v. Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc., </em>479 U.S. 238, 263-64, 107 S. Ct. 616, 631 (1986), there is an exception for nonprofit corporations which meet the three criteria listed above. Vaughey finally determines that PRG does <em>not </em>meet the third criterion because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">[njothing in the Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws, or the other information you have provided confirms that PRG was not established by a business corporation or a labor organization. Moreover, <em>you have not provided any information establishing that PRG does not directly or indirectly accept donations or contributions of anything of value from business corporations or labor organizations. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Likewise here, there is no evidence in the record-mot in Marbut\u2019s affidavit, in MSSA\u2019s Articles of Incorporation (attached to Marbut\u2019s affidavit), in Unsworth\u2019s affidavit, in Baker\u2019s affidavit, or in any other document-establishing that MSSA \u201cdoes not directly or indirectly accept donations or contributions of anything of value from business corporations or labor organizations.\u201d Hence, MSSA does <em>not </em>qualify as a \u2018Voluntary association\u201d under the Commissioner\u2019s definition, and MSSA is <em>not </em>allowed to use its general treasury funds to make independent expenditures in connection with candidate elections. MSSA states in the First Amended Complaint that it wishes to \u201cuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>corporate funds to directly support or oppose candidates.\u201d In light of the foregoing discussion, \u00a7227(1) bars MSSA from doing so. The Court is flat wrong, therefore, in stating that \u201cthe statute has no or minimal impact\u201d on MSSA. Opinion, \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b696 Third, the Court likewise misstates the impact on Champion Painting. For one thing, the Court again seems to be improperly focused on <em>Champion\u2019s </em>speech rights, which are not at issue, rather than <em>Champion Painting\u2019s </em>speech rights, which are at issue. Opinion, \u00b6 18. The Court also suggests that the only reason Champion Painting is participating in this lawsuit is so that its shareholder (Champion) can be allowed to make \u201ccandidate end\u00f3rsemenos]\u201d using the company name. Opinion, \u00b6 18. Finally, the Court asserts that because Champion, as sole shareholder, can simply establish a PAC to advocate for Champion Painting\u2019s interests and expend funds that he will decide to contribute, Opinion, \u00b6 18, \u201cthe statute has no or minimal impact on ... Champion,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 46. The Court is wrong on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b697 According to the First Amended Complaint,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">Champion Painting intends to spend corporate funds to educate the citizens of Montana and Bozeman about political candidates and ballot issues that will either positively or negatively impact Montana\u2019s small businesses, and Champion Painting intends to publicly support or oppose candidates and issues relating to Montana\u2019s small businesses. The corporate funds will be spent to purchase TV spots and radio advertisements, and to create and distribute brochures and fliers ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Champion\u2019s affidavit is to the same effect: \u201cIn addition to being politically active as an individual, I would like for Champion Painting to be politically active. . . . Since Champion Painting is a small business, its voice will be more effective than my voice when supporting or opposing candidates who may have an impact on small businesses.\u201d It is apparent, then, that Champion Painting\u2019s claim is about the corporation\u2019s ability to speak, not its shareholder\u2019s ability to speak. And as the Court concedes, \u00a7227(1) forbids the expenditure of Champion Painting\u2019s corporate funds to support or oppose candidates. Opinion, \u00b6 18. Nothing in \u00a7227 exempts corporations held by a sole shareholder. As for the Court\u2019s theory that Champion Painting could speak through a PAC, Opinion, \u00b6 18, the Supreme Court rejected this approach as discussed above and noted again below.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">IV. COMPARISON</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u00b698 I now turn to a comparison of the rationales provided in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Court\u2019s Opinion with the statements by the Supreme Court rejecting those rationales. Again, the specific issue is the constitutionality of \u00a7 227(1)\u2019s prohibition on corporate <em>expenditures </em>in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate or a political party. The disclosure laws, the prohibition on direct corporate contributions, and the Corrupt Practices Act as a whole have not been challenged. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">A. The Political Committee Alternative</p>\n<p id=\"A0n\">\u00b699 Section 227(1) states that \u201c[a] corporation may not make a contribution or an expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate or a political party.\u201d Section 227(3), however, provides that \u201c[t]his section does not prohibit the establishment or administration of a separate, segregated fund [known as a political committee or PAC] to be used for making political contributions or expenditures if the fund consists only of voluntary contributions solicited from an individual who is a shareholder, employee, or member of the corporation.\u201d <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b6100 The Court asserts that, in Montana, political committees are \u201ceasy to establish,\u201d\u201ceasy to use,\u201d and an \u201ceffective alternative to direct corporate spending for engaging in political speech.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 47. The Supreme Court, however, stated: \u201cA PAC is a separate association from the corporation. So the PAC exemption from [the law\u2019s] expenditure ban does not allow corporations to speak.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 897 (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201c[e]ven if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to <em>speak </em>\u2014 and <em>it does </em>not^.he option to form PACs does not alleviate the First Amendment problems.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 897 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b6101 The Court ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that a PAC is \u201cseparate\u201d from the corporation and, thus, is not a valid alternative to direct corporate expenditures. Indeed, the Court asserts that the Supreme Court rejected PACs \u2018because of the burdensome, extensive, and expensive Federal regulations that applied.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 12. This is false. Granted, the Supreme Court briefly noted that \u2018PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 897. Yet, even if federal PACs were as \u201ceasily implemented\u201d as the Court says Montana\u2019s PACs are, Opinion, \u00b6 21, the fundamental problem with PACs still remains: \u201cA PAC is a separate association from the corporation. So the PAC exemption from [the law\u2019s] expenditure ban does not allow corporations to speak.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>897 (citation omitted). Bottom line: \u2018[Section 227(1)] is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation [as permitted under \u00a7 227(3)] can still speak.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 897. The Court\u2019s contrary holding is plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">B. Anticorruption and Restraining Corporate Influence</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b6102 The Court cites various examples of \u201cwell-financed corruption\u201d perpetrated by F. Augustus Heinze, the Anaconda Company, and W. A. Clark. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 23-28. Notably, some of these examples involved blatant bribery and <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption (i.e., dollars for political favors), but it is not clear that any of them involved independent expenditures (i.e., political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate) in exchange for political favors. In any event, the Court then proceeds to paint a dismal picture of the corporate \u201cdomination\u201d and Influence\u201d that has persisted in Montana. Opinion, \u00b6 29. From this discussion, the Court concludes as follows. First, voters had a \u201ccompelling interest\u201dto enact the challenged statute in 1912 because \u2018the real social and political power [in Montana] was wielded by powerful corporate managers to further their own business interests,\u201d and the voters were fed up with the \u201ccorrupt practices\u201d and \u2018heavy-handed influence\u201d asserted by the special interests controlling Montana\u2019s political institutions. Opinion, \u00b6 36. Second, the statute \u2018has worked to preserve a degree of political and social autonomy\u201d from \u201cshadowy\u201d corporate figures who seek to promote their own interests. Opinion, \u00b6 37. And finally, there is still a sufficient interest to support the statute because \u2018Tissues of corporate influence, sparse population, dependence upon agriculture and extractive resource development, location as a transportation corridor, and low campaign costs make Montana especially vulnerable to continued efforts of corporate control.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b6 103 It is patently unconstitutional, however, for the government to silence a speaker on the ground that the speaker might otherwise exert an undesired amount of \u2018influence\u201d or \u201ccontrol\u201d in government and politics. Under such a rationale, any disfavored class of speakers could be censored if thought to be too \u2018influential.\u201d The Supreme Court unequivocally repudiated the notion that corporate political speech can be restricted \u201cas a means to prevent corporations from obtaining an unfair advantage in the political marketplace by using resources amassed in the economic marketplace.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 904 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Austin\u2019s </em>holding was founded on the same concern expressed by the Court here: that \u201c[c]orporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>wealth can unfairly influence elections when it is deployed in the form of independent expenditures.\u201d <em>Austin, </em>494 U.S. at 660, 110 S. Ct. at 1398. The Supreme Court in <em>Citizens United, </em>however, held that <em>\u201cAustin </em>is overruled, so it provides no basis for allowing the Government to limit corporate independent expenditures.\u201d 130 S. Ct. at 913. The Supreme Court \u2018Rejected the premise that the Government has an interest in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 904 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">\u00b6104 \u2018Favoritism and influence are not ... avoidable in representative politics,\u201d and \u2018Tr]eliance on a generic favoritism or influence theory... is at odds with standard First Amendment analyses because it is unbounded and susceptible to no limiting principle.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 910 (ellipses in original, internal quotation marks omitted). More to the point, the First Amendment prohibits \u201crestrictions distinguishing among different speakers, allowing speech by some but not others.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898. \u201c \u2018In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating the subjects about which persons may speak and the speakers who may address a public issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 902 (quoting <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. at 784-85, 98 S. Ct. at 1420). The government may not bar corporations from contributing to the \u201copen marketplace\u201d of ideas. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 906. \u201cWhen Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought. This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b6105 The Court tries to distinguish <em>Citizens United </em>as \u201cdecided upon its facts\u201d and involving only federal laws and federal elections, while this case \u201cconcerns Montana law, Montana elections and ... Montana history.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 11,16. Yet, <em>Bellotti </em>involved a state law, and the Supreme Court in <em>Citizens United </em>expressly noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">[Bellotti] rested on the principle that the Government lacks the power to ban corporations from speaking. <em>Bellotti </em>did not address the constitutionality of the State\u2019s ban on corporate independent expenditures to support candidates. In our view, however, that restriction would have been unconstitutional under Bellotti\u2019s central principle: <em>that the First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker\u2019s corporate identity.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Citizens United, </em>130 S.

Regardless of the history of\u2018bribery,\u201d \u201ccontrol,\u201d and \u201cnaked corporate manipulation\u201d recounted by the Court, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 23,25,28, plaintiffs here do not challenge the statutory prohibition on corporate <em>contributions. </em>Rather, they challenge the prohibition on corporate <em>expenditures. </em>And the Supreme Court stated very clearly \u201cthat independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 909. \u201cWhen <em>Buckley </em>identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited to <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 909. \u2018The hallmark of corruption is the financial <em>quid pro </em>quo: dollars for political favors.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 910 (internal quotation marks omitted), \u2018independent expenditures do not lead to, or create the appearance of, <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption. In fact, there is only scant evidence that independent expenditures even ingratiate. Ingratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 910 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b6107 As for the Court\u2019s fear that invalidation of \u00a7 227(l)\u2019s prohibition on independent expenditures by corporations will return Montana to its pre-1912 days of corruption and corporate domination, the Supreme Court answered this concern as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern. We must give weight to attempts by [the legislature] to seek to dispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law, however, must comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that <em>more speech, not less, </em>is the governing rule. <em>An outright ban on corporate political speech ... is not a permissible remedy.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\"><em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 911 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">C. Citizen Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\u00b6108 The Court observes that allowing unlimited independent expenditures of corporate money into the Montana political process would \u201cdrastically change campaigning by shifting the emphasis to raising funds.\u201dOpinion, \u00b6 30. Direct political spending by corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>could also \u201csignificantly affect the outcome of elections.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 32. The Court explains that Montana has a small population and enjoys political campaigns marked by person-to-person contact and a low cost of advertising compared to other states. Opinion, \u00b6 30. Thus, the infusion of unlimited corporate money in support of or opposition to a targeted candidate would leave the average citizen candidate \u201cunable to compete against the corporate-sponsored candidate.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38. \u00b6109 Furthermore, Montana voters feel they do not really \u201ccount\u201din the political process unless they can make a material financial contribution; and they are concerned, therefore, that special interests hold sway. Opinion, \u00b6 31. The percentage of campaign contributions from individual voters is much less in states that do not have restrictions on corporate spending. Opinion, \u00b6 33. At present, the individual contribution limit for Montana House, Senate, and District Court races is $160 and for Supreme Court elections is $310. Opinion, \u00b6 38. Thus, with the infusion of unlimited corporate money in support of or opposition to a targeted candidate, \u2018Montana citizens, who for over 100 years have made their modest election contributions meaningfully count[,] would be effectively shut out of the process.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38. \u2018Clearly the impact of unlimited corporate donations creates a dominating impact on the political process and inevitably minimizes the impact of individual citizens.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 41. The State \u2018has an interest in encouraging the full participation of the Montana electorate.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38; <em>accord </em>Opinion, \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b6110 While I understand the Court\u2019s desire to protect the ability of citizen candidates to compete, and the ability of citizens to meaningfully participate and be heard in the political process, this rationale has been rejected. \u201c \u2018[T]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 904 (brackets in original) (quoting <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 48-49, 96 S. Ct. at 649). The Court\u2019s reasoning is essentially a repackaged version of the antidistortion rationale, which the Supreme Court answered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\"><em>Austin </em>sought to defend the antidistortion rationale as a means to prevent corporations from obtaining \u201can unfair advantage in the political marketplace\u201d by using \u201cresources amassed in the economic marketplace.\u201dBut <em>Buckley </em>rejected the premise that the Government has an interest \u2018in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>was specific in stating that the skyrocketing cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>political campaigns could not sustain the governmental prohibition. The First Amendment\u2019s protections do not depend on the speaker\u2019s financial ability to engage in public discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ani\"><em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 904 (citations and some internal quotation marks omitted). \u2018The rule that political speech cannot be limited based on a speaker\u2019s wealth is a necessary consequence of the premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker\u2019s identity.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 905. The Court\u2019s citizen-protection theory is invalid under <em>Citizens United.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">D. Elected Judges</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b6111 The Court next discusses Montana\u2019s interests in \u201cprotecting and preserving its system of elected judges,\u201d providing \u201can independent, fair and impartial judiciary,\u201d and \u201cpreserving the appearance of judicial propriety and independence.\u201dOpinion, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40. The Court fears that \u2018Montana judicial elections would be particularly vulnerable to large levels of independent spending, both in terms of fairness and in terms of the public perception of impartiality.\u2019\u2019Opinion, \u00b6 44. The Court cites Sandra Day O\u2019Connor\u2019s recent observation that the \u201c\u2018crisis of confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary is real and growing.\u2019 5,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Opinion, \u00b6 45. Noting that Montana is not immune from the influence of corporate-funded \u201csuper spender groups,\u201d the Court concludes that Montana \u201chas a compelling interest in precluding corporate expenditures on judicial elections based upon its interest in insuring judicial impartiality and integrity, its interest in preserving public confidence in the judiciary and its interest in protecting the due process rights of litigants.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\u00b6112 While I share some of the Court\u2019s concerns,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>1 do not believe the Supreme Court will allow a state to single out corporations as a group and prohibit them from speaking in judicial elections. First of all, as noted already, the First Amendment prohibits \u201crestrictions distinguishing among different speakers, allowing speech by some but not others.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898. More to the point, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker\u2019s corporate identity.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"AdG\">\u00b6113 Secondly, <em>Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., </em>556 U.S. 868, 129 S. Ct. 2252 (2009), which the Court cites at \u00b6 43, is of no assistance. <em>Caperton </em>held that a judge was required to recuse himself \u201cwhen a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge\u2019s election campaign when the case was pending or imminent.\u201d 129 S. Ct. at 2263-64. As the Supreme Court later explained in <em>Citizens United, </em>\u201c[t]he remedy of recusal was based on a litigant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial before an unbiased judge. Caperton\u2019s holding was limited to the rule that the judge must be recused, not that the litigant\u2019s political speech could be banned.\u201d 130 S. Ct. at 910 (citation omitted). In other words, recusal is the remedy for the concern with \"protecting the due process rights of litigants\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 45), not banning corporate speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">\u00b6114 Third, Justice Stevens raised this exact issue in his dissent, pointing out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">[t]he majority of the States select their judges through popular elections. At a time when concerns about the conduct of judicial elections have reached a fever pitch, the Court today unleashes the floodgates of corporate and union general treasury spending in these races. Perhaps <em>\u201cCaperton </em>motions\u201d will catch some of the worst abuses. This will be small comfort to those States that, after today, may no longer have the ability to place modest limits on corporate electioneering even if they believe such limits to be critical to maintaining the integrity of their judicial systems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7R\"><em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 968 (citations omitted). In response, the majority certainly could have left open the possibility that judicial elections implicate unique interests justifying restrictions on corporate expenditures in that particular context. The majority did not do so, however.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The majority, rather, remained firm and categorical: the First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker\u2019s corporate identity, and speech restrictions aimed at reducing the relative ability of corporations to influence the outcome of elections are invalid. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 903, 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b6115 Lastly, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>White, </em>536 U.S. 765, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>122 S. Ct. 2528, strongly indicates that the interests cited by the Court here are insufficient for prohibiting corporate speech in judicial elections. The Supreme Court-Justice Scalia joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O\u2019Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas-held that the Minnesota Supreme Court\u2019s canon of judicial conduct (the \u201cannounce clause\u201d) prohibiting candidates for judicial election from announcing their views on disputed legal and political issues violated the First Amendment. <em>White, </em>536 U.S. at 788, 122 S. Ct. at 2542. The interests asserted in support of the announce clause were the same interests asserted by the Court in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\">preserving the impartiality of the state judiciary and preserving the appearance of the impartiality of the state judiciary. Respondents reassert these two interests before us, arguing that the first is compelling because it protects the due process rights of litigants, and that the second is compelling because it preserves public confidence in the judiciary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\"><em>White, </em>536 U.S. at 775, 122 S. Ct. at 2535 (citation omitted). In analyzing these interests, the <em>White </em>Court considered different possible meanings of the term \u2018impartiality.\u201d One meaning is the Tack of bias for or against either <em>party </em>to the proceeding,\u201d which \u201cguarantees a party that the judge who hears his case will apply the law to him in the same way he applies it to any other party.\u201d <em>White, </em>536 U.S. at 775-76, 122 S. Ct. at 2535 (emphasis in original). Without stating expressly whether this was a compelling state interest, the Supreme Court held that the announce clause\u2019s restriction on speech for or against particular <em>issues </em>did not serve the interest in assuring equal application of the law to particular <em>parties. White, </em>536 U.S. at 776, 122 S. Ct. at 2535. Another meaning of impartiality is the Tack of preconception in favor of or against a particular <em>legal view.\u201d White, </em>536 U.S. at 777, 122 S. Ct. at 2536 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court disagreed, however, with the proposition that \u201c[a] judge\u2019s lack of predisposition regarding the relevant legal issues in a case\u201d is a compelling state interest. <em>White, </em>536 U.S. at 777-78, 122 S. Ct. at 2536. Likewise, the Supreme Court concluded that a third possible meaning-\u2018openmindedness\u201d-was an implausible basis for the announce clause. <em>White, </em>536 U.S. at 778-81, 122 S. Ct. at 2536-38.</p>\n<p id=\"AC6\">\u00b6116 Of relevance to the present discussion, the Supreme Court observed in <em>White </em>that \u201cthe notion that the special context of electioneering justifies an abridgment of the right to speak out on disputed issues sets our First Amendment jurisprudence, on its head. Debate on the qualifications of candidates is at the core of our electoral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>process and of the First Amendment freedoms, not at the edges.\u201d 536 U.S. at 781, 122 S. Ct. at 2538 (alteration, emphasis, and internal quotation marks omitted). Concerning the relationship between judicial elections and the First Amendment, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYL\">There is an obvious tension between the article of Minnesota\u2019s popularly approved Constitution which provides that judges shall be elected, and the Minnesota Supreme Court\u2019s announce clause which places most subjects of interest to the voters off limits.... The disparity is perhaps unsurprising, since the ABA, which originated the announce clause, has long been an opponent of judicial elections. That opposition may be well taken (it certainly had the support of the Founders of the Federal Government), but the First Amendment does not permit it to achieve its goal by leaving the principle of elections in place while preventing candidates from discussing what the elections are about. <em>The greater power to dispense with elections altogether does not include the lesser power to conduct elections under conditions of state-imposed voter ignorance. If the State chooses to tap the energy and the legitimizing power of the democratic process, it must accord the participants in that process ... the First Amendment rights that attach to their roles.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><em>White, </em>536 U.S. at 787-88, 122 S. Ct. at 2541 (second ellipsis in original, brackets, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). \u00b6117 Justice O\u2019Connor made a similar point in her concurrence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">Minnesota has chosen to select its judges through contested popular elections .... In doing so the State has voluntarily taken on the risks to judicial bias described above. As a result, the State\u2019s claim that it needs to significantly restrict judges\u2019 speech in order to protect judicial impartiality is particularly troubling. If the State has a problem with judicial impartiality, it is largely one the State brought upon itself by continuing the practice of popularly electing judges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><em>White, </em>536 U.S. at 792, 122 S. Ct. at 2544 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"AvG\">\u00b6118 Perhaps most telling are the remarks of Justice Kennedy-who, as noted, authored the majority opinion in <em>Citizens United. </em>Justice Kennedy agreed that \u201cjudicial integrity is ... a state interest of the highest order.\u201d <em>White, </em>536 U.S. at 793, 122 S. Ct. at 2544 (Kennedy, J., concurring). He also acknowledged that a state may choose to have an elected judiciary, may strive to define those characteristics that exemplify judicial excellence, may enshrine its definitions in a code of judicial conduct, may adopt recusal standards more rigorous than due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>process requires, and may censure judges who violate these standards. <em>White, </em>536 U.S. at 794, 122 S. Ct. at 2545.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><em>What [a state] may not do, however, is censor what the people hear as they undertake to decide for themselves which candidate is most likely to be an exemplary judicial officer. </em>Deciding the relevance of candidate speech is the right of the voters, not the State. The law in question here contradicts the principle that unabridged speech is the foundation of political freedom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">The State of Minnesota no doubt was concerned, as many citizens and thoughtful commentators are concerned, that judicial campaigns in an age of frenetic fundraising and mass media may foster disrespect for the legal system. Indeed, from the beginning there have been those who believed that the rough-and-tumble of politics would bring our governmental institutions into ill repute. And some have sought to cure this tendency with governmental restrictions on political speech. See Sedition Act of 1798, ch. 74, 1 Stat. 596. Cooler heads have always recognized, however, that these measures abridge the freedom of speech-not because the state interest is insufficiently compelling, but simply because content-based restrictions on political speech are expressly and positively forbidden by the First Amendment. <em>The State cannot opt for an elected judiciary and then assert that its democracy, in order to work as desired, compels the abridgment of speech.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-X\"><em>White, </em>536 U.S. at 794-95, 122 S. Ct. at 2545 (emphases added, internal quotation marks and some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b6119 The principle espoused by Justice Kennedy in <em>White-ttiat </em>a state may not \u201ccensor what the people hear as they undertake to decide for themselves which candidate is most likely to be an exemplary judicial officer\u201d4s consistent with the theme of the <em>Citizens United </em>opinion: \u201c[I]t is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule,\u201d 130 S. Ct. at 911, and \u201c[n]o sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations,\u201d 130 S. Ct. at 913. A fair reading of the broad holding in <em>Citizens United, </em>together with a fair reading of the First Amendment principles articulated in <em>White, </em>leads inevitably to the conclusion that corporate independent expenditures can no more be prohibited in judicial elections than they can be in legislative and executive elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">E. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b6120 In sum, what has happened here is essentially this: The Supreme Court in <em>Citizens United </em>(and in White) rejected several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>asserted governmental interests; and this Court has now come along, retrieved those interests from the garbage can, dusted them off, slapped a \u2018Made in Montana\u201d sticker on them, and held them up as grounds for sustaining a patently unconstitutional state statute. The erroneous premise underlying the Court\u2019s entire approach here is its belief that the Supreme Court rejected the asserted governmental interests only as applied to federal elections. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 16. Nowhere in its decision did the Supreme Court state that there was something unique about federal elections that precluded the PAC-as-an-alternative theory, the antidistortion rationale, or the anticorruption interest as justifications for restricting independent expenditures by corporations. The Supreme Court simply rejected all of these arguments outright, in broad and unqualified language. Not only that, the Supreme Court expressly noted that <em>\u201cBellotti </em>did not address the constitutionality of the State\u2019s ban on corporate independent expenditures to support candidates. <em>In our view, however, that restriction would have been unconstitutional under </em>Bellotti\u2019s <em>central principle: that the First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker\u2019s corporate identity.\u201d Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 903 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. at 784-85, 98 S. Ct. at 1420). This Court is extremely misguided, therefore, in attempting to resurrect the rejected governmental interests under a Montana is unique\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b6121 As demonstrated, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Citizens United </em>is clear with regard to the First Amendment\u2019s protection of corporate political speech. Section 13-35-227(1), MCA, impermissibly restricts such speech by prohibiting corporations from making \u201can expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate or a political party.\u201d The statute is, therefore, facially unconstitutional under <em>Citizens United.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b6122 That said, and as noted above, I agree, at least in principle, with the arguments and concerns expressed by the Attorney General and the amici curiae supporting the State. I am deeply frustrated, as are many Americans, with the reach of <em>Citizens United. </em>The First Amendment has now been elevated to a vaunted and isolated position so as to endow corporations with extravagant rights of political speech and, with those rights, the exaggerated power to influence voters and elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b6123 Professor Howell suggests that \u2018tt]he disconnect between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>['Citizens United\u2019s </em>and Caperton\u2019s] statements about corruption\u201d provides Montana an opportunity to preserve its Corrupt Practices Act as applied to judicial elections. <em>See </em>Larry Howell, <em>Once Upon a Time in the West: </em>Citizens United, Caperton, <em>and the War of the Copper Kings, </em>at 26 (available at http://mtlr.org). For my own part, I doubt that approach will be successful. In its zeal to grant corporations unlimited rights of political speech, the Supreme Court summarily dismissed its decision in <em>Caperton </em>with the statement that <em>Caperton </em>\u2018is not to the contrary\u201d because its holding \u201cwas limited to the rule that the judge must be recused, <em>not that the litigant\u2019s political speech could be banned.\u201d Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 910 (emphasis added). This statement, along with the observations of the dissent in <em>Citizens United </em>and the statements by the majority and concurring opinions in <em>White, </em>lead me to conclude that <em>Citizens United </em>will eventually be applied to state judicial elections,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> leaving recusals as the sole remedy where corporate expenditures have corrupted or biased the judge or judges at issue.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b6124 Once <em>Citizens United </em>is imposed on elected state judiciaries, I am concerned-as were Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor; as are my former colleagues <em>(see </em>Amicus Brief of Former Montana Supreme Court Justices William Hunt, William Leaphart, James Regnier, Terry Trieweiler and John Warner (Apr. 27, 2011)); and as is the Court in today\u2019s Opinion-that judicial elections will become little better than the corporate bidding wars that elections for partisan offices have already become. I have suggested, therefore, that Montana\u2019s voters may-and probably should-amend the Montana Constitution to implement a merit system for selecting judges. <em>See </em>James C. Nelson, <em>Introduction, </em>72 Mont. L. Rev. 1, 5-6 (2011); <em>cf. </em>W. William Leaphart, <em>First Right of Recusal, </em>72 Mont. L. Rev. 287 (2011) (suggesting that Montana adopt an enforceable mechanism for removing Montana justices when potential bias exists).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b6 125 'While, as a member of this Court, I am bound to follow <em>Citizens </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>United, </em>I do not have to agree with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And, to be absolutely clear, I do not agree with it. For starters, the notion that corporations are disadvantaged in the political realm is unbelievable. Indeed, it has astounded most Americans. The truth is that corporations wield inordinate power in Congress and in state legislatures. It is hard to tell where government ends and corporate America begins; the transition is seamless and overlapping. In my view, <em>Citizens United </em>has turned the First Amendment\u2019s \u201copen marketplace\u201d of ideas into an auction house for Friedmanian<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> corporatists. Freedom of speech is now synonymous with freedom to spend. Speech equals money; money equals democracy. This decidedly was not the view of the constitutional founders, who favored the preeminence of individual interests over those of big business. <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 949-50 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">\u00b6126 Second, I disagree with the premise that unlimited corporate political speech is essential to \u201cenlightened self-government\u201d and aids the electorate in making \u201cinformed choices.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 898,907.1 agree that \u201c[rjhetoric ought not obscure reality.\u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 907. But I cannot agree that the <em>Citizens United </em>majority\u2019s views reflect \u201creality.\u201dFor one thing, voters generally do not have the desire, much less the time, sophistication, or ability, to sift through hours upon hours of attack ads, political mumbo jumbo, and sound bites in order to winnow truth (of which there often seems to be very little) from fiction and half-truths (of which there unfortunately seems to be an endless supply).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Supreme Court believes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>solution for false or misleading speech is more speech. Yet, an endless barrage of accusations and counteraccusations providing more fodder than fact only serves to overwhelm, confuse, and disenchant voters.</p>\n<p id=\"Are\">\u00b6127 Furthermore, it defies reality to suggest that millions of dollars in slick television and Internet ads-put out by entities whose purpose and expertise, in the first place, is to persuade people to buy what\u2019s being sold-earry the same weight as the fliers of citizen candidates and the letters to the editor of John and Mary Public. It is utter nonsense to think that ordinary citizens or candidates can spend enough to place their experience, wisdom, and views before the voters and keep pace with the virtually unlimited spending capability of corporations to place corporate views before the electorate. In spending ability, bigger really is better; and with campaign advertising and attack ads, quantity counts. In the end, candidates and the public will become mere bystanders in elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b6 128 Third, with respect to the interests of shareholders in not being compelled to fund corporate political speech with which they disagree, I do not believe that participation in \u201ccorporate democracy\u201d actually accounts for anything-nnless, of course, the objecting shareholder is an insider or owns a controlling percentage of the outstanding stock. I cannot agree that \u201ccorporate democracy\u201d will cause big business and multinational corporations to exercise responsibly their new unlimited power to speak and spend. It won\u2019t, because money, influence, and access are at stake. Any notion to the contrary is simply the triumph of hope over experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b6129 Fourth, I absolutely do not agree that corporate money in the form of\u2018independent expenditures\u201d expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates cannot give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. Of course it can. Even the most cursory review of decades of partisan campaigns and elections, whether state or federal, demonstrates this. <em>Citizens United </em>held that the only sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption is one that is limited to <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption. This is simply smoke and mirrors. <em>See Citizens United, </em>130 S. Ct. at 961 (dissenting opinion). In the real world of politics, the <em>\u201cquid pro </em>quo\u201d of both direct contributions to candidates and independent expenditures on their behalf is <em>loyalty. </em>And, in practical effect, experience teaches that money corrupts, and enough of it corrupts absolutely. <em>See e.g. Caperton, </em>556 U.S. 868, 129 S. Ct. 2252.</p>\n<p id=\"AjR\">\u00b6130 Fifth, therefore, I cannot agree with the holding that the prevention of corruption in the form of independent expenditures is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>not a compelling state interest. There is no plausible reason why a state would <em>not </em>want to protect the integrity of its election process against corruption and undue influence; to do otherwise would render the fundamental right to vote a meaningless exercise. To my knowledge, the First Amendment has never been interpreted to be absolute and gloriously isolated from other fundamental rights and values protected by the Constitution. Yet, <em>Citizens United </em>distorts the right to speech beyond recognition. Indeed, I am shocked that the Supreme Court did not balance the right to speech with the government\u2019s compelling interest in preserving the fundamental right to vote in elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\">\u00b6131 At the same time, though, I am not persuaded that Montana\u2019s experience with corruption is as \u201cunique\u201d as the Attorney General and this Court posit. Each state has its own corruption horror stories and has battled political and election corruption at one time or another. Even a casual examination of the daily newspaper or the evening news proves that battling political corruption is ongoing; like painting the Golden Gate Bridge, when you reach one end, you start over at the other. It should be noted that Montana\u2019s Corrupt Practices Act was adopted in 1912 at a time when the country\u2019s focus was on preventing political corruption, not on protecting corporate influence. Due to intervening changes in the composition and philosophy of the Supreme Court, that focus has now flip-flopped. <em>See </em>Zephyr Teachout, <em>The Historical Roots of </em>Citizens United v. FEC: <em>How Anarchists and Academics Accidentally Created Corporate Speech Rights, </em>5 Harv. L. &amp; Policy Rev. 163 (2011). Montana\u2019s Corrupt Practices Act has become an historical-and unconstitutional-artifact, and it will have to be legislatively revised to accommodate a changed time and a changed Supreme Court. A number of our sister states have modified their laws in the wake of <em>Citizens United (see </em>\u00b6 72 n. 4, <em>supra), </em>and I expect that Montana\u2019s 2013 Legislature will, or should, be tasked with doing the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b6132 Lastly, I am compelled to say something about corporate \u201cpersonhood.\u201d While I recognize that this doctrine is firmly entrenched in the law, <em>see Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. at 780 n. 15, 98 S. Ct. at 1418 n. 15; <em>but see </em>435 U.S. at 822, 98 S. Ct. at 1439-40 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), I find the entire concept offensive. Corporations are artificial creatures of law. As such, they should enjoy only those powers-not constitutional rights, but legislatively-conferred powers-that are concomitant with their legitimate function, that being limited-liability investment vehicles for business. Corporations are not persons. Human beings are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>persons, and it is an affront to the inviolable dignity of our species that courts have created a legal fiction which forces people-human beings-to share fundamental, natural rights with soulless creations of government. Worse still, while corporations and human beings share many of the same rights under the law, they clearly are not bound equally to the same codes of good conduct, decency, and morality, and they are not held equally accountable for their sins. Indeed, it is truly ironic that the death penalty and hell are reserved only to natural persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b6133 Having said all this, I must return to the central point of this Dissent. Regardless of my disagreement with the views of the <em>Citizens United </em>majority, the fact remains that the Supreme Court has spoken. It has interpreted the protections of the First Amendment vis-\u00e1-vis corporate political speech. Agree with its decision or not, Montana\u2019s judiciary and elected officers are bound to accept and enforce the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling-in the same way that this Court demands obedience to its rulings, like them or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b6134 For these reasons, I dissent from the Court\u2019s analysis in the instant case. I disagree with the Court\u2019s decision to parse <em>Citizens United </em>in a fashion so as to \u201csend a message\u201d to, or be the next \u201ctest case\u201d before, the Supreme Court. In my view, this approach is disingenuous. Montana is in the same First Amendment swimming pool as every other state, and the Supreme Court has dictated that its waters are expansive and deep when it comes to corporate political speech. <em>Citizens United </em>is the law of the land, and this Court is duty-bound to follow it. When this case is appealed to the Supreme Court, as I expect it will be, a summary reversal on the merits <em>(see </em>U.S. Sup. Ct. R. 16) would not surprise me in the least.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b6135 In my opinion, District Court Judge Sherlock\u2019s well-reasoned and courageous-though politically unpopular-decision should be affirmed. I cannot agree with this Court\u2019s determination not to do so. Therefore, I respectfully and regretfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\"> 1 refer to the United States Supreme Court as \u2018the Supreme Court.\u201d References to the Montana Supreme Court include \u2018the Court,\u201d\u2018this Court,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d and \u201cour.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-4\"> As the Court notes, direct contributions are not at issue here.
