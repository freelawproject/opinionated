The facts are that one M. W. Gay, on October 19, 1889, being the owner of lots 7 and 8, in block 111, in Grover\u2019s Addition to Portland, executed a mortgage thereon to one W. G. Begister, to secure the payment of his promissory note for $2,000, due in one year, with interest from said date at the rate of eight per cent, per annum, which note and mortgage on December 4, 1889, were assigned to plaintiff, which since that date has been, and now is, the owner and holder thereof; that on October 23, 1889, Gay conveyed said premises to Mary C. Hill and H. E. Bristow by a deed with warranty against all incumbrances except said mortgage, but they did not assume or agree to pay the debt thereby secured; that Mary C. Box \u2014 formerly Hill \u2014 and Thomas Box, her husband, and H. E. Bristow, on April 3, 1893, for the expressed consideration of $4,800, conveyed said lots to the defendant H. M. Cake by a deed containing a covenant of warranty against all incumbrances except said mortgage, \u201cwhich,\u201d the <em>habendum et tenendum </em>clause thereof recites, \u201cthe said H. M. Cake assumes and agrees to pay;\u201d that Cake, on June 18, 1894, conveyed said land to the defendant Mary E. Croft by a deed containing a similar covenant and exception, but she did not assume or agree to pay said debt. Default having been made in the payment of said note, this suit was instituted for the relief hereinbefore stated, and, the trial thereof resulting in a decree foreclosing said mortgage, and dismissing the suit as to the defendant Cake, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b131-5\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-6\">For appellant there was an oral argument by <em>Mr. Wallace McCamant, </em>with a brief over the name of <em>Snow &amp; Mc-Camant, </em>to this effect.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-7\">A vendee who assumes and agrees to pay a mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>on the land is personally liable for the mortgage debt, notwithstanding the fact that his vendor was not so liable: <em>Merriam </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>90 Pa.

The evidence tends to show that at the time Cake purchased the lots in question, he considered them worth about $3,600 ; that he paid, on account of the purchase, the sum. of $150, and executed to Mary C. Hill and H. E. Bristow a deed of unincumbered real property, which he valued at about $1,500; and from these facts it is argued by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the mortgage debt formed a part of the consideration of Cake\u2019s purchase, and having, by his acceptance of the deed, assumed and agreed to pay the said debt, his grantors thereby created a fund for plaintiff\u2019s benefit, of which Cake was trustee, and, this being so, the law supplies the want of privity of contract between him and the mortgagor by the fiction of an implied promise, which a court of equity will enforce. Defendant\u2019s counsel insist, however, that, inasmuch as Mary C. Hill and H. E. Bristow were not personally liable for the payment of the mortgage debt, they did not become Cake\u2019s sureties by his assumption and agreement to pay it ; and hence, as against him, they could not be subrogated by any payment they might make, and, as the mortgagee could take no better title than they possessed, it cannot recover a personal judgment against Cake upon his covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">It is impossible to reconcile the conflict of judicial utterance upon the question under consideration, but we believe the weight of authority supports the principle for which defendant contends. In <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Jeffery, </em>26 Or. 186 (37 Pac. 712), the defendants Robinson Bros., having entered into a contract with the City of Portland for the' construction of a sewer, stipulated that they \u201cwould pay all sums of money due at the completion of the work, or thereafter to become due, for material used in, and labor performed on, or in connection with, said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>work,\u201d and to secure the faithful performance of this contract they executed' a bond to the city, in which the defendants Jeffery and Bays joined as sureties. The plaintiff, having sold and delivered to Robinson Bros, material to be used in the construction of the sewer, and not having been paid therefor, commenced an action against said sureties to recover the amount so due him, and it was held that he could not recover, because it did not appear that the contract had been entered into directly and primarily for his benefit. To the same effect is the case of <em>Washburn v. Interstate Investment Co., </em>26 Or. 436 (36 Pac. 533, and 38 Pac. 620), in which Bean, O. J., says: \u201cThe prevailing doctrine in this country undoubtedly is that, where one person, as a consideration or part consideration for an executed contract, promises another, for a consideration moving from him, to pay or discharge some legal obligation or debt due from such other to a third person, the latter, although a stranger to the consideration, and not an immediate party to the contract, may maintain an action thereon, if it was made directly and personally for his benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In <em>Brower Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>28 Or. 565 (52 Am. St. Rep. 807, 43 Pac. 659), in construing a clause contained in a bond given to the City of Portland for the faithful performance of the stipulations of a contract for making a street improvement, it was held, in effect, that, inasmuch as the city was not liable to the persons who sought to take advantage of the condition of the bond, there was no consideration for the stipulation to pay for the material used in or the labor performed upon the improvement. The conclusion arrived at in that case seems to have been based upon the rule announced by Mr. Justice Allen, in <em>Vrooman </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>69 N. Y. 280, in which he says: \u201cTo give a third party, who may derive a benefit from the performance of the promise, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>action, there must be \u2014 First, an intent by the promisee to secure some benefit to the third party; and, second, some privity between the two, the promisee and party to be benefited, and some obligation or duty owing from the former to the latter, which would give him a legal or equitable claim to the benefit of the promise, or an equivalent from him personally.\u201d In <em>King </em>v. <em>Whitely, </em>10 Paige 465, it was held that, where the grantor of mortgaged premises is not personally liable for the payment of the debt thereby secured, the person to whom he conveys the land by a deed, which recites that the grantee assumes the payment of the debt as a part of the consideration, is not liable to the holder of the mortgage for any deficiency that might exist upon a sale of the premises under a foreclosure of the mortgage. See, also, as illustrating this principle: <em>Trotter </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>12 N. Y. 74 (62 Am. Dec. 137); <em>Vrooman </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>69 N. Y. 280; <em>Pardee </em>v. <em>Treat, </em>82 N. Y. 385; <em>Garnsey </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>47 N. Y. 233 (7 Am. Rep. 440); <em>Carrier </em>v. <em>Paper Co., </em>73 Hun. 287 (26 N. Y.

Ct. 494); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Mix, </em>4 Kan. App. 654 (46 Pac. 58); <em>New England Trust Co. v. Nash, </em>5 Kan. App. 739; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>De Oca, </em>120 Cal. 102 (52 Pac. 130); <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>144 Mo. 495 (66 Am. St. Rep. 431, 46 S. W. 32).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Where the grantor is in equity bound to pay the debt as his own, the covenant of his grantee to discharge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>obligation constitutes a promise made for tbe benefit of tbe holder of tbe mortgage, wbicb be may enforce, although tbe primary object of tbe grantor in exacting tbe covenant was to protect himself against bis personal liability for tbe debt, wbicb was a charge upon tbe mortgaged premises: <em>Burr </em>v. Beers, 24 N. Y. 178 (80 Am. Dec. 327); <em>Pardee </em>v. <em>Treat, </em>82 N. Y. 385; <em>Biddel </em>v. <em>Brizzolara, </em>64 Cal. 354 (30 Pac. 609); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Naftzger, </em>103 Cal. 438 (37 Pac. 411).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In Pennsylvania, however, a different conclusion has been reached by tbe courts, which bold that a grantor, although not personally liable for tbe payment of a mortgage debt, may direct bow tbe purchase money shall be paid; and, if tbe grantee of tbe premises agrees to pay according to such directions, he will be liable on bis covenant: <em>Merriam v. Moore, </em>90 Pa. St. 78. The rule adopted in Pennsylvania and some other states seems to be founded on tbe maxim that \u201cequity regards as done what ought to be done,\u201d tbe application of which treats tbe land purchased as money, and tbe grantee, having agreed, as a part of tbe consideration, to pay tbe debt, is liable on bis covenant to tbe bolder of the mortgage for tbe faithful disposition of tbe fund wbicb has been placed in bis bands by tbe grantor for tbe purpose of discharging tbe incumbrance. If this theory be correct, and tbe mortgagee has a claim in equity upon tbe fund, it would seem to follow, from tbe adoption of tbe maxim, that a conveyance of tbe legal title must necessarily discharge tbe mortgage, and tbe bolder thereof, having lost bis lien thereby, is obliged to resort for indemnity to tbe fund which takes tbe place of bis security. Tbe transfer of tbe title to tbe premises, however, does not discharge tbe mortgage thereon ; and, tbe bolder of tbe lien not having parted with bis security nor incurred any loss in consequence of tbe conveyance, it would seem to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>follow that he could, have no claim whatever against the grantee who had assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage debt. When default is made in the payment of said debt, the incumbrance on the premises remains intact, and, this being so, the land was never converted into money, and the theory that the purchase price in the hands of the grantee constitutes a fund for the purpose of discharging the incumbrance is unfounded; thus showing that the maxim involved is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">A conveyance of mortgaged land by a grantor who is not personally liable for the payment of the debt thereby secured, is not equivalent to remitting money to another with a request that he pay it over to the holder of the mortgage in satisfaction of the incumbrance, in consideration of which the grantee assumes and agrees to pay such debt. The error in the conclusion, by which the grantee under such circumstances -is held personally liable on his covenant, seems to lie in the adoption of theory as the major premise, instead of basing the reasoning upon the facts involved. If the grantor, however, is personally liable for the payment of the mortgage debt, it is but reasonable to suppose that when he conveys the premises, which are subject to the lien, he would seek indemnity for his own benefit, and insist that the person to whom he sold the land should assume and agree, as a part of the consideration, to pay the debt which was a charge thereon, and the grantee, having accepted a deed poll containing such a covenant, becomes personally liable for the payment of said debt; but this covenant must necessarily inure to the grantor for whose benefit it was made, rather than to the holder of the mortgage, who has given no consideration whatever for the additional assurance which he thus obtains by reason of the grantee\u2019s covenant. In foreclosing the mortgage such grantee is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>a necessary party in order to bar bis equity of redemption, and the court, having obtained jurisdiction of his person, will, in order to avoid a circuity of remedies, enforce his covenant, not for the benefit of the holder of the mortgage, but to protect the grantor from any personal judgment that may be rendered against him: <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Cabell, </em>77 Va. 482. Mary C. Hill and H. E. Bristow, not being personally liable for the payment of said debt, were not benefited by Cake\u2019s covenant, and, if any benefit was intended to be derived therefrom, plaintiff must have been the recipient thereof; but, under the recent decisions of this court, which we think are founded in reason and supported by the weight of authority, something more than an intended benefit is required to give force to the implied promise, and, as no personal debt was due Cake\u2019s grantors, he incurred no personal liability to plaintiff by his covenant, and hence it follows that the decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
