Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et aI., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b189-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">Appellant Eugene Oliver Dirr, Jr. filed a \u201cPetition for Restraining Order\u201d in the federal district court for the Southern District of Texas seeking to enjoin the Chancery Court of Harrison County, Mississippi from enforcing a decree that defines his visitation rights with his children, who are in the custody of his former wife, and requires him to post $500 bond with the Mississippi court before visits will be allowed. The petition, which names no judge or other individual as a respondent, as amplified by appellant\u2019s brief, asserts that the Mississippi court\u2019s decree violates the full faith and credit clause, Article IV, Section 1 of the United States Constitution because it alters certain provisions of a decree regarding visitation rights previously issued by the Harris County, Texas Court of Domestic Relations. The federal district court in this action dismissed appellant\u2019s petition on its own motion. The court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283, pertaining to the prohibition against federal courts granting an injunction to stay state court proceedings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> barred Dirr\u2019s request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-16\">We agree that the lower court lacked jurisdiction over this cause. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(f) establishes the \u201cTerritorial Limits of Effective Service,\u201d providing in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ll process other than a subpoena may be served anywhere within the territorial limits of the state in which the district court is held, and, when authorized by a statute of the United States or by these rules, beyond the territorial limits of that state.\u201d As this court has emphasized, under \u201cthe recognized general principle in the federal system\u201d federal district courts possess no \u201cpower of foreign service of process . . . unless by the terms of a \u2018specific exception\u2019 created by Congress.\u201d <em>Hanes Supply Co. v. Valley Evaporating Co., </em>5 Cir., 1958, 261 F.2d 29, 33, 34. We know of no such \u201cspecific exception\u201d empowering a federal court in Texas to serve process upon a Mississippi state court, and since \u201cservice of process (in the absence of a voluntary appearance or a conscious waiver) is an indispensible prerequisite to the court\u2019s jurisdiction to proceed,\u201d <em>Beecher v. Wallace, </em>9 Cir., 1967, 381 F.2d 372, 373; <em>see Mooney Aircraft, Inc. v. Donnelly, </em>5 Cir., 1968, 402 F.2d 400, 406, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dirr\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-12\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283 provides that</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
