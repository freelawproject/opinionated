The first claim stated in the complaint is a <em>qui tam </em>action based on 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 264 for a monetary penalty and forfeiture of a Chevrolet station wagon allegedly sold to plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>tiffs on an Indian reservation in violation of federal licensing requirements. The second claim is for statutory damages for failure to make proper disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601, et seq. We affirm the dismissal of the second claim and that portion of the first claim seeking forfeiture. We hold, however, that plaintiffs have properly stated a claim for the monetary penalty under \u00a7 264 and vacate the dismissal thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">On November 21, 1975, plaintiffs visited the Navajo Motors (Navajo) showroom in Gallup, New Mexico. Mr. Otero, a salesman at Navajo, waited on the plaintiffs and filled out a credit application for them when they displayed an interest in a Chevrolet station wagon. Following a conversation about the car and credit possibilities Mr. Otero suggested that the plaintiffs go to lunch and come back later in the afternoon to see if their credit had been approved. That afternoon Mr. Otero obtained approval of credit from the Merchants Bank. He also prepared a retail installment contract and an estimate on plaintiffs\u2019 trade-in vehicle. The plaintiffs, however, did not return as expected. The following morning Mr. Otero obtained permission from his sales manager to deliver the station wagon to plaintiffs\u2019 home within the Navajo Indian reservation at Ft. Defiance, Arizona. Following Mr. Otero\u2019s arrival, the plaintiffs agreed to purchase the car, and they executed the retail installment contract at their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">Plaintiffs have asserted a claim under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 264,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which is part of a statutory scheme designed to protect Indians living on reservations from unscrupulous trade practices. <em>See, Rockbridge v. Lincoln, </em>9 Cir., 449 F.2d 567. It provides sanctions against non-Indians who attempt to introduce goods for trade on a reservation without first obtaining a license from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. By the terms of the statute, such a person \u201cshall . be liable to a penalty of $500.\u201d This pen\u00e1lty may be recovered through a <em>qui tam </em>action brought by a private informer pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 201.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, </em>317 U.S. 537, 541 n.4, 63 S.Ct. 379, 87 L.Ed. 443. The informer is entitled to one half of the penalty, and the other half is paid to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-10\">Navajo\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 264 only applies in \u201cthose situations where the merchant makes the first contact with the Indian on the reservation\u201d is without merit. The \u00a7 264 sanctions extend to any non-Indian \u201cwho shall attempt ... to introduce goods, or to trade therein\u201d on a reservation. The complaint states that a Navajo Motors salesman drove a Chevrolet station wagon to the plaintiffs\u2019 residence within the borders of a Navajo Indian Reservation, and while there without a license \u201coffered to sell and sold the vehicle to plaintiffs.\u201d This alleged behavior falls squarely within the scope of commercial activities proscribed by the statute. The preliminary negotiations conducted the previous day between the parties in Gallup created no binding obligations and have no bearing on the applicability of \u00a7 264. The subject vehicle was as yet unsold at the time it was introduced onto the reservation. Navajo\u2019s further attempt to restrict application of the statute to those merchants who frequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>the reservation with several items of merchandise in order to conduct a regular course of trade are equally unfounded in both the language employed by Congress and the social policy reflected in Title 25. The activity here alleged raises sufficient possibilities of overreaching and exploitation to invoke the protective sanctions of \u00a7 264. <em>See, Rockbridge v. Lincoln, supra, </em>at 573-75. The order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claim for the \u00a7 264 monetary penalty is accordingly vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">We reach a different result, however, with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 claim for forfeiture of the subject vehicle. The Supreme Court has articulated the general rule that \u201c[f]orfeitures are not favored; they should be enforced only when within both letter and spirit of the law.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>One Ford Coach, </em>307 U.S. 219, 226, 59 S.Ct. 861, 865, 83 L.Ed. 1249. Forfeiture in this instance would violate both the letter and spirit of federal Indian legislation, and plaintiffs\u2019 action therefor was properly dismissed below. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 264 states that a violator \u201cshall forfeit all merchandise offered for sale to the Indians or found in his possession, and shall moreover be liable to a penalty of $500.\u201d Plaintiffs seek to invoke the forfeiture provisions of \u00a7 264 in their own behalf by virtue of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 which authorizes a <em>qui tam </em>action for \u201c[a]ll penalties\u201d accruing under Title 25. The \u201cpenalty\u201d of $500 provided in \u00a7 264 is distinct, however, from the forfeiture of merchandise. The latter is not a \u201cpenalty,\u201d subject to claims by a private <em>qui tam </em>litigant. By the Act of July 31, 1882, ch. 360, 22 Stat. 179, Congress amended what is now \u00a7 264 by replacing the clause \u201cforfeit and pay the sum of $500\u201d with the clause \u201cbe liable to a penalty of $500.\u201d The amended language distinguishes the forfeiture of merchandise from the monetary \u201cpenalty.\u201d We will not ascribe a meaning to \u00a7 201 which would effectively dissolve this distinction and expand the definition of \u201cpenalty\u201d beyond the scope reflected in the text of \u00a7 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">Our result here is supported by the canon of statutory construction that federal Indian legislation is to be construed where possible in favor of the Indians. <em>Squire v. Capoeman, </em>351 U.S. 1, 6-7, 76 S.Ct. 611,100 L.Ed. 883. At the time suit was brought, \u25a0the subject vehicle had already been sold to Indians living on the reservation. Plaintiffs assert, however, that \u201cthe formal declaration of the forfeiture relates back to the time the station wagon was offered for sale and avoids the sale to appellants and the subsequent assignment to Merchants Bank.\u201d Were we to accept this position, we would jeopardize the possessory rights of reservation Indians to purchased goods which were offered to them in contravention of \u00a7 264, since the goods would be subject to forfeiture irrespective of a subsequent good faith purchase. Such a doctrine would violate the spirit and intent of \u00a7 264, which was enacted for the Indians\u2019 economic protection. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim of forfeiture must consequently fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">The retail installment contract executed by plaintiffs contains on its reverse side the following acceleration clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-10\">In the event of default by the Buyer hereunder, the entire unpaid balance of the Total of Payments shall, at the option of Holder, become immediately due and payable. .' .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-11\">The plaintiffs assert that this clause imposes a default, delinquency or similar charge, and was thus required to be disclosed on the front of the contract pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638(a)(9) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 226.8(a)(1) and 226.8(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">After the briefs in the present case were filed, the decision of this court in <em>Begay v. Ziems Motor Co., </em>550 F.2d 1244, was published, which is dispositive of this issue. In <em>Begay </em>we adopted the position of the Fifth Circuit in <em>Martin v. Commercial Securities Co., Inc., </em>539 F.2d 521, and held that an acceleration clause does not contain an additional \u201ccharge\u201d and therefore need not be disclosed as such. The dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claim for statutory damages for failure to disclose is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>All other appellate contentions have been considered and are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part, and remanded.
