Hamrick sues to recover manufacturer\u2019s excise taxes which he paid during 1964-66 in connection with the sale in the United States of new Volkswagen automobiles that he had imported from Europe. The defendant counterclaims for additional excise taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>Mr. Hamrick, the claimants in <em>F &amp; D Trading Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>No. 273-74, decided July 14, 1978, 580 F.2d 414, a company known as Jattke &amp; Cap\u00e9is, and certain other companies were \u201cgrey market\u201d importers of Volkswagen automobiles into the United States from Europe during the 1960\u2019s. The grey market importers competed with each other in selling the imported Volkswagens, and they also competed with Volkswagen of America, Inc. (\u201cVW of A\u201d), which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Volkswagenwerk, AG, the West German manufacturer of Volkswagens. VW of A was the only factory-authorized importer of Volkswagens into the United States, and it handled the great bulk of the business. Although they grey market importers could not purchase Volkswagens from the manufacturer, they were able to purchase new Volkswagens in Europe from Volkswagen regional distributors or from Volkswagen dealers who had available for sale Volks-wagens which they had previously purchased from the factory or from regional distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">In order for Volkswagens to be imported and sold in the United States, it was necessary for the vehicles to be \u201cAmericanized.\u201d This involved the installation of safety glass windshields, leatherette vinyl seat covers, a mileage (rather than a kilometer) speedometer and odometer, and sealed-beam headlights. The Volkswagens imported by VW of A were Americanized by the factory in Germany, and the Volkswagens imported by the grey market importers were Americanized in free trade zones at various port cities of Western Europe. The Americanized Volkswagens imported and sold by Mr. Hamrick and other grey market importers were identical with those imported and sold by VW of A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">Unlike VW of A, Jattke &amp; Cap\u00e9is, and the claimants in the <em>F &amp; D Trading Corp. </em>case, all of whom sold their imported Volks-wagens exclusively at wholesale, plaintiff Hamrick sold some of his imported Volks-wagens at retail directly to consumers. He also sold at wholesale to retailers but not to wholesale distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Mr. Hamrick conducted his business in Florida. Sometime in the early 1960\u2019s, he was advised by a local Internal Revenue Agent that he should use 75 percent of the sale price of the imported Volkswagens sold during a particular quarter as the base on which to compute his quarterly manufacturer\u2019s excise tax liability on such sales. Subsequently, and continuing through part of the period involved in the present litigation, Mr. Hamrick used the 75-percent-of-sale-price formula in computing and paying his manufacturer\u2019s excise tax liability, both with respect to the sale of imported Volks-wagens at retail to consumers and the sale of Volkswagens at wholesale to retailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">In the spring of 1965, Mr. Hamrick obtained a copy of a letter which a representative of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service stationed in London, England, had written on April 29, 1965, to Jattke &amp; Ca-p\u00e9is, one of Mr. Hamrick\u2019s grey market competitors in the sale of imported Volks-wagens. In that letter, the IRS representative informed Jattke &amp; Cap\u00e9is that the manufacturer\u2019s excise tax on Volkswagens purchased in Europe and imported into the United States should be based upon the purchase price of the vehicles in Europe, plus the cost of Americanizing the vehicles. Beginning in about June 1965, and in reliance on the letter to Jattke &amp; Cap\u00e9is, Mr. Hamrick began calculating and paying his manufacturer\u2019s excise tax liability on the basis of the cost of purchasing the Volks-wagens in Europe, plus the cost of Americanizing the automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">In 1968, the Internal Revenue Service examined Mr. Hamrick\u2019s manufacturer\u2019s excise tax returns for the period from October 1, 1964, through March 31, 1966, and determined that Mr. Hamrick owed $12,465 of additional excise tax. This deficiency, which prompted the defendant\u2019s counterclaim in the present case, was calculated: (1) by using as a tax base the actual sale price for those Volkswagens which Mr. Hamrick sold at wholesale to retailers; and (2) , for those Volkswagens sold at retail to consumers, by using as a tax base the average sale price of comparable automobiles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>sold by Mr. Hamrick at wholesale to retailers. Thus, the Service held that it was erroneous for Mr. Hamrick to have used the 75-percent-of-sale-pfice formula prior to June 1965 in determining his manufacturer\u2019s excise tax liability, and also erroneous to have used the purchase price of the Volkswagens in Europe, plus the cost of Americanizing the vehicles, as the base on which to compute his manufacturer\u2019s excise tax liability beginning in June 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">At the present stage of the litigation (/. e., before the judges), plaintiff contends that he was entitled to use, for his sales to consumers, a constructive sale price (under I.R.C. \u00a7 4216(b)(1)) based upon the wholesale price at which his main competitor, VW of A, sold identical Volkswagens of the same types as those sold by him. For his sales to retailers, he urges that the \u201cspecial\u201d constructive sale price provided in I.R.C. \u00a7 4216(b)(2) (1964) (amended 1965, 1971) was available to him on the basis of the constructive sale price he urges for the tax on his retail sales.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We discuss and reject both of these positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\"><em>Retail sales to consumers: </em>The automobile excise tax is generally imposed, I.R.C. \u00a7 4061(a) (1964) (amended 1971), on \u201cthe manufacturer, producer, or importer\u201d at a specified percent of the price for which the article is sold by him in the United States. <em>See F &amp; D Trading Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>Ct.Cl. No. 273-74, 580 F.2d at 417, decided July 14, 1978. However, in certain circumstances two alternative \u201cconstructive sale prices\u201d are available under \u00a7 4216(b)(1) and (b)(2). With respect to Mr. Hamrick\u2019s sales at retail to consumers, defendant now concedes that he was entitled under \u00a7 4216(b)(1) and Rev.Rul. 68-202, 1968-1 Cum.Bull. 477, to utilize a constructive sale price consisting of 75 percent of his actual retail sale price or cost plus ten percent, whichever was higher.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 4216(b)(1), <em>see </em>note 2, <em>supra, </em>establishes that, in the case of an article sold at retail, the constructive sale price shall be the <em>lower </em>of \u201c(i) the price for which such article is sold, or (ii) the highest price for which such articles are sold to wholesale distributors in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as <em>determined by the Secretary or his delegate\u201d </em>(emphasis added). We are concerned here only with the second prong; both sides agree that that standard provides in this case a lower base than the price for which plaintiff sold his Volkswagens at retail. The dispute is over the extent of the difference. As we have pointed out (note 2, supra), the Service held in Rev.Rul. 68-202 that the highest price for which automobiles were sold to wholesale distributors in the ordinary course of trade by manufacturers or producers was the higher of 75% of actual sale price or total cost plus 10%. Plaintiff challenges that Ruling as controlling his case, while defendant says that the Ruling governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>Three significant aspects of the \u201cconstructive sale price\u201d for sales at retail, as permitted by \u00a7 4216(b)(1), should be marked at the outset. <em>First </em>is that the \u201cconstructive sale price\u201d is only applicable if it is lower than the price for which the taxpayer actually sold the article on which the tax is imposed; the actual sale price sets the maximum base for the tax and the \u201cconstructive sale price\u201d is an alternative only if it is advantageous to the taxpayer, resulting in a smaller tax. <em>Second, </em>the section expressly gives to the Treasury Department the power to determine the \u201cconstructive sale price,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>\u201cthe highest price for which such articles are sold to wholesale distributors, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof.\u201d <em>Third, </em>this legislative formulation of the \u201cconstructive sale price\u201d is far from precise, presenting several substantial ambiguities not resolved by the bare words of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">Hamrick\u2019s position, with respect to his retail sales, is that he is entitled to the \u201cconstructive sale price\u201d under \u00a7 4216(b)(1)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> computed on the basis at which Volkswagens were sold by VW of A, by far the largest importer and seller of Volkswagens in this country, in its sales to its wholesalers. If that were the applicable basis, plaintiff might be entitled to a refund and in any event would probably be free from the defendant\u2019s counterclaim with respect to sales to consumers (/. e., at retail).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">We stumble over this contention of plaintiff\u2019s because \u00a7 4216(b)(1) authorizes \u201cthe Secretary or his delegate\u201d \u2014 not the court \u2014 to determine \u201cthe highest price for which <em>such articles </em>are sold to wholesale distributors\u201d (emphasis added). The statute does not seem to require the \u201cSecretary or his delegate\u201d to limit \u201csuch articles\u201d to the narrow class of imported Volkswagens; so far as we can now tell, the Treasury has substantial leeway (within rational bounds) to take account- \u2014 in fixing the highest price for which <em>\u201csuch </em>articles\u201d are sold \u2014 of all vehicles, or all passenger vehicles, or some other class of vehicles less than all but broader than the minor category of imported Volkswagens. The statute does not prescribe the exact perimeters of the \u201csuch articles\u201d which are to be used as the measuring rod, and the Treasury, since Congress gave it the authority to determine, must have reasonable discretion in defining \u201csuch articles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-11\">On what has been presented to us, we cannot say that IRS has abused its discretion in Rev.Rul. 68-202, <em>supra. </em>Plaintiff simply assumes, without argument or proof, that the only accepted comparison is with the sale of other imported Volkswagens; he makes no effort whatever to show that the Service could not properly make a comparison with other cars or vehicles, or that the standard of the Revenue Ruling would be wrong if such a broader category were taken as the basis of comparison.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For its part, the defendant suggests, though it does not represent, that, in establishing the formula set forth in the Revenue Ruling, the Service took into consideration a wide spectrum of motor vehicles of all types and sought to ascertain the general mark-up percentage between sales to wholesale distributors and sales to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-12\">This being the state of the record, we are in no position to upset the Revenue Ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>as arbitrary, capricious, in excess of proper discretion, or based upon an incorrect view of the statute. Much more would have to be shown to overturn the determination by the agency explicitly endowed by Congress with the power to decide this alternative \u201cconstructive sale price,\u201d under a statutory standard as imprecise in its terms and application as the one in \u00a7 4216(b)(l)(ii).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Plaintiff insists that Rev.Rul. 68-202 should not be considered the Treasury \u201cdetermination\u201d contemplated by \u00a7 4216 (b)(l)(ii). But the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, as the delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury, has for many years made similar determinations in the form of Revenue Rulings. Section 4216(b)(l)(ii) does not prescribe the form of the \u201cdetermination,\u201d and the Service\u2019s \u201cconsistent pattern of administrative construction of \u00a7 4216(b)(1)\u201d has been accepted as a practical interpretation and application of the statute, <em>Whattoff v. United States, </em>355 F.2d 473, 477-78 (8th Cir. 1966); <em>see also Smith v. United States, </em>319 F.2d 776, 781 (5th Cir. 1963). We agree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">Nor can plaintiff rightfully invoke <em>Smith v. United States, supra, </em>319 F.2d at 781, as calling for rejection of the Revenue Ruling. In that case, the Government argued that a \u201cconstructive sale price\u201d under \u00a7 4216(b)(l)(ii) could not be applied to used cars. In turning down that position of the Department of Justice, the Fifth Circuit did not overrule any Revenue Ruling or any Service \u201cdetermination\u201d under \u00a7 4216(b)(1) (ii); the court simply held that the section did not, under its wording and as generally applied by the Service, exclude used cars entirely from the privilege of that \u201cconstructive sale price.\u201d It deserves mention, too, that,, in directing the determination by the District Court of the constructive sale price for the used cars, the Court of Appeals employed the same general formula as the IRS \u2014 a percentage of the retail price.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-11\">We conclude, then, that Rev.Rul. 68-202 provides in this case the proper basis for computing plaintiff\u2019s tax on his retail sales and that, under that formula, he is not entitled to recover but may possibly have underpaid his tax; and if so, the defendant is entitled to recover on its counterclaim with respect to his retail sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-12\"><em>Sales to retailers: </em>For sales to retailers, \u00a7 4216(b)(2) provides a special \u201cconstructive sale price\u201d to those taxpayers who meet the conditions of that sub-subsection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mr. Hamrick presents an intricate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>argument that he can properly take advantage of that provision, but on this point he simply cannot avoid the statutory barrier raised by \u00a7 4216(b)(2)(B) (see note 9, <em>supra) </em>which makes it a necessary condition for application of this alternative \u201cspecial rule\u201d that \u201cthe manufacturer, producer, or importer of such article regularly sells such articles to one or more wholesale distributors in arm\u2019s length transactions * * Plaintiff concedes that he himself made no such sales during the relevant period.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Yet the express wording of the subsection and its legislative history both demonstrate that Congress intended this \u201cspecial rule\u201d to apply only where the <em>same </em>manufacturer, producer, or importer also made regular sales to wholesale distributors. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 481, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 22 (1958-3 Cum. Bull. 372, 393). This concurrence of unmistakable statutory language and indication of Congressional purpose is too strong to be overcome by general appeals to \u201cfairness.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Obviously, express and intended provisions of the Internal Revenue Code cannot be disregarded by courts merely because the judges can conceive of some solution which seems \u201cfairer\u201d to them. <em>See, e. g., F &amp; D Trading Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>Ct.Cl. No. 273-74, 580 F.2d at 417-18 (1978). Congress is the forum for such rectifications. In this ease, moreover, we have word from Congress that, when it added the \u201cspecial rule\u201d of \u00a7 4216(b)(2), it was not attempting in that provision to achieve fully the goal of imposing manufacturers taxes on a completely uniform basis; administrative problems were thought to prevent the reaching of full equality. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 481, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 21 (1958-3 Cum.Bull. 372, 392).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">The result, on this phase of the case, is that the only provision of the Code covering plaintiff\u2019s sales to retailers was I.R.C. \u00a7 4061(a), <em>supra, </em>declaring that the excise tax on automobiles sold in the United States by an importer is to be based on the price for which the importer sold them. It is undisputed that Hamrick did not pay taxes on that basis on his sales to retailers, during the years in suit, but on a lesser basis. Accordingly, he is not entitled to recover, but defendant can recover on its counterclaim. The amount of the Government\u2019s recovery, considering both aspects of the case, will have to be determined under Rule 131(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"AZY\">The court, having considered the evidence, the decision and findings of Senior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>Trial Judge Mast\u00edn G. White, and the briefs and arguments of counsel, makes findings of fact as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">1. Plaintiff, Raymond E. Hamrick (\u201cMr. Hamrick\u201d), is an individual and a citizen of the United States. He has been a resident of Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida, since 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">2. (a) During the period 1959 through 1966, Mr. Hamrick was the southeastern regional distributor (for eight States) and a retail dealer for the SAAB automobile (\u201cSAAB\u201d), a vehicle manufactured in Sweden. Mr. Hamrick had retail locations in Jacksonville and Coco Beach, Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">(b) To complement the SAAB line, Mr. Hamrick imported and sold new Volkswagen vehicles (\u201cVolkswagens\u201d), both through his retail SAAB outlets and to SAAB dealers in the southeast United States. He also sold Volkswagens to franchise Volkswagen dealers. Thus, Mr. Ham-rick, during the period involved in this suit, sold both SAABs and Volkswagens at retail and at wholesale to retailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">3. (a) Mr. Hamrick\u2019s sale of SAABs was not subject to the manufacturer\u2019s excise tax (\u201cMET\u201d) imposed by section 4061 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as Mr. Hamrick purchased those vehicles in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">(b) However, Mr. Hamrick was the importer of the Volkswagens, having purchased them in Europe; and his sales of Volkswagens were thus subject to the MET imposed by section 4061.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">4. Volkswagens imported into the United States for resale during the 1960-71 period came through two channels. The primary source was Volkswagen of America, Inc. (\u201cVW of A\u201d), the wholly owned subsidiary and only factory-authorized importer of the West German Volkswagen manufacturer, Volkswagenwerk, AG. The great majority of all Volkswagens imported and sold in the United States were brought in and sold by VW of A. After importation into the United States, VW of A sold these Volkswagens to 14 regional distributors, five\u2019of which were wholly-owned subsidiaries of VW of A. These regional distributors, in turn, resold the Volkswagens to retail dealers, who sold them to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-11\">5. (a) The remaining relatively small percentage of the Volkswagens imported and sold in the United States were brought in and sold by importers such as Mr. Ham-rick and about 21 others. All of these importers were known in the trade as \u201cgrey market\u201d importers. The mechanics of purchasing cars and the marketing structure followed by Mr. Hamrick and the other grey market importers are indicated in paragraph (b) of this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-12\">(b) As VW of A was the only factory-authorized importer of Volkswagens in the United States, it was impossible for other individuals or companies to purchase, for importation into the United States, Volks-wagens directly from the Volkswagen factory in Germany. However, Mr. Hamrick and his grey market competitors were able to purchase new Volkswagens in Europe from Volkswagen regional distributors or from Volkswagen dealers who had available for sale new Volkswagens which they had previously purchased from the Volkswagen factory or from regional distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-13\">6. (a) To meet consumer tastes and United States Government safety standards for vehicles sold within the United States, certain modifications, known in the trade as \u201cAmericanization,\u201d had to be made to the basic European Volkswagens. This process consisted of installing safety glass windshields, leatherette vinyl seat covers, a mileage (rather than a kilometer) speedometer and odometer, and sealed-beam headlights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-14\">(b) The vehicles imported by VW of A were \u201cAmericanized\u201d at the Volkswagen factory in Germany.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-15\">(c) The Volkswagens purchased in Europe by Mr. Hamrick and other grey market importers were either manufactured for the United States market (for sale in Europe to either American servicemen or tourists) or were European models. The European models were Americanized in free trade zones at port cities of Western Europe utilized by the various purchasers. The average Americanization cost on European models was from $55 to $65 per automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>(d) The United States market Volks-wagens and the Americanized European models purchased by Mr. Hamrick were shipped to the United States by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">(e) The Americanized Volkswagens imported and sold by Mr. Hamrick and other grey market importers were identical with those imported and sold by VW of A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">7. During the quarters involved in the present case, Mr. Hamrick sold the Volks-wagens he imported as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">\n<em>Volkswagens Sold at Retail Volkswagens Sold to Retailers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ADI\">\n<em>Quarter No. $ Volume No. $ Value</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8x\">4th 1964 0 0 116 $195,455.00</p>\n<p id=\"AvYg\">1st 1965 11 22.670.45 78 133,600.00</p>\n<p id=\"ALoe\">2d 1965 20 36,916.95 36 59.260.00</p>\n<p id=\"avx-dedup-0\">3rd 1965 16 27,729.85 43 67.145.00</p>\n<p id=\"ABWr\">4th 1965 22 38.998.45 5 7,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"AgeG\">1st 1966 0 0 9 14.475.00</p>\n<p id=\"AgTr\">TOTAL 69 287 $476,935.00 $126,315.70</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-48\">8. (a) In the early 1960\u2019s, Mr. Hamrick was advised by a local Internal Revenue Agent that he should use 75 percent of his actual sale price as the base on which to compute his manufacturer\u2019s excise tax liability on sales of imported Volkswagens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-49\">(b) During part of the period involved in the present litigation, Mr. Hamrick continued to use the formula referred to in paragraph (a) of this finding, both with respect to the sale of Volkswagens at retail to consumers and the sale of Volkswagens at wholesale to retailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-50\">9. During the quarters in issue, Mr. Hamrick\u2019s main competitor was VW of A, and his principal grey market competitor was a company known as Jattke &amp; Cap\u00e9is. All three imported and sold identical models of Volkswagens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-51\">10. (a) Jattke &amp; Cap\u00e9is was a grey market importer of Volkswagens into the United States from Europe and a competitor of Mr. Hamrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-52\">(b) Sometime prior to April 29, 1965, Ray Culbertson, Jr., representing Jattke &amp; Ca-p\u00e9is, orally requested that Roland L. Wolfe, a representative of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service stationed in London, England, furnish to him information as to the price of Volkswagens shipped to the United States on which the manufacturer\u2019s excise tax should be computed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-53\">(c) On April 29,1965, Mr. Wolfe responded in writing to Mr. Culbertson\u2019s inquiry, and stated in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-54\">* * * [I]t seems that the price of the automobile plus Americanization should be considered the sales price for the purpose of the excise tax and the excise tax should not be computed on the delivery, forwarding fee, insurance, finance charges and freight. There is a requirement, however, that when the amount billed separately as freight is in excess of the actual transportation charge only the amount billed as freight in excess of the actual charge is taxable as part of the sales price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-55\">I hope that the above will enable you to compute the proper excise tax on shipments requiring the imposition of such tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1113-56\">(d) At all times material to this litigation, the manufacturer\u2019s excise tax which Jattke &amp; Cap\u00e9is paid on the Volkswagens which that company purchased in Europe and imported into the United States was based upon the purchase price of the vehicles in Europe, plus the cost of Americanizing the vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-57\">(e) The Volkswagens which Jattke &amp; Ca-p\u00e9is purchased in Europe and imported into the United States were sold by that company at wholesale to retailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-58\">11. (a) In the spring of 1965, Mr. Ham-rick obtained a copy of the letter referred to in finding 10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-59\">(b) Beginning in about June 1965, and in reliance on the letter of April 29, 1965, to Ray Culbertson, Jr., Mr. Hamrick began filing his MET returns, and calculating his excise tax liability, on the basis of the cost of purchasing the Volkswagens in Europe, plus the cost of Americanizing the automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-60\">12. After the close of each quarter, Mr. Hamrick prepared his MET return by calculating the aggregate tax base (using the 75-percent-of-sale-price formula prior to June 1965 and the Jattke &amp; Cap\u00e9is formula beginning in June 1965), and by assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>that the total included the 10 percent (later 7 percent) manufacturer\u2019s excise tax. Mr. Hamrick then divided tax base by 110 (or 107), and multiplied the result by 10 (or 7). The results of these calculations were entered on the quarterly MET returns, which were prepared after the respective quarters were over.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">13. (a) In 1968, the Internal Revenue Service examined Mr. Hamrick\u2019s MET returns for the period October 1, 1964-March 31, 1966, and determined that Mr. Hamrick owed $12,465 of additional MET.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">(b) This deficiency was calculated by using as a tax base the actual sale price for those Volkswagens sold by Mr. Hamrick at wholesale to retailers, and, for those Volks-wagens sold at retail to consumers, the average sale price for comparable automobiles sold by Mr. Hamrick to retailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">(c) The Internal Revenue Service refused to permit Mr. Hamrick to utilize either the 75-percent-of-sale-price formula or the Jattke &amp; Cap\u00e9is formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">14. (a) In this suit, Mr. Hamrick is seeking refunds of MET, plus statutory interest, and the Government has counterclaimed for the additional $12,465 of MET referred to in finding 13, plus interest in the amount of $4,926.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">(b) Mr. Hamrick\u2019s claims for refund are based upon contentions that (1) in calculating his MET liability, Mr. Hamrick should be permitted to utilize (without regard to his actual sale prices of the Volkswagens) the same tax base which his main competitor, VW of A, used, or the same tax base which his principal grey market competitor, Jattke &amp; Cap\u00e9is, used, in computing the manufacturer\u2019s excise tax liability on the sale of imported Volkswagens identical with those sold by Mr. Hamrick, and (2) the excise taxes which are claimed by Mr. Ham-rick were not passed on to customers but, rather, were absorbed by Mr. Hamrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">(e) At the times material to this litigation, the MET of VW of A was computed on the basis of the actual sale price of imported Volkswagens by VW of A to regional distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-10\">(d) The tax base used by Jattke &amp; Cap\u00e9is at the times material to this litigation is indicated in finding 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-11\">15. (a) There follows a table which reflects (1) the amount of Mr. Hamrick\u2019s MET as reported and paid, (2) the amount of additional MET which the Government contends that Mr. Hamrick owes, and (3) the amounts of refunds that Mr. Hamrick has demanded in his claims for refund:</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-12\">\n<em>Taxable Quarter MET Reported and Paid Govt\u2019t's Claim For Add'I MET Hamrick\u2019s Claim For Refund of MET</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ays-dedup-0\">4th 1964 $10,673.52 $ 5,972.71 $ 2,891.64</p>\n<p id=\"ay8-dedup-0\">1st 1965 10,766.10 2,495.16 4,366.10</p>\n<p id=\"ABdk\">2d 1965 6,023.64 1.704.07 2,297.58</p>\n<p id=\"Ak1\">3rd 1965 4,773.10 1.317.08 1,632.92</p>\n<p id=\"ARE\">4th 1965 2,016.09 381.36 550.67</p>\n<p id=\"aij-dedup-1\">1st 1966 224.01 595.33</p>\n<p id=\"AS-\">TOTAL $34,476.46 $12,465.71 $11,738.91</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-26\">(b) The defendant\u2019s claim for assessed interest is summarized in the following table:</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-27\">\n<em>Taxable Quarter Government\u2019s Claim forAssessedIntere.it</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"afn-dedup-0\">4th 1964 $2,463.53</p>\n<p id=\"AsAN\">1st 1965 992.15</p>\n<p id=\"At8\">2nd 1965 651.75</p>\n<p id=\"ava-dedup-2\">3rd 1965 483.98</p>\n<p id=\"Amr\">4th 1965 134.41</p>\n<p id=\"ahn-dedup-1\">1st 1966 201.00</p>\n<p id=\"ADE\">TOTAL $4,926.82</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-35\">16. (a) At all material times, the sale price of the Volkswagens sold by Mr. Ham-rick were set to meet the price charged by competitors, principally VW of A and Jattke &amp; Cap\u00e9is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-36\">(b) The sale price of Mr. Hamrick\u2019s Volkswagens was determined and fixed as the result of negotiations by the plaintiff and the purchasers. In negotiating for the sale of a particular automobile or group of automobiles, Mr. Hamrick would quote a price to a customer, and the customer would then usually make a counter offer. The counter offer would often set the final sale</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-37\">price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-38\">(c) At no time in the history of Mr. Ham-rick\u2019s business was there a case where the sale price of the Volkswagens was first negotiated and an excise tax was then added.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-39\">17. (a) Mr. Hamrick\u2019s invoices made no reference to the manufacturer\u2019s excise tax. Rather, the invoices simply reflected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>sale price of the automobile or automobiles involved in the various transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\">(b) In no situation was the manufacturer\u2019s excise tax separately stated or added to the sale price of an automobile or group of automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">18. Plaintiff knew that there was an excise tax imposed with respect to each automobile which he imported, the tax to be imposed upon his sale of such automobile. Plaintiff did not know the amount of the tax, however, until the sale had been negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">19. (a) Mr. Hamrick did not view the MET which he paid as a separate add-on item to be collected from the purchaser, but, rather, viewed it as part of his overall cost and expense of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">(b) To the extent possible, Mr. Hamrick endeavored to sell his imported Volks-wagens at prices that would cover all costs and expenses, including the manufacturer\u2019s excise tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-15\">20. (a) Mr. Hamrick filed timely claims for refund of the taxes involved in this suit, and later timely filed this suit for refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-16\">(b) The Government\u2019s counterclaim was filed with the responsive pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-17\">21. The following table sets forth the number of Volkswagens imported by Mr. Hamrick during the quarter-years involved in the case, the MET proposed by the Internal Revenue Service on those particular Volkswagens (under the IRS theory that the tax is based on the sale prices received by Mr. Hamrick).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-19\">\n<em>Quarter Number of Volkswagens Imported and Sold by Hamrick Met on Cars Sold by Hamrick Imposed by the IBS, $12,465 of which has not been paid</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A11\">4th 1964 116 $16,646.23</p>\n<p id=\"A6h\">1st 1965 89 13,261.26</p>\n<p id=\"A_hA\">2d 1965 56 7,727.71</p>\n<p id=\"aml-dedup-0\">3rd 1965 59 6,090.19</p>\n<p id=\"ame-dedup-0\">4th 1965 27 2,397.45</p>\n<p id=\"aqx-dedup-0\">1st 1966 9 819.34</p>\n<p id=\"A_r5\">TOTAL $46,942.18</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-33\">22.

The court further concludes as a matter of law, upon the foregoing opinion and findings, that the defendant is entitled to recover on its counterclaim, together with interest as provided by law, and judgment is entered to that effect. The case is remanded to the Trial Division for a determination of the amount of the defendant\u2019s recovery in accordance with Rule 131(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">. Mr. Hamrick does not now contend that he was entitled to use the so-called Jattke and Cap\u00e9is tax base (which we have already rejected, <em>see F &amp; D Trading Corp. v. United States, </em>Ct.Cl. No. 273-74, 580 F.2d at 418-419 (1978)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">. Section 4216(b)(1) provides as follows: <em>\u201cConstructive Sale Price.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">(1) <em>In General. </em>\u2014 If an article is\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-9\">(A) sold at retail,</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-10\">(B) sold on consignment, or</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-11\">(C) sold (otherwise than through an arm\u2019s length transaction) at less than the fair market price, the tax under this chapter shall (if based on the price for which the article is sold) be computed on the price for which such articles are sold, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary or his delegate. In the case of an article sold at retail, the computation under the preceding sentence shall be on whichever of the following prices is the lower: (i) the price for which such article is sold, or (ii) the highest price for which such articles are sold to wholesale distributors, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary or his delegate. This paragraph shall not apply if paragraph (2) applies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-14\">Rev.Rul. 68-202, 1968-1 Cum.Bull. 477, provided that for sales at retail the constructive sales price under \u00a7 4216(b)(l)(ii) was the higher of (a) 75 percent of the actual sales price or (b) the total cost plus ten percent. The Ruling directly relates to trailer chassis and bodies, but has been applied to other types of automobiles where the seller has no \u201cestablished retail price.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">. For example, the scope of the terms \u201csuch articles\u201d and of \u201cordinary course of trade\u201d is not clear. Another problem is whether \u201cmanufacturers or producers thereof\u201d includes importers in this context. Other portions of the statute (see, e. <em>g., </em>\u00a7 4061(a), imposing the tax and \u00a7 4216(b)(2), providing a \u201cspecial rule\u201d for certain taxpayers) use \u201cmanufacturer, producer, or importer\u201d but \u00a7 4216(b)(l)(ii) employs only \u201cmanufacturers or producers.\u201d We have not seen any regulation or ruling \u2014 or other authoritative indication \u2014 showing the position of IRS as to whether the term \u201cimporter\u201d can or should be introduced into this particular part of \u00a7 4216(b)(l)(ii) as an addition to \u201cmanufacturers or producers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1109-14\">. Plaintiff does not claim, for his retail sales, the special \u201cconstructive sale price\u201d established by \u00a7 4216(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1109-15\">. Plaintiff had full opportunity to make his factual case before the trial judge and his legal case at that level as well as before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">. Specifically, we cannot say, on the basis of the present record, that (a) plaintiff, in selling \u201cgrey market\u201d Volkswagens, competed only with other sellers of Volkswagens and not with other sellers of passenger cars (or of smaller passenger cars); (b) \u00a7 4216(b)(1)(h) compelled IRS to base its determination solely on the experience of VW of A which was an importer, not a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d or \u201cproducer\u201d; or (c) that Rev.Rul. 68-202 could not properly compute \u201cordinary\u201d sales to wholesale distributors by reducing the retail price by what was deemed to be the normal markup percentage in the vehicle-selling industry (or by adding 10% to the cost of the article).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">. No court has held that the \u201cdetermination\u201d called for by \u00a7 4216(b)(1)(h) could not be made by Revenue Ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">. The holding in <em>Quaker City Iron Works, Inc. v. United States, </em>256 F.Supp. 450, 453-54 (E.D. Pa. 1966), is also not pertinent. The vice there was that the taxpayer was selling far below cost and its cost was more than 75% of retail price; in that situation the predecessor Revenue Ruling required it to pay tax on the basis of the full retail price. In Mr. Hamrick\u2019s instance, no loss was incurred (sales were not below cost), and the <em>Quaker City Iron Works </em>problem does not arise. The opinion in that case suggests, <em>id. </em>at 455, that the percentage formula of the Revenue Ruling is appropriate where sales below cost are not involved \u2014 as in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1110-14\">. Section 4216(b)(2) (1964) (amended 1965, 1971) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-15\">\u201c(2) <em>Special Rule. </em>\u2014 If an article is sold at retail or to a retailer, and if\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-16\">(A) the manufacturer, producer, or importer of such article regularly sells such articles at retail or to retailers, as the case may be,</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-17\">(B) the manufacturer, producer, or importer of such article regularly sells such articles to one or more wholesale distributors in arm\u2019s length transactions and he establishes that his prices in such cases are determined without regard to any tax benefit under this paragraph,</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-18\">(C) in the case of articles upon which tax is imposed under section 4061(a) (relating to automobiles, trucks, etc.), the normal method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>of sales for such articles within the industry is not to sell such articles at retail or to retailers, or combinations thereof, and (D) the transaction is an arm\u2019s length transaction, the tax under this chapter shall (if based on the price for which the article is sold) be computed on whichever of the following prices is the lower: (i) the price for which such article is sold, or (ii) the highest price for which such articles are sold by such manufacturer, producer, or importer to wholesale distributors.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">. His contention, boiled down, is that he had the \u201cdefinitional equivalence\u201d of such sales to wholesalers because \u00a7 4216(b)(1) entitles him (in his view) to a basis for his retail sales predicated on the price VW of A sold cars to <em>its </em>wholesale distributors. Plaintiff\u2019s position is that the tax base for sales at retail, for sales to retailers, and for sales to wholesalers should be the same under the statute, at least where the retail base is calculated (as he thinks it should be for him) on the price the vehicles are sold to wholesale distributors by the seller he conceives to be his dominant competitor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">. Mr. Hamrick points out that, if \u00a7 4216(b)(2) is taken literally as defendant urges, he could be paying a higher tax on his sales to retailers (i. e., based on the actual sale price to retailers) than on his retail sales (computed under the \u201cconstructive sale price\u201d formula of Rev.Rul. 68-202). He does not claim that it would be unconstitutional for Congress to impose the tax on such a disparate basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1111-11\">. The House Committee report makes it clear that the requirement that the same manufacturer, producer or importer regularly make sales to wholesalers was deliberately adopted in order to avoid the administrative burdens of having to construct, from the experience of other sellers, a hypothetical base for imposition of the tax. But where sales to wholesalers are regularly made by the same taxpayer, \u201ca basis for constructing a price for the manufacturers\u2019 sales at retail and to retailers will be readily available.\u201d <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 481, <em>supra, </em>at 21-22 (1958-3 Cum.Bull. at 392-93).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
