Smith, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 544 F.2d 832. There is no constitutional right to reinstatement of an appeal abandoned by escape. <em>Estelle v. Dorrough, </em>1975, 420 U.S. 534, 95 S.Ct. 1173, 43 L.Ed.2d 377. Nor is there a right to automatic reinstatement of an appeal dismissed without prejudice because of the appellant\u2019s escape. <em>See United States v. Smith, supra. </em>Because of the period of time that has elapsed since appellant was tried, there would be substantial danger of prejudice to the government if appeal were allowed at this time and were successful; therefore we would not allow reinstatement without at least a showing of good cause. In the absence of any evidence that appellant was not actually a fugitive or of any explanation for his conduct, he has failed to meet the threshold requirement that would justify reinstatement of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>right that he has relinquished. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>5 Cir. 1975, 508 F.2d 797, cert. <em>denied, </em>423 U.S. 828, 96 S.Ct. 45, 46 L.Ed.2d 44; <em>Fratus v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 496 F.2d 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the motion to reinstate appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-28\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this case summarily. See <em>Groendyke Transportation, Inc. v. Davis, </em>5 Cir. 1969, 406 F.2d 1158.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
