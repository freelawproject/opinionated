SKELLY WRIGHT, Chief Judge.</p>\n<author id=\"b634-9\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Presented for our review are orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissing a complaint filed by petitioner against several railroads for alleged violations of Sections 1(5), 1(6), and 6(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner is a merchant of waste paper and waste wood-pulp originating at its own facilities and shipped to paper mills for recycling. Its shipments were classified by the defendant railroads under the Uniform Freight Classification tariff category for virgin \u201cwood-pulp,\u201d which commands a substantially higher rate than that imposed under the corresponding category applicable to recyclable \u201cscrap or waste paper.\u201d In dismissing petitioner\u2019s complaint the Commission, with four Commissioners dissenting,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ruled that waste woodpulp was properly classified by the railroads under the pertinent tariff provisions, and that petitioner failed to show that application of such rates was otherwise unjust and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-21\">The issue we decide is limited in scope, involving a matter of tariff interpretation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and does not require extended discussion. Simply stated, the interpretative issue is whether waste woodpulp is embraced by the specific tariff classification applicable to \u201c[wjoodpulp, not powdered, noibn * * <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as found by the majority of the Commission, or by the tariff classification applicable to scrap or waste paper, which includes \u201cpaper, pulpboard or fibre-board, or * * * any article made thereof, or made of woodpulp * * * being shipped to a mill for repulping,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as petition contends. At least one dissenting Commissioner <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> believed that the waste paper tariff provision was ambiguous, and therefore agreed with petitioner\u2019s subsidiary contention that the tariff should be applied to waste woodpulp under the rule that ambiguous tariff provisions must be construed strictly against the drafting carriers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>We agree that the tariff provision for waste paper is ambiguous. A reading of the provision creates a reasonable doubt as to whether waste woodpulp is \u201cany article * * * made of woodpulp * * * [used] for repulping.\u201d As the Commission concedes, moreover, the language \u201cmade of\u201d is reasonably susceptible of two meanings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It may have been meant to encompass articles \u201cmanufactured from\u201d wood-pulp, or it may have been intended to apply to products \u201cconsisting of\u201d woodpulp. Although waste woodpulp would fall within the provision only under the latter interpretation, both constructions consistently flow from the language employed without working an unjust or dysfunctional result. Since we find this provision to be latently ambiguous, we conclude that the Commission erred by construing it against petitioner and in favor of the railroads.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">We need not address the remaining questions raised by the petition, since the Commission has indicated that it will consider them anew in its ongoing proceeding in <em>Ex Parte </em>No. 319.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That proceeding was the subject of our opinion in <em>National Ass\u2019n of Recycling Industries, Inc. v. ICC, </em>190 U.S. App.D.C. -, 585 F.2d 522 (D.C. Cir. 1978), decided this day, and the Commission will consider those issues consistent with our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">The orders under review are vacated, and the case is remanded to the Commission for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-12\">.

During the pendency of our review the Commission, by order, directed that waste woodpulp be included within its investigation. In that investigation, instituted pursuant to \u00a7 204 of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act, Pub.L. No.94-210, \u00a7 204, 90 Stat. 40 (1976), the Commission will decide whether the rate structures on waste woodpulp are unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory, and will order removal of unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory rates.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
