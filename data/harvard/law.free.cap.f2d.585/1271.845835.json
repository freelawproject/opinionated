Austin issued over $750,000 worth of bad checks drawn against his checking account with the Bank of Pontotoc, Mississippi (the Bank), a small-town bank with a capital structure of less than one million dollars. On October 20, 1975, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) bank examiners discovered that his account was overdrawn in the amount of $499,941.42. The examiners found the Bank\u2019s capital to be so impaired that they required it to raise in excess of $200,000 in new capital or to merge with another bank in order to preserve its insured status with FDIC. The Bank chose the latter course.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-22\">On July 16, 1976, Austin and three officers of the Bank who had made it possible for Austin to maintain his account in an overdraft position were indicted for violating federal banking laws. In five counts, they were charged with aiding and abetting one another in misapplying FDIC-insured bank funds, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 (1976), in making false entries in the Bank\u2019s books and reports, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005 (1976), and in concealing material facts about the Bank\u2019s condition from FDIC. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (\u00cd976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One of the officers, Sarah Mc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>Donald, the head bookkeeper, pled guilty prior to trial and testified against the remaining defendants as a prosecution witness. Austin and Stanley Faulkner, the Bank\u2019s president, were found guilty by the jury on all counts; Jimmy Stegall, vice president and head cashier, was acquitted. Austin is the only defendant before us in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">Austin contends that his convictions should be set aside for want of sufficient evidence and that a judgment of acquittal should be entered on each count. Alternatively, Austin claims that he is entitled to a new trial because a statement by the prosecutor in closing argument to the jury amounted to an improper comment on his failure to take the witness stand. We are unpersuaded by Austin\u2019s contentions and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-7\">Whether the sufficiency of the evidence is questioned on motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of the Government\u2019s case, at'the close of all the evidence, or after the return of a guilty verdict, the test is the same:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> viewing the case in the light most favorable to the Government, could \u201ca reasonably-minded jury . . . accept the relevant evidence as adequate and sufficient to support the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Warner, 441 F.2d 821, 825 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 829, 92 S.Ct. 65, 30 L.Ed.2d 58 (1971); <em>accord United States v. Teal, </em>582 F.2d 343 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Prout, </em>526 F.2d 380, 384 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 840, 97 S.Ct. 114, 50 L.Ed.2d 109 (1976). This test applies \u201cwhether the evidence is direct or circumstantial. [W]e must accept as established all reasonable inferences that tend to support the action of the jury, and any conflicts in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the jury verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Teal, </em>582 F.2d at 345 (quoting <em>United States v. Warner, </em>441 F.2d at 825, 831).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-17\">At the outset we observe that Austin concedes that the Government\u2019s proof established that he issued the bad checks in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>question<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that entries were made in the Bank\u2019s records that prevented the FDIC examiners from discerning that his account was overdrawn. The shortcoming in the Government\u2019s case, he contends, lies in the absence of sufficient probative evidence to show that he intended that the Bank\u2019s funds be misapplied or that any false entries be made or other techniques be used for the purpose of hiding his overdrafts from the examiners. We are convinced that the evidence was more than adequate to demonstrate that Austin was a party to the misapplication of bank funds and that he participated in a cover up scheme with the requisite criminal intent. An examination of Austin\u2019s conduct alone, we think, makes this clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">At the time Austin opened his account with the Bank in 1974 he was engaged in business for himself, operating as a land-clearing contractor and as an interstate trucker. He utilized one checking account for his business needs. It was in the name of \u201cL. C. Austin, Dozier Account, Sarepta, Miss.\u201d and was the account on which all of the bad checks were written. No sooner had the account been opened than Austin began to write worthless checks. The checks were numerous and often in substantial amounts, at times in excess of $5,000. It was a rare occasion when the balance in the account was sufficient to cover a check. Nevertheless, the Bank\u2019s bookkeeper, Sarah McDonald, was under standing instructions to honor Austin\u2019s checks. She was told by the president of the Bank, Stanley Faulkner, to pay the checks and to hold them as \u201ccash items.\u201d Under the Bank\u2019s normal procedure, she had the authority to allow an overdraft of an insubstantial amount, but upon paying the customer\u2019s check she would have been required to send him an overdraft notice immediately so that a deposit to cover the check could be made. In Austin\u2019s case, however, her instructions were to honor the check despite the amount and to ignore the overdraft notice procedure. She was simply to advise Faulkner of the overdrafts as they appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-8\">This practice continued unabated except on those occasions when it was suspected that the FDIC examiners might arrive to inspect the Bank. Though the examiners came only intermittently and always unannounced, Faulkner and Jimmy Stegall, the vice president and cashier, seemed to be able to anticipate most of their visits. Whenever they sensed a visit, steps would be taken to ensure that the overdrawn condition of Austin\u2019s account and the accumulation of bad checks as cash items would not be discovered. Various methods were adopted to effect the cover up; each resulted in the establishment of deposit entries in Austin\u2019s account sufficient in amount to offset the worthless checks he had drawn. Consequently, when the examiners inspected his account they were led to believe that sufficient funds had been on deposit to pay his checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-9\">The first FDIC examination of concern to the defendants came in July 1974. By that time, Austin had overdrawn his account by $50,000. Checks totalling that amount had been presented to the Bank and paid. As she had been instructed, Sarah McDonald had honored the checks, without debiting Austin\u2019s account (which lacked funds to pay them), and had held the checks as \u201ccash items,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that is, as assets awaiting conversion to cash. Under normal banking practice, it was improper to treat Austin\u2019s worthless checks as cash items. Shortly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>before the examiners arrived the following procedure was employed to eliminate these cash items: Austin drew a $50,000 worthless check on his account with Mechanics Savings Bank of Water Valley, Mississippi; Faulkner gave the check to Sarah McDonald with instructions to deposit it in Austin\u2019s account; and McDonald, after making the deposit, removed the bad checks from cash items and purportedly converted them to cash by charging them against the proceeds of Austin\u2019s $50,000 deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">Another FDIC examination was anticipated in December 1974. In preparation for the examination, which actually did not take place until the following January, these steps were taken to dispose of an accumulation of $156,000.69 worth of bad checks being carried as cash items: Faulkner, without authority and in violation of Bank policy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> made two $110,000 loans, one to Austin\u2019s wife and one to Austin\u2019s minor son, and deposited the proceeds of the loans in Austin\u2019s account; Sarah McDonald then eliminated the bad checks being held as cash items by charging them against Austin\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">An FDIC examination was again anticipated in June 1975. This time $161,000 in bad checks were removed from cash items by paying them off with the proceeds of four notes totalling $161,520 that Faulkner deposited in Austin\u2019s account. The notes were obtained in this way: Faulkner gave Austin four of the Bank\u2019s form notes; Austin later returned to the Bank and presented Faulkner with the notes fully made out. Each note was made payable to the Bank and completed with a fictitious borrower\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-12\">On September 30, 1975, the Bank was required to submit to FDIC a consolidated report of the Bank\u2019s condition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Faulkner and Stegall signed the report and under 'the heading \u201cCash and Due From Banks\u201d falsely included the sum of $363,356.40, which represented the worthless checks Austin had written and the Bank had paid and was holding as cash items. The falsification of this report was alleged, in Count 2 of the indictment, to be a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-13\">On Monday, October 20, 1975, the FDIC examiners once more appeared. This time the defendants were caught off guard; $499,941.42 worth of Austin\u2019s bad checks, 735 in number, were being held as cash items and were reflected in the Bank\u2019s daily cash journal balance for the previous business day, October 18. When the examiners left the Bank on the evening of October 20, Faulkner and Austin handled the bad checks in the following manner: Faulkner obtained $100,000 of the Bank\u2019s funds by making a false note, payable to the Bank, in the name of one of the Bank\u2019s customers<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and deposited those funds in Austin\u2019s account. Four hundred thousand dollars was added to the account balance with the deposit of two $200,000 checks, both worthless, that Austin drew on accounts he had closed over six months earlier at Mechanics Savings Bank of Water Valley, Mississippi, and the Bank of Mantee, Mississippi.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>Against this $500,000 in deposits, Stegall charged off the $499,941.42 in bad checks that had been carried as cash items. When the FDIC examiners returned to the Bank the next morning, October 21, to continue their work, they discovered these transactions while they were inspecting Austin\u2019s line of credit with the Bank. An investigation that lead to the indictment in this case ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">The revelations of October 21 formed the bases of Counts 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the indictment. For causing the Bank to pay the 735 worthless checks, the defendants were charged, in Count 1, with misapplying $499,941.42 of Bank funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 (1976). In Count 3, the defendants were charged with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005 (1976) by making a false entry of $802,475.17 in the closing debit-column balance for cash items in the daily cash journal for October 18. The entry was alleged to be false because it included the bad check total of $499,941.42, thus overstating a Bank asset (cash items) by that amount and misleading the FDIC examiners as to the true capital condition of the Bank. In Counts 4 and 5, the defendants were charged with depositing the two $200,000 checks in Austin\u2019s account on October 20 for the purpose of concealing, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (1976), the fact that the Bank had previously paid $499,941.42 of Austin\u2019s bad checks without charging his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">As we observed, Austin readily admits to having issued the 735 worthless checks, to-talling $499,941.42, as the FDIC examiners discovered on October 21, 1975. Moreover, he does not deny that he previously wrote, and the Bank paid, the approximately $367,-000 in bad checks not specified in the indictment but revealed during the Government\u2019s case. Austin vigorously contends, however, that these admissions do not permit the inference that he intended to engage in the unlawful conduct charged in the indictment: the misapplication of the 'Bank\u2019s funds, the false entries made in the Consolidated Report\" of Condition of Bank submitted to the FDIC and in the Bank\u2019s daily cash journal, and the concealment from the FDIC\u2019s examiners of the Bank\u2019s payment of $499,941.42 in worthless checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-8\">As for the Count 1 charge that Austin aided and abetted the misapplication of bank funds, we think the evidence of his guilt is overwhelming. We find his argument that there was nothing out of the ordinary for this small bank to have honored his worthless checks totalling some $867,000 farfetched, indeed. To be sure, it was established Bank practice to allow overdrafts, but the evidence was that the only overdrafts routinely permitted were those in small amounts. Nothing even approaching the magnitude of Austin\u2019s overdrafts was condoned. Moreover, when other customers overdrew their accounts they immediately received overdraft notices requesting payment. No such requests for payment were ever made to Austin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-9\">Austin\u2019s modus operandi depended upon an unlimited use of the Bank\u2019s funds as if they were his own. Austin argues that he intended no injury to the Bank \u2014 he contemplated that the checks would be covered in full.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He does not suggest that the overdrafts were actually loans that were to be repaid, and there is no indication that loans were intended. For one thing, no interest was charged or collected; the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>ment of interest was never discussed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even assuming that the evidence permits the inference that Austin intended that, eventually, the Bank would be repaid for cashing his checks, such an intent is no defense to a prosecution for aiding and abetting the misapplication of bank funds under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 (1976) or the making of a false entry in a bank record in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005 (1976). <em>Hall v. United States, </em>286 F.2d 676, 681 (5th Cir. 1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>366 U.S. 910, 81 S.Ct. 1087, 6 L.Ed.2d 236 (1961); <em>see Agnew </em>v. <em>United States, </em>165 U.S. 36, 57, 17 S.Ct. 235, 243, 41 L.Ed. 624 (1897); <em>United States v. Southers, </em>583 F.2d 1302, 1305 (5th Cir. 1978); Benchwick v. <em>United States, </em>297 F.2d 330, 334 (9th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">We are convinced that the evidence demonstrating Austin\u2019s commission of the offenses charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005 (1976) (Counts 2 and 3) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (1976) (Counts 4 and 5), though not as direct as the proof establishing his participation in the misapplication of bank funds, is as compelling. The evidence is not as direct because there is nothing in the record to establish that Austin personally participated in effecting the false entries in the Bank\u2019s books or in the FDIC report, that he even knew that the entries were being made, or that he knew that his two $200,000 checks were used or for what purpose they were used. It is not necessary, however, that one charged as an aider or abettor commit the overt acts that serve to accomplish the offense or that he have knowledge of the particular means his principals (in this case the three Bank officers) employ to carry out the criminal activity. <em>United States v. James, </em>528 F.2d 999, 1015 n. 22 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 959, 97 S.Ct. 383, 50 L.Ed.2d 326 (1976); <em>United States v. Sellers, </em>483 F.2d 37, 45 (5th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 908, 94 S.Ct. 2604, 41 L.Ed.2d 212 (1974); <em>Russell v. United States, </em>222 F.2d 197, 198-99 (5th Cir. 1955). Criminal liability under the aider or abettor statute<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> results from the existence of \u201ca community of unlawful intent between the [aider or abettor] and the [principal],\u201d <em>Russell v. United States, </em>222 F.2d at 199; an aider and abetter is \u201cliable for any criminal act which in the ordinary course of things was the natural or probable consequence of the crime that he advised or commanded, although such consequence may not have been intended by him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 22 C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 92, at 164 (1940)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-9\">As we have demonstrated above, the evidence of Austin\u2019s intent to misapply the Bank\u2019s funds is compelling. A community of unlawful intent necessarily existed between Austin and the Bank officers who knowingly made the funds available to him. Austin\u2019s criminal liability for making false entries and concealing the misapplication from the FDIC examiners emanates from his knowing participation in the check writing scheme. That the false entries and concealments were natural consequences of this scheme is evident from an admission Austin made to his business manager, Marvin Avent. Avent had reason to speak with Austin on more than one occasion about the serious overdraft situation at the Bank, which Austin seemed to take lightly. During one of their discussions on the subject, according to Avent, Austin revealed that his bankers had to maneuver things at the Bank in order to hide the situation from the examiners.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This admission demands the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>inference that Austin conferred with Faulkner regarding actions that had to be taken to cover up the misapplication of the Bank\u2019s funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">This inference is reinforced when one considers the history of Austin\u2019s dealings with the Bank. From the very beginning he wrote overdrafts, and they grew in number and amount with the passage of time. Special arrangements not available to the other customers were made to handle his overdrafts. When these arrangements posed serious accounting problems, at least from the bank examiners\u2019 point of view, the steps taken by Austin and the Bank officers to conceal the facts and to perpetuate the scheme became more complicated and, from a criminal point of view, more serious. As we have recounted, the first device utilized to avoid the examiners\u2019 scrutiny involved the writing (by Austin) and depositing (by Faulkner and McDonald) of a rubber check in the amount of $50,000. The next time two $110,000 loans were made to provide the funds necessary to reconcile Austin\u2019s account. One of the loans was to Austin\u2019s minor son. The jury was entitled to infer that the loans were fraudulent. The Bank had already exceeded its loan limit to Austin; the loans were a ruse; and the one to the son was unenforceable. The third major ploy disclosed by the evidence had Austin present the Bank with four fictitious notes totaling $161,520. To effectuate the fourth deceptive device, the one that precipitated the Bank\u2019s collapse, Austin drew two worthless $200,000 checks on bank accounts elsewhere that he had closed months earlier, and Faulkner betrayed the trust imposed in him by one of the Bank\u2019s good customers by falsifying a $100,000 note in that customer\u2019s name. It requires no subtle analysis to conclude that these machinations embraced several common law crimes, if not offenses against the state of Mississippi and the United States, in addition to those charged in the indictment. Any layman, much less an operator of a business the size of Austin\u2019s, would know that this conduct was in disobeyance of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">We note one additional argument, made by Austin in his brief but seemingly abandoned by him in oral argument, going to the sufficiency of the evidence. It is that the bookkeeping and FDIC reporting entries concerning cash items were not false because they were made in pursuance of the Bank\u2019s standard operating procedures. Whether the characterization of overdrafts as cash items was false is a question of fact for the jury. In rejecting Austin\u2019s claim that a jury issue was not presented as to the falsity of the cash items references in this case, we adopt the response of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to the same contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1368-9\">What is [considered] a false entry is essentially a question of fact to be found by the jury if there is a proper basis in the evidence for such finding. <em>All relevant circumstances are to be considered by the jury in determining whether or not a check is in fact such a cash item. </em>Common banking practice and the practice followed in the particular bank may be relevant. It cannot be denied <em>that when checks drawn against insufficient funds remain in a bank\u2019s possession overnight or for a short time pending clearance or collection, they are ordinarily treated as cash items. It does not follow that such treatment may be continued indefinitely.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\"><em>Meredith v. United States, </em>238 F.2d 535, 540 (4th Cir. 1956) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-11\">In sum, we are convinced that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Austin aided and abetted the commission of the section 1001 and 1005 offenses charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">At the end of his final argument to the jury, the prosecutor made the following remark in responding to the arguments of defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1369-6\">But all that we ask is that you fairly and impartially consider the evidence. Don\u2019t rush into any conclusions, jump to any conclusions one way or the other. Go in and consider it and talk about it and discuss it and see if you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the charges made by the grand jury in this indictment have been proved beyond any doubt and that <em>these defendants have not given you any explanation whatsoever why they should be excused from the consequences of their conduct.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">Record, vol. 6, at 1325 (emphasis added). In a side-bar conference convened after the prosecutor concluded his argument, Austin moved for a mistrial on the ground that the remark constituted a comment on his failure to testify. The trial judge declared a recess, and argument on the motion was resumed in chambers. After counsel were heard, the judge opined that, taken as a whole, the remark was not a comment on Austin\u2019s failure to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31. He denied the motion and volunteered that he would be explicit in his charge to the jury in an effort to remove any prejudice that might have resulted from the remark. <em>Id. </em>A charge conference ensued. Austin requested no special curative instructions, and the court did not articulate an instruction explicitly addressed to the prosecutor\u2019s statement. The court then proceeded to instruct the jury on the law, expounding in the process on the defendant\u2019s right not to testify.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We are convinced, after examining the closing arguments of counsel in the light of the evidence presented to the jury, that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">A prosecutor\u2019s reference to a defendant\u2019s silence is deemed impermissible if \u201cit can be said that the prosecutor\u2019s manifest intention was to comment upon the accused\u2019s failure to testify [or the remark] was . . of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u201d <em>Samuels v. United States, </em>398 F.2d 964, 968 (5th Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1021, 89 S.Ct. 630, 21 L.Ed.2d 566 (1969). Of course, we must view the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in the context in which they are made, considering the circumstances of each case. <em>United States v. Bursten, </em>453 F.2d 605, 608 (5th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 843, 93 S.Ct. 44, 34 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972); <em>see, e. g., United States v. Edwards, </em>576 F.2d 1152, 1154 (5th Cir. 1978) (intent of prosecutor to comment and jury perception implied from the circumstances of that case). These principles have been employed recently in this circuit to determine whether prosecutorial remarks necessitated reversal. <em>United States v. Becker, </em>569 F.2d 951, 964-65 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Rochan, </em>563 F.2d 1246, 1249-50 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Dearden, </em>546 F.2d 622, 625 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 902, 98 S.Ct. 296, 54 L.Ed.2d 188 (1977). In none of these cases did the court find that the prosecutor intended or the jury perceived that the remark in question referred to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Rather, the remarks, when taken in the context which they were made, were found to be permissible comments upon the failure of defense counsel, in argument, to rebut the Government\u2019s case. <em>United States v. Ward, </em>552 F.2d 1080, 1083-84 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 850, 98 S.Ct. 161, 54 L.Ed.2d 119 (1977); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>508 F.2d 345, 347 (5th Cir. 1975). We so construe the remark in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-13\">The central theme of Austin\u2019s defense was that he and his codefendants were honest folk who intended no harm to the Bank. The thrust of Austin\u2019s closing argument, reflected also in the arguments of his code-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>fendants, was that, in this particular bank, overdrafts were allowed as a matter of course; his were simply more frequent and sizeable than any of the others. That coincidence alone, he argued to the jury, was not enough to establish criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">In the rebuttal portion of his closing argument, the prosecutor began by explaining to the jury the function to be served by defense counsel, in their final summations, and by the prosecutor, in rebuttal. He said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-5\">The law . . gives <em>the defendants </em>the right to explain to you why that evidence is not sufficient to convict them, point out any defects or deficiencies in that evidence, anything that is left unproved that\u2019s necessary to reach a final just verdict in this case. And then it\u2019s my responsibility to try to answer some of the points that may have been raised by <em>the defense </em>in their arguments to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"abn-dedup-1\">Record, vol. 6, at 1303-04 (emphasis added). The prosecutor then proceeded to argue that defense counsel had failed to explain away the Government\u2019s case or to point to anything in the evidence that would authorize the jury to exonerate any of the defendants. In closing, he admonished the jurors as to their function, and, in so doing, made the remark quoted above, which precipitated the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-7\">Because a prosecutor\u2019s use of the words \u201cthese defendants\u201d may be susceptible to various interpretations, depending upon the circumstances of the moment, <em>see United States v. Rochan, </em>we take this occasion to caution the Government that it treads dangerous waters indeed in using such language. It should not be necessary for us to remind the Government of its duty to avoid such potentially prejudicial rhetoric; the Government\u2019s overriding interest in seeing that justice is done should suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-8\">In the case before us, we cannot say that the prosecutor manifestly intended to comment on Austin\u2019s failure to testify, since another explanation for his remark is obviously plausible. <em>See id., </em>563 F.2d at 1249. There was no allusion to testifying or taking the stand. His remark was intended to suggest that defense counsel, in their summations, had not shown any reason why the defendants should not be found guilty. We think it probable that his remark was so taken by the jury. In claiming reversible error, Austin carries the burden of demonstrating that the jury necessarily construed the prosecutor\u2019s remark as a comment on his failure to testify. <em>See id. </em>at 1250. He has not carried this burden. Just prior to stating, \u201cthese defendants have not given you any explanation whatsoever,\u201d the prosecutor had urged the jury to search the evidence for anything to support the defendants\u2019 theory of the case. Furthermore, throughout his argument, he had referred to the \u201cdefense,\u201d the \u201cdefendants,\u201d and \u201cthey,\u201d interchangeably. Austin\u2019s own attorney even referred to himself as \u201cdefendant\u201d in alluding to his past experiences as defense counsel. In fine, we think it would be unreasonable for us to conclude that the jury in this case naturally and necessarily perceived the remark as a comment on the failure of the defendant to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-11\">For the reasons stated above, Austin\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1362-13\">.

The precise question whether the sufficiency of the evidence should be measured in the same way at each of these procedural steps in a case has not been addressed explicitly in our prior opinions. Certainly, there is nothing in the language of Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, or in its legislative history that would indicate that the test should differ depending on when a motion for judgment of acquittal is made. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Crim.P. 29; <em>United States v. Sutton, </em>138 U.S.App.D.C. 208, 216, 426 F.2d 1202, 1210 (1969); 2 C.

The testimony of the Government\u2019s expert witnesses established that in ordinary bank accounting and FDIC reporting a cash item is an item that is readily convertible to cash, such as checks drawn on other banks or the United States Treasury. It would also be proper for a bank to describe as a cash item a check drawn on and paid by itself, but .not yet charged against the appropriate account, <em>provided </em>that the check would not create an overdraft if charged to the drawer\u2019s account. The Bank\u2019s daily cash journal contained a cash item heading under which the cash item credit and debit balances at the close of business each day were stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">.

The customer, a travelling businessman, had left a signed but otherwise incomplete note with Faulkner pursuant to a previous arrangement. It was to be filled out by Faulkner, i. e., the date of the note and the amount of the principal and interest were to be inserted, and delivered to the Bank only in the event the customer\u2019s account might become overdrawn. In this instance, the customer\u2019s account was not overdrawn, and therefore Faulkner had no authority to make out the note. Moreover, there was nothing in Faulkner\u2019s authority to handle the customer\u2019s affairs in this fashion that would have permitted Faulkner to deposit the note proceeds to Austin\u2019s account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1365-15\">.

Austin did not testify at trial, and, consequently, the jury was never given his side of the story, apart from his counsel\u2019s closing argument. The only evidence of Austin\u2019s claimed intention that the Bank should suffer no loss came from the testimony of Jimmy Stegall, who took the stand in his own defense. Stegall denied any intent to participate in the overdraft scheme and described his role as that of a Bank employee who dutifully followed his superior\u2019s (Faulkner\u2019s) instructions. He testified to a growing concern among subordinates in the Bank, including himself, as Austin\u2019s overdrafts multiplied and related that shortly before the October 20-21, 1975 FDIC examination he finally confronted Austin, demanding that the checks be paid. Austin assured him that he would take care of the checks, that he had enough jobs going to enable him to pay them off. Record, vol. 5, at 9. Nothing was done, however, save the surreptitious activity generated when FDIC examiners arrived on the scene on October 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1367-6\">. Austin\u2019s dealings resulted in a substantial loss to the Bank. Shortly after the overdraft scheme was discovered by the examiners, the Bank, because of its impaired capital condition, was forced to merge with another state bank, Peoples Bank and Trust Company, Tupelo, Mississippi. As of the commencement of Austin\u2019s trial in district court on September 7, 1976, the Bank\u2019s loss had been reduced by a little over $100,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1367-7\">.
