We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">\u2022 <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">McDonald\u2019s Corporation (McDonald\u2019s) opposed registration of BIG MAC by Gay Toys, Inc. (Toys), asserting that its use on toy trucks would be likely to cause confusion with McDonald\u2019s trademark BIG MAC, registration Nos. 970,987 and 989,692, for restaurant services and carry-out foods, and that Toys\u2019 goods are similar to toys sold by McDonald\u2019s and its licensees under the mark BIG MAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">In its application, dated April 15, 1976, Toys claimed use of BIG MAC for toy trucks since April 1, 1976. On that date, according to the deposition of Toys\u2019 president, a salesman displayed a plaster mockup of a truck at a trade show; the mock-up was visually identical to an actual toy; the mock-up nowhere bore the BIG MAC mark; the salesman had special promotion sheets for use in conjunction with the mock-up. Although the salesman took orders, Toys did not obtain molds necessary for production of commercial models until the end of May.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-9\">The application alleges use \u201con advertising literature\u201d \u2014 the special promotion sheets \u2014 \u201cassociated with the goods\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-10\">McDonald\u2019s moved for summary judgment, on the grounds that Toys had not used BIG MAC as a trademark on goods in commerce prior to its filing date and had knowingly submitted false specimens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-12\">Noting that only plaster \u201cmodels\u201d were used in conjunction with the mark prior to the filing date, the board granted the motion, holding that because the actual goods were not sold or transported in commerce, or displayed in connection with the mark, Toys had not used BIG MAC in commerce within the meaning of \u00a7 45 of the Lanham Act (Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127, and its application was therefore \u201cvoid <em>ab initio.\" </em>Use of BIG MAC on the promotion sheets being considered mere advertising, not use on a display associated with the goods, it could not, said the board, serve as foundation for the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-13\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-14\">The dispositive issue is whether the plaster mock-up constituted \u201cgoods\u201d within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-15\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-16\">Section 1 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051, permits registration of a trademark \u201cused in commerce.\u201d Section 45 states: \u201ca mark shall be deemed to be used in commerce (a) on goods when it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith * * The es-</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-17\">sence of McDonald\u2019s motion is that, as of either April 1 or April 15,1976, Toys had no actual toy trucks, and therefore no \u201cgoods\u201d with which BIG MAC could have been associated, as required by \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 45. Toys says the Act does not prescribe the physical structure or composition of \u201cgoods,\u201d and thus it is immaterial whether the product be hand-made or machine-made, and whether it be of plaster, plastic, wood, or other substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-18\">Section 1 of the Act requires the applicant to specify \u201cthe goods in connection with which the mark is used * * *.\u201d The goods specified in Toys\u2019 application are \u201ctoy trucks.\u201d Though the plaster mock-up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>was described as visually similar to actual toy trucks which can be formed of plastic in production molds, visual similarity alone cannot convert a plaster mock-up into a toy truck. Toys correctly states that \u201cgoods\u201d may be formed in a variety of materials. In so saying, Toys begs the question, which is not what its toy trucks are made of, but whether its plaster mock-up was a toy truck. There is no evidence of record that the plaster mock-up was actually used as a toy, or was suitable for use as a toy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaster mock-up having failed to correspond to the description of the goods, Toys did not use the mark in commerce in association with the goods. Its application was therefore void.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">The decision of the board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">BALDWIN, J., concurs in result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1158-11\">. The application also alleges use \u201cby labels affixed to the goods.\u201d Admitting that no labels were used, Toys offered before the board to delete that phrase by amendment. The board did not act on the amendment, and it is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1158-19\">. We do not reach the issue whether the promotion sheets were associated displays within the meaning of \u00a7 45. Nor do we reach McDonald\u2019s allegation that Toys was guilty of fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office, which the board did not mention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1159-17\">. On appeal, Toys says the plaster mock-ups were \u201cworking models.\u201d The record does not support that assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1159-18\">. Toys could have simply filed a new application. All that it could have obtained on this appeal was an April, 1976 filing date. McDonald\u2019s priority of use was unquestioned. Toys\u2019 persistence in pursuing the issue here constitutes a waste of judicial resources.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
