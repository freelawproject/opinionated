We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">After a thorough consideration of the record, briefs and oral argument, we find no reversible error in the decision and opinion of Judge Landis and adopt it as our own with the following additional comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The appellant\u2019s contention that motorized wheelchairs are encompassed within the definition of furniture set forth in TSUS Schedule 7, Part 4, Subpart A, headnote 1<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> must fail because the testimony in the record establishes that motorized wheelchairs serve as a means of mobility for individuals with upper and lower body disabilities. Mr. Burrer, a Government witness and himself a user of a motorized wheelchair, testified that he uses his motorized wheelchair as a vehicle for getting from one point to another. Further, no evidence presented established use of a motorized wheelchair solely as an article of furniture to the exclusion of its primary, mobility function.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-22\">The appellant\u2019s alternative argument that the merchandise should be classified as furniture for hospital or medical use fails for similar reasons. The fact that motorized wheelchairs are commonly marketed by medical and hospital supply firms is not evidence that the wheelchairs are furniture since such enterprises undoubtedly sell innumerable articles that are not furniture. Similarly, it does not follow that motorized wheelchairs must be furniture for medical or hospital use simply because certain agencies administratively require physician approval before an individual can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>be issued a motorized wheelchair at government expense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Finally, the testimony that motorized wheelchairs are frequently transported between locations of use instead of being driven under their own power does not preclude their classification as motor vehicles since other motor vehicles, e. g., snowmobiles, dune buggies, golf carts, race cars, etc., are likewise transported to the environments for which they are designed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The judgment is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\">.
