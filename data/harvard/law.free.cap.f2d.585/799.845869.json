Stewart was sentenced to serve fifteen years for violating count one and an additional five years for violating count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">For the reasons stated in <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>579 F.2d 356, 357 (5 Cir. 1978), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>Sept. 25, 1978, we vacate the sentence assessed under count two.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Simpson v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978). However, we affirm the conviction as to count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-19\">Stewart argues that a statement he made following his arrest was improperly admitted into evidence and the evidence against him at trial was insufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-20\">At Stewart\u2019s trial, the government informed the court that it would call as a witness an F. B. I. agent who would testify that Stewart made a statement after arrest and during interrogation. Thereafter, the court held a separate hearing pursuant to <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964) to determine whether Stewart\u2019s statement was made voluntarily. At this hearing it was revealed that Stewart had been fully informed of his rights, had read his rights aloud in a coherent fashion, and had expressed a willingness to discuss the bank robbery. Stewart, however, refused to sign an acknowledgement form. Stewart now suggests that his refus-. al to sign the acknowledgement dispositively demonstrates that his statement was not voluntary. We have repeatedly rejected the argument that a refusal to sign a waiver form precludes subsequent admission of a statement on the grounds that the statement was not voluntarily made or that the defendant had not effectively waived his right against self-incrimination. <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>483 F.2d 957 (5 Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. McDaniel, </em>463 F.2d 129 (5 Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Devall, </em>462 F.2d 137 (5 Cir. 1972); <em>Hodge v. United States, </em>392 F.2d 552 (5 Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Next, Stewart argues that the evidence against him is insufficient to support his conviction. The lion\u2019s share of the evidence against Stewart was given by Brenda Jackson<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> who testified that she participated in the robbery of the Citizen\u2019s Bank along with Stewart and Roach.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">Stewart suggests that since Brenda Jackson has a history of psychiatric problems and drug abuse and that she testified only to avoid incarceration for her part in the bank robbery, her testimony is unworthy of belief. Stewart confuses our mission as an appellate court and the appropriate role of the jury. Choices of credibility are made by the jury and with the jury the matter rests. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>576 F.2d 46 (5 Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">We therefore conclude that Stewart was properly convicted as to count one. However, his conviction under count two is vacated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">AFFIRMED in part and VACATED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-13\">. <em>See United States v. Stewart, </em>573 F.2d 84 (5 Cir. 1978), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 99 S.Ct. 140, 58 L.Ed.2d 144; <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>579 F.2d 356 (5 Cir. 1978), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>Sept. 25, 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b890-16\">. Roach\u2019s appeal is being separately considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b890-17\">. The government suggests that <em>Simpson v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978), is applicable only when a defendant is sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d) to a term in excess of twenty years. While the government\u2019s argument is not implausible, we read the rule in <em>Simpson </em>to be that \u201cin a prosecution growing out of a single transaction of bank robbery with firearms, a defendant may not be sentenced under both Section 2113(d) and Section 924(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 910. We think this rule should be applied irrespective of any sentence actually imposed. <em>See United States v. Nelson, </em>574 F.2d 277, 280 (5 Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b891-5\">. Miss Jackson also testified against Stewart in <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>579 F.2d 356, 359 (5 Cir. 1978), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>Sept. 25, 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b891-6\">. The government argues that since the district court obviously felt that a twenty year sentence was appropriate for the defendant\u2019s armed bank robbery, we should allow the district court to re-sentence Stewart to a greater term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d) than the term originally imposed. We decline this invitation. To allow this procedure would allow the government to do indirectly what the Supreme Court has held that it cannot do directly. Moreover, such a procedure would require an inquiry into the mental processes of the trial judge that we are not prepared to make.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
