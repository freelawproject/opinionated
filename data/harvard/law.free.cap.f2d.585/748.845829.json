Wainwright, </em>582 F.2d 348 (5th Cir. 1978). Our earlier disposition was, but for a contention of petitioner foreclosed by <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), a remand to the district court for a determination whether state remedies had been exhausted as to his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-23\">We conclude that <em>Galtieri </em>has little if any bearing on this case. It deals with petitions containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims. Here there is doubt whether <em>any </em>of petitioner\u2019s claims have been exhausted. Nevertheless we conclude, exhaustion being a matter of comity and not jurisdiction, that we should reach the merits of petitioner\u2019s remaining claims. The state does not raise exhaustion, and this matter has been in our courts for almost three years \u2014 long enough. We have therefore considered these claims, all denied by our district court on their merits. As to each, we conclude that the court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
