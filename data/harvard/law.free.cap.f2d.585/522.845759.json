SKELLY WRIGHT, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b614-31\">In these consolidated cases<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we are called upon to review a final report and order of the Interstate Commerce Commission declining to remove alleged unlawful rates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>from the freight rate structures for recyclable and virgin resource materials transported by the nation\u2019s railroads. The order under review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> dissented from by three commissioners<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and challenged here by both representatives of recycling industries<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the United States,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> reflects the agency\u2019s efforts to comply with Section 204 of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This provision directed the Commission to conduct an expedited investigation into the lawfulness of the rate structures and to order removal of all rates not shown by the railroads to be just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We find that the challenged order does not represent a reasoned compliance with the mandate expressed by Congress in Section 204. We therefore vacate the order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The significance and purpose of the investigation required by Section 204 cannot be understood apart from the Commission\u2019s past experience with ratemaking on recyclable materials. That experience occurred largely in the context of general revenue proceedings, in which the Commission\u2019s main task involved determination of the appropriate revenue levels and needs of the railroads, rather than the lawfulness of the rates on these materials. It is to the controversial history<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of those proceedings that we turn first in placing the investigation under review, and the Commission\u2019s approach and findings therein, in proper perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-18\">Under the Interstate Commerce Act<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the initiative for ratemaking is vested in the railroads, subject to approval by the Commission in an appropriate proceeding. One method by which the railroads may initiate a rate increase is by filing a group tariff in which all or substantially all of the nation\u2019s railroads propose an across-the-board percentage increase in rates. In these so-called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>general revenue proceedings the Commission may either find the proposed increase just and reasonable after taking evidence related to the general need for increased revenues,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or \u201capprove\u201d the increase by declining to declare it unlawful following an investigation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The characteristic feature of these proceedings is that the Commission focuses only on the need of the carriers for increased revenues, not on whether any particular application of the increase is just, reasonable, or nondiscriminatory. Nevertheless, the effect of Commission approval of a general increase is to shift the burden of proof from the carriers favoring the increase to complainants later challenging it.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Once the general increase has been approved, particular applications of the increase may then be challenged in subsequent proceedings under the Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Pursuant to this scheme the Commission approved, over the past decade, a series of annual upward adjustments in rates applicable to recyclable materials.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Appearing in proceedings to oppose the proposed increases, shippers and representatives of recycling industries contended that the proposed rates and underlying rate structures on recyclable products were unreasonably high and discriminatory when compared with the lower rates and rate structures traditionally prevailing on virgin resource materials. They also maintained that application of the proposed increases to recyclables would adversely affect the environment by discouraging industrial use of recycled products, thereby contributing to depletion of the nation\u2019s virgin resources. In the limited context afforded by general revenue proceedings, and subject to the aforementioned rules governing complainants\u2019 burden of proof, the Commission invariably concluded that complainants had neither met their burden of refuting the railroads\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>submission of needed revenues, nor otherwise demonstrated that demand for recyclables would be unlawfully reduced as a result of the proposed increase.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Numerous environmental impact statements and threshold assessment surveys were also prepared,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> concluding that increases in freight rates would have either no effect or a negligible one on industrial use of recycled products.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Throughout this period the Commission steadfastly refused to conduct a broad investigation into the lawfulness of the underlying rate structures on recyclable products. Apparently of the view that such an investigation was unnecessary in light of the findings reached in its general revenue proceedings, the Commission repeatedly declined requests by representatives of the recycling industry to undertake such an investigation,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, indeed, vigorously opposed legislation under consideration by Congress that would have required nothing less.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Prodded by increasing litigation,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>however, the Commission, on December 12, 1973, finally instituted an investigation<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> into the lawfulness of the rate structures for movements of scrap iron and steel, one of the recyclable materials herein involved. The Commission\u2019s final report, issued on February 4, 1976, confirmed generally its previous findings with respect to scrap iron and steel.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Citing the relative demand ine-lasticity of scrap iron and steel to freight rates, and finding that the relationship between scrap iron and iron ore in the steel-making process is complementary and not competitive,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the report concluded that the rate structures were reasonable and nondiscriminatory. The environmental impact statement prepared for this proceeding also concluded that these rate structures did not have a significant impact on the environment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">On February 5, 1976 Congress enacted the Regulatory Reform Act, including within it Section 204. This section, in addition to directing the Commission to investigate the rail rate structures for \u201crecyclable materials\u201d and for \u201ccompeting virgin natural resource materials,\u201d as defined therein,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> expressly reversed, for the purpose of the investigation, the rules normally governing complainants\u2019 burden of proof. It directed the Commission to determine, after a \u201cpublic hearing during which the burden of proof shall be on\u201d the railroads, whether the \u201crate structure^], as affected by rate increases applicable to the transportation of such competing materials, is just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Section 204 further instructed the Commission to order removal of all unreasonableness or unjust discrimination from such rate structures.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The remaining provisions of the statute required the Commission to comply fully with the requirements of NEPA,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and directed the Environmental Protection Agency<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and the Department of Transportation<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> to participate and assist the Commission in carrying out the required investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Responding to this mandate, the Commission instituted the proceeding under review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>on February 25,1976. By order it designated recyclable and virgin resource materials for inclusion within its investigation and instructed the railroads, in accordance with the burden of proof imposed upon them by Section 204, to submit evidence with respect to the costs and revenues derived from their movements of the listed materials.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It also, by order, incorporated into the record the findings and conclusions of its previous investigation in <em>Ex Parte </em>No. 270.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> After public hearings and submission of verified statements from interested parties, the Commission issued its final report and order, accompanied by draft and final environmental impact statements, on February 1, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The evidence submitted by the railroads was repeatedly criticized by the federal agencies participating in the investigation,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and by the Commission itself in its final report.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It did indicate, however, that the rates for movements of the listed recyclable materials were significantly higher than those for their virgin resource material counterparts.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In many instances the rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>roads\u2019 evidence revealed that the rates on recyclables were in excess of the national average,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> while corresponding rates on virgin materials were below compensatory levels.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Commission refused to conclude that the rate structures were unlawful based solely on the evidence of wide rate disparities. Instead, it determined that it would apply traditional rate-making criteria to determine the lawfulness of the rate structures on a product-by-product basis.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Applying such criteria, it concluded that the rate structures on practically all of the recyclable materials were reasonable and that none of the rate structures were discriminatory. The articulated bases for these determinations varied slightly according to the product involved. Referring to the relative demand inelasticities of recyclable materials to freight rates, as shown by freight commodity statistics submitted by the railroads<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and demand' elasticity studies<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> employed in the environmental impact statement, the Commission found that the recent rate increases did not result in a decreased volume in the amount of recyclable traffic moved by the railroads. The Commission further found that several of the recyclable materials did not in fact compete with their virgin material counterparts for transportation purposes, and that shippers of recyclables were not competitively injured by current rate disparities. Based on these findings, supported by the conclusions of the accompanying environmental impact statement,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> the Commission issued the final order here under review, declining, with few exceptions,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> to order any reductions in the applicable rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Three Commissioners dissented from the majority\u2019s report, arguing that the Commission did not comply with its mandate under Section 204.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> According to the dissenting Commissioners, the majority unlawfully relieved the railroads of their burden of proof under Section 204 by failing to require the railroads to justify the rate structures based on the transportation characteristics of the products involved. Advancing similar as well as other related challenges to the Commission\u2019s order<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> petitioners thereupon filed these petitions for review, in which the United States has joined in urging that the order be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Much of the controversy throughout this proceeding has centered on the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>interpretation to be given to the Commission\u2019s mandate under Section 204. We do not believe the interpretative issue is nearly as difficult as the array of conflicting and exceedingly elaborate positions presented by the parties would suggest.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Rather, we believe the language, and particularly the legislative history and background, of Section 204 make easily discernible the Commission\u2019s mandate in this investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Section 204 was the result of several years of congressional study<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and consideration of the problems of the recycling industry as a whole and the freight rates applied to recyclable products in particular. Informed of the limited amount of recycling occurring throughout the nation, and concerned with what it regarded as a regulatory barrier to attainment of national environmental and agency goals associated with promotion of industrial recycling,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Congress responded initially by including Section 603 within the Regional Rail Reorganization Act.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> This section directed the Commission to \u201cadopt appropriate rules\u201d to \u201celiminate discrimination against the shipment of recyclable materials in rate structures and in other Commission practices where such discrimination exists.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> As has been interpreted elsewhere, Section 603</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>was a clear \u201clegislative recognition of discrimination in the existing railroad rate structures and a legislative direction to the commission to eliminate it.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0hW\">The Commission virtually ignored the statutory message contained in Section 603. Rather than instituting a broad investigation into the lawfulness of the rate structures, the Commission responded by promulgating redundant rules governing procedures for filing a complaint with the agency.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Moreover, the Commission thereafter approved another series of general rate increases applicable to recyclables,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> thereby possibly exacerbating the discrimination Congress believed was firmly imbedded in the rate structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The Commission\u2019s persistent refusal to investigate the rate structures, combined with its continued approval of rate increases applicable to recyclables, led representatives of the recycling industries to support a number of bills subsequently introduced in Congress.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Like Section 603, these bills all revealed Congress\u2019 dissatisfaction with the approach displayed by the Commission in its general revenue proceedings, and were aimed at eliminating rate structures which in Congress\u2019 view impeded development of increased recycling. In addition to explicitly requiring the Commission to investigate the rate structures, they would have compelled the Commission to adopt a presumption of competition between recyclable and virgin materials for the purpose of its investigation,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> and to establish recyclable rates at the lowest lawful levels compatible with maintenance of adequate transportation service.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Although some of these bills were vigorously opposed by the Commission and eventually died in committee, Section 204 was finally enacted by Congress as that section emerged from the bills comprising the Regulatory Reform Act.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Section 204, we believe, did not differ materially by either its terms or its underlying purpose from the bills considered and rejected by Congress. Just as those bills did not purport to change or modify substantive standards relating to the lawfulness of rates,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> neither did Section 204. Congress used familiar language, having a long-settled meaning in transportation law, in proscribing \u201cunreasonableness\u201d and \u201cunjust discrimination\u201d in rate structures. It is apparent from the use of such established terms that Congress deemed traditional transportation policy criteria adequate pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>tection against rate structures which discouraged industrial use of recycled products.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">At the same time, however, Section 204, like previous bills, was intended to ensure proper application by the Commission of established statutory standards. Thus, by reversing the rules governing complainants\u2019 burden of proof, Section 204 both precluded the Commission from adopting the approach taken in its general revenue proceedings, whereby it approved disparate rate structures based on the railroads\u2019 revenue needs, and required the railroads to justify fully the rate structures involved under established ratemaking standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In the order under review<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and before this court<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> the Commission has urged that in applying traditional standards in this investigation it was unnecessary to require the railroads to adduce proof on all factors related to transportation of commodities, and that instead it was incumbent on the recycling industry to demonstrate by way of rebuttal those factors militating against the lawfulness of the rate structures. We believe the Commission\u2019s position reveals a serious misapprehension of the significance of the statutory reversal of the burden of proof in Section 204. As previously noted<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> the burden-shifting procedure employed by the Commission in its general revenue proceedings is premised on the notion that once the railroads have demonstrated a need for additional revenues, most individual increases within the approved limit will be found just and lawful. The Commission approved the rate increases on recyclables subject to this procedure and its concomitant assumption in its general revenue proceedings. By reversing the burden of proof in this proceeding, however, Congress accomplished more than a mere change in the procedural format for presentation of evidence, suggested by the Commission. Specifically, it erected an evidentiary presumption against the lawfulness of the rate structures, thereby preventing the Commission from assuming, or otherwise deferring to, asserted revenue needs of the railroads in determining the lawfulness of the rates. Unlike general revenue proceedings, this investigation was to proceed from the premise that disparate rate structures were not justified by the revenue needs of the railroads, and were therefore only to be upheld where actually warranted after consideration of all of the transportation characteristics, including the competitive relationships and costs, of the materials involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">This theme \u2014 that Congress firmly opposed disparate rates maintained by the Commission to protect the railroads\u2019 general revenue needs without complete consideration of the transportation characteristics of these products \u2014 is clearly revealed by both of the relevant portions of the legislative history of Section 204, the Senate Commerce Committee Report<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> and the remarks made on the floor of the Senate.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Thus, in view of the provisions of Section 204, its legislative history, and the background of congressional concern surrounding its enactment, we have no doubt that the Commission\u2019s mandate in this investigation was to identify and remove disparities in the rate structures based on an in-depth examination of the transportation characteristics involved. The Commission, in the view of the proponents of Section 204, had erected barriers to industrial recycling by approving rate increases under the limited criteria applied in its general revenue proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Under Section 204 it was up to the Commission to eliminate these barriers, after a complete investigation of the rate structures in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Moreover, we reject the view<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> that Congress in some manner defeated the purpose of this investigation by its inclusion of Section 204 within the framework of the Regulatory Reform Act. As we have recently observed, this Act was not only a legislative enactment designed \u201cto restore the financial stability of our railway system and promote its revitalization,\u201d but was also an expression of congressional concern \u201cthat the interests of the railroads be balanced with the needs of shippers and the public.\u201d <footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Section 204, dealing with an area of importance to the nation\u2019s environment, struck the balance Congress deemed appropriate after its consideration of the interests involved. In so doing Congress tilted the scales against existing rate structures fostered by the Commission in its general revenue proceedings. It was not for the Commission to disagree with this legislative judgment by giving greater weight to concerns for railroad profitability than to the environmental and energy goals underlying the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">We agree with the dissenting Commissioners that on this record the Commission\u2019s approval of the rate structures was not consistent with its mandate. The challenged order does not meaningfully address the focal question presented by its investigation, namely whether the substantial rate disparities between recyclable and virgin products are justified, in whole or in part, by the transportation characteristics of the products involved. The Commission, by finessing this and other questions,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> effectively relieved the railroads of their burden of proof under Section 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">Even reviewing the Commission\u2019s order on its own terms, we also find that several of its underlying findings and conclusions are inadequately supported and arbitrary. Applying a standard of competition which was both unduly narrow and inconsistent with its Section 204 mandate, the Commission again found that recyclable and virgin products do not compete for transportation purposes. These findings, based more on the Commission\u2019s perceptions of industry structures than on articulated determinations with respect to rate structures, neither comport with the Commission\u2019s mandate nor rationally flow from the record before us. Since the Commission was required in this proceeding to supply a reasoned decision with respect to two issues\u2014 whether the rate structures were shown to be reasonable and whether they were shown to be not unjustly discriminatory\u2014 we shall discuss the Commission\u2019s determinations on each of these aspects separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>A. <em>Reasonableness Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The Commission determined that in ascertaining the reasonableness of the rate structures it would not consider the rates on recyclables to be unreasonable unless they had resulted in a diminished volume of traffic during past years, or unless it appeared that recyclable materials could not absorb current rates.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> It applied no other standard of reasonableness<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and offered no explanation for its decision to focus exclusively on these criteria. Moreover, despite evidence of unusually high rate structures, the Commission refused to articulate a standard of maximum reasonableness for recycled products, stressing instead the need to consider in all instances the \u201cpublic interest in a viable and efficient railroad industry\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> and \u201cthe maintenance of adequate revenue levels for the railroads\u201d <footnotemark>68</footnotemark> in determining the reasonableness of the rate structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">As we have stated, the Commission was clearly authorized by Section 204 to apply traditional ratemaking criteria in this investigation. And we recognize that among such criteria the Commission normally is entitled to consider as one factor the effect of rates in terms of the volume of traffic moved. In view of the Commission\u2019s mandate in this proceeding and the evidence before it, however, we do not believe its decision to focus exclusively on this factor constituted an application of \u201csatisfactory\u201d <footnotemark>69</footnotemark> or proper and legal standards.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">The most salient theme that stands out in the legislative history of Section 204 is that Congress did not regard the existing rates on recyclables to be lawful <em>solely </em>because these materials could withstand rate increases and continue to move by rail. Congress, as we have seen, was concerned with rate barriers to <em>increased </em>levels of recycling, as well as with the maintenance of existing ones. It believed, based on the data and information before it, that removal of unreasonableness (and discrimination) in rate structures would serve to promote an increase in the amount of industrial recycling, consistent with its environmental and energy goals. By applying, as an exclusive legal standard in this investigation, one which was designed to insure only maintenance of the <em>status quo </em>in the volume of recyclable traffic, and not one capable of measuring the eff\u00e9ct of rate structures in terms of promotion of industrial recycling, the Commission thwarted the purpose of this investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">It is true that the freight commodity statistics submitted by the railroads and the elasticity studies relied upon by the Commission indicated that the volume of traffic for most recyclables did not decrease in response to previous rate increases. Such evidence, while probative, was hardly conclusive on the question whether the rate structures were impeding development of <em>increased </em>recycling.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The probative value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>of both types of evidence, moreover, rests entirely on their shared assumption that the rate structures themselves are not unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The clear purpose of this investigation, however, was to test the validity of this underlying assumption, one upon which the Commission has been operating for years, not summarily to adopt it. Neither the standard applied by the Commission nor the evidence before it, therefore, was adequate to enable it to conclude, consistent with its mandate, that these rate structures were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Other deficiencies in the evidence relied upon by the Commission also lead us to conclude that its determinations on these issues are inadequately supported and arbitrary. As the Commission itself acknowledged,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> a great void exists in this record due to the absence of any evidence concerning the effect of the rate structures on intermodal competition. Given the substantial disparities in the rates applicable to these products, such evidence may well have been material in determining the reasonableness of the rate structures. It may be, for example, that greater equality in the rates would result in diversion of traffic for some or all of these products to competing modes. We need not consider the question whether evidence showing that lower rates on recyclables or higher rates on virgin products would endanger the railroads\u2019 ability to carry the traffic might have been sufficient to permit the Commission to approve these rate structures, for we believe the question is one that required an initial determination by the Commission. On the present record, however, there is no basis to enable either this court or the Commission to make an informed determination on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Beyond this inadequacy in the record, we note that the heavy, and often impressionistic, weight<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> given by the Commission to the elasticity studies in this proceeding was plainly unwarranted. The Commission itself admitted the inherent limitation of such studies when used to determine the lawfulness of rate structures<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Moreover, its findings in a recent report prepared pursuant to Section 202 of the Regulatory Reform Act<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> to the effect that practically all commodities are demand inelastic to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>freight rate structures indicate that such studies may have no special significance with respect to the rate structures on recyclable products. We need not, and thus do not, question the validity of the Commission\u2019s elasticity studies <footnotemark>77</footnotemark> in order to observe that its approval of the rate structures, based in several instances solely on the results of these studies, was arbitrary in light of their admitted limitations and the findings of this report.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Finally, we stress that the Commission was not permitted in this investigation to maintain high rates on reeyclables based on general assertions by the railroads concerning the profitability of recyclable traffic and their needs for additional revenues. While we agree with the Commission that it was not required by Section 204 to establish a maximum reasonableness standard applicable to all recycled products, we have no doubt that it was prohibited from approving rate structures unless they were shown to be justified by the transportation characteristics of the particular products. To us, this means that the Commission was compelled by Section 204 to scrutinize the railroads\u2019 cost justifications for current rate levels, and that it was insufficient to conclude that the rates were reasonable merely because these levels were profitable for the railroads or because recyclable traffic would continue to move by rail at the railroads\u2019 current revenue levels. It may be that, having examined fully the transportation characteristics of the products involved, the Commission might have determined to fix a maximum reasonableness standard for recycled products. And in measuring the appropriate standard the Commission might even have allowed for a reasonable margin of profitability under the rate structures. It is not for us to determine at this stage whether this course, if pursued, would have been proper, or precisely how a maximum reasonableness standard should be measured<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> since, owing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the Commission\u2019s failure to require proof on the transportation characteristics of these products, there is no basis in the record for these determinations. We leave these and the other questions alluded to for resolution by the Commission upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">B. <em>Discrimination Issues </em>The Commission stated that in determining whether the rate structures were unjustly discriminatory it would be guided by its \u201ctraditional standards\u201d under Section 3(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act,<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> and would therefore conduct a four-step analysis. The four steps listed by the Commission were: (1) whether disparities exist between the ratios for recyclable and virgin materials; (2) whether \u2022 there is \u201cin fact\u201d competition between these materials; (3) whether shippers of recyclables are being injured by the rate disparities; and (4) whether rate disparities are justified by differences in the transportation characteristics of the materials involved.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Applying these standards, it concluded that most of the recyclable materials did not in fact compete with their virgin material counterparts, and that shippers of all of the recyclable materials were not competitively injured by existing rate structures. As it had in addressing the issue of the reasonableness of the rate structures, the Commission again avoided an examination of the transportation characteristics of the various products, in this instance by concluding its analysis at the third of these criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">We agree with the Commission\u2019s initial determination to consider the discrimination issues within the framework of the broad prohibitions provided by Section 3(1).<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Moreover, we concur in the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>sion\u2019s view that resolution of the discrimination issues in this proceeding required it to consider carefully the competitive relationships between the materials involved. We hold, however, that on this record the Commission\u2019s findings of no competition in fact, and no actual competitive injury, were inconsistent with its mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Turning first to the Commission\u2019s findings of no competition, we note that an obvious concern of Congress in enacting Section 204 was to ensure that the Commission take into account the full competitive relationships between recyclable and virgin commodities. In its general revenue proceedings the Commission had rejected challenges to rate increases, concluding consistently that recyclable and virgin products did not compete for transportation purposes because their competitive relationships were complementary. As in this proceeding, therefore, the Commission applied a standard of competition requiring a showing that recyclable products were substitutable for, rather than functionally equivalent with, virgin products in the manufacture of industrial products. In the view of some members of Congress this standard was unduly narrow and its application by the Commission had resulted in approval of freight rates which retarded rather than promoted industrial use of recycled products. The pertinent passages of the legislative history of Section 204<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> suggest further that these proponents believed application of this standard would frustrate the purpose of the investigation required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Although the competition standard employed by the Commission was thus an important area of congressional concern, it is evident from both the language of the statute and its remaining legislative history that it was not the main concern leading Congress to require this investigation. As we have previously stated, Congress\u2019 major concern was with removal of rate structures which impeded or discouraged development of industrial recycling. In light of this dominant purpose, and especially due to the absence of any statutory reference to the standard of competition to be applied, we are unable to conclude that Section 204 was a legislative directive to the Commission to make positive findings that these products compete for transportation purposes. Nor may we conclude that Congress meant to prescribe any particular standard of competition for application in this investigation. While, as indicated previously, some of the proponents of Section 204 believed that the Commission\u2019s investigation should proceed with a presumptive standard of competition based on the functional equivalency of the products in manufacturing processes, Section 204, by its terms, did not enact such a standard.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>At the same time, giving effect to the specific mandate of Section 204 \u2014 that the Commission order removal of unlawful rate structures found to discourage industrial recycling after a broad investigation \u2014 we believe that the Commission was not entitled to apply a competition standard so narrow in scope as to obviate the statutory purpose of its investigation. The lawfulness of the rate structures was not to be governed by the fact that recyclable products had been unable to attain actual competitive status with virgin products under existing rates. Instead, we believe that to warrant dispositive findings of no competition the Commission was required to find that the various products were neither actually nor potentially competitive for transportation purposes. The Commission was therefore required to consider the potential under the rate structures for competitive relationships between recyclable and virgin products, and for competitive injury to shippers. This standard, we might add, not only comports with the Commission\u2019s mandate, but is fully consistent with competition standards traditionally applied by the Commission in other discrimination cases.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">When measured against this standard, the Commission\u2019s findings of no competition cannot be sustained. The Commission uniformly required a showing of competition \u201cin fact\u201d to establish discrimination, and concluded in each instance that the recyclable and virgin material counterparts were noncompetitive because they were not actually substitutable in manufacturing processes.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> It made no findings, and was offered no evidence by the railroads, to the effect that the recyclable materials were not potentially competitive in manufacturing processes, in terms of either their sub-stitutability or their functional equivalency. As we have indicated, it was patently insufficient for the Commission to approve rate structures on recyclables without consideration of such evidence, for to do so was to contravene its mandate in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">It follows from our discussion that the Commission\u2019s alternative findings of no competitive injury also may not be sustained. Based on the same evidence relied upon in determining the reasonableness of the rate structures,<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> the Commission invariably concluded that shippers of recyclables had not suffered actual injury as a result of disparate rate treatment. That evidence, as we have seen, does not support a finding that the rate structures do not present a potential for competitive harm to shippers of recyclables. Instead, it only reflects the responsiveness of the relatively small amount of recyclables shipped to the recent rate increases approved by the Commission. It does not measure the effects of the rate structures on recyclable traffic. Nor does it account for increases in recyclable traffic that may have occurred absent the effects of the rate structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Unable to discern from this record any support for the Commission\u2019s findings on the discrimination issues, we set them aside, leaving for the Commission\u2019s determination such questions as may be involved in the assessment of the potential competition and competitive injury presented by these rate structures.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Recognizing the breadth of the competition standard the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>will be required to apply, however, we note that only extraordinary circumstances, not disclosed by this record, will warrant another effort by the Commission which omits consideration, under a Section 3(1) analysis, of the issue whether disparities in the rate structures are justified by differences in the transportation characteristics of these products.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Before concluding, we stress that we are unimpressed with the Commission\u2019s attempt to excuse its failure to comply with its mandate by repeated reference to the expedited nature of this investigation. The Commission has for a long time promised, and was finally compelled by Section 204, to resolve the longstanding controversy related to these rate structures. In light of the Commission\u2019s general familiarity with the issues involved, and the fact that a significant portion of the extensive record compiled consists of incorporated matter predating its investigation, the proffered excuse is untenable. This is not a case where an agency\u2019s determinations are or should be accorded an unusual degree of deference by a reviewing court because of the novelty of the issues and the time constraints within which the agency must operate.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">On the other hand, although we disagree with the Commission\u2019s actions on this record, we also emphasize that our discussion of the standards employed by the Commission to determine the lawfulness of these rate structures, and of the evidence submitted by the railroads, is not intended to set forth our view of the lawfulness of any of the rate structures involved. They may be lawful, or they may not. In either event, it was for the Commission to decide initially based on an adequately supported consideration of the transportation characteristics of the products consistent with its mandate. We have concluded only that the Commission has not done so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AXN\">Nor, by our disposition, do we mean to intimate any view on the several contentions advanced relating to the measures the Commission should adopt in proscribing either maximum rates on recyclables or maximum rate disparities between recyclable and virgin products. All of these questions we leave to the informed judgment of the Commission, after full consideration of the railroads\u2019 justifications for disparities in the rate structures and the effect of the rate structures in terms of their actual and potential impact on the use of recycled products.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">With these closing admonitions, we conclude that the Commission has not reasonably adhered to its mandate in this proceeding. Accordingly, we vacate the order under review in Nos. 77-1187 and 77-1292 in its entirety, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We also dismiss the petition for review in No. 77-1193<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">Section 204 of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, P.L. 94-210, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 793 note, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">INVESTIGATION OF DISCRIMINATORY FREIGHT RATES FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF RECYCLABLE OR RECYCLED MATERIALS</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">Sec. 204.

Together these proceedings yielded rate increases applicable to recyclable materials totalling approximately 70%. In addition to any economic and environmental impacts associated with the rate structures, it may be observed that percentage rate increases themselves, although facially neutral, may have independent impacts, since a rate increases a high rate by a larger absolute amount than it does a low rate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\">. <em>Id. A </em>review of these proceedings reveals findings by the Commission that rate increases on recyclables are reasonable in part because recyclable products are subject to relative demand inelasticities to freight rate increases. In economic theory, price and product demand elasticities serve to measure buyer response to increased product prices and shipper response to percentage changes in price. The Commission found in these proceedings that increases in transportation prices did not cause significant shifts in demand for recyclable products.

On the circumstances disclosed by the record, we agree. <em>Ex Parte </em>No. 270 was a nonadversary proceeding which, as the Commission acknowledged, was significantly different from the proceeding under review because of the requirement of \u00a7 204 that the railroads maintain the burden of proof.

Having acknowledged the differences between these proceedings, however, the Commission proceeded to treat the Coordinator\u2019s conclusions as creating a presumption that the rate structures were lawful. <em>See id. </em>at 75-80. While we believe it was appropriate for the Commission to consider the evidence developed in <em>Ex Parte </em>No. 270, it was clearly inappropriate for the Commission to accord presumptive weight to the findings of the Coordinator\u2019s report. That report was issued prior to the enactment of \u00a7 204 and was therefore superseded by it.

For the reasons discussed herein, we adopt neither of these views.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">. Congress did not announce its general environmental goals and its particular emphasis on promotion of the recycling industry solely by its enactment of \u00a7 204. NEPA, in requiring all federal agencies to determine and justify the effect of any major federal action upon the nation\u2019s environment, originally directed such agencies to promote the \u201cmaximum attainable recycling of depletable resources.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331 (1970). In 1970 Congress next enacted the National Materials Policy Act, Pub. L. No. 91-512, \u00a7\u00a7 201-206, reaffirming the national policy to conserve virgin resources and enhance recycling of those materials. This Act created the National Materials Policy Commission which, after three years of investigation, submitted a final report to Congress in June 1973 recommending that the \u201cFederal Government take the necessary steps to correct the existing freight rate differentials between secondary and primary materials.\u201d National Com\u2019n on Materials Policy, Final Report to Congress 4D-18 (1973). This report followed a similar report prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency, pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3251 <em>et seq. </em>(1965), which identified inequitable freight rates as a federal disincentive to maximum recycling. Environmental Protection Agency, Report to Congress on Resource Recovery (1973). Subsequently Congress enacted the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-319, requiring the Federal Energy Administration to conduct and submit to Congress a study of \u201calternative requirements, incentives or disincentives for increasing industrial recycling and resource recovery.\u201d Pub. L. No. 93-319, \u00a7 8(a)(2). The study ultimately prepared by the FEA concluded that the Commission\u2019s shipping rates and regulations were a regulatory restraint to industrial energy conservation. Specifically, the report found that \u201cshipping rates that discriminate against transport of recycled materials in favor of virgin materials are a significant barrier to increased recycling.\u201d Federal Energy Administration, Office of Conservation and Environment, Report to Congress: Energy Conservation Study 157 (1974). Finally, in 1976 Congress enacted the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901 <em>et seq., </em>creating the National Resource Conservation Committee to ensure that barriers to recycling and energy conservation are eliminated. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6982(j). Such legislation, based on years of study of the problems of the recycling industry, evinces an evolving congressional plan to conserve resources and to promote recycling of depletable materials. Section 204 must therefore be viewed as an integral part of this congressional design. <em>See also </em>text and notes at notes 60-61 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\">.

Petitioner NARI\u2019s supplemental brief at 5-6. We disagree. Where the Commission erred here is that it accorded virtually dispositive weight to evidence, having by its own admission limited significance to a determination of the issues presented, without fully considering other evidence directly relevant to those issues. The Commission is not prohibited from taking such evidence into account, provided it otherwise adheres to its mandate by examining traditional factors related to the transportation of commodities, and it articulates a rational basis for attributing significance to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"78\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">. Petitioner NARI devoted a substantial portion of its arguments to the contention that existing rate structures, when measured against guides applied in other rate situations, are unreasonable. In support of its position it relied on: (1) the Commission\u2019s 1972 Burden Study, Interstate Commerce Commission, Rail Revenue Contribution by Commodity and Territory for the Year 1972, Statement No. 153-72; (2) the Commission\u2019s recently promulgated market dominance regulations, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1109.1, 41 Fed.Reg. 44183 (1976); and (3) the Commission\u2019s recent decision in <em>San Antonio, Texas, Acting By and Through Its City Public Service Board v. Burlington Northern, Inc., </em>Docket No. 36180.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The essence of NARI\u2019s argument appears to be that the existing rate structures are unreasonable <em>per se </em>because they exceed standards announced in these proceedings by a wide margin. In its Burden Study, for example, the Commission found that the average cost-revenue ratio on national traffic was 131.8%. A large number of the ratios developed by the Commission in this proceeding exceeded this figure. <em>See </em>note 35 <em>supra. </em>Similarly, many of the ratios were higher than the 160% ratio announced in the Commission\u2019s market dominance regulations as creating a rebuttable presumption that a carrier possesses market dominance over the service rendered under a proposed rate. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1109.1(g)(2). Finally, although the Commission did not analyze cost evidence in this proceeding, it appears that the rate structures on many of the recyclable products would be invalid under the Commission\u2019s San <em>Antonio </em>decision, in which it prescribed rates approximating the cost levels of the service therein involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">The Commission contends that none of the standards suggested by NARI compel a finding of unreasonableness, or should be used to set a standard of maximum reasonableness, because they were not intended to establish the reasonableness of particular rates. Respondent\u2019s brief at 58-64. Moreover, the Commission asserts that the question of the reasonableness of the rate structures should not be dependent upon a cost standard, at whatever level such standard might be set. <em>Id. </em>at 58-59. Since costs alone have never been held to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>maximum reasonable rates, see, e. <em>g., General </em>Motors <em>Corp. </em>v. New <em>York Central R. Co., </em>311 ICC 622, 625, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>207 F.Supp. 641, 648 (E.D.Mich. 1962), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>324 F.2d 604 (6th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Great Northern R. Co., </em>293 ICC 341, 345 (1954); <em>Morrison-Knudson Co. v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., </em>308 ICC 205, 209 (1959), we agree that the Commission was neither required to limit its consideration to this criterion solely, nor compelled to establish a maximum standard of reasonableness based exclusively on cost-derived standards. Granting this much, however, does not lead us to conclude that the Commission was entitled, as it has, to ignore any consideration of costs. Section 204, as we have stated, required it to determine the lawfulness of the rate structures based on a complete investigation of the transportation characteristics involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Nor does our rejection of NARI\u2019s argument inevitably support the view that the Commission was not authorized in this investigation to establish a maximum standard of reasonableness. In this regard, we note that the market dominance regulations promulgated by the Commission under the Regulatory Reform Act were designed to assist it in focusing on areas where maximum rate regulation is needed in the public interest. It may be that during the course of an investigation conducted consistent with its mandate under \u00a7 204 the Commission would decide that some equivalent standard would serve a similar purpose concerning rates on recyclables.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"79\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">.

The Commission\u2019s initial position was that it \u201cshould not restrict\u201d itself to viewing its investigation under \u00a7 2 of the Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1970), which prohibits unjust discrimination between like kinds of traffic under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, but also should consider the prohibitions under \u00a7 3(1). Order at 71. To the extent that the Commission\u2019s subsequent application of \u00a7 3(1) standards may have reflected a view that it was not required to examine the transportation characteristics of these products, <em>see Id. </em>n.19a, this determination was inconsistent with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>mandate. We note, however, that according to its statement of the criteria applied under \u00a7 3(1), the Commission was required to consider whether differences in, the transportation characteristics justified disparities in ratios. <em>Id. </em>at 72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"82\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\">. Senator Tunney, the sponsor of the amendment to \u00a7 204 placing the burden of proof upon the railroads, stated that \u201cthe investigation must proceed with an articulation of a presumptive standard of competition. For the purpose of this investigation, the Commission should consider recyclable and virgin materials to be competing if they are functionally equivalent in the manufacturing stage.\u201d 121 Cong. Rec. 38451 (1975). In a similar vein, the Senate Commerce Committee Report stated: \u201c[T]he record * * * indicates that the Commission may not be taking into account the full competitive relationship * * *. A reexamination of that relationship will be necessary if this investigation is to achieve its goal.\u201d S. Rep. No. 94-499, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 51 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"83\">\n<p id=\"b629-11\">. To hold, as petitioners suggest, that the Commission was required by \u00a7 204 to find or assume that recyclable and virgin commodities compete would require us to give controlling weight to the remarks of Senator Tunney. We decline to do so not only because they are not supported by the language of \u00a7 204, but also because they were not adopted in the Senate Commerce Committee Report, which indicated instead that the Commission should \u201creexamine\u201d competitive relationships consistent with the investigation\u2019s purpose of removing unlawful impediments to the movement of recycled materials. <em>See </em>note 82 <em>supra.

The date of the legislation is February 5, 1976, and Section 204 provides that the investigation be concluded within one year of that date. The investigation culminating in the orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>under review here met this timetable, but on August 2, 1978 we vacated the orders of the Commission and remanded the case to the Commission.
