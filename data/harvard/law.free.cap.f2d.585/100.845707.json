Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b191-5\">AINSWORTH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Edgar P. Buchanan was convicted of participating in a conspiracy to steal United States Treasury checks from the mail and then cash them under forged endorsements in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United States), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495 (forgery relating to United States Treasury checks), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708 (possession of stolen mail). On appeal, Buchanan contends that the prosecuting attorney failed to comply with Rule 16(a)(1)(C), Fed.R. Crim.P., by failing to turn over certain specimens of his handwriting prior to trial and that such failure was prejudicial to his substantial rights. He also contends that the trial judge improperly commented on the evidence in a supplemental charge to the jury and thereby denied him a fair trial. We find both contentions meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Buchanan\u2019s Rule 16 contention relates to the Government\u2019s admitted failure to turn over to defense counsel certain specimens of the defendant\u2019s handwriting obtained by government investigators prior to trial. In a written report and in testimony at Buchanan\u2019s trial, a handwriting analyst produced by the Government stated unequivocally that the handwriting of the signatures on two stolen checks was the same as the handwriting of the specimens obtained from Buchanan. Defense counsel repeatedly objected to any reference to the handwriting specimens and to their introduction into evidence on the ground that the Government failed to turn them over to him in advance of the trial as required by Rule 16. Buchanan\u2019s counsel contended that he needed the specimens of his client\u2019s handwriting in order to utilize the testimony of a handwriting analyst of his own choosing to contradict the testimony of the Government\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Rule 16 requires the Government, upon request of the defendant and without the necessity of a court order, to furnish to the defendant or to permit him to inspect and copy or photograph certain statements made by the defendant, 16(a)(1)(A), the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, 16(a)(1)(B), certain documents and tangible objects, 16(a)(1)(C), and reports of certain examinations or tests, 16(a)(1)(D). In this case, the handwriting specimens are properly characterized as \u201ctangible objects\u201d subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to that section, Buchanan\u2019s counsel requested the Government \u201c[t]o produce any books, papers, documents, photographs or tangible objects which the prosecution intends to use against the defendant or which were obtained from or belong to the defendant.\u201d In response to that request, and to a further request for any reports of experts, the Government turned over to defense counsel, <em>inter alia, </em>a copy of the report of its handwriting analyst and photocopies of the stolen checks showing the forged signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">We conclude that, by furnishing defense counsel a copy of the handwriting analyst\u2019s report, which revealed the existence of the handwriting specimens, and by pointedly making himself available for further inquiry, the prosecuting attorney effectively \u201cproduce[d]\u201d the specimens and \u201cpermitted] the defendant to inspect and copy\u201d them within the meaning of the defendant\u2019s disclosure request and Rule 16(a)(1)(C). Thus, in the absence of a specific demand for the specimens themselves, the failure to furnish them did not constitute a failure to comply with Rule 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Our holding conforms to our prior decision in <em>United States v. O\u2019Shea, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 450 F.2d 298. In that case we found no Rule 16 violation when, in response to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>court order to provide \u201cresults and reports of scientific tests\u201d and \u201cdocuments [and] tangible objects . . . which may be introduced into evidence,\u201d the Government provided the written report of a fingerprint expert without also providing photocopies of palm prints found on a note given by a hold-up man to a bank teller. In finding no Rule 16 violation in <em>O\u2019Shea, </em>this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">It is clear from this record that appellant\u2019s counsel, even after the existence of the palm prints was made known to him, neither requested that the Government make these items available nor asked the Court to order the Government to produce them. . . . Under Rule 16, the word \u201cdisclosure\u201d encompasses the steps taken by the Government in this case. Defense counsel was made aware of the items of physical and documentary evidence which were or would be in the possession of the Government. Neither Rule 16 nor the pre-trial order requires more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 300. <em>O\u2019Shea </em>is therefore dispositive of the Rule 16 issue posed here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, if Rule 16 does not obligate the Government to provide, without a specific request, copies of fingerprints obtained at the scene of the crime, to which the defense otherwise has no access, it does not require the provision of handwriting specimens which could easily have been duplicated at any time by the defendant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Even if the Government technically failed to comply with Rule 16, Buchanan would still merit no relief from this court, since i,t is well established that an error by the trial court in the administration of the discovery rules is not reversible absent a showing that the error was prejudicial to the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>United States v. Valdes, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 545 F.2d 957; <em>United States v. Arcentales, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 532 F.2d 1046; <em>United States v. Saitta, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 443 F.2d 830. Here, no such prejudice has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">Buchanan also contends that the trial judge improperly commented on the evidence in a supplemental charge to the jury. The trial judge delivered the charge in response to notes from the jury during their deliberations which revealed confusion regarding the two counts of the indictment which involved the possession and forged endorsement of a specific check.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury was primarily concerned with the effect of the Government\u2019s failure to produce as a witness Orlando M. Jones, the intended payee. In his closing argument Buchanan\u2019s counsel commented on that failure. After carefully emphasizing that he could not answer questions of fact, the trial judge suggested various reasons why Jones might have been unable to testify. Buchanan\u2019s counsel objected to those statements and contends that they denied his client a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">It is well settled that a trial judge may comment upon the evidence as long as he instructs the jury that it is the sole judge of the facts and is not bound by his comments and as long as the comments are not so highly prejudicial that an instruction to that effect cannot cure the error. <em>United States v. Musgrave, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 444 F.2d 755; <em>Bursten v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1968, 395 F.2d 976; <em>Moody v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1967, 377 F.2d 175. In this case, the trial court properly and repeatedly emphasized in the supplemental charge that the jury was the sole trier of fact. Furthermore, the court\u2019s comments were not prejudicial. The trial judge\u2019s comments in the supplemental charge, viewed in context, were therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\">. Rule 16(a)(1)(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">(C) Upon request of the defendant the government shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions thereof, which are within the possession, custody or control of the government, and which are material to the preparation of his defense or are intended for use by the government as evidence in chief at trial, or were obtained from or belong to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\">. Although <em>O\u2019Shea </em>was decided prior to the 1975 amendments to Rule 16, it still provides precedent for our holding since the amendments were not addressed to the question raised in <em>O\u2019Shea </em>and in this case regarding the manner of \u201cdisclosure\u201d required by the Rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-15\">. The third count is the general conspiracy count in regard to which evidence relating to several other individual checks was offered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
