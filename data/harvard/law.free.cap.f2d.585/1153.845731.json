Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">\n<em>Background and Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">In 1965, Congress enacted Federal Health Insurance for the Aged, known as Medicare, as Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. Rhode Island Hospital, as a \u201cprovider of services\u201d, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(u), is reimbursed for the \u201creasonable cost\u201d, of its Medicare services, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395b, from a federal trust fund channeled through a fiscal intermediary, here Blue Cross of Rhode Island. The Medicare Act, in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A), excludes costs found to be unnecessary and authorizes regulations which reimburse up to established ceilings in advance for estimated costs. Pursuant to this directive, the Secretary promulgated such regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.460, and published a proposed Schedule of Limits, periodically revised, for hospital costs. <em>See </em>39 Fed.Reg. 20168 (1974); 40 Fed.Reg. 17190, 23622 (1975); 41 Fed.Reg. 26992 (1976); 42 Fed.Reg. 35496, 53675 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">Under this system, a hospital is located within a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (S.M.S.A.) and a group number assigned to the S.M.S.A. based on the area\u2019s per capita income. Each group is then subdivided into cells based on the number of beds available in the hospital. The reimbursement ceilings for the cell were determined as follows: cost data were acquired from each hospital in the cell; the 80th percentile of these costs was ascertained, subjected to various computations, and became the limit beyond which expenditures were presumed to be unreasonable and thus not reimbursable. Generally speaking a hospital in a higher per capita income area is reimbursed at a higher rate than a hospital of comparable size in a lower per capita income area. The regulations establish an exception process for challenging the amounts computed under this system at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.460(e)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">The reimbursement limit established by this system for Rhode Island Hospital during the twelve month period beginning October 1, 1977 is $112.83 per diem. The Hospital\u2019s budgeted expenditures for this period are $130.47 per diem, leaving a deficit of $17.64 per diem per patient. The result is a projected loss of $1,559,094 in Medicare costs for the twelve months. The Hospital has not filed an exception, claiming that it would be futile for it to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">Instead, the Hospital sought to have these regulations, promulgated under section 222 of Pub.L.No.92-603, at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.460(a)-(d) (1977), and their accompanying Schedule of Limits declared unconstitutional. The Hospital argued that these limitations on reimbursement constitute a taking of its property without due process and without just compensation, and that they discriminate against hospitals located in lower per capita income areas without rational basis, in violation of the equal protection of the laws. It further contended that the limits were arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-11\">The Hospital complains as well of the impact of these Medicare reimbursement ceilings, incorporated by reference in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(D), on its reimbursement by the states for Medicaid expenditures. The Medicaid system, embodied in Title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1965, provides assistance to those who are economically unable to meet the cost of necessary medical care, including the aged, the blind, the disabled and families with dependent children. It is funded by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, but unlike Medicare, is administered by the states rather than the federal government. <em>Springdale Convalescent Center v. Mathews, </em>545 F.2d 943, 950 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Opelika Nursing Home, Inc. v. Richardson, </em>448 F.2d 658, 660 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-12\">State medical assistance plans which satisfy Title XIX statutory requirements, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(l)-(37), are in part financed by federal matching funds, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>thus become subject to certain federal controls, one of which is at issue here. Section 1396a(a)(13)(D) of Title XIX states that a state plan must provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-4\">\u201cfor payment of the reasonable cost of inpatient hospital services provided under the plan, as determined in accordance with methods and standards, consistent with ... [42 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1320a \u2014 1], which shall be developed by the State and reviewed and approved by the Secretary and . . . included in the plan, <em>except that the reasonable cost of any such services as determined under such methods and standards shall not exceed the amount which would be determined under . . . [42 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1395x(v)] as the reasonable costs of such services for purposes of title XVIII . . </em>. .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">The challenged regulations and Schedule of Limits promulgated under \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A) of Title XVIII therefore apply as well to Medicaid payments. Accordingly, the Hospital projects a potential Medicaid loss for the same twelve month period of $219,792, allegedly in violation of its constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-10\">\n<em>Jurisdiction of the Medicare Dispute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">The Hospital asserted below and argues on appeal that the district court had federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Secretary in response argues that section 1331(a) jurisdiction is barred by \u00a7 205(h) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h), found in Title II, but expressly made applicable to Title XVIII, the Medicare Act, by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\u00dc.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-16\">Section 205(h) reads in relevant part: \u201cNo findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided. No action against the United States, the Secretary, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 41 of Title 28 [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331] to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1246-17\">This provision applies \u201cwith respect to [Title XVIII] to the same extent as [it is] applicable with respect to Title II.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\u00dc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-18\">\u201cThe extent to which [\u00a7 205(h)] is applicable with respect to Title II\u201d was considered by the Supreme Court in <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). In <em>Salfi, </em>the plaintiff class, composed of surviving wives and stepchildren of deceased wage earners, challenged the constitutionality of duration-of-relationship eligibility requirements under Title II of the Social Security Act. <em>Id. </em>at 752 \u2014 53, 95 S.Ct. 2457. The Court held that the district court was barred by the last sentence of \u00a7 205(h), quoted <em>supra, </em>from exercising \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction. Describing this sentence as \u201cmore than a codified requirement of administrative exhaustion\u201d, and emphasizing that <em>\u201cno </em>action shall be brought under \u00a7 1331\u201d, the Court required the plaintiffs to resort to the Act\u2019s provisions for judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decision in that case, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>It seems to us that the plain language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) and \u00a7 1395\u00dc, read in tandem, and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the former in <em>Salfi </em>bar the finding of \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction in this ease. Our review gains support from a recent case in which the Association of American Medical Colleges sought to challenge the same cost limitation regulations at issue here. In <em>Association of American Medical Colleges v. Califano, </em>186 U.S.App.D.C. 270, 569 F.2d 101 (1977), the court, relying on <em>Salfi, </em>held that \u201cappellant\u2019s failure to pursue the Act\u2019s remedial administrative procedures that culminate in judicial review left the District Court without subject-matter jurisdiction over the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>186 U.S.App.D.C. at 272, 569 F.2d at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">The Hospital argues, however, that neither the language of the statute itself, nor the Supreme Court\u2019s directive in <em>Salfi, </em>as read by others than the District of Columbia Circuit, precluded the district court from hearing its claim. We first consider its attempt to confine the reach of section 405(h) as it applies to disputes under the Medicare statute, Title XVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">Faced with the language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\u00dc that applies \u00a7 405(h) to Title XVIII to the same extent that that section applies to Title II disputes, the Hospital nonetheless maintains that the impact of \u00a7 405(h) on Title XVIII can be determined only by a detailed exploration of Title XVIII itself. In 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff, provision is made for resolution of three types of Medicare controversies: disputes as to whether an individual is covered by Medicare; disputes concerning the amount of benefits to which an individual is entitled; and disputes as to whether a provider is eligible to participate in the Medicare program. The Hospital correctly notes that in these Title XVIII contexts, the judicial review mechanisms of \u00a7 405(g), <em>see </em>note 2, <em>supra, </em>are expressly carried over and made available, and reasons that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-8\">\u201cThe express incorporation of these Title II procedural provisions with respect to the types of disputes enumerated in Section 1395ff make it impossible to avoid the conclusion that Section 405(h), incorporated to the extent \u2018applicable,\u2019 was intended to apply whenever <em>other </em>Title II provisions providing for hearing and judicial review, are expressly made applicable to Title XVIII controversies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">Because \u00a7 405(g) judicial review is not provided for resolution of provider reimbursement disputes, \u00a7 405(h), the argument concludes, is inapplicable in the instant case as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">We reject this imaginative reading of Congressional intent. The Hospital ignores the plain directive of \u00a7 1395\u00dc that \u00a7 405(h) applies to Title XVIII to the same extent that it applies to Title II. Its quest into Title XVIII to determine the applicability of \u00a7 405(h) is therefore unnecessary and unenlightening. Moreover, there is no reason to conclude that \u00a7 405(h) enjoys such a symbiotic relationship with \u00a7 405(g) that the former\u2019s limitation on judicial review to that which is provided in the Act, can <em>only </em>be applied when \u00a7 <em>405(g) </em>is the particular review provision made available. While courts have hesitated to read <em>Salfi </em>and \u00a7 405(h) to foreclose all avenues of judicial review when the Act provides for <em>no </em>administrative process leading to judicial review and constitutional questions are at issue, <em>see Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 108-09, 97 S. Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>Dr. John T. MacDonald Foundation, Inc. v. Califano, </em>571 F.2d 328, 331-32 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Adams Nursing Home of Williamstown, Inc. v. Mathews, </em>548 F.2d 1077, 1079 (1st Cir. 1977); <em>Trinity Memorial Hospital v. Associated Hospital Service, </em>570 F.2d 660, 664-65 (7 Cir. 1977), we are not faced with such a situation here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Medicare Act, in 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo, itself provides for the establishment of a Provider Reimbursement Review Board to hear reimbursement disputes. And in \u00a7 1395oo(f), we find the functional equivalent of \u00a7 405(g) in this context, expressly authorizing judicial review of final decisions of the Board and of any reversal, affirmance or modification of any Board decision by the Secretary. <em>See </em>Pub.L.No. 93^484, \u00a7 3(a)-(b), 88 Stat. 1459 (Oct. 26, 1974).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">We next address the Hospital\u2019s arguments that there is case law reading <em>Salfi </em>restrictively so as to preclude its application to this case. In <em>St. Louis University v. Blue Cross Hospital Service, </em>537 F.2d 283 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 977, 97 S.Ct. 484, 50 L.Ed.2d 584 (1976), the Eighth Circuit drew a distinction between a provider\u2019s attempt to obtain payments pursuant to the Medicare Act, in which <em>Salfi </em>bars jurisdiction, and its due process challenge to the procedures adopted by the Secretary to hear Medicare reimbursement disputes, <em>id. </em>at 291. It refused to read <em>Salfi </em>to bar a suit seeking a constitutionally adequate hearing, <em>id. </em>at 292, a claim collateral to one for benefits under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">That case is distinguishable for two important reasons. First, <em>St. Louis University </em>involved an attack on <em>hearing procedures </em>employed by the agency to determine whether the particular claimant was entitled to reimbursement, <em>id.. See Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 330-35, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). The instant challenge, in contrast, is not collateral to a claim for reimbursement, despite the Hospital\u2019s protestations to the contrary. It is a substantive constitutional attack against the reimbursement provisions of the Medicare Act, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.460(a)-(d) and its Schedule of Limits, in essence, asserting that the reimbursement provided by those provisions does not cover its \u201creasonable costs\u201d. Rhode Island Hospital\u2019s argument is not that the mechanisms for review of its claim constitute a decision process that violates procedural due process. We recently recognized this distinction between a challenge to the validity of a Medicare provision and a challenge to the hearing procedures that govern the statute\u2019s application to a particular claimant. <em>See Cervoni v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>581 F.2d 1010 at 1017 (1st Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>Second, \u201cand more importantly\u201d, 537 F.2d at 292, the court in <em>St. Louis Hospital </em>emphasized that the Act provided no adequate alternative to the defective hearing procedures by which the constitutional challenge at issue could eventually move into the courts, <em>id., </em>noting that the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, \u00a7 1395oo, was not yet in existence during the relevant accounting periods, <em>id. </em>at 289 n.8. The Board is now available, however, and \u00a7 1395 <em>oo </em>(f) expressly authorizes judicial review of provider reimbursement disputes, at which time a constitutional challenge can be heard by the courts. Rhode Island Hospital\u2019s situation is critically distinguishable from that in <em>St. Louis Hospital </em>and thus falls squarely within <em>Salfi </em>in which judicial review was also made available by the Act, in \u00a7 405(g). <em>See Cervoni v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, supra, </em>at 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">In a further attempt to rescue its case from <em>Salfi </em>and \u00a7 405(h), the Hospital challenges the adequacy of the Act\u2019s administrative procedures that culminate in judicial review under \u00a7 1395oo(f). Two flaws are alleged, first that the administrative process is unlikely to be resolved in favor of the Hospital and is fraught with burdensome delays, and more fundamentally, that that process cannot yield the relief it <em>seeks </em>\u2014 a ruling that the challenged regulations are violative of the Constitution. Although the Hospital may have accurately depicted an administrative process that we would characterize as less than ideal, neither flaw would render <em>Salfi </em>inapplicable and justify \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction in this case. <em>See Association of American Medical Colleges v. Cali-fano, supra, </em>186 U.S.App.D.C. at 277 &amp; n.63, 569 F.2d at 108 &amp; n.63.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">A brief description of the administrative procedures for resolving provider reimbursement disputes is necessary at this point. Apparently, two administrative avenues of review exist. First, a provider of services may, pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.-460(e), file an \u201cexception\u201d, enumerated in subpart (f) of that section, objecting to the cost limits established by the intermediary under the challenged regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.460(a)-(d). The intermediary\u2019s determination may then be reviewed by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board of \u00a7 1395oo and in turn by the Secretary, if he so chooses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">The Hospital maintains that there is little likelihood that it would be granted any of the specified exceptions to the imposed cost ceilings, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.460(f). It describes the prospect of an (f)(1) reclassification as a \u201ccomplete myth\u201d, and asserts that at most it may be entitled to $650,000 under the burdensome (f)(2) atypical exception. The remaining exceptions it describes as clearly unavailable. Whether or not the Hospital accurately predicts the outcome of the exception process before its intermediary, the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, and possibly the Secretary, we do not believe that it is our role to second guess the administrative process that has been established by the Act. The determination of the availability of these exceptions is a matter properly vested with the administrative expertise of the agency. Had the Hospital\u2019s claims been pursued through the administrative channels,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1249-10\">\u201c[t]he Secretary would . . . have been assured the opportunity to determine whether the claims were invalid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>other reasons or cognizable under other theories, and a reviewing court would have been assisted in its scrutiny of the challenged regulation by its application to particular facts.\u201d <em>Association of American Medical Colleges v. Califano, supra, </em>186 U.S.App.D.C. at 279, 569 F.2d at 110; <em>see Weinberger </em>v. <em>Salfi, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 762, 95 S.Ct. 2457.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">The delay inherent in the administrative process is also challenged. The Hospital argues that the exception process, subjected to \u201cthe provisions of Subpart R of this Part 405\u201d, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.460(e), need not move forward until a cost report for the 1977-1978 fiscal year has been filed, at the close of the accounting year, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.406(b). The Hospital may indeed be correct in its description of the administrative review established by the regulations. Subpart R, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.1801 <em>et seq., </em>conditions further review on an \u201cintermediary determination\u201d, \u00a7 405.1835(a)(1), and an \u201cintermediary determination\u201d by definition is afforded \u201ca provider of services which has filed a cost report\u201d. Section 405.1801.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">The second avenue of administrative review appears to suffer from the same defect of delay. The provider of services may also seek a hearing with respect to its cost report before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, without pursuing a \u00a7 405.-460(f) exception, after it has received a final determination of its fiscal intermediary. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1811. <em>See Association of American Medical Colleges </em>v. <em>Califano, supra, </em>186 U.S.App.D.C. at 279, 569 F.2d at 110. Thus, as far as we can determine from the intricate statutory regulations, a cost report, filed at the close of the fiscal year is once again the triggering event, making administrative review unavailable until then.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">It strikes us as somewhat anomalous to establish a system of payment for projected costs, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.402(b)(1), and then preclude administrative review until the period covered by the projections has passed. However, we do not find that the delay renders the administrative process so inadequate that we should consider following those cases that have hesitated to apply <em>Salfi </em>when <em>no </em>administrative process leading to judicial review of constitutional questions was available. <em>See, e. g., Trinity Memorial Hospital v. Association Hospital Service, supra, </em>570 F.2d at 664-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">In <em>Bob Jones University v. Simon, </em>416 U.S. 725, 94 S.Ct. 2038, 40 L.Ed.2d 496 (1974), the Supreme Court considered petitioners\u2019 objections that the Anti-Injunction Act, \u00a7 7421(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, forced them to exhaust administrative remedies which entailed serious delay. The Court sharply distinguished between \u201ca case in which an aggrieved party has no access at all to judicial review\u201d and \u201cavenues of review . . . [that] present serious problems of delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746-47, 94 S.Ct. at 2050. Without suggesting that the delay in this case is as serious as that in <em>Bob Jones University, supra, </em>we likewise decline to collapse the distinction between delayed review and no review at all. The review process established by the Act for provider reimbursement disputes, whether or not \u201cthe best that can be devised\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 747, 94 S.Ct. at 2051, is sufficient to mandate application of <em>Salfi </em>and \u00a7 405(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-10\">The Hospital\u2019s final contention is that <em>Salfi </em>does not bar this suit because the administrative process cannot produce the kind of relief it seeks \u2014 a determination of the constitutional validity of these reimbursement limitations. It is true that both the Intermediary and the Provider Reimbursement Review Board are without statutory authority to review the legality or constitutionality of the regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.1829, 405.1867, and the Secretary, who could alter the regulatory scheme is not required to review the decision of the Board, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1875(a). Nor can he realistically be expected to effect a broad change in the regulatory scheme \u201cat the behest of a single aid recipient\u201d. <em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 330, 96 S.Ct. at 900. However, on an earlier occasion, we noted that <em>Salfi\u2019s </em>restrictions on judicial review to that provided in the Act \u201cis not made inapplicable by reason of a constitutional challenge, beyond the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>of the Secretary to take remedial action.\u201d <em>Milo Community Hospital v. Weinberger, </em>525 F.2d 144, 147 (1st Cir. 1975). Accordingly, we are in agreement with the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>Association of American Medical Colleges, supra, </em>186 U.S.App. D.C. at 277, 569 F.2d at 108, which likewise found unpersuasive a provider\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Salfi </em>on this basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-6\">\u201cThe <em>Salfi </em>plaintiffs clearly could not have obtained from the Secretary a ruling of unconstitutionality of a statute that the Secretary was bound to enforce, yet their action was denied federal-question jurisdiction, and resort to the administrative process was required. Appellant\u2019s contention that the availability of federal-question jurisdiction of this lawsuit depends upon whether the issues in dispute can be dealt with better at an administrative hearing than in a judicial proceeding must accordingly fail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">The clear mandate of <em>Salfi </em>is that \u00a7 405(h) is \u201csomething more than simply a codification of the judicially developed doctrine of exhaustion, and may not be dispensed with merely by a judicial conclusion of futility . . . .\u201d 422 U.S. at 766, 95 S.Ct. at 2467; see <em>Humana of South Carolina, Inc. </em>v. <em>Califano, supra, </em>Nos. 76-1953, 76-2125, slip op. at 15. The Hospital\u2019s attempts to render <em>Salfi </em>and \u00a7 405(h) inapplicable to this case by challenging the adequacy of the review provided in \u00a7 1395 <em>oo </em>therefore must fail. We conclude, consistent with <em>Salfi, </em>that \u00a7 405(h), incorporated into the Medicare Act by \u00a7 1395\u00dc, limits jurisdiction over this Title XVIII dispute to that provided by the Act, here, \u00a7 1395oo (f). And because the Hospital has not obtained \u201ca final decision of the Board, or any reversal, affirmance, or modification by the Secretary\u201d, the jurisdictional prerequisite established by \u00a7 1395oo(f),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we hold that the district court properly found that it was without jurisdiction to hear the Medicare dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-15\">\n<em>Jurisdiction of the Medicaid Dispute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-16\">As discussed earlier, the challenged Medicare reimbursement ceilings have been incorporated by reference into the Medicaid Act, Title XIX, at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(D), thereby holding the Hospital\u2019s reimbursement for Medicaid costs under a state plan to the same designated limits. The Hospital argued before the district court, and on appeal, that regardless of our disposition of its challenge to the Medicare Act, jurisdiction clearly lies to hear the Medicaid dispute. This is so, it maintains, because \u00a7 405(h), which limits judicial review to that provided by the Act, and made applicable to Title XVIII by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\u00dc, has not been incorporated into Title XIX. We agree, as did the court below, that \u00a7 405(h) presents no jurisdictional bar in cases arising under Title XIX. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number><em>See Springdale Convalescent Center v. Mathews, </em>545 F.2d 943, 949 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">The district court refused to take jurisdiction over the Medicaid claim, however, for two reasons. First, because federal sums appropriated for Medicaid are paid to the states and not to providers through their fiscal intermediary and because states establish the \u201cmethods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care and services available under the plan\u201d, 42'U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30), the Hospital\u2019s disagreement, the court believed, was with the state and not with the reimbursement limits as established by the federal statute. We are not persuaded that jurisdiction should be denied on this basis. The Hospital\u2019s quarrel, realistically, is with the reimbursement limits promulgated pursuant to a federal statute and imposed on the states by a federal statute. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(D); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 250.30(b); <em>see also Johnson\u2019s Professional Nursing Home v. Weinberger, </em>490 F.2d 841 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>Virginia Hospital Association v. Kenley, </em>427 F.Supp. 781 (E.D.Va.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">Second, the district court rejected the Hospital\u2019s assertion that part of its suit arises under Title XIX, the Medicaid Act. It reasoned that the Hospital\u2019s Title XIX challenges was essentially an attack on the <em>Medicare </em>reimbursement limits, that the entirety of its claim arose under Title XVIII and thus was subject to the limitations of that Title, namely \u00a7 405(h). While we cannot say as confidently as did the court below that \u201c[t]he only relation this action bears to [the Medicaid] Act is Plaintiff\u2019s mere status as a provider of Medicaid services\u201d, we are persuaded that this case should be viewed as one arising under Title XVIII. We do not reach this conclusion without some difficulty, mindful that the Title XVIII limits have been incorporated into Title XIX and thus have a tangible impact on the Hospital\u2019s Medicaid reimbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">Were we to assume \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction over the Hospital\u2019s Medicaid claim we would find ourselves in the peculiar posture of hearing a case that consists entirely of a challenge to the limits promulgated under Title XVII\u2019I, when we are expressly barred by Title XVIII from entertaining that challenge at this time. To so allow Title XIX to become the back door into Title XVIII, which has barred this case from entrance, would result in an automatic circumvention of the Title XVIII administrative machinery when its cost limitations have been adopted by Title XIX and the provider, as will usually be the case, furnishes services under both Titles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">The situation in this case is significantly different from <em>Springdale Convalescent Center v. Mathews, supra, </em>545 F.2d at 943, upon which the Hospital relies. In <em>Spring-dale, </em>the court found \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction over a provider\u2019s suit to enjoin the Secretary from suspending its Medicaid provider status, occasioned by the provider\u2019s refusal to reimburse the Secretary for alleged Medicare overpayments. 545 F.2d at 945. While in the course of the court\u2019s disposition of the case it reviewed the constitutionality of Medicare reimbursement limits, the Secretary\u2019s act which triggered the lawsuit was the suspension of Springdale\u2019s status as a <em>Medicaid </em>provider, and \u201c[statutory authority for suspension exists under the Medicaid rather than the Medicare Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 949. The court emphasized that \u201c[c]entral to the resolution of this jurisdictional issue is our determination that Springdale\u2019s action falls under the Medicaid rather than the Medicare Act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-9\">We are not faced with a case like <em>Spring-dale </em>in which the gravamen of the action can be said to arise under the Medicaid Act and resolution requires analysis of a Medicare provision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At issue here is the validi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>ty of Title XVIII reimbursement limits which allegedly deprive a provider of reimbursement for Medicare costs, and as a result of their impact on Title XIX, of a much smaller amount of Medicaid costs as well. By declining to exercise jurisdiction over this case we leave the Hospital to the Title XVIII administrative process. To the extent that its challenge to the Medicare reimbursement limits would be successful there, or in a court after obtaining a \u201cfinal determination\u201d, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f), the benefits of the determination will accrue to it as a provider of Medicaid as well as Medicare services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">\n<em>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1246-12\">. As the parties recognize, the Administrative Procedure Act \u201cdoes not afford an implied grant of subject-matter jurisdiction permitting federal judicial review of agency action.\u201d <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 107, 97 S.Ct. 980, 985, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1246-13\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) in part provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-14\">\u201cAny individual, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision or within such further times as the Secretary may allow. Such action shall be brought in the district court of the United States . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-21\">Because the unnamed class members had failed even to file an application for review with the Secretary, \u201cmuch less [receive] any decision, final or otherwise, review of which is sought\u201d, they failed to satisfy the requirements for jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). \u201cOther sources of jurisdiction being foreclosed by 405(h)\u201d, their complaint should have been dismissed. 422 U.S. at 764, 95 S.Ct. at 2466. The situation of the named appellees was different. They had presented their claims for benefits to the local and regional offices but had failed to fully exhaust their remedies before the Secretary. <em>Id. </em>at 764-65, 95 S.Ct. 2457. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>refused to \u201cbar the Secretary from determining in particular cases that full exhaustion of internal review procedures is not necessary for a decision to be \u2018final\u2019 within the language of \u00a7 405(g)\u201d, <em>id </em>at 766-67, 95 S.Ct. at 2467, and found jurisdiction as to the named appellees under \u00a7 405(g). <em>Id </em>at 767, 95 S.Ct. 2457.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A9Ug\">.

We are unpersuaded as well by the Hospital\u2019s suggestions that \u00a7 405(h) applies only to claims for monetary benefits and thus is inapposite to the Hospital\u2019s action for injunctive relief. We decline to read that section which bars an \u201caction ... to recover on any claim\u201d, so technically (emphasis added). In <em>Salfi, </em>\u00a7 405(h) was applied to an action for declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages for wrongfully withheld benefits, 422 U.S. at 755, 95 S.Ct. 2457, and was held to bar completely the unnamed appellees\u2019 suit. <em>See Dr. John T. MacDonald Foundation v. Califano, supra, </em>571 F.2d at 331; <em>Association of American Medical Colleges v. Califano, supra, </em>186 U.S.App.D.C. at 275, 569 F.2d at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">In addition, the Hospital argues that the first sentence of \u00a7 405(h) \u2014 \u201c[t]he findings and decisions of the Secretary after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing\u201d \u2014 indicates that the reach of \u00a7 405(h) is limited to actions by individuals and not institutions. We reject this limiting construction, taking note of the long line of cases that have applied \u00a7 405(h) to actions brought by providers \u2014 institutions\u2014under the Medicare Act. <em>See, e. g., Dr. John T. MacDonald Foundation, Inc. v. Califano, supra; Trinity Memorial Hospital v. Associated Hospital Service, supra, </em>570 F.2d at 660; <em>Association of American Medical Colleges v.

In <em>Cervoni, </em>we considered a physician\u2019s assertion that the procedures used to apply the Medicare Act did not comport with due process. Because we concluded that no colorable constitutional claim had been made, the question whether \u00a7 405(h) should be read to bar a procedural due process claim was not reached. <em>Cervoni, supra, </em>at 1017-1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-11\">Our view finds further support in <em>Humana of South Carolina, Inc. v. Califano, </em>Nos. 76-1953, 76-2125 (D.C.Cir. Sept. 18, 1978). In the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s most recent discussion of the impact of \u00a7 405(h) on the Medicare Act, it distinguished between \u201cstatutory and constitutional contentions . . directed at establishing error in the Secretary\u2019s views of what limits on reimbursement Congress intended or at demonstrating a fundamental un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>reasonableness in benefit amounts\u201d and a \u201cprocedural attack\u201d whose \u201cgravamen is simply that the Secretary failed to adhere to the methodology generally applicable to any rulemaking effort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. The provider had made both types of claims. The court likened the first situation to its earlier decision in <em>American Medical Colleges v. Califano, supra, </em>186 U.S.App.D.C. 270, 569 F.2d 101, which found \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction to hear \u201csuits seeking eventual realization of provider-cost reimbursement under the Medicare Act\u201d barred by \u00a7 405(h).</p>\n<p id=\"AYt\"><em>Humana of South Carolina, Inc. v. Califano, supra, </em>slip op. at 18-20. With respect to the second situation, however, the court stated \u201cthat when suit is brought simply to vindicate an interest in procedural regularity, Section 205(h) is not summoned into play\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 21. Accordingly, the court took jurisdiction to decide whether the rulemaking process for the challenged r\u00e9tum-on-equity regulation was exempt from the strictures of the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>Id. </em>at 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1251-9\">. It is well established that there is flexibility in the term \u201cfinal determination\u201d. Full exhaustion of the administrative remedies provided by the Act in a particular case may not further administrative purposes and therefore on occasion has been waived. <em>See Mathews v. El-dridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 328-29, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976); <em>Weinberger v.

Absent such a claim there can be no \u2018decision\u2019 of any type. And some decision by the Secretary is clearly required by the statute.\u201d <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 328, 96 S.Ct. at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-12\">The situation of the Hospital in this case therefore is akin to that of the unnamed class members in <em>Salfi </em>who had failed to even file an application for review of the Secretary, \u201cmuch less [receive] any decision, final or otherwise, review of which is sought\u201d and whose case accordingly was dismissed. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra. </em>Although the Hospital apparently did take advantage of its opportunity to comment on the proposed regulations and limits and, in a number of meetings attempted to have HEW officials look at and change the regulations, as the district court found: \u201c[the Hospital] has not made any such application [for an exception], nor has [it] submitted this controversy to the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare for his determination in any other fashion.\u201d The Hospital does not argue that it has satisfied, even preliminarily, the statutory prerequisites for judicial review under \u00a7 1395oo (f), but rather that it should not be required to satisfy that section, given the defects of the administrative process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">.
