SKELLY WRIGHT, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1221-24\">Appellant James Cogdell was convicted by a jury of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a) (1976) by escaping from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>\u201cNortheast One\u201d section of the new D.C. Jail on August 26, 1976, the same date as the escape of the appellants in <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>190 U.S.App.D.C.-, 585 F.2d 1087 (D.C. Cir. 1978), a case we also decide today. Cogdell was originally indicted along with those other appellants, but his case was severed and tried at a later date to accommodate his attorney\u2019s schedule. Nevertheless, the trial judge relied heavily on the rulings he had made previously in the <em>Bailey </em>case when ruling on appellant\u2019s motions and developing the jury instructions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons outlined in <em>Bailey </em>we hold that Cogdell\u2019s conviction must be reversed and his case remanded for a new trial because of errors in the trial court\u2019s instructions and the exclusion of relevant evidence on the \u201cescape\u201d element of the offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-13\">Cogdell\u2019s case also raises unique issues that require additional consideration. Unlike any of the appellants in <em>Bailey, </em>Cog-dell had been brought to the D.C. Jail pursuant to a writ of <em>habeas corpus ad prosequendum </em>from the Fairfax County Jail in Virginia where he had been committed following a state conviction but before sentencing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cogdell\u2019s indictment reflected his special situation; he was charged with escaping from \u201ccustody under and by virtue of a commitment issued under the laws of the United States by a Judge of the Superi- or Court of the District of Columbia following his arrest on a charge of a felony.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>On the basis of these factors peculiar to his case, Cogdell argues that the charge on which he was convicted must be dismissed. We find no error that requires dismissal and therefore remand this case, like those of the appellants in <em>Bailey, </em>for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">Appellant first contends that the indictment does not state an offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a) (1976) because the writ of <em>habeas corpus ad prosequendum </em>issued by the Superior Court was not issued under the laws of the United States. Cogdell claims that the writ was issued under 16 D.C.Code \u00a7 1901 (1973), which he argues is not a law of the United States. <em>See Key v. Doyle, </em>434 U.S. 59, 98 S.Ct. 280, 54 L.Ed.2d 238 (1977). The Government does not contend that Section 1901 is a law of the United States, but responds that the writ in this case was issued under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1652 (1970), which is a law of the</p>\n<p id=\"AHy\">United States. The writ does not recite the statutory authority under which it was issued,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but we find the Government\u2019s position more convincing than appellant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-16\">Section 1901 is limited by its terms to writs of <em>habeas corpus ad subjiciendum </em>\u2014writs challenging the grounds for imprisonment of persons \u201ccommitted, detained, confined, or restrained from [their] lawful liberty within the District.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The authority to issue writs of <em>habeas corpus ad prose-quendum </em>cannot be read into the language of the section without severe strain. On the other hand, the literal terms of Section 1652 authorize the Superior Court, as a court \u201cestablished by Act of Congress,\u201d to issue the writ of <em>habeas corpus ad prose-quendum </em>as one \u201cin aid of [its] respective jurisdiction[] and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (1970). <em>See Morrow v. District of Columbia, </em>135 U.S.App.D.C. 160, 417 F.2d 728 (1969).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>Although Congress has recently passed legislation designed to treat the D.C. court system more like the court system of a state,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it surely did not intend to remove the local courts\u2019 power to issue writs of <em>habeas corpus ad prosequendum. </em>Since Congress has not provided for this authority in a \u201clocal\u201d statute, we conclude that the Government was justified in claiming that the authority still exists under the All Writs Act and that the writ issued in this case was therefore issued under the laws of the United States.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">Appellant also argues that the indictment must be dismissed because of a fatal variance between the offense with which he was charged and that for which he was tried. We see no consequential variance between the indictment and the evidence. As noted above, appellant was indicted for escaping from \u201ccustody under and by virtue of a committment [sic ] issued under the laws of the United States by a Judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia following his arrest on a charge of a felony.\u201d The prosecution\u2019s documentary and testimonial evidence indicated that appellant had been brought from the Fairfax County Jail on August 17, 1976 pursuant to a writ of <em>habeas corpus ad prosequendum </em>to appear for a status call in the Superior Court, where he had been indicted on charges of forgery, uttering, unauthorized use of a vehicle, and carrying a pistol without a license; that he had been confined in the \u201cNortheast One\u201d section of the new D.C. Jail; that he had left the jail without authorization on August 26; and that he had been arrested by the FBI on September 28.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">While we see no significant variance between the indictment and the evidence, we do recognize that there were possibly prejudicial variations between the indictment and the trial court\u2019s instructions. Because of the similarity between appellant\u2019s case and <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>the trial judge developed the instructions for this case by going through the instructions he had given in the <em>Bailey </em>case and making the changes he thought necessary in consultation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>the prosecutor and defense counsel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The instructions resulting from this procedure failed to take sufficient account of the differences between the indictment in <em>Bailey </em>and that in this case. In particular, much language referring to the \u201ccustody of the Attorney General\u201d was left in the instructions, in spite of the irrelevance of such language to the charge in Cogdell\u2019s indictment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In its context, this superfluous language may not have been prejudicial to appellant,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to the instructions on this ground at trial. Nevertheless, this language was a potential source of confusion to the jury, and we assume that the trial court will not give the same instruction in the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">Appellant\u2019s final argument is based on the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), to which the District of Columbia and the United States became signatories in 1970. 24 D.C.Code \u00a7 701 (1973); Pub.L. 91-538, 84 Stat. 1397 (1970). The IAD is designed to establish a uniform process for transporting prisoners for trial from a jurisdiction in which they are serving a sentence to a jurisdiction in which they have been charged with an offense. The primary purpose of the IAD is to eliminate the abuses, such as delay in bringing prisoners to trial and interference with rehabilitation programs, which characterized the use of \u201cdetainers\u201d previous to the adoption of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>Agreement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The provisions of the IAD relevant to this case allow \u201c[t]he appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information, or complaint is pending * * * to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party State made available * * * upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody * * *.\u201d Article IV(a). The IAD also provides that once a prisoner has been transferred pursuant to its provisions, \u201c[i]f trial is not had on any indictment, information, or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner\u2019s being returned to the original place of imprisonment * * *, such indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall .enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\u201d Article IV(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">Appellant urges us to treat a writ of <em>habeas corpus ad prosequendum </em>issued by the Superior Court as a \u201cdetainer\u201d and to find that the provisions of the IAD apply to his case. He points out that before the writ involved in this case was issued he had already been brought before the Superior Court for arraignment and returned to the Fairfax County Jail. If the IAD applies, he argues (1) that his return to Virginia prior to trial rendered the charges against him in the Superior Court of no effect, (2) that the writ bringing him before the Superior Court on August 17 was therefore a \u201cnullity,\u201d and (3) that the writ thus cannot serve as a basis for a conviction of escape under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">Appellant\u2019s arguments based on the IAD are no longer tenable following the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Mauro, </em>436 U.S. 340, 98 S.Ct. 1834, 56 L.Ed.2d 329 (1978). The Court in <em>Mauro </em>held that a writ of <em>habeas corpus ad prosequendum </em>issued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is not a \u201cdetainer\u201d under the IAD. Although we hold that the writ in this case was issued under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, the Court\u2019s reasoning \u2014 that the IAD was not intended to apply to writs of <em>habeas corpus ad prosequendum </em>because such writs do not cause the problems created by detainers, which the IAD was meant to relieve, <em>United States v. Mauro, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 340, 98 S.Ct. 1834 \u2014 applies with equal force regardless of the authority under which the writ is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-13\">Since we conclude that none of the arguments raised by appellant require dismissal of the charge on which he was convicted, we reverse the judgment of the District Court for the reasons stated above and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-14\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">. <em>See </em>Transcript of Proceedings, <em>United States v.

Relying on his ultimate conclusion in <em>Bailey </em>to exclude from the jury\u2019s consideration any evidence of threats, assaults, or conditions in the D.C. Jail, the trial judge refused even to admit such evidence in Cog-dell\u2019s case. <em>See Cogdell </em>Tr. I, <em>supra </em>note 1, at 11-12. The trial court\u2019s instructions on intent and on what constitutes an \u201cescape\u201d were the same in both cases. <em>Compare Cogdell </em>Tr.

A court issues a writ of <em>habeas corpus ad prosequendum </em>when it is necessary to bring a person who is confined for some other offense before the issuing court for trial. <em>See generally Carbo v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 611, 81 S.Ct. 338, 5 L.Ed.2d 329 (1961); <em>Ex parte Bollman, </em>8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 75, 2 L.Ed. 554 (1807). Appellant had been convicted in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County on July 21, 1976, of three counts of uttering and delivering a forged check. His sentencing on that conviction had been postponed until September 9, at his attorney\u2019s request, so that a presentence report could be prepared. At the time the writ involved in this case was issued, appellant was confined in the Fairfax County. Jail awaiting sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1222-15\">. <em>See Cogdell </em>Tr. II, <em>supra </em>note 1, at 112. Appellant was also charged with violating 22 D.C. Code \u00a7 2601 (1973) (prison breach), but the jury was instructed that they need not consider this charge if they found appellant guilty of the federal offense. <em>See Cogdell </em>Tr. II, <em>supra </em>note 1, at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-16\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a) (1970) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-17\">Whoever escapes or attempts to escape from the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative, or from any institution or facility in which he is confined by direction of the Attorney General, <em>or from any custody under or by virtue of any process issued under the laws of the United States by any court, judge, or magistrate, </em>or from the custody of an officer or employee of the United States pursuant to lawful arrest, shall, <em>if the custody or confinement is by virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony, </em>or conviction of any offense, be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both; or if the custody or confinement is for extradition or by virtue of an arrest or charge of or for a misdemeanor, and prior to conviction, be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-18\">(Emphasis added.) Cogdell\u2019s indictment was based on the portion of \u00a7 751 proscribing escapes \u201cfrom any custody under or by virtue of any process issued under the laws of the United States by any court, judge, or magistrate,\u201d in contrast to the indictments in <em>Bailey, </em>which were based on escape from the \u201ccustody of the Attorney General.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bailey, supra </em>note 2, 190 U.S.App.D.C. at-, 585 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>F.2d at 1087. Appellant urges us to find the indictment fatally defective because it uses the term \u201ccommitment\u201d rather than \u201cprocess,\u201d and because a writ of <em>habeas corpus ad prosequen-dum </em>is not a commitment. Brief for appellant at 8-12. We agree with the Government, however, that the word \u201ccommitment\u201d has a general custodial sense as well as a strict technical one, and that the words of the indictment were sufficiently clear to give appellant notice of the proof that would be adduced against him and to protect him from double jeopardy. See <em>Gaither v. United States, </em>134 U.S.App.D.C. 154, 159, 413 F.2d 1061, 1066 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">. Government Exhibit 1C.

The All Writs Act was made expressly applicable to courts \u201cestablished by Act of Congress\u201d in a 1948 revision. The Revisor\u2019s Note commented:</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-21\">The revised section extends the power to issue writs in aid of jurisdiction, to all courts established by Act, of Congress, thus making explicit the right to exercise powers implied from the creation of such courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-22\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (1970) (Reviser\u2019s Note). The power to issue writs of <em>habeas corpus ad prose-quendum </em>seems clearly within this category of implied powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-23\">Appellant argues that despite its literal language the All Writs Act does not grant any authority to issue writs of <em>habeas corpus. </em>He relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of <em>habe-as corpus </em>and the All Writs Act in <em>Carbo v. United States, supra </em>note 3. The Court in <em>Carbo </em>was concerned with the jurisdiction of a federal district court to issue a writ of <em>habeas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number><em>corpus ad prosequendum </em>to retrieve a prisoner outside its territorial jurisdiction and found the issue controlled by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, the specific provision giving the Supreme Court, Supreme Court Justices, circuit judges, and federal district courts the power to issue writs of <em>habeas corpus, </em>rather than by the All Writs Act. <em>See id. </em>at 621, 624 (Warren, C. J., dissenting). Unlike the All Writs Act, \u00a7 2241 does not mention courts established by Act of Congress. Although <em>Carbo </em>holds that \u00a7 2241 governs issuance of writs of <em>habeas corpus </em>by the courts and judges mentioned in that section, appellant\u2019s contention that \u00a7 2241 implicitly denies any other court or judge authority to issue the writ under the All Writs Act is contrary to other Supreme Court precedents and to the views of leading commentators. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Hayman, </em>342 U.S. 205, 221 &amp; n.35, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952); <em>Price v. Johnston, </em>334 U.S. 266, 278-286, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948); 9 J.

The relevant portion of the trial\u2019s instructions reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">I will now take up with you the indictment and the instructions which relate particularly to the indictment. You are instructed as a matter of law that an individual held within the District of Columbia, Department of Corrections, pursuant to a court order of commitment or Writ of Habeas Corpus [Ad] Pro-sequendam [sic] of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia is in the custody of the Attorney General of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">Now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Cogdell, the Defendant in this case, is charged in Count One of the indictment as follows: On or about August 26, 1976, within the District of Columbia, James T. Cogdell, having been in the custody under and by virtue of a commitment issued under the laws of the United States by a Judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia following his arrest on a charge of a felony, did unlawfully and willfully flee and escape from such custody, which would constitute a violation of Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 751(a). Now, the essential elements of the offense of escape from custody, each of which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt in order to justify a verdict of guilty[,] are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">First, that at the time [of] the offense, that is to say August 26, 1976, the Defendant in question had been in custody pursuant to a commitment issued under the laws of the United States. On that particular date there are certain copies of pertinent court papers on that particular element.</p>\n<p id=\"ARPQ\">Second, that as a result of the commitment, the Defendant was committed to the custody of the Attorney General or his designated representative, and was in custody at the time of the offense. Insofar as this element is concerned, there are records of the District of Columbia, Department of Corrections, and a certified copy of the Writ of Habeas Corpus ad Prosequendam [sic]. That is to say, these records have been received in evidence. You may examine them in the jury room. You have previously been instructed as to the legal significance of the commitment, the Writs of Habeas Corpus as they pertain to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative. ******</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-14\">* * * xhus, if you find that the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt each of the essential elements constituting the offense charged in Count One, you may find the Defendant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-15\">On the other hand, if you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the Government has proved any one of these essential elements, then you must find the Defendant not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"ak9-dedup-0\"><em>Cogdell </em>Tr. II, <em>supra </em>note 1, at 111-113. These instructions indicate that the trial court added an additional element (being in the custody of the Attorney General) to the elements of the offense alleged in the indictment (escaping from custody by virtue of a commitment issued under the laws of the United States), and then instructed the jury that this additional element was met as a matter of law if the other elements were satisfied. We also note in passing for the benefit of the trial court on remand that the instructions might have given more emphasis to the requirement that the defendant must be in custody \u201cby virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony,\u201d an element contained in both the statute and the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">. <em>See generally </em>Note, <em>The Effect of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Upon Federal Prisoner Transfer, </em>46 Fordham L.Rev. 492, 508-515 (1977); Comment, <em>The Detainer Sys-tern and the Right to a Speedy Trial, </em>31 U.Chi.
