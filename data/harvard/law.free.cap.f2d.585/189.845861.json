California, </em>422 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). Therein, Mr. Justice Stewart wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">When an accused manages his own defense, he relinquishes, as a purely factual matter, many of the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel. For this reason, in order to represent himself, the accused must \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d forgo those relinquished benefits. Although a defendant need not himself have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligently to choose self-representation, he should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that \u201che knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541. <em>Faretta, </em>however, arose in a different context because Faretta, who \u201cweeks before trial [had] clearly and unequivocally declared to the trial judge that he wanted to represent himself and did not want counsel,\u201d was denied the right to represent himself and was required to accept the representation of a state-appointed public defender. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment of conviction on the ground that in the circumstances disclosed by the record, Faretta was entitled to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">There was thus no occasion in <em>Faretta </em>to lay down detailed guidelines concerning what tests or lines of inquiry a trial judge is required to conduct in order to determine whether a defendant has \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d chosen to forego the benefits of counsel. While a more satisfactory record would be before us had the district judge chosen to follow a line of inquiry akin to that mandated by Rule 11(c), Rules of Criminal Procedure, an examination of the entire record in the present case satisfies us that appellant was in fact aware of the dangers, waived his right to be represented by counsel, and chose to represent himself \u201cwith eyes open.\u201d It is further apparent that he fully understood his right to appointed counsel and the court\u2019s willingness to make such appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Appellant\u2019s additional contention is that he was prejudiced by the trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant a 3-day continuance when a motion therefor was presented on the opening day of trial. However, the record establishes that the date of trial had been set and appellant advised thereof at least five weeks prior to trial, and we conclude that no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
