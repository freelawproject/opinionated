On cross-examination, Baker related that although he did not see Vanlandingham and Perlmutter get into the subject suspect car, he also did not observe them walking past the end of either driveway of the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">Perlmutter, who was granted immunity, testified that: on the evening of the illicit sale, Vanlandingham stopped by Perlmut-ter\u2019s apartment prior to Galer\u2019s arrival and dropped off a scale; Vanlandingham wanted to sell the cocaine to Galer one ounce at a time but Galer disagreed and said he wanted to buy all four ounces at one time; he and Vanlandingham then \u201cproceeded down the street to a waiting vehicle where Michael Andrews was in and we got in the car\u201d; Vanlandingham told Andrews he thought the buyers (agents) were \u201ccool\u201d and that it would be all right to sell all four ounces at once; Andrews stated the reason he had never been busted was because he had taken precautions; Andrews then drove his vehicle down the street, stopped it next to a curb, opened his door and, without exiting, removed cocaine from a bush which he then handed to Vanlandingham; Andrews then drove the car back where he parked it in front of the resthome (located next to the parking lot where Baker had set up surveillance); as he was exiting Andrews\u2019 car, Andrews told him to check out the suspicious parties at the old folks\u2019 home; after checking the parking lot and failing to observe anything suspicious, he walked back to his residence, with Vanlandingham following him; Vanlandingham handed him the cocaine on the outside steps of his apartment and Vanlandingham then returned to the car; at the top of his outside steps he placed the three ounces of cocaine received from Vanlandingham in- a bush, entered the apartment and obtained the remaining ounce of cocaine which he also then placed in the bush; after placing the cocaine in the bush, he went to Galer\u2019s car where he indicated that he had all four ounces of cocaine; he and Galer then went back up the apartment steps, he delivered the cocaine to Galer, and was then arrested. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>On cross-examination Perlmutter admitted that he had obtained cocaine from Vanland-ingham on prior occasions and that he had been granted immunity for testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">Goldston testified relative to receiving the cocaine involved following the arrests which were made herein, that he first stored it in a vault, tested it and then delivered it to Denver, Colorado, for purposes of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">At the close of the Government\u2019s case-in-chief, Andrews moved for a judgment of acquittal. He contended that venue had not been established and that the Government had failed to establish anything beyond his knowing presence during the sale or possible distribution of narcotic drugs. The trial court took judicial notice that Boulder is in the State and District of Colorado in denying Andrews\u2019 lack of venue contention and the court also denied Andrews\u2019 motion based upon the insufficiency of the evidence. Andrews did not present any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">On appeal Andrews contends that the trial court erred in: (1) admitting Perlmut-ter\u2019s testimony as an immunized co-conspirator; (2) taking judicial notice that venue was proper; (3) admitting plastic bags of the cocaine involved in the case, and (4) in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">Andrews contends the trial court erred in, admitting hearsay testimony of his alleged co-conspirators\u2019 statements because independent evidence of a conspiracy was inadequate. A review of the general law of conspiracy should facilitate our disposition of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">The essence of the crime of conspiracy is an agreement to violate the law. <em>United States v. Butler, </em>494 F.2d 1246 (10th Cir. 1974); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>United States, </em>333 F.2d 354 (10th Cir. 1964). The evidence in a criminal conspiracy trial, such as the instant case, need only establish the <em>existence </em>of a conspiracy and that a defendant <em>knowingly contributed </em>his efforts in furtherance thereof. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>482 F.2d 1167 (10th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1159, 94 S.Ct. 918, 39 L.Ed.2d 111 (1974); <em>Collins v. United States, </em>383 F.2d 296 (10th Cir. 1967). The nature of the offense of conspiracy with its attendant aspects of secrecy, often requires that elements of the crime be established by circumstantial evidence. Thus, the common plan or purpose may be inferred from a combination of circumstances. <em>Jordan v. United States, </em>370 F.2d 126 (10th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 1033, 87 S.Ct. 1484, 18 L.Ed.2d 595 (1967); <em>Baker v. United States, </em>329 F.2d 786 (10th Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 853, 85 S.Ct. 101, 13 L.Ed.2d 56 (1964). The Government\u2019s evidence may establish an ongoing course of conduct giving rise to one continuing conspiracy, covering an extended period of time. <em>United States v. Bridwell, </em>583 F.2d 1135 (10th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>546 F.2d 861 (10th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 920, 97 S.Ct. 2189, 53 L.Ed.2d 232 (1977). Accordingly, a party may join an ongoing conspiracy during its progress and become criminally liable for all acts done in furtherance of the scheme. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>541 F.2d 873 (10th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>468 F.2d 422 (10th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 935, 93 S.Ct. 1389, 35 L.Ed.2d 599 (1973). Once a conspiracy is established, only slight evidence is required to connect a co-conspirator. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>528 F.2d 143 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 837, 97 S.Ct. 105, 50 L.Ed.2d 103 (1976); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>498 F.2d 302 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marrapese, </em>486 F.2d 918 (2nd Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 994, 94 S.Ct. 1597, 39 L.Ed.2d 891 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">We have previously held that acts and declarations of one co-conspirator are admissible against another if the <em>existence </em>of a conspiracy is in fact first established by independent evidence and if the acts and declarations occurred during and in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>540 F.2d 465 (10th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1101, 97 S.Ct. 1125, 51 L.Ed.2d 551 (1977); <em>Lowther v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number><em>States, </em>455 F.2d 657 (10th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 857, 93 S.Ct. 114, 34 L.Ed.2d 102 (1972). This view was further enunciated in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>417 U.S. 211, 94 S.Ct. 2253, 41 L.Ed.2d 20 (1974), where the Court stressed the admissibility of \u201cevidence, such as that of <em>acts </em>of alleged conspirators\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-5\">The doctrine that declarations of one conspirator may be used against another conspirator, if the declaration was made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy charged, is a well-recognized exception to the hearsay rule which would otherwise bar the introduction of such out-of-court declarations. The hearsay-conspiracy exception applies only to declarations made while the conspiracy charged was still in progress, a limitation that this Court has \u201cscrupulously observed.\u201d .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-7\">But, as the Court emphasized in <em>Lut-wak, </em>[344 U.S. 604, 73 S.Ct. 481, 97 L.Ed. 593] the requirement that out-of-court declarations by a conspirator be shown to have been made while the conspiracy charged was still in progress and in furtherance thereof arises only because the declaration would otherwise be hearsay. The ongoing conspiracy requirement is therefore inapplicable to evidence, such as that of <em>acts </em>of alleged conspirators, which would not otherwise be hearsay. Thus the Court concluded in <em>Lutwak </em>that acts of one alleged conspirator could be admitted into evidence against the other conspirators, if relevant to prove the existence of the conspiracy, \u201ceven though they might have occurred after the conspiracy ended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">417 U.S., at pp. 218-219, 94 S.Ct. at p. 2259.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-12\">Under the new Federal Rules of Evidence, rules 104(a, b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 801(d)(2)(E)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, 28 U.S.C.A., if it is more likely than not that a declarant and coconspirator were members of a conspiracy when hearsay statements were made and the statements were in furtherance of a conspiracy, that hearsay is admissible. <em>United States v. Petrozziello, </em>548 F.2d 20 (1st Cir. 1977). In <em>Petrozziello, supra, </em>the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-13\">Appellant\u2019s last claim is that the evidence against him was insufficient. . In particular, he focuses on the dearth of independent, non-hearsay evidence that a conspiracy existed between appellant and the dealer. Evidence of this sort, he argues, is a necessary foundation for the hearsay statements of the dealer, which were admitted under the co-conspirator exception. Because appellant was tried a few months after the new federal rules of evidence took effect, we must consider their impact. The new rules recognize the co-conspirator exception; statements are \u201cnot hearsay\u201d if they are offered against a party who conspired with the declarant, and if they are made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). However, the rules make a change in the way the co-conspirator exception is applied. In this circuit, the jury has had a prominent role in deciding whether the co-conspirator exception can be invoked. Trial courts instruct the jury that a co-conspirator\u2019s hearsay may be used against a defendant only if the defendant\u2019s membership in the conspiracy has been established by independent, non-hearsay evidence. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Honneus, </em>508 F.2d 566, 577 (1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 948, 95 S.Ct. 1677, 44 L.Ed.2d 101 (1975). The new rules, however, give the jury only a narrow responsibility for deciding questions of admissibility. Most issues are resolved finally by the judge. . ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-4\">That, however, is not the end of the matter. The new rules, by eliminating the jury\u2019s role, place a greater burden on the judge, for his decision is now conclusive. In years past, this circuit has followed the general rule that the judge should admit hearsay against a defendant if the judge finds enough independent, non-hearsay evidence to make a prima facie case of conspiracy. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>467 F.2d 804 (1st Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 909, 93 S.Ct. 963, 35 L.Ed.2d 270 (1973); <em>see also United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 701 n. 14, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974). This standard makes sense when the jury has the last word; the judge should refuse to admit a co-conspirator\u2019s hearsay only when no reasonable jury could find that there was a conspiracy. But rule 104(a) requires that questions of admissibility be \u201cdetermined\u201d by the judge, and finding a prima facie case is not the same as \u201cdetermining\u201d that a conspiracy existed. A higher standard is implicit in the judge\u2019s new role.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-5\">Other changes in the rules also suggest a higher standard. The new rules permit a trial judge to base his \u201cdetermination\u201d on hearsay and other inadmissible evidence. Fed.R.Evid. 104(a). .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">548 F.2d, at pp. 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">Evidence of the acts and statements of other co-conspirators may be admitted prior to demonstrating participation in the conspiratorial scheme by the objecting defendant, providing the foundation is subsequently laid. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Krohn, </em>573 F.2d 1382 (10th Cir. 1978); <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>367 F.2d 458 (10th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">The testimony of Agent Galer and Perlmutter established the existence of a conspiracy to effectuate an illicit drug sale in relation to the facts and circumstances of the meeting at Perlmutter\u2019s apartment between Perlmutter, Vanlandingham and Gal-er. Thus, the existence of the conspiracy was established. Statements thereafter made by co-conspirators in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy are thus not considered hearsay under rule 801(d)(2)(E). Perlmutter\u2019s testimony was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">We have consistently held that testimony, otherwise hearsay, offered against a co-conspirator cannot be admitted unless the existence of the conspiracy is established by independent evidence. The existence of the conspiracy in this case was initially established when Perlmutter and Vanlanding-ham met with Galer in Perlmutter\u2019s apartment. It is uncontested that two conspirators, Perlmutter and Vanlandingham were present in the apartment and that their singular purpose was that of effectuating an illicit sale of cocaine to Galer. Statements thereafter made by Andrews, Van-landingham and Perlmutter, testified to by Perlmutter, were properly admitted. They were made after the existence of the conspiracy had been first established by independent evidence. Accordingly, they were admissible as statements made during the course of and in furtherance of the on-going conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">Even were we to assume, which we do not, that the statements attributed to Andrews testified to by Perlmutter were inadmissible, the existence of the conspiracy and Andrews\u2019 participation therein was established by substantial independent evidence. As noted, <em>supra, </em>Galer\u2019s testimony established the existence of the conspiracy to sell the cocaine. Agent Baker\u2019s testimony established Andrews\u2019 presence in the immediate area of the sale at the time thereof. Perlmutter\u2019s testimony established that he and Vanlandingham entered Andrews\u2019 car, that Andrews drove the car a short distance and retrieved cocaine from a bush located close to the curb of the roadway, and that Andrews gave the cocaine to Vanlandingham who subsequently gave it to Perlmutter for delivery to Galer to effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>tuate the sale. This testimony relates exclusively to <em>acts </em>of Andrews rather than declarations. These facts thus establish the existence of the conspiracy together with Andrews\u2019 participation therein beyond a reasonable doubt. Under such circumstances, Perlmutter\u2019s testimony relative to statements made during the course of the conspiracy did not carry the weight so often attendant thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">We have considered Andrews\u2019 remaining allegations of error. We hold that they are individually and collectively without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">WE AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">. Rule 104.
