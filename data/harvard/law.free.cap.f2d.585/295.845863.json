The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, resulting in this appeal. We affirm as to the refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Mrs. Proesel died on August 12, 1965. The Executor of her Estate consented to \u201csplit gift tax\u201d treatment for certain gifts made by Mr. Proesel, as he was authorized to do by her will. He then paid half of the ensuing gift tax liability with funds from the Estate. The question presented by this case is whether the gift taxes paid by the Estate are deductible for estate tax purposes. The key clause in Mrs. Proesel\u2019s will is contained in Article III, Section 6(p), which authorizes her Executor</p>\n<p id=\"A7v\">\u201cto join with my husband or with his personal representative in a * * * gift tax return covering any period of time for which such * * * [return has] not been filed by me, and in any manner to otherwise affirm or disaffirm the filing by my husband of a * * * gift tax return covering any period of time for which such * * * [return] may be filed by my husband; and to pay in connection with any such return or returns such taxes, interest and penalties as to my Executor may seem proper, without the necessity of allocating any portion thereof to my husband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">During 1964, Mrs. Proesel\u2019s husband, Henry made taxable gifts of real property valued at $429,137.68 for final gift tax purposes. Because of an extension of time granted by the Internal Revenue Service, he did not file the gift tax return until January 3, 1966, several months after his wife\u2019s death, pursuant to the split gift provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2513).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his gift tax return Mr. Proesel reported that under Section 2513 one-half of the gifts were to be considered as having been made by his deceased wife. On the same day, as Executor of his wife\u2019s estate, he filed another gift tax return consenting to the split gift election. The Government concedes that the above-quoted language of Mrs. Proesel\u2019s will authorized him to do so, and that Treasury Regulation 25.2513-2(c) (note 14 <em>infra) </em>recognizes the validity of such an election of an executor, for gift tax purposes. Mr. Proesel paid on his own behalf $44,955 (plus interest) in gift tax and as Executor he paid the same amount on behalf of his wife\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">On the federal estate tax return, Mrs. Proesel\u2019s Estate sought to deduct the gift tax and interest paid by the Estate pursuant to the split gift election, as a claim against the Estate under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2053(a)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This was disallowed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on the ground that the gift taxes and interest in question were not personal obligations of Mrs. Proesel at the time of her death and therefore did not fall within Section 2053(a)(3). The Estate thereafter paid the additional estate taxes claimed by the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>missioner, and the Trustees of Mrs. Proe-sel\u2019s Testamentary Trust filed a claim for refund. After a refund was denied, this suit was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\n<em>Section 20.2058(4) of the Treasury Regulations on Estate Tax Bars the Claimed Deduction.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In the district court, both parties requested summary judgment. As noted, the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted. In the accompanying unreported memorandum opinion and order, the district court held that Mrs. Proesel\u2019s Estate may not \u201cdeduct from the estate tax return federal gift taxes which were paid by the Executor who was both the donor and the husband of decedent, after he had elected the \u2018split gift tax\u2019 treatment under Section 2513 subsequent to his wife\u2019s death and in accordance with the intention expressed in her will.\u201d The opinion noted that Section 2513 was designed to equalize beneficial tax treatment of gifts by married couples in common-law jurisdiction such as Illinois with that accorded gifts by married couples in community property states.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The district court refused to grant the requested refund because while Treasury Regulation 20.2053-4 states \u201cLiabilities imposed by law * * * are deductible,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Treasury Regulation 20.2053-6(d) provides that \u201cNo portion of the tax attributable to a gift in fact made by the decedent spouse is deductible except to the extent that the obligation is <em>enforced against the decedent\u2019s estate * * </em>* \u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district judge concluded that the gift tax was not enforced against the decedent or her estate, as required by Regulation 20.-2053-6(d), since she was neither the donor nor the donee of the real estate in question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although an effective consent to \u201csplit\u201d the gift under Section 2513 makes the non-donor spouse jointly and severally liable for the full gift tax due,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the district court concluded that \u201cno such liability was \u2018imposed\u2019 on the Estate until such time \u2014 decidedly after decedent\u2019s death \u2014 that consent to treat the matter under \u00a7 2513 was filed by the executor.\u201d Thus the Estate had no gift tax liability within the meaning of Regulation 20.2053-4. For these reasons, plaintiffs were not permitted to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>the requested deduction under Section 2053(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In affirming, we rest our holding on Section 20.2053-4 of the Treasury Regulations on Estate' Tax (note 3 supra). This Regulation was approved in <em>United States v. Stapf, </em>375 U.S. 118, 132, 84 S.Ct. 248, 11 L.Ed.2d 195, and its legality is not challenged by plaintiffs. The Regulation provides that claims against a decedent\u2019s estate are deductible only if they \u201crepresent personal obligations of the decedent existing at the time of his death.\u201d We agree with the district court that when Mrs. Proesel died in August 1965, she was not liable for any portion of the gift taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on the transfers by her husband in 1964 because she was neither the donor nor the donee of such gifts, nor had she assumed liability for such tax under Section 2513(a)(2) (note 1 <em>supra) </em>at the time of her death.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, the $44,-955 gift tax paid in January 1966 by her estate did not \u201crepresent personal obligations of the decedent existing at the time of [her] death\u201d as required by Section 20.-2053-4 of the Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">For a contrary result, plaintiffs argue that the gift taxes paid by Mrs. Proesel\u2019s Estate were \u201cLiabilities imposed by law\u201d within the meaning of the last sentence of Section 20.2\u00d353-4 (note 3 <em>supra) </em>and therefore deductible. In our view, this sentence was meant to show the type of claims that are deductible and was not intended to abrogate the earlier requirement of this Section that the claims are only deductible if they represent personal obligations of the decedent existing at the time of death, whether in respect to contract, tort, tax or any other obligation imposed by law. Moreover, since the liability was assumed by the Estate voluntarily (Br. 17, 23) without any consideration,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> this gift tax liability was not at the time of Mrs. Proesel\u2019s death \u201cenforceable against the decedent\u2019s estate\u201d \u2014still another requirement of Section 20.-2053-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">In urging reversal, plaintiffs also rely on the clause \u201cwhether or not then matured\u201d in the first sentence of Section 20.2053-4, asserting that the Executor\u2019s consent to the application of the split gift provisions should relate back and be given effect as an obligation of the decedent existing at the time of death. We disagree. In context with the rest of this Regulation, the purpose of this phrase is to permit deduction of claims against the estate if they are personal obligations of the decedent existing at the time of death whether or not they were due to be paid at the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Our interpretation of the Regulation in question is not unduly harsh. Here Mr. Proesel received the benefit of reduced gift tax rates on gifts made prior to the death of his wife even though she died before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>consenting to the split gift provisions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Absent those provisions, Mr. Proesel would have had to pay higher gift taxes, so that the community property aspect of the impact of the gift tax has been realized. This Regulation does not allow an estate tax deduction for a gift tax liability which the decedent remained free not to assume at the time of her death. Otherwise, as the Government states, \u201cthe estate tax would be imposed on something other than the transmission of the actual net estate as of the time of death\u201d (Br. 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 principal contention is that if Section 20.2053-4 is construed to bar an estate tax deduction for the late Mrs. Proe-sel, the provision of Section 20.2053-6(d) (note 4 <em>supra), </em>providing for deductibility of unpaid gift taxes when the \u201csplit gift\u201d election has been made, would come into play in only two unimportant circumstances (Plaintiffs\u2019 Br. 18-20; Reply Br. 9 n. 7).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, since our affirmance is based on Section 20.2053-4, which plainly bars this deduction, we need not consider whether Section 20.2053-6(d) may be of somewhat limited applicability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\n<em>Decedent\u2019s Pre-Death Intention to Consent Is Immaterial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">As an alternative argument, plaintiffs assert that summary judgment should not have been granted to the Government because they can show that decedent had agreed to the split gift treatment of her spouse\u2019s 1964 transfers prior to her August 12, 1965, death. They suggest first that they could show an agreement to split the gift which would be enforceable against the Estate. This is based on the theory that since the donees of the real estate were Proesel family members, a third party contract may have been formed for their benefit. But under Section 20.2053-4 of the Treasury Regulations, an agreement must be \u201cfor an adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth\u201d to justify an estate tax deduction. This is true even if the agreement is enforceable under state law, as noted in <em>United States v. Stapf, supra, </em>375 U.S. at 131, 84 S.Ct. at 257: \u201ca deduction under \u00a7 812(b) [the predecessor of Section 2053] should not be predicated solely on the finding that a promise or claim is legally enforceable under the state laws governing the validity of contracts and wills.\u201d In our view, plaintiffs\u2019 novel third-party-beneficiary theory, advanced only at oral argument, fails to meet the \u201cmoney or money\u2019s worth\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The plaintiffs, however, advance still another argument \u2014 that the authorization in Mrs. Proesel\u2019s will for her Executor to make the election establishes her pre-death con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>sent. The language in Mrs. Proesel\u2019s will<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> on which plaintiffs rely however, did not establish a claim \u201cenforceable against the decedent\u2019s estate\u201d as also required by the same Treasury Regulation (Section 20.2053-4). The fact that \u201cThe executor * * * of a deceased spouse * * * may signify the consent\u201d (Regulation \u00a7 25.2513-2(c))<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> does not show that Mrs. Proesel had agreed to the split gift treatment. Indeed it reinforces the Government\u2019s contention that at the time of her death she did not know whether her Executor would seek split gift treatment, even though he had the authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Finally, the plaintiffs urge that the Executor\u2019s authorized consent \u201crelates back\u201d to the date of death. However, to make decedent personally liable at the time of her death, as required by Section 20.2053-4 of the Regulations (note 3 supra), her consent had to be signified on her husband\u2019s return or on her own return, as provided by Section 25.2513-2(c) of the Regulations. Under unchallenged Rev.Ruling 70-600,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the consent had to be prior to her death, so that it is immaterial that under Section 25.2513-2(c) the executor of a deceased spouse may later signify the consent. It is also immaterial that Mrs. Proesel may have intended to consent, had she lived.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">For these reasons, the district court correctly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact needing resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">Judgment affirmed as to the estate tax deduction for gift taxes; judgment vacated and cause remanded for determination of plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\">.

Although the district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 claim for an additional estate tax deduction for the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in this litigation, the Government now agrees that the Estate is entitled to a deduction for reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees under Section 2053(a)(2) permitting deductions \u201cfor administration expenses\u201d (Br. 4, n. 2). Therefore, a remand will be necessary to determine the proper amount of this deduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel suggested at oral argument that the holding of the district court, taken together with Section 2513(b) of the Code (note 1 supra), presents a \u201cCatch-22\u201d situation. Apparently he meant that because one cannot file <em>the </em>consent until after the end of the calendar quarter in which the gift was made, if one dies before the end of such a quarter his estate loses the ability to deduct any gift taxes it elects to pay under the \u201csplit gift\u201d provisions. This is true, but if this result is perceived as an overwhelming hardship, it would be necessary for Congress to modify Section 2513(b) to allow for consents to be filed as soon as the gift is made. Certainly we may not create a judicial exception to the fundamental requirement of Section 20.2053-4 of the Treasury Regulations \u2014 already approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Staph, supra </em>\u2014that only obligations existing at the time of the decedent\u2019s death are deductible from the estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b388-13\">. At oral argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel suggested that a contract enforceable against the Estate might be proved, based on reliance by third party beneficiaries. For the reasons developed <em>infra, </em>we reject this as insufficient to create a liability which would support a deduction under Section 2053.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\">. Plaintiffs have alleged that our holding will render meaningless the Regulation permitting an executor to consent to \u201csplit the gift\u201d (Section 25.2513-2(c), note 14 <em>infra). </em>While this is not entirely germane to construing the Regulation before us, we do not in any event accept the plaintiffs\u2019 contention. First, they say that splitting the gift will not always result in a lower total gift tax liability. The answer to this, of course, is that in that case the Executor need not make the election. Second, the plaintiffs say that under our holding the Executor will be unable to consent because to do so would be a breach of his fiduciary obligation to the beneficiaries. To the extent that there is such a conflict (and there may not be, if splitting the gift results in no gift tax liability or if the Executor is the sole beneficiary or if the beneficiaries consent), it exists whether or not the gift taxes assumed by the Estate are deductible. It is true that the Estate will be depleted more if the gift taxes are not deductible, but in no event can it be in the beneficiaries\u2019 interest for the Estate to undertake to pay gift taxes not otherwise due. Surely a fiduciary\u2019s obligation is not measured by the magnitude of the expense he voluntarily incurs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b389-12\">.

Section 20.2053-6(d) provides for the de-ductibility of gift taxes on gifts made by the decedent before his death or considered as made one-half each by the decedent and his spouse, under Section 2513.

The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel contended at oral argument that Rev.Ruling 78-27 (1978-3 I.R.B. 11) and <em>Jones v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>327 F.2d 98 (4th Cir. 1964), establish that consent may sometimes be \u201csignified\u201d other than by the signature of the consenting spouse on the requisite return. He offered to prove that Mrs. Proesel \u201csignified\u201d such consent by demonstrating her intention to file the consent form. The <em>Jones </em>case held that when the proper return was filed on time and the signature omitted, apparently inadvertently, this technicality would not invalidate the consent. Rev. Ruling 78-27, on the other hand, held that a timely consent signed for the wife by the husband, as an accommodation to her, was invalid. Both of these situations dealt only with the technical requirements of otherwise timely and valid consents. They provide no authority for equating a consent (through the timely filing of the return) with the bare intention to consent. This result is not unusually harsh. By analogy, a decedent might have manifested an unmistakably clear intent to make a gift, or even have made an enforceable agreement to make a gift. But if the gift is not completed before death, we take it that the plaintiffs would not suggest that the gift could be excluded from the estate, even though it might in fact later be delivered to the intended donee. Similarly, in the present case, death cuts off the decedent\u2019s power to transfer the funds at issue (here the gift taxes she might otherwise have elected to pay) out of her estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
