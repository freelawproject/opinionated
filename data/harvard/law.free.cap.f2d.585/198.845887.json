No. 91-375, 84 Stat. 731 (codified at 39 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et <em>seq.) </em>or the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Appellants are former employees of USPS <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and members of the Union; neither was a preference-eligible employee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They were discharged from USPS while covered by the 1973 National Collective Bargaining Agreement (\u201cNational Agreement\u201d) between USPS and the Union. Article XVI of the National Agreement provided that \u201c[n]o employee may be disciplined or discharged except for just cause.\u201d As permitted by 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206(b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> article XV of the National Agreement set forth a series of steps in the grievance procedure which could culminate in binding third-party arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\n<em>The Grievance Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AZI\">On July 18, 1973, appellant Winston was given a thirty-day written notice of discharge based upon an allegation that on May 26, 1973, he had \u201cthreatened to kill a supervisor who was on duty.\u201d In accordance with article XV of the National Agreement, Winston filed a grievance with a representative of the Union. The grievance procedure provided for an employee to be represented by a union representative, who, in this case, was the treasurer of the local union. Step 1 of the grievance procedure consisted of an informal discussion between Winston and his Union representative with his immediate supervisor. The grievance was orally denied on July 19, 1973. Stlbse-quently, a step 2A appeal was filed. On August 2, 1973, the grievance was denied after an informal discussion between Winston and his Union representative with a representative of the Chicago Postmaster.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Winston filed a step 2B appeal which resulted in an \u201cinformal hearing on the merits\u201d between the USPS Chicago District Director of Employee and Labor Relations and another Union representative for Winston. At this \u201chearing,\u201d the Postal Inspection Service Investigative Summary was discussed. It consisted of statements of Winston, the supervisor who instituted the charge against him, and four supervisory employees who had witnessed the May 26, 1973, incident. Winston states in this appeal, without contradiction by appellees, that evidence of his witnesses, whose names he had given to the Union representative, was not submitted, that he was not allowed to be present, and that no witnesses were called, interviewed, or subjected to cross-examination. On December 4, 1973, the grievance was again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">Pursuant to section 3 of article XV of the National Agreement, Winston requested that the Union demand arbitration of his grievance, but the request was denied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Winston was formally discharged on January 8, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Appellant Cummings was given a thirty-day notice of discharge on August 30, 1973, based on allegations that she had \u201cmisappropriated postal funds in the years 1972 &amp; 1973. \u201d She followed the same grievance procedures as Winston, with the same result, and was discharged effective March 1, 1974. Her appeal to CSC was, like Winston\u2019s, denied. Cummings states, without contradiction by appellees, that she was denied an opportunity to appear, present evidence, and cross-examine adverse witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\n<em>The District Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Appellants contended before the district court<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the grievance procedure of the National Agreement violated both 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(b)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, they alleged that they were discharged without an opportunity for a fair hearing, including the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses and to present evidence of their own to rebut the charges against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">In its order of April 13, 1977, the district court granted summary judgment to USPS and the Union. It concluded that the legislative history of PRA \u201cmakes clear that non-preference eligible employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are limited to grievance procedures [under those agreements] in resolving adverse actions.\u201d 432 F.Supp. at 1119. It found that 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005(a)(2) gives preference-eligible employees alternative remedies of (1) appeal to the CSC for a \u201ctrial type\u201d hearing, or (2) the. collective bargaining agreement procedure. But it found no alternative remedies for nonpreference-eligible employees on the basis that, under 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005(a)(1), access to the CSC ends when such access would be inconsistent with the \u201cprovisions of any collective-bargaining agreement negotiated on behalf of and applicable to them.\u201d The court was not persuaded that 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 reflects a Congressional intent that a \u201ctrial type\u201d hearing be required before dismissal of non-preference-eligible employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">Addressing the constitutional issue, the district court held that postal workers, as federal employees, have a sufficient property interest in continued employment to entitle them to Fifth Amendment protection, but that \u201cthe grievance procedure established by the agreement between USPS and the Union satisfies Due Process.\u201d 432 F.Supp. at 1121. Citing the plurality opinion by Mr. Justice Rehnquist in <em>Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-14\">Since Congress created the property interest in continued employment in the Act [PRA] and in the same Act set forth the procedure for protection of that interest, this Court may find that employees of USPS were entitled to no Due Process protection beyond that afforded by the collective bargaining agreement ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">Nevertheless, the court, assuming that an independent examination of the grievance procedures was required, concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>due process does not necessarily include a \u201ctrial type\u201d hearing and is satisfied where, as here, the grievance procedures provide: (1) notice to the employees of the pending charges; (2) an opportunity to be heard by presenting grievances through a \u201crepresentative of their own choosing,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>the Union; and (3) authority for the representative to bring further proceedings before a neutral arbiter and to be sued if failure to bring the case to an arbiter \u201cwas a breach of duty to fairly represent.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">I. <em>Statutory Interpretation Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Relying on 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(b), appellants argue that Congress specifically provided for the full protection of their right to be heard on any adverse actions. They also argue that the \u201cfair hearing requirement\u201d of section 1001(b) includes \u201cthe rights of confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses, and the right to present evidence, as an alternative to grievance procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This is predicated on their contention that the \u201cfair hearing requirement\u201d is not qualified by or subordinate to any grievance procedures negotiated by USPS and the Union through collective bargaining. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that legislative history clearly demonstrates Congressional intent that nonpreference-eligible postal employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement are to be limited solely to the grievance procedures of that agreement in appealing adverse actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">\n<em>Legislative History of PRA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">The legislative history of the PRA provides a unique source for determining the intent of Congress underlying its postal reform since, as the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee\u2019s report on H.R. 17070<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> observes: \u201cRarely has any subject received as much careful and intensive consideration by a committee of the Congress as this committee has given to the very complex and important subject of postal reform.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 91-1104, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 2, <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 3649, 3651 [hereinafter cited as \u201cHouse Report\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">The first bill to address the subject of postal labor relations with a view to replacing the procedures of traditional government labor relations with those of the private sector was H.R. 4, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> H.R. 4 kept postal employees within the competitive civil service system <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 2125) and gave both individual employees and their union \u201cthe right to present and process grievances and to submit to arbitration unresolved grievances\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 3711(b)). Section 3711(c)(3) required the grievance procedures to include \u201cthe right to call, question, and cross-examine witnesses.\u201d It is this right which appellants argue is contained in 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">Later in 1969, a bill was introduced in behalf of the Administration (H.R. 11750, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969)), under which postal employees could be removed from the competitive civil service <em>(id. </em>at \u00a7 209). There was <em>no provision </em>for the grievance procedures to include an employee\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>call, question, and examine witnesses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The President\u2019s recommendations made clear the intent that nonpreference-eligible employees would have recourse to only the procedures provided under a collective bargaining agreement. House Comm, on Post Office and Civil Service, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., Recommendation of the President of the United States on H.R. 11750, at 152,160 (Comm. Print 1969). It is to be noted that H.R. 11750 became the model for subsequent bills, amendments, and ultimately the PRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Following hearings on these bills, H.R. 4 was reported out of committee;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> however, the sections pertinent to our analysis had been changed to substantially conform to the sections of H.R. 11750.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Under section 209 of the revised H.R. 4, postal employees were not to be covered by other laws relating to federal employees. Section 801(a) required the Postal Service to establish procedures, subject to collective bargaining contracts, \u201cto assure its employees of an opportunity to be heard before adverse actions are to be taken against them.\u201d The Lloyd-LaFollette Act (appeal procedures for adverse actions), chapter 75 of title 5, was made applicable <em>except when there was a collective bargaining agreement in effect.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 91-988, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 20-21, 32-33 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In the aftermath of the March 1970 postal strike, direct negotiations regarding the format of postal reorganization were undertaken between representatives of the President and the unions. Their \u201cMemorandum of Agreement\u201d of April 16,1970, committed the Administration to \u201ccollective bargaining under a statutory framework over <em>all aspects </em>of wages, hours, and working conditions <em>including grievance procedures </em>[emphasis added].\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The President transmitted a new proposed bill, introduced as H.R. 17070, <em>supra </em>note 11, in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement. Section 201(a), in pertinent part, provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">The Postal Service shall establish procedures, subject to subchapter II of this title, ... to assure its employees full protection of their employment rights by guaranteeing them an opportunity for a fair hearing on adverse actions, with representatives of their own choosing. Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the provisions of chapter 75 of title 5 shall apply to employees of the Postal Service except to the extent of any inconsistency with\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">(1) the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement negotiated on behalf of and applicable to them, or</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">(2) procedures established by the Postal Service and approved by the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">The reference to subchapter II was to the \u201cEmployee-Management Relations\u201d portion of the bill which made the National Labor Relations Act applicable to the Postal Service, granted recognition to the unions, and authorized collective bargaining agreements to include procedures for resolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\u201cby the parties of grievances and adverse actions arising under the agreement\u201d (section 227(b)), with arbitration as the final step. H.R. 17070 also included a \u201cfair hearing requirement,\u201d guaranteeing employees \u201can opportunity for a fair, hearing on adverse actions, with representatives of their own choosing.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The personnel and employee relations sections of H.R. 17070 emerged essentially intact from the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. The House Report summarizes the \u201cfair hearing requirement\u201d in words similar to those contained in section 801(a) of the revised H.R. 4:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">[T]he Postal Service is required to establish procedures to assure its employees . of [an] opportunity to be heard before adverse action is taken against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">House Report at 9-10, [1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 3658. We have found no suggestion in the legislative history, and appellants have shown us none, that the above-quoted portion of section 201(a) of H.R. 17070 was intended to expand postal employees\u2019 rights beyond those provided in section 801(a) of the revised H.R. 4; or that the \u201cfair hearing requirement\u201d was meant to provide an alternative, for appeal of adverse actions, to that of a collective bargaining agreement. Moreover, the House Report makes clear that H.R. 17070 would limit grievance procedures for non-preference eligibles<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to those negotiated in a collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It states that section 201(a)\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">Provides that existing, law on adverse actions shall continue to apply to employees of the Postal Service <em>except as modified by collective bargaining agreements </em>or except as new procedures are approved by the Civil Service Commission. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 27, [1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 3676.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">A review of the House debate on H.R. 17070 also demonstrates that the \u201cfair hearing\u201d was to be provided through a collective bargaining agreement. Congressman Udall, a member of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee and a sponsor of H.R. 17070, explained the status of the \u201cnew postal worker after reform\u201d and declared that he would \u201cbecome a new kind of Federal civil servant\u201d and that, because of collective bargaining, he would become \u201ca viable force in creating real changes in his working conditions.\u201d 116 Cong.Rec. 20229 (1970). Mr. Udall added that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AG5\">every law, rule and regulation that covered the rights of the postal employee subject to collective bargaining would continue in force until they are changed through negotiations between the employees and management. Thus, this worker will continue to be guaranteed his job, his merit appointment and promotion procedures, his health benefits \u2014 everything like this \u2014 until such matters are changed through collective bargaining. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Id.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Congressman Derwinski, another member of the committee, asserted a similar understanding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">All other terms and conditions of employment in effect when the Postal Service commences operations \u2014 including rates of pay, fringe benefits, seniority, rights on adverse actions, and so forth \u2014will continue to apply unless changed by the Postal Service, and as far as employees who are represented by collective bargaining agents are concerned, any such change will be subject to collective bargaining as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">. [T]he statutory provisions relating to adverse actions in the competitive civil service will be applicable, except to the extent of any inconsistency with applicable collective bargaining agreements . . ., subject always to the provisions of the Veterans Preference Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 20231.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The legislative history of the Senate bill, S. 3842, <em>supra </em>note 11,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> is also persuasive that grievance procedures must be handled solely in accordance with collective bargaining agreements. This bill would have required <em>both </em>preference and nonpreference eligibles to appeal adverse actions solely under the grievance procedures of a collective bargaining agreement. The report of the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee commented on this requirement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">Employees who have competitive status under the Civil Service Act of 1883 shall automatically achieve career tenure under the postal career system, but thereafter the provisions of title 5, United States Code, relating to the competitive service shall not apply to officers and employees of the Postal Service. The Postal Service shall establish, pursuant to its collective bargaining agreements with postal labor unions and its programs developed for the offices [sic] and employees not subject to such agreements, a system which will assure career development and protection of employment rights. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">Veterans\u2019 preference shall apply to officers and employees in the Postal Service, but may in certain circumstances be subject to modification by labor-manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ment agreements or programs developed for supervisory personnel. The committee recognizes the significant departure from the present status of preference eli-gibles which this provision makes, but we believe that if collective bargaining is to work, it must have the power to establish a seniority and retention system based primarily on postal career service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqe-dedup-0\">S.Rep.No.91-912, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 5-6 (1970). Although an amendment preserving existing veterans\u2019 preference rights for postal employees was subsequently adopted during debate on the floor (116 Cong.Rec. 22337 (1970)), there was no amendment with respect to the appeal rights of non-preference eligibles. Thus, it is clear that the Senate understood that appeal rights of nonpreference eligibles to adverse actions were to be solely determined by collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\n<em>Congressional Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Based on the theory that among the postal reform bills there were conflicting goals<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (securing full Lloyd-LaFollette Act coverage for all postal employees versus subjecting all employment conditions to the collective bargaining process), appellants argue that two changes made by the Conference Committee to section 201(a) of the bill resulted in a substantial alteration of the meaning of what became section 1001(b) of PRA,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">The final bill approved by the Conference- Committee and passed by both Houses of Congress, then, represents an obvious comprise [sic], intended to satisfy both the need for greater administrative efficiency and the committment [sic] to retain the fundamental requisites of due process for employees subjected to adverse actions. The cumbersome regulations requiring not one but two full evi-dentiary hearings on adverse actions were eliminated. Instead, the new Postal Service would be required only to provide one hearing, within the agency, without any right to appeal to the Civil Service Commission. Moreover, the Postal Service was left free to negotiate grievance procedures which could be chosen by an employee as an alternative to requesting the hearing made available pursuant to \u00a71001(b). This compromise solution preserved the right of postal employees to at least one evidentiary hearing, while also providing flexibility and administrative efficiency for the new Postal Service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2V\">However, we have several difficulties with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">First, there is no indication in the Conference Report that either of the changes was substantive, and there is nothing to support appellants\u2019 contention that these changes were considered \u201ccrucial\u201d and were the result of an \u201cobvious compromise.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Second, as related earlier, by the time H.R. 17070 was reported out of committee there was no conflict over whether the terms and conditions of postal workers\u2019 employment would be determined solely by a collective bargaining agreement or whether full Lloyd-LaFollette Act protection would be granted. Finally, an analysis of the changes themselves reveals that they were \u201cminor technical and clarifying changes,\u201d as described by the Conference Report. The need for the first change (putting the last sentence of section 201(a), which dealt with the applicability of chapter 75 of title 5, into section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>1005(a)(1) of PRA) is obvious from the heading of section 1005, \u201cApplicability of laws relating to Federal employees.\u201d The second change (substituting \u201cin accordance with this title\u201d for \u201csubject to subchapter II of this title\u201d) did not alter the meaning of the affected sentence and was necessitated by the first change. The language of section 1001(b) of PRA was required to subject the \u201cfair hearing requirement\u201d to all collective bargaining provisions of PRA. Section 201(a) of H.R. 17070 had done this by reference to subchapter II; however, because of the first change, the \u201cfair hearing requirement\u201d would not have been subjected to section 1005(a)(1). Therefore, the Conference Committee substituted the broader language \u201cin accordance with this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We conclude that there is no basis for appellants\u2019 contention that these changes effected a substantive change, much less reflected an intent that adverse action procedures for nonpreference-eligible postal employees not be solely a matter left to collective bargaining. We note that this conclusion is consistent with what would be expected to follow from PRA\u2019s stated purpose, namely: that the labor-management provisions \u201cwould bring postal labor relations within the same structure that exists for nationwide enterprises in the private sector.\u201d House Report at 13, [1970] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 3662.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Appellants further argue that, to make the \u201cfair hearing requirement\u201d of section 1001(b) of PRA subject to section 1206(b) (which makes grievance procedures a subject of collective bargaining), would ignore the cardinal rule of statutory construction that specific terms prevail over general ones. However, this ignores that the section creating the \u201cfair hearing requirement\u201d specifically requires that it be \u201cin accordance with this title.\u201d Throughout the legislative history of both the House and Senate bills, the \u201cfair hearing requirement\u201d was similarly limited.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Moreover, the \u201cfair hearing requirement\u201d was, since its first appearance, qualified by the phrase \u201cwith representatives of their [postal employees] own choosing.\u201d As discussed <em>infra, </em>it is through their union representatives that postal workers receive the \u201cfair hearing\u201d which satisfies the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Since there has been no argument to the contrary by appellants, grievance procedures which satisfy the due process clause may be presumed to pass the \u201cfair hearing requirement\u201d of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Accordingly, we hold that the grievance procedures adopted for nonpreference-eligi-ble postal employees by USPS and the Union do not violate the Postal Reorganization Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">II. <em>The Constitutional Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">Appellants\u2019 argument that the grievance procedures of the National Agreement violate their rights to due process raises two issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">(1) Did appellants have a property interest in continued employment with USPS; and, if so,</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">(2) Did the grievance procedures of the National Agreement satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process for protection of that property interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">Fundamental to the due process issue is the fact that appellants are employees in a national collective bargaining unit subject, under 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1209(a), to the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>Through PRA, Congress brought USPS employees into the labor relations mode of the private sector.

In grievances arising out of problems not foreseen at the time of contract negotiations, although the issue is nominally framed by the past, the important question is often what rule shall govern the parties\u2019 conduct in the future. The group may be affected by future implications of the ruling to an extent that far outweighs the individual\u2019s claim for damages. Vesting the Union with control of all grievances increases the likelihood of uniformity and reduces \u201ca potential source of competitions and discriminations that could be destructive of the entire structure of labor relations in the plant\u201d. It prevents dissident minorities from pressing real or imagined grievances in an effort to squeeze the last drop of competitive advantage out of each grievance. Allowing an individual to compel arbitration whenever he is dissatisfied with the company-union adjustment would discourage day-to-day cooperation between union and company in which grievances are treated as problems to be solved. Public officials and arbitrators, as well as employers, constantly remind union officials that they have a duty to discountenance disruptive and frivolous claims. If they are to accept this responsibility, union officials should be given the power to make their decisions effective.

It is unnecessary to decide whether appellants\u2019 use of the grievance procedures of the National Agreement constituted a waiver of their due process argument, as contended by the Union.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
