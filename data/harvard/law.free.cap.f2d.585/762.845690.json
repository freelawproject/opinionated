Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 </em>Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b853-6\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The petitioner, Jesus Manuel Sierra-Reyes, was found deportable and denied discretionary relief from deportation by an immigration judge. The Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal and affirmed the order of deportation. We affirm and dismiss this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">The petitioner admits that he was born in Mexico and that his mother is not a United States citizen, and he has never alleged becoming a naturalized American citizen. He was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on January 14, 1952, when he was two months old. He married an American citizen on April 16, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Deportation proceedings were initiated with the issuance of an Order to Show Cause on December 24, 1975. The petitioner was charged with deportability under \u00a7 241(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(a)(4), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">(a) Any alien in the United States (including an alien crewman) shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be deported who\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">(4) . . . at any time after entry is convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct, regardless of whether confined therefor and regardless of whether the convictions were in a single trial;</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">The petitioner was convicted in 1969 of theft and sentenced to two years imprisonment, but sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation. In 1970, petitioner was convicted of burglary and again sentenced to two years imprisonment, with sentence suspended and probation imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">Before the immigration judge and the Board, petitioner argued that he should be granted discretionary relief from deportation under \u00a7 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(c). That section provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">(c) Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General without regard to the provisions of paragraphs (l)-(25), (30), and (31) of subsection (a) of this section. Nothing contained in this subsection shall limit the authority of the Attorney General to exercise the discretion vested in him under section 1181(b) of this title.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-18\">Although the statute is by its terms applicable only to aliens seeking to reenter the United States after a trip abroad, the Board has by interpretation extended its benefits to nondeparting permanent resident aliens who have resided in the United States for over seven years. <em>Matter of Silva, </em>Interim Decision 2532 (BIA 1976), adopting the decision of the Second Circuit, <em>Francis v. INS, </em>2 Cir., 1976, 532 F.2d 268<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. The immigration judge refused to grant petitioner discretionary relief and the Board affirmed. Balancing the affirmative equities \u2014 the petitioner\u2019s lifelong residence in the United States, his marriage to an American citizen, and several attestations to his good character\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>against the adverse factors \u2014 principally, the petitioner\u2019s criminal record \u2014 the Board found itself \u201cunable to exercise our administrative discretion favorably<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">On this petition for review, the petitioner\u2019s principal contention is that he has advanced a nonfrivolous claim to United States citizenship. He apparently rests his claim to citizenship on his long residence in the United States \u2014 he asserts that he is \u201ca product of the United States\u201d and that he \u201cowes no allegiance to any foreign country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Section 106(a)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1105a(a)(5), provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">(5) whenever any petitioner, who seeks review of an order under this section, claims to be a national of the United States and makes a showing that his claim is not frivolous, the court shall (A) pass upon the issues presented when it appears from the pleadings and affidavits filed by the parties that no genuine issue of material fact is presented; or (B) where a genuine issue of material fact as to the petitioner\u2019s nationality is presented, transfer the proceedings to a United States district court for the district where the petitioner has his residence for hearing de novo of the nationality claim and determination as if such proceedings were originally initiated in the district court under the provisions of section 2201 of Title 28. Any such petitioner shall not be entitled to have such issue determined under section 1503(a) of this title or otherwise;</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The statute requires a two-step analysis in determining whether to transfer the proceedings to a District Court: the Court of Appeals must (1) be convinced that the claim is not frivolous \u2014 that is, that the legal theory underlying it is not totally meritless; and (2) determine that there exists a genuine issue of material fact to be resolved. See <em>Agosto v. INS, </em>1978, 436 U.S. 748, 98 S.Ct. 2081, 56 L.Ed.2d 677. In this case neither of these two requirements is satisfied. The material facts are not in dispute, only the legal consequences of those facts. Moreover, the petitioner\u2019s legal theory is meritless. He was born in Mexico, his mother is not an American citizen, and he has never filed a petition for naturalization. There is no provision in the statutes conferring citizenship solely on the basis of long residence in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">The petitioner makes several other related arguments. For example, he argues that if he is an alien and if the deportation statutes therefore apply to him, the application of those statutes in this case violates the equal protection clause. His argument is that by virtue of his long residence, he stands similarly situated to any person born in the United States. Since \u201can individual born in this country would not be deported if he committed the same identical crimes\u201d as the petitioner, the deportation statutes effect an unlawful discrimination. We have considered this and other arguments raised by petitioner and find them merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-13\">. Petitioner\u2019s probation on the 1969 sentence was not revoked following the 1970 conviction. The Government speculates that this was due to the listing of different first names (Manuel\u2014 1969; Jesus M. \u2014 1970) on the records of conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b853-19\">. Because of our resolution of the issues presented by petitioner, we need not decide the extent to which we agree with the reasoning or result of these cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b854-7\">. The petitioner has not attacked this exercise of discretion as such, but has instead argued only that the Board erred in applying the deportation statutes to him at all. Our review of the administrative record has revealed that the immigration judge considered as \u201cadverse factors\u201d two police reports that implicated petitioner in criminal activity. Petitioner was never prosecuted for these alleged crimes, apparently because the prosecuting authorities decided that they had insufficient evidence to prosecute. In our view, these police reports were not probative of anything and should not have been considered as \u201cadverse factors.\u201d <em>Cf. Ras-sano v. INS, </em>7 Cir., 1974, 492 F.2d 220. We are quite concerned about the consideration of and reliance on these police reports by the immigration judge and would be tempted to remand for reconsideration were this a closer case. But since the other evidence revealed, as the immigration -judge observed, a \u201crather lengthy, involved and complicated involvement with law,\u201d and since the petitioner has failed to raise the point on review, we do not think that the consideration of these reports warrants our reversing the Board\u2019s decision. The scope of our review of the Board\u2019s decisions on whether to grant discretionary relief is quite limited. <em>See United States ex rel. Hintopolous v. Shaugh-nessy, </em>353 U.S. 72, 77 S.Ct. 618, 1 L.Ed.2d 652; <em>Carrasco-Favela v. INS, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 563 F.2d 1220, 1222.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
