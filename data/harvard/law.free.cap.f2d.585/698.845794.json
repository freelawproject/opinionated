We agree with that conclusion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">None of Barnette\u2019s x-rays revealed the presence of complicated pneumoconiosis, even as interpreted by the claimant\u2019s readers. Hence, Barnette is not entitled to an irrebuttable presumption, under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.418(a), that he suffers from totally disabling pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Nor is Barnette able to rely on the special presumption made available to some claimants by the interim regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.490. The Secretary was entitled to decide that Barnette\u2019s x-rays did not \u201cestablish the existence of pneumoconiosis,\u201d for purposes of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.490(b)(l)(i), given the negative rereadings by the Secretary\u2019s \u201cB\u201d readers. <em>See Sharpless </em>v. <em>Califa-no, </em>585 F.2d 664 (4th Cir. 1978). Similarly, the results of the claimant\u2019s three pulmonary function studies were inconsistent, but the two most recent studies yielded normal values or values above the interim criteria. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.490(b)(l)(ii). Therefore, the Secretary\u2019s decision, that Barnette\u2019s pulmonary function studies did not establish the rebuttable presumption under the interim regulations, also was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Finally, we conclude that the evidence entitled the Secretary to find that Barnette had not established the rebuttable presumption of totally disabling pneumoconiosis, that is available under the permanent regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.414(b). That provision provides that a claimant with fifteen or more years of coal mine employment is entitled to a presumption that he is totally disabled by pneumoconiosis \u201cif other relevant evidence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling chronic respiratory or pulmonary impairment.\u201d <em>See Petry v. Cali-fano, </em>577 F.2d 860 (4th Cir. 1978). The Secretary acknowledged that Barnette does suffer from a respiratory impairment, but the Secretary ultimately concluded that the impairment was not \u201ctotally disabling,\u201d as is necessary to establish the \u00a7 410.414(b) presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">The regulations permit a claimant to prove that his respiratory impairment is \u201ctotally disabling\u201d by the same means that a claimant would prove that his pneumoconiosis is \u201ctotally disabling\u201d in the absence of any presumption. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.422(a). In some instances, a claimant can establish the existence of a \u201ctotal disability\u201d by certain medical criteria alone, but Barnette\u2019s evidence definitely was insufficient for this purpose. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 410.424(a), 410.-426(b)-(c). Consequently, Barnette must rely on the provision that a respiratory impairment is considered \u201ctotally disabling if other relevant evidence . . . establishes that the miner has ... a chronic respiratory or pulmonary impairment, the severity of which prevents . him not only from doing his previous coal mine work, but also, considering his age, his education, and work experience, prevents . him from engaging in comparable and gainful work.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.426(d). We interpret this regulation to mean that if a claimant\u2019s respiratory impairment would have the described effect on his ability to work, regardless of and apart from any other medical impairments, then the <em>respiratory impairment </em>is \u201ctotally disabling.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.426(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">Aside from the inconclusive x-rays and pulmonary function studies, Barnette\u2019s only evidence that he suffered from a respiratory impairment consisted of his own testimony and three doctors\u2019 medical reports. However, none of those three doctors concluded that Barnette was totally disabled, much less totally disabled by a respiratory impairment. All three of the doctors listed numerous non-compensable medical problems from which Barnette suffers, and none indicated that the respiratory impairment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>was predominant. Two of the doctors appeared to base their diagnoses of pneumoco-niosis and emphysema on x-rays that were reread later as negative for pneumoconio-sis; to that extent, the Secretary was entitled to discount these doctors\u2019 diagnoses of some respiratory impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">After considering all of the evidence, we conclude that the Secretary\u2019s decision that Barnette had failed to establish that his respiratory impairment was \u201ctotally disabling,\u201d was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d The regulations and the 1969 Act generally allocate the burden of proof on the \u201ctotal disability\u201d issue to the claimant, absent a special presumption. Barnette failed to satisfy this burden, so he did not establish the basis for the \u00a7 410.414(b) rebuttable presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Finding that the Secretary\u2019s decision was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d with respect to all of the provisions potentially applicable to Barnette, we affirm the final decision of the Secretary and the district court that Barnette was not entitled to \u201cblack lung\u201d benefits. The claimant, of course, is and has been entitled to request administrative reconsideration of his claim under \u00a7 15 of the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
