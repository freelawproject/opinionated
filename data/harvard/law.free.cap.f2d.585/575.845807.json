(\u201cLannett\u201d or \u201cclaimant\u201d). The Government alleged that the drugs were subject to seizure under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cDrug Act\u201d), 52 Stat. 1052 (1938), <em>codified </em>as <em>amended </em>at, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301-92 (1976), because they were \u201cmisbranded\u201d; that is, their labels did not contain adequate instructions for lay use. Essentially, the Government asserted: (1) that the seized articles were all prescription drugs not generally recognized as safe and effective; (2) that as such, they were \u201cnew drugs\u201d; and (3) that as \u201cnew drugs\u201d they could not be labeled satisfactorily for lay use without the approval of a New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) by the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). On this theory, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Government moved for summary judgment in the district court, and the motion was granted. Because we believe that the district court incorrectly decided that motion, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Federal regulation of the drug industry may be traced to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which Congress required the producers of drugs to list the quantity and nature of potent ingredients in their products and to refrain from labeling their products with false of misleading statements. Some safety requirements were imposed on drug manufacturers under this legislation as well, but the statute contained no provisions to ensure the effectiveness of drug products.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">In 1938, the present Drug Act was introduced and more stringent controls governing the demonstration of a drug\u2019s safety were imposed on drug manufacturers. Under the Act, FDA approval was required for all drugs not generally recognized as safe for human consumption. Such \u201cnew drugs\u201d could not be sold by any company until it had received premarketing clearance by the FDA; only established, generally recognized drug products could bypass th,e approval mechanism. The legislation, however, provided only limited \u201ceffectiveness\u201d provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">Lannett applied for and received marketing clearance, under the 1938 Act, for several of its articles of drugs, including those seized in the instant case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Approval, certified that the FDA regarded Lannett\u2019s products as safe for human consumption and with such FDA certification, Lannett was able to market its drugs. By 1962, Lan-nett\u2019s products were sold to and widely used in the medical profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">In 1962, however, the Drug Act was amended and the statutory definition of \u201cnew drug\u201d was broadened to add greater protection for the consuming public. Under the new standards, a drug would be treated as a \u201cnew drug,\u201d subject to premarketing clearance, if \u201cnot generally recognized . as safe <em>and </em>effective\u201d for the purposes for which the drug was being marketed. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p)(l) (1976) (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The new effectiveness requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>of the 1962 legislation was made retroactive to all drugs which had been the subject of new drug applications under the 1938 statute. Thus, it applied to all drugs which previously had secured FDA premarketing approvals \u2014 as those received by. Lannett for the drugs seized in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The FDA, recognizing that a transitional period would be necessary to review all drug products affected by the 1962 amendments, granted a two-year grace period before revoking any NDAs given under the 1938 Act. This period of time was to be used to assess the evidence of \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of approved drug products. Two years proved to be insufficient time to permit the FDA to evaluate the status of all drugs potentially made \u201cnew drugs\u201d by the 1962 amendments. Therefore, in order to expedite the task of evaluation, the FDA arranged with the National Academy of Sciences \u2014 National Research Council (\u201cNAS-NRC\u201d) to have them review the qualities of the potential \u201cnew drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">NAS-NRC undertook a study of some 4,000 drug formulations for the express purpose of assessing the efficiency of the product. This study, known as the Drug Efficiency Study, was submitted to the FDA for evaluation; the FDA retained authority to accept or reject the findings of NAS-NRC. As a result of the NAS-NRC findings, the FDA set forth in the Federal Register its conclusions and assessment (\u201cDrug Efficiency Study Implementation\u201d or \u201cDESI\u201d notices) of whether a particular drug could be considered \u201ceffective\u201d for use as required by the 1962 amendments to the Drug Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Each of the drugs confiscated in this action, at least in its generic form, was included in the DESI notices. It is conceded that NAS-NRC and the FDA found every one of the claimant\u2019s drugs, in its generic form, to be effective for the purposes that Lan-nett was selling them. Nonetheless, because of possible variations in the manufacturing process used by each individual drug producer, FDA classified all of the drugs tested as \u201cnew drugs,\u201d requiring each producer of the tested drug to file for marketing clearance. In recognition of NAS-NRC\u2019s positive effectiveness evaluation of the drugs, however, the FDA requested that manufacturers file only an Abbreviated New Drug- Application (\u201cANDA\u201d), a short form, requiring proof that the individual manufacturing process for a particular drug yielded an effective product. Filing for an ANDA was intended to ensure that each version of a generic drug would match the generic compound certified as effective in the DESI notice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In response to the FDA requirements, Lannett filed ANDAs for each of the drug products seized in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">Although the generic equivalents of Lan-nett\u2019s drugs were certified as effective for the purposes indicated by Lannett, each of the drugs was also found not to be recognized as effective for other purposes indicated by different manufacturers. As to the indications for which a drug was not found to be effective, the FDA declared the drugs to be \u201cnew drugs\u201d and required manufacturers of the drug for those indications to file an NDA. The FDA further announced that it would give a hearing to any person affected adversely by the withdrawal of the approved drug status for any specific indication of a drug. Lannett could not have qualified for such a hearing, as its drugs were being marketed only for indications approved by the FDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>During the pendency of Lannett\u2019s ANDA application, the FDA allowed it to continue to market its drugs. Under FDA policy, Lannett could continue to manufacture and sell its drug products so long as it attempted to secure an approval of its application. In 1975, however, in response to a district court opinion,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the FDA altered its marketing policy and ordered that marketing of \u201cnew drugs\u201d cease until they were approved by the FDA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Lannett nonetheless continued to market its drugs with pending ANDAs. Not until April of 1976 did the FDA order Lannett to cease the marketing of its drugs. At that time, the FDA informed Lannett that its drugs were unapproved \u201cnew drugs\u201d which could not be marketed legally. Lannett responded to the FDA notice and asserted that it had applications for approval pending and that it needed continued marketing of the drugs pending approval for economic reasons. FDA did not respond to Lannett\u2019s letter and some four months later, it brought this action to condemn and destroy the seized articles of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In its complaint, the Government asked for the seizure of Lannett\u2019s drugs \u2014 all of which are prescription drugs \u2014 alleging that they were misbranded under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352 (1976) which provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">A drug or device shall be deemed to be misbranded\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">(f) <em>Directions for use and warnings on label</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Unless its labeling bears (1) adequate directions for use; . . . <em>Provided, </em>That where any requirement of clause (1) of this subsection, as applied to any drug or device, is not necessary for the protection of the public health, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations exempting such drug or device from such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(f)(1) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-18\">Adequate directions for use \u201cmeans directions under which the layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended,\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.5 (1977). In its complaint the Government argued that Lannett\u2019s drugs, as prescription drugs, by their very nature could not be used to inform the layman. Therefore, the Government contended that unless the drugs were exempt from the \u201cadequate directions\u201d requirement, they would be misbranded.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-19\">FDA regulations provide that a prescription drug for human consumption shall be exempt from the requirement that it bear adequate instructions for lay use if either (a) it is an \u201cold drug\u201d \u2014 generally recognized as safe and effective or (b) it is a \u201cnew drug\u201d the labeling of which is authorized by an approved NDA. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.-100(c)(2) (1977); <em>see </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.115 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-20\">The Government contended that all of Lannett\u2019s drugs were \u201cnew drugs\u201d which had not received approval by the FDA. Therefore, the Government claimed that the drugs could not be exempt from the \u201cadequate directions\u201d requirement of section 352(f)(1) and that they were misbrand-ed. Consequently, FDA asked that the drugs be condemned under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 334(a)(1) (1976) as articles held for sale in interstate commerce, the components of which had been shipped in commerce.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-21\">Lannett\u2019s answer denied that the drugs were misbranded and subject to seizure. The claimant instead stated that its drugs were generally recognized as safe and effective and that therefore they were not \u201cnew drugs.\u201d It asked that the libel be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>After receipt of the answer, the Government moved for summary judgment, filing affidavits to the effect that regardless of the general recognition of safety and effectiveness of generic versions of Lannett\u2019s drugs, Lannett\u2019s drugs were \u201cnew drugs\u201d in the absence of proof of the bioavailability and bioequivalence of the products. The Government also argued that Lannett be precluded from attacking the FDA\u2019s \u201cnew drugs\u201d assessment because the claimant\u2019s filing of ANDAs for the drugs without challenging FDA\u2019s classification of the products constituted a waiver. Lannett filed an affidavit asserting the general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of generic equivalents of its products and asserting that bioavailability and bioequiva-lence are not relevant as to whether a drug is a \u201cnew drug.\u201d Its affidavit also asserted that all of the seized drugs contained adequate instructions for lay use and hence could not be misbranded. Finally, Lannett contended that it was never given an opportunity to challenge the FDA\u2019s \u201cnew drug\u201d determinations and that therefore, it was not precluded from litigating that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">With this background, on May 16, 1977, the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that although the claimant\u2019s affidavit recited facts contradicting those in the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, the contents of Lannett\u2019s affidavit did not rise \u201cto the level of raising disputed questions of fact.\u201d The basis for the court\u2019s decision, however, was unclear. It made no findings of fact as to the manner by which the articles of drugs were misbranded, nor did it hold that the articles were \u201cnew drugs.\u201d Rather, the court outlined general principles of law<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and held only that Lannett could not bypass agency review and relitigate the FDA\u2019s decision that the seized drugs were \u201cnew drugs\u201d within the meaning of the Drug Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">The basis for the district court\u2019s decision to condemn Lannett\u2019s drugs was that Lan-nett\u2019s sole defense, that its products were not \u201cnew drugs,\u201d was precluded by its failure to challenge administratively FDA\u2019s classification of the drugs. The court stated that allowing Lannett to challenge the FDA\u2019s \u201cnew drug\u201d classification in an action in the district court would be \u201ctantamount to permitting a by-pass of the review provided in the [Drug] Act and allowing relitigation in another proceeding.\u201d This, the court asserted, would have run afoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition in <em>Ciba Corp. v. Weinberger, </em>412 U.S. 640, 644, 93 S.Ct. 2495, 2498, 37 L.Ed.2d 230 (1973), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-14\">[W]here there is ... an administrative determination, whether it be explicit or implicit in the withdrawal of an NDA, the tactic of \u201creserving\u201d the threshold question (the jurisdictional issue) for later judicial determination is not tolerable. There is judicial review of FDA\u2019s ruling. But petitioner, having an opportunity to litigate the \u201cnew drug\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>issue before the FDA and to raise the issue on appeal to a court of appeals, may not relitigate the issue in another proceeding. <em>Yakus v. United States, </em>321 U.S. 414, 444-446 [64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Lannett contends that the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Ciba </em>was misplaced because: (1) Lannett was never given an actual hearing in which it could contest the status of the drugs; (2) at the time the drugs were classified as new, the FDA indicated that the drugs were considered safe and effective for all indications under which Lannett was selling the drugs; (3) at the time the drugs were reclassified, the FDA permitted their continued marketing subject only to an ANDA covering Lannett\u2019s specific manufacturing process; (4) not until April of 1976 was Lannett fully apprised that it was in danger of losing its drugs; and (5) within four months of the notice from the FDA this suit was commenced. Lannett therefore asserts that this suit was the first opportunity for it to litigate the \u201cnew drug\u201d issue and the first time in which that status affected it adversely.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">FDA concedes that Lannett could not have qualified for a hearing under its regulations and that Lannett could not have litigated \u201cnew drug\u201d status before any court of appeals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It asserts, nonetheless, that whenever FDA issued each declaration of \u201cnew drug\u201d status, Lannett could have challenged such declaration in the district court or by petition or letter to the agency. FDA contends that the instant it classified Lannett\u2019s drugs as new and required an ANDA, Lannett was aggrieved and could have challenged the decision and that therefore, the district court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">We believe that the FDA and the district court have given undue deference to the agency and have in essence precluded Lannett from challenging the status of its products. It is undoubtedly true that Lannett could have written the FDA and requested that its drugs not be classified as new. However, it is equally certain that there was no reason for Lannett to do so because it was not affected adversely by the \u201cnew drug\u201d classification. Until 1975, it legally sold its drugs,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and even after FDA decided to withdraw marketing approval, Lannett was not affected until it received a letter from FDA notifying it to cease marketing. Under those circumstances, we believe it error for the district court to have precluded Lannett from challenging \u201cnew drug\u201d status. We therefore must reverse.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">Although we hold that this case must be reversed because the district court erroneously precluded Lannett from litigating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\u201cnew drug\u201d status of its products, we feel compelled to address the critical issues the district court will face on remand as well, for we may lend guidance to prevent another appeal. We therefore briefly address the following critical questions: (A) are there issues of fact pertaining to the \u201cnew drug\u201d status of Lannett\u2019s products precluding summary judgment? and (B) even if the drugs are new, may they be condemned or destroyed?</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">A new drug is \u201c[a]ny drug that ... is not generally recognized [by qualified experts] as safe and effective\u201d for uses suggested by its labeling. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p)(l) (1976). Under the statute, such a \u201cnew drug\u201d cannot be marketed without prior approval by the FDA.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> No doubt exists that the FDA has listed Lan-nett\u2019s drugs as \u201cnew drugs\u201d within the Drug Act; similarly, no doubt exists that at the time of the condemnation, none of Lan-nett\u2019s ANDAs was approved.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> What is at issue, in view of the FDA\u2019s concession that certain generic drugs almost identical to Lannett\u2019s are generally recognized as safe and effective, is whether Lannett\u2019s drugs may be considered \u201cnew drugs\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The FDA admits that data exists from which experts have concluded that certain generic formulations of Lannett\u2019s products are safe and effective for human consumption. But, the Government asserts that these judgments may not be applied directly to Lannett because there is no sound basis to extrapolate judgments of one manufacturer\u2019s drugs to another\u2019s products. The FDA instead maintains that for each specific drug product there must be general recognition of its safety and efficacy. This, the FDA contends, is especially true if applied to the bioavailability (ability of the active ingredient of a drug to get to the bloodstream), the bioequivalence (comparison of one drug to another), and the quality control problems of specific drugs such as Lannett\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">In contrast to the FDA\u2019s new drug theory is that espoused by Lannett. Lannett\u2019s basic contention is that all of its drugs have been admitted by the Government as being the same generically as a drug already approved as safe and effective. Therefore, it contends that all that is required by the \u201cnew drug\u201d <em>section </em>\u2014 general safety and effectiveness recognition \u2014 has been provided and that bioavailability, bioequivalence, and other quality control tests are irrelevant as to safety and efficacy. Lannett points to other provisions of the Drug Act and the regulations which the FDA can utilize to sanction a manufacturer for a drug which does not perform according to specifications for the generic drug,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and from this, rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>sons that FDA is not authorized to take a specific manufacturer\u2019s methods of production into account when assessing \u201cnewness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We believe Lannett\u2019s position to be correct. FDA\u2019s own regulations as to the definition of \u201cnewness\u201d of a drug, though not purporting to be exhaustive, conspicuously omit any reference to anything like quality control or a specific product\u2019s capabilities:</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">(h) The newness of a drug may arise by reason (among other reasons) of:</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">(1) The newness for drug use of any substance which composes such drug, in whole or in part, whether it be an active substance or a menstruum, excipient, carrier, coating, or other component.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">(2) The newness for a drug use of a combination of two or more substances none of which is a new drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">(3) The newness for drug use of the proportion of a substance in a combination, even though such combination containing such substance in other proportion is not a new drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">(4) The newness of use of such drug in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, treating, or preventing a disease, or to affect a structure or function of the body, even though such drug is not a new drug when used in another disease or to affect another structure or function of the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">(5) The newness of a dosage, or method or duration of administration or application, or other condition of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of such drug even though such drug when used in other dosage, or other method or duration of administration or application, or different condition, is not a new drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-16\">21 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.3(h)(l)-(5) (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-17\">A close reading of the FDA\u2019s \u201cnew drug\u201d regulation indicates that newness is a function of the novelty of a particular formulation, including a novel composition, combination, dosage, or administration. It extends so far as to encompass new uses for a drug or new methods of application, but nothing within the regulation indicates a scope as broad as that advocated by FDA. The absence of any regulatory provision setting forth a manufacturer\u2019s production techniques as an element making a formulation \u201cnew\u201d is powerful evidence that FDA\u2019s theory is not based strongly on the statute. In fact, if the FDA\u2019s theory were supported by the Drug Act, its \u201cnewness\u201d regulation would be superfluous for under the FDA\u2019s theory any new manufacture of a generic drug, whether approved or not, would be a \u201cnew drug\u201d in the absence of general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of the new manufacture. The absence of such a provision in the regulations undercuts FDA\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-18\">The cases lend additional support to the conclusion that there is no need for general recognition of each manufacturer\u2019s particular production techniques. In <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, Inc., </em>412 U.S. 609, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973), the Supreme Court, in deciding that the FDA had rule-making power to declare a generic compound a \u201cnew drug,\u201d also confirmed the FDA\u2019s power to make that declaration applicable to all \u201cme-too\u201d drugs \u2014 those purporting to be the same as the generic formulation. 412 U.S. at 625, 93 S.Ct. at 2469. This, the court indicated, was for the purpose of ensuring administrative efficiency because \u201cparalysis would re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>suit if case-by-case battles in the courts were the only way to protect the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626, 93 S.Ct. at 2481. Moreover, the Court indicated that a case-by-case approach could result in inequities, allowing one manufacturer to market its goods while another was litigating with the FDA. <em>Id. </em>Although concerned with <em>eliminating </em>harmful drugs from public sale and not <em>permitting </em>drugs to be marketed, the Court\u2019s reasoning is supportive of Lannett\u2019s position\u2014 \u201cme-too\u201d drugs carry the same qualities as generic drugs, irrespective of individual manufacturing differences, and therefore should be treated the same for purposes of the Drug Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Similarly, <em>United States v. An Article of Drug . . . \u201cMykocert\u201d, </em>345 F.Supp. 571 (N.D.Ill.1972), supports Lannett\u2019s assertion that its drugs may escape \u201cnew drug\u201d classification if they are generally recognized as containing the same characteristics as generic drugs. In that condemnation case, the claimant defended seizure asserting that its drugs were not \u201cnew.\u201d The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">Claimant\u2019s contention that Mykocert is not a new drug can only succeed if it is recognized by experts in the field as safe and effective. There are two possible alternatives that would substantiate claimant\u2019s assertions. <em>Either a Mykocert type drug in its exact form, dosage, and application must be recognized by experts (even though the drug may be marketed under a different name) </em>[a generic drug] or each of the component parts of Myko-cert must be recognized with the critical caveat that the combination of these parts does not in any way create a new drug under [FDA regulations].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">345 F.Supp. at 575 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">Although the <em>Mykocert </em>court concluded that its claimant could not make out such a claim, the court accepted a definition of new drugs nearly identical with that proposed by Lannett. If that holding is coupled with the Supreme Court\u2019s indication of similar qualities between \u201cme-too\u201d drugs, and the Government\u2019s concession that Lan-nett\u2019s drugs were identical to approved drugs but for the individual manufacturing techniques, there should be little to support summary judgment for the Government on the \u201cnew drug\u201d issue, as a matter of law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">Even if the articles of drugs seized in the instant case are deemed \u201cnew drugs\u201d we have serious doubts whether the drugs should be destroyed. The Government\u2019s basic theory for condemnation is that the seized prescription drugs, as \u201cnew drugs\u201d cannot be labeled properly for lay use and thus are misbranded.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Even accepting this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>theory of misbranding, nothing compels destruction of the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Drugs may be condemned either if they are misbranded, as alleged in this case, or if they are unapproved \u201cnew drugs.\u201d However, because different standards are used to ascertain whether a drug is subject to seizure under \u201cmisbranding\u201d than are used under \u201cnew drugs\u201d and because different consequences attach to the provision under which a drug is condemned, analysis of the appropriate category for condemnation is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In order for a court properly to condemn a drug item, a nexus must be shown between that drug item and commerce so as to invoke federal jurisdiction. On the one hand, in a case in which a drug is found to be misbranded, it may be condemned: \u201c[1] when introduced into or [2] while in interstate commerce or [3] while held for sale (whether or not the first sale) after shipment in interstate commerce.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 334(a)(1) (1976).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On the other hand, if a drug is confiscated because it is an unapT proved \u201cnew drug\u201d it must be shown to have been introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, before it may be condemned. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(a) (1976).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The drugs in this case were confiscated at Lannett\u2019s plant. Because the components of the drugs were shipped interstate, the drugs were subject to seizure under the third clause of section 334. Therefore, the drugs were subject to condemnation only if misbranded and could be condemned only under section 334\u2019s provisions.'</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">If the basis for the condemnation of the drugs is that they are misbranded \u2014 as is the only possible basis for condemnation here\u2014 section 334 does not <em>require </em>the destruction of the drugs. Rather, it provides the court with discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-13\">(1) Any . . . drug . . . condemned under this section shall, after entry of the decree, be disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may, in accordance with the provisions of this section, direct . . <em>Provided, </em>That after entry of the decree and upon the payment of the costs of such proceedings and the execution of a good and sufficient bond conditioned that such article shall not be sold or disposed of contrary to the provisions of this chapter . <em>the court may by order direct that such article be delivered to the owner thereof to be destroyed or brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 334(d)(1) (1976) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-17\">Thus, even if the court finds on remand that the drugs are misbranded by virtue of being \u201cnew drugs,\u201d the court should not automatically order destruction of the drugs;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> it may consider allowing Lannett the possibility of rehabilitating that feature of the labeling leading to the drug\u2019s mis-branding. Rehabilitation would be simple enough, for Lannett has ANDAs pending for each of its drugs and as each drug is approved, its label may be constructed so as to qualify for an exemption from the \u201cadequate directions\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the Government will be reversed and the action will be remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\">.

The FDA had provided an opportunity for a hearing to \u201cany person who would be adversely affected\u201d by its order requiring deletion of claims of certain indications of drugs. Lannett was not such a person, for it marketed its drugs only for approved purposes.

Because the Act contains these provisions to deal with an individual manufacturer\u2019s version of a generic drug, Lan-nett reasons that there is no necessity to make individual manufacturing idiosyncracies part of the \u201cnew drug\u201d tests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">. The parties have also cited two other cases to support their positions, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Articles of Drug . . . Colchicine, </em>No. 76-C-2444 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 11, 1978), and <em>United States v. An Article of Drug . . . Excedrin P.M., </em>No. 70-C-77 (E.D.N.Y. March 5, 1971). The Government contends that <em>Colchicine </em>supports its theory that manufacturing idiosyncra-cies are determinants of \u201cnew drug\u201d status. In that case, the Government sought condemnation and destruction of articles of drugs alleging that they were misbranded and poorly manufactured with incorrect labeling. The Government also introduced evidence that the claimant could not show general recognition of the drug\u2019s bioavailability and other factors \u2014 an argument analogous to that presented here. The Court, however, did not rely on'this theory and instead held that the drugs had been mislabeled (wrong amount of drug listed) and that the drugs were not the same as generic compounds because they differed in dosage and method of release. That case is thus distinguishable from this in which Lannett\u2019s drugs are admittedly the same as generic compounds. <em>Excedrin </em>adds some support for Lannett, holding that affidavits by the claimant asserting that its product, as the combination of safe and effective drugs, was not a \u201cnew drug,\u201d opposed by Government affidavits asserting that they were \u201cnew drugs,\u201d raised at least a triable issue of fact.

Rather, Lannett contends that its labels conformed to general practice and contained sufficient warn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ings for lay use. We do not resolve this conundrum in view of our belief that even if the articles of drugs are misbranded, Lannett may rehabilitate its product.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b675-9\">. <em>See </em>n.8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b675-10\">. <em>See </em>n.13, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b675-11\">. The district court ordered the destruction of Lannett\u2019s drugs after granting the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It entered no findings of fact as to misbranding nor did it consider Lannett\u2019s argument that the drugs were labeled sufficiently for lay use. The court also did not consider whether Lannett could cure its defective labeling. The court apparently viewed condemnation as automatic once it determined that the drugs were \u201cnew.\u201d This we believe is unsupportable because the drugs were not condemned as \u201cnew drugs,\u201d but were condemned as \u201cmisbranded.\u201d On remand the court should consider these factors before condemning the drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b675-19\">. One final point must be raised. As stated previously, <em>see </em>n.14, <em>supra, </em>since the time of this complaint, all but five of Lannett\u2019s seized drugs have received FDA approval. We perceive no compelling purpose under the Drug Act to order destruction of such approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>drugs. In view of the punitive nature of the destruction of drugs certified by the FDA as safe and effective and the unnecessary economic loss, we believe compelling countervailing interests must be presented by the FDA before the court should order destruction of the drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
