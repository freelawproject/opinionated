MacDonald\u2019s motion for supplemental briefing on the issue of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-15\">We conclude that the proceeding against MacDonald under Article 32, U.S.C.M.J., 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 832, and the commanding officer\u2019s review were investigative. Although this investigation culminated in the acceptance of a recommendation that charges against MacDonald be dismissed because they were \u201cnot true,\u201d the proceeding did not adjudicate his guilt or innocence. <em>Calley v. Callaway, </em>519 F.2d 184, 215 n.54 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moffett, </em>10 U.S.C.M.A. 169, 27 C.M.R. 243 (1959); <em>United States v. Zagar, </em>5 U.S.C.M.A. 410, 416-17, 18 C.M.R. 34, 40-41 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-16\">Since MacDonald was not put to trial before a military tribunal authorized to convict or acquit him, jeopardy never attached. <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 387-89, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 43 L.Ed.2d 265 (1975). Consequently, the fifth amendment\u2019s guarantee against double jeopardy does not bar subsequent prosecution in a federal district court. <em>See Crist </em>v. <em>Bretz, </em>437 U.S. 28, 32, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 2159, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978). Furthermore, because no final judgment of a tribunal having jurisdiction to try MacDonald has determined an issue of ultimate fact, the prosecution pending in the district court is not barred by the fifth amendment\u2019s embodiment of collateral estoppel. <em>See Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970). The absence of such a judgment distinguishes this case from <em>United States v. Oppenheimer, </em>242 U.S. 85, 37 S.Ct. 68, 61 L.Ed. 161 (1916) and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Utah Construction &amp; Mining Co., </em>384 U.S. 394, 86 S.Ct. 1545, 16 L.Ed.2d 642 (1966), on which MacDonald primarily relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>The order denying MacDonald\u2019s plea of double jeopardy is affirmed, and this case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1302-12\">The Court reversed <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>531 F.2d 196 (4th Cir. 1976). The facts and issues are set forth sufficiently in both opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
