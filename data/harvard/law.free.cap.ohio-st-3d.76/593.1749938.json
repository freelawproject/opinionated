Because we find that there was \u201csome evidence\u201d before the commission supporting its conclusion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">In <em>AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 55, 623 N.E.2d 63, and <em>State ex rel. McGinnis v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 81, 568 N.E.2d 665, this court construed former R.C. 4123.56 as imposing not only the duty of a self-insured employer to make TTD payments to a claimant once a claim has been allowed, but also claimant\u2019s entitlement to receive such payments as compensation. In <em>McGinnis </em>we held that former R.C. 4123.56 entitled a claimant to receive TTD up until the date of a DHO hearing despite the hearing officer having found that the claimant\u2019s allowed conditions had not prevented him from returning to his old job for well over a year before the date of the hearing. This court held that, in light of McGinnis\u2019s attending physician\u2019s continued certification of TTD, the DHO was powerless to retroactively terminate the claimant\u2019s TTD. Likewise, in <em>AT &amp; T, </em>we held that pursuant to former R.C. 4123.56, where an attending physician\u2019s reports support TTD, a self-insured employer who successfully challenges the attending physician\u2019s reports is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>entitled to a termination of TTD retroactive to the date MMI was diagnosed by the nonattending physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The pertinent portion of former R.C. 4123.56 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">\u201cIn the case of an employer who has elected to pay compensation direct, payments shall be for a duration based upon the medical reports of the attending physician. If the employer disputes the attending physician\u2019s report, payments may be terminated only upon application and hearing by a district hearing officer. Payments shall continue pending the determination of the matter, however payment shall not be made for such period when any employee has returned to work or when an employee\u2019s treating physician has made a written statement that the employee is capable of returning to his former position of employment.\u201d (138 Ohio Laws, Part 1,1984.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Because payments are for a \u201cduration based upon the medical reports of the attending physician,\u201d we have held that a self-insured employer\u2019s obligation to continue TTD payments ceases upon receipt of the attending physician\u2019s opinion that the allowed condition has become permanent. <em>State ex rel. Jeep Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 64, 577 N.E.2d 1095. However, where an attending physician issues contradictory reports regarding the claimant\u2019s eligibility to receive TTD, the attending physician\u2019s statement that the allowed condition has become permanent does not necessarily terminate a claimant\u2019s entitlement to TTD as of the date of that statement. See <em>Jeep </em>at 67, 577 N.E.2d at 1098. Instead, under former R.C. 4123.56, an issue of fact is created that must be resolved at the administrative level.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Here, Sarac\u2019s attending physician issued contradictory reports \u2014 the January 22, 1991 MMI letter and the C-84s dated after January 22, 1991. The commission implicitly discredited the attending physician\u2019s MMI letter and credited the C-84s. The C-84s supplied the commission with \u201csome evidence\u201d of the attending physician\u2019s continued certification of Sarac\u2019s eligibility to receive TTD. Accordingly, the Industrial Commission did not abuse its discretion in establishing the date of the 1992 DHO hearing as the effective date for termination of TTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b726-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, Pfeifer and Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b726-12\">F.E. Sweeney, J., dissents and would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
