Civ.R. 17(A) requires that \u201c[e]very action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\u201d A real party in interest is directly benefited or injured by the outcome of the case rather than merely having an interest in the action itself. <em>State ex rel. Botkins v. Laws </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 383, 387, 632 N.E.2d 897, 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">Respondents assert that Massie is not a real party in interest as to William\u2019s grades and credits because his statutory duty to support William ceased when William became eighteen. The evidence presented established that William is an eighteen-year-old high school student. Respondents rely on R.C. 2151.03, which defines \u201cneglected child,\u201d and R.C. 2151.011(B)(1)(a), which defines \u201cchild.\u201d Respondents\u2019 reliance is misplaced. The applicable provision is R.C. 3103.03(B), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>which provides that \u201cthe parental duty of support to children, including the duty of a parent to pay support pursuant to a child support order, shall continue beyond the age of majority as long as the child continuously attends on a full-time - basis any recognized and accredited high school.\u201d Therefore, the fact that William had reached eighteen was not dispositive. The evidence presented pursuant to the alternative writ indicated that William was still attending high school on a full-time basis. Massie possessed a duty under R.C. 3103.03(B) to support William. Furthermore, the evidence established that William\u2019s grades are being withheld due to Massie\u2019s failure to pay his student instructional fee. Based on the foregoing, Massie is a real party in interest on his claim for the issuance of William\u2019s grades and credits. We overrule respondents\u2019 motions to dismiss and vacate. Since we need not consider the affidavits attached to Massie\u2019s memorandum in opposition to the motion in deciding the motion, respondents\u2019 motion to strike these affidavits is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">\n<em>Mandamus; R.C. 3313.642</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">In his first proposition of law, Massie contends that a board of education cannot impose a fee for instruction or for consumable materials as part of a deficit reduction plan. Massie did not pay the student instructional fees for his three children because he believed that his children were entitled to a free public education.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The General Assembly \u201cshall make such provisions, by taxation, or otherwise, as, with the income arising from the school trust fund, will secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the State.\u201d Section 2, Article VI, Ohio Constitution. R.C. 3313.48 provides that \u201c[t]he board of education of each city, exempted village, local, and joint vocational school district shall provide for the free education of the youth of school age within the district under its jurisdiction * * See, also, R.C. 3313.64.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">However, R.C. 3313.642 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\"><em>\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of sections 3313.48 and 3313.64 of the Revised Code, the board of education of a </em>city, exempted village, or <em>local school district shall not be required to famish, free of charge, to the pupils attending the public schools any materials used in a course of instmction </em>with the exception of the necessary textbooks required to be furnished without charge pursuant to section 3329.06 of the Revised Code. The board may, however, make provision by appropriations transferred from the general fund of the district or otherwise for furnishing free of. charge any materials used in a course of instruction to such pupils as it determines are in serious financial need of such materials. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Unlike tuition, which pays the costs of instruction or teaching, student fees charged by many educational institutions typically pay the costs of items actually used by students, such as textbooks and supplies. See, generally, 1 Rapp, Education Law (1996) 5-115, Section 5.04[1]. According to Massie, R.C. 3313.642 does not authorize the student instructional fees charged by respondents. \u201c \u2018In construing a statute, a court\u2019s paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute. * * * In determining legislative intent, the court first looks to the language in the statute and the purpose to be accomplished.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Cassels v. Dayton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 217, 220, 631 N.E.2d 150, 153, quoting <em>State v. S.R. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 590, 594-595, 589 N.E.2d 1319, 1323. Words used in a statute must be taken in their usual, normal or customary meaning. R.C. 1.42; <em>State ex rel. Solomon v. Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Disability &amp; Pension Fund Bd. of Trustees </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 62, 65, 647 N.E.2d 486, 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\u201cMaterials\u201d are tools or articles needed to make or do something. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1392. \u201cInstruction\u201d refers to teaching. <em>Id. </em>at 1172. Therefore, R.C. 3313.642 authorizes boards of education to charge fees for all articles used in courses where students are taught, with the exception of necessary textbooks required to be furnished under R.C. 3329.06 to pupils attending public schools. The General Assembly enacted R.C. 3313.642 to \u201crelieve the undue burden placed upon boards of education because of inability to charge for materials in the course of instruction.\u201d Am.S.B. No. 214, Section 2, 128 Ohio Laws 286, 287 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">In <em>Assn, for the Defense of the Washington Loc. School Dist. v. Kiger </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 116, 537 N.E.2d 1292, we granted a peremptory -writ of mandamus to compel the Superintendent and the Board of Education of the Washington Local School District to issue grades and credits of students which had been withheld for failure to pay a five-dollar-per-pupil fee. The superintendent had announced that the fees would \u201cassist in providing paper products, copier materials, student record keeping/test supply sheets, work sheets, and other necessary consumable educational supply items which directly affect all students in their classrooms/buildings.\u201d <em>Id., </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 116-117, 537 N.E.2d at 1292. We noted that since free public education is the general rule in Ohio, the exception under R.C. 3313.642 should be strictly construed. <em>Id., </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 118, 537 N.E.2d at 1293. After strictly construing R.C. 3313.642, we determined that the student fees at issue were \u201cfor the costs of administrative materials, not classroom materials.\u201d <em>Id., </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 118, 537 N.E.2d at 1293. We noted that this conclusion was strengthened by language in the announcement that the fees were \u201cin addition to other laboratory, workbook, and activity fees, etc., being assessed for science, industrial arts, art, weekly readers, etc.\u201d <em>Id., </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 118, 537 N.E.2d at 1293. Since the fees were not authorized by R.C. 3313.642, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>superintendent and board of education possessed a clear legal duty to issue grades and credits to the parents of students who had not paid the fees. <em>Id., </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 118, 537 N.E.2d at 1293-1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Massie claims that based on <em>Kiger, </em>respondents\u2019 fees here are not authorized by R.C. 3313.642 because all consumable supplies constitute administrative rather than classroom materials. Massie misreads <em>Kiger. Kiger </em>did not hold that consumable supplies can never constitute materials used in courses of instruction under R.C. 3313.642. While the fees in <em>Kiger </em>were referred to by the respondents therein as \u201cconsumable educational supply items which directly affect all students,\u201d there was no indication that these materials were actually used in classrooms during courses. In fact, \u201cstudent record keeping\u201d sheets indicated administrative rather than classroom materials in <em>Kiger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Conversely, the record in this case establishes that the instructional fees assessed by respondents have been used to purchase classroom materials, <em>i.e., </em>materials used in courses of instruction. Similarly, although like <em>Kiger, </em>the challenged fees are being charged in addition to certain class-specific fees, this does not mandate a finding that these instructional fees are also for administrative, rather than classroom, materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The term \u201cadministrative\u201d \u201cpertains to administration, especially management, as by managing or conducting, directing, or superintending, the execution, application or conduct of persons or things\u201d and particularly has the characteristics of \u201cexecutive or ministerial action.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 45. The evidence indicates that the instructional fees established by respondents are for classroom materials instead of administrative materials. The treasurer of the school district stated that the fees generated less income than the expenses he posted to categories of the State Auditor designated under the Uniform School Accounting System as covering \u201cinstructional supplies\u201d or \u201cteaching aids.\u201d These are defined respectively as \u201c[expenditures for consumable non-food instructional supplies used in classroom, such as paper, paste, pencils, [and] paint\u201d and \u201c[expenditures for items and supplies used by teachers to aid in their instruction of the student, for example, flash cards, geographical maps, and so forth.\u201d These accounting classifications comport with the conclusion that the challenged fees are assessed to cover the cost of classroom materials, as authorized by R.C. 3313.642.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">While Massie emphasizes that the court must narrowly construe R.C. 3313.642, courts do not have the authority to ignore the plain language of a statute under the guise of statutory interpretation or liberal or narrow construction. See, <em>e.g., Morgan v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 344, 347, 626 N.E.2d 939, 942. The plain language of R.C. 3313.642 permits the instructional fees established by respondents because they are being used for classroom materials. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Therefore, Massie is not entitled to a writ of mandamus based on <em>Kiger </em>and the applicable statutes. His first proposition of law is meritless and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">\n<em>Constitutionality of R.C. 3313.642</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In his second proposition of law, Massie asserts that even if the fees are authorized by R.C. 3313.642, he is entitled to extraordinary relief in mandamus to compel issuance of the withheld grades and credits of his children because R.C. 3313.642 is unconstitutional. Massie claims that R.C. 3313.642 violates due process because it penalizes children (by withholding grades and credits) for the actions of their parents (failure to pay fees for materials used in a course of instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Massie did not raise this constitutional claim in his complaint or motion to amend the complaint. The alternative writ was issued on a pleading which did not include this claim. Evidence was presented by respondents without notice that this claim was being raised. Massie has not sought leave to amend his complaint to raise this claim. Finally, respondents have not expressly or impliedly consented to trial of this issue. Civ.R. 15(B). Therefore, we need not consider the merits of this improperly raised claim. See, <em>e.g., Austintown Loc. School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 355, 364-365, 613 N.E.2d 167, 174-175; <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Bainbridge Twp. Trustees </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 41, 5 OBR 99, 448 N.E.2d 1159, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Accordingly, in that Massie has failed to establish either a clear legal right to the withheld grades and credits of his children or a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of respondents to issue them, he is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus. The writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b719-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
