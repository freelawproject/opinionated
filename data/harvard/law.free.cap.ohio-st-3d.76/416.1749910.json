White argues that these statutes impose a duty on boards of county commissioners to prepare minutes which reflect the substance of their meetings and provide some indication of the nature and direction of their discussions. A different reading, the appellant contends, would render R.C. 121.22 and 305.10 meaningless. The appellees, on the other hand, claim R.C. 305.10 does not require that minutes contain the type of specific information that White seeks, and that R.C. 121.22 is satisfied when <em>any </em>record is kept, regardless of how sparse the information is. We agree with the appellant and conclude that these statutes, when read together, impose a duty on boards of county commissioners to maintain a full and accurate record of their proceedings. Because we find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>R.C. 121.22, 149.43, and 305.10 require the minutes of boards of county commissioners meetings to include more than a record of mere roll call votes, we reverse the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s grant of mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">One of the strengths of American government is the right of the public to know and understand the actions of their elected representatives. This includes not merely the right to know a government body\u2019s final decision on a matter, but the ways and means by which those decisions were reached. There is great historical significance to this basic foundation of popular government, and our founding fathers keenly understood this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">James Madison clearly laid out this strength of our government when he said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">\u201cA popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps, both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.\u201d The Complete Madison, His Basic Writings (1988) 337 (Letter to W.T. Barry, August 4, 1822).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Thomas Jefferson further expounded on this principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">\u201cThe way to prevent [errors of] the people, is to go give them full information of their affairs throu\u2019 the channel of the public papers, and to contrive that those papers should penetrate the whole mass of the people. The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right * * 11 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson (1955) 49 (Letter to Col. Edward Carrington, January 16,1787).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Ohio\u2019s own history is replete with rich examples of detailed records dating back to the 1800s. <em>Amicus </em>League of Women Voters of Ohio cites many rich examples of the long and illustrious record-keeping of our forebears. In fact, when the Ohio legislature created the first boards of county commissioners, it included in that creation a requirement that accurate records be kept by the county commissioners. See 2 Ohio Laws 150. In 1804, in \u201cAn act establishing boards of commissioners,\u201d the Ohio legislature required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-13\">\u201cSec. 9. * * * That the commissioners shall have a just and accurate record kept of all their corporate proceedings, and for that purpose they are hereby empowered to appoint a clerk * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153. That mandate continues through today in R.C. 305.10, requiring that the clerk \u201ckeep a full record of the proceedings of the board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">The question arises as to what is meant by a \u201cfull record.\u201d To understand what is meant by a \u201cfull record,\u201d one must look at the purpose and meaning behind keeping records. As several of the <em>amici </em>briefs point out, keeping an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>accurate record serves many useful functions. First of all, such records provide rich detail as to the history and culture of our country, as our government officials embody the wishes and desires of the people in making their decisions. Sometimes, difficult decisions are reached which go against popular opinion, but which may be necessary for the common good as determined by the governing bodies. Accurate minutes can reflect the difficult decision-making process involved, and hopefully bring the public to a better understanding of why unpopular decisions are sometimes necessary. As the court stated in <em>Dayton Newspapers, Inc. v. Dayton </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 107, 109, 74 O.O.2d 209, 211, 341 N.E.2d 576, 577:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">\u201c \u2018The rule in Ohio is that public records are the people\u2019s records, and that the officials in whose custody they happen to be are merely trustees for the people.\u2019 \u201d (Citing <em>State ex rel. Patterson v. Ayers </em>[1960], 171 Ohio St. 369, 371, 14 O.O.2d 116, 117, 171 N.E.2d 508, 509.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Second, public scrutiny is necessary to enable the ordinary citizen to evaluate the workings of his or her government and to hold government accountable. If the public can understand the rationale behind its government\u2019s decisions, it can challenge or criticize those decisions as it finds necessary; the entire process thus allows for greater integrity and prevents important decisions from being made behind closed doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Third, keeping full minutes allows members of the public who are unable to attend the meetings in person to obtain complete and accurate information about the decision-making process of their government. In <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 469, 491, 95 S.Ct. 1029, 1044, 43 L.Ed.2d 328, 347, the United States Supreme Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\u201c[I]n a society in which each individual has but limited time and resources with which to observe at first hand the operations of his government, he relies necessarily upon the press to bring to him in convenient form the facts of those operations.\u201d Accord <em>State ex rel. Dayton v. Phillips </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 457, 467, 75 O.O.2d 511, 516, 351 N.E.2d 127, 134.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">In addition to the media\u2019s coverage, the interested citizen should also be able to examine personally those decisions and the decision-making process involved. Most people\u2019s day-to-day schedule leaves them with far too little time to attend government meetings. Therefore, the opportunity to examine a full and complete copy of the minutes enables the citizens of Ohio to stay informed about the actions and thoughts of their elected officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The ready availability of tape recorders, video cameras, and computers provides government bodies with simple means of recording their deliberations. Indeed, we note that detailed handwritten minutes were kept of early county commissioner meetings, and provided rich historical detail without the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>current technology. However, the Clinton County Commissioners did not need to handwrite transcripts \u2014 they had purchased a recording system and simply neglected to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Having examined the principles embodied in these three' statutes, we now direct ourselves to their application in the instant case. The version of R.C. 121.22 in effect at the time that White brought her mandamus action states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u201c(C) All meetings of any public body are declared to be public meetings open to the public at all times. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">\u201cThe minutes of a regular or special meeting of any such public body shall be promptly recorded and open to public inspection. The minutes need only reflect the general subject matter of discussions in executive sessions authorized under division (G) of this section.\u201d (144 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1855-1856.) Boards of county commissioners are \u201cpublic bodies\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 121.22.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, such boards must prepare, file and maintain the minutes of their regular and special meetings in accordance with that statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">This court analyzed the language of R.C. 121.22 in some depth in <em>State ex rel. Fairfield Leader v. Ricketts </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 97, 564 N.E.2d 486. In that case, we held that a board of county commissioners has a clear legal duty to record descriptions of pre-arranged discussions in its minutes. Majorities of the Fairfield County Board of Commissioners, the Board of Trustees of Violet Township, and the Council of the village of Pickerington had met for a workshop to discuss traffic, sewer and water matters, but denied casting any votes or making any final decisions. The court ruled that because the members of a public body had met as a majority group, <em>i.e., </em>the Fairfield County and Violet Township respondents, R.C. 121.22(C) applied, and minutes of the meeting were therefore necessary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the court in <em>Fairfield Leader </em>did not explain how detailed public records must be. To gain such an understanding in the context of county commissioners meetings, we look to R.C. 305.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>R.C. 305.10 mandates that \u201c[t]he clerk of the board of county commissioners shall keep a full record of the proceedings of the board, and a general index of such proceedings, entering each motion with the name of the person making it on the record.\u201d It is the appellees\u2019 position that R.C. 305.10\u2019s phrase <em>\u201ca </em>full record of the proceedings of the board\u201d is an umbrella phrase which simply encompasses the specific items mentioned in the later portions of R.C. 305.10.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, the appellees argue, so long as the minutes of a board of county commissioners include those items, the minutes fully comply with R.C. 305.10. In addition, the appellees claim that R.C. 121.22 has been satisfied, because that statute \u201csimply requires that whatever minutes are maintained must be promptly recorded and made available to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">R.C. 305.10 does not contain a definition of \u201cfull record\u201d or \u201cproceedings.\u201d As a result, we give these words their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Coventry Towers, Inc. v. Strongsville </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 120, 122, 18 OBR 151, 152, 480 N.E.2d 412, 414. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 918, 919, defines \u201cfull\u201d as \u201ccontaining all that can possibly be placed or put within\u201d; \u201ccontaining all details: complete.\u201d Accordingly, a \u201cfull record\u201d would be one in which the details of the recorded event are contained. \u201cProceedings\u201d is defined as \u201can official record or account (as in a book of minutes) of things said or done (as at a meeting or convention of a society).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1807. In light of these common definitions, as well as the reasons stated above and those which follow, we reject the appellees\u2019 arguments as failing to satisfy the purpose and meaning of the three statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Although the appellees are correct that R.C. 305.10 does enumerate specific items which the clerk of a board of county commissioners must include in the minutes of the board\u2019s proceedings, those items are not exhaustive. Rather, R.C. 305.10 operates simply as a statutory checklist of those items for which the clerk bears the initial responsibility of making available to the public for review. It does not, however, excuse either the county commissioners or their clerk from observing the more fundamental requirements of R.C. 121.22, which are imposed upon all public bodies. Indeed, we hold that R.C. 305.10\u2019s requirement for the clerk of a board of county commissioners to keep a \u201cfull record\u201d of the board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>proceedings implicitly includes a duty on the part of the clerk and the board to comply with the more comprehensive requirements of R.C. 121.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Had the commissioners maintained a full record that included the rationale and decision-making process of the orders that they issued, White would have had a better understanding of these orders. She could have challenged the rationale for those orders, or she could have understood the process and accepted the commissioners\u2019 decision. But with no discussion of the decision-making process, or of the orders that were ultimately issued, White was unable to exercise her rights as a citizen to challenge the decision of those public bodies elected to represent her. Full disclosure would have removed the process\u2019s secretive nature and opened it to public scrutiny. Unfortunately, the facts make it clear that this is precisely what the Clinton County Board of Commissioners did <em>not </em>do.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">As already noted, R.C. 121.22 requires the preparation, filing, and maintenance of a public body\u2019s minutes. Granted, the statute does not explicitly state what should be included in the minutes of a county board of commissioners\u2019 meeting. However, we can glean more about the requirements of R.C. 121.22(C) by examining the last sentence of that subsection, which states that the minutes of a public body\u2019s <em>executive sessions </em>\u201cneed only reflect the general subject matter of discussions * * *.\u201d When one considers the sensitive nature of the topics examined in executive sessions, it follows from this language that it is <em>only </em>the minutes of an executive session which may be properly limited to \u201cthe general subject matter of discussions.\u201d The minutes of <em>any other meeting </em>of a public body must contain a more substantial treatment of the items discussed, and certainly should not be limited to a mere recounting of the body\u2019s roll call votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The appellees also argue that mandamus relief is inappropriate in this matter because White has failed to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a writ of mandamus. For a writ of mandamus to issue, there must be (1) a clear legal right to the requested relief, (2) a clear legal duty on the part of the respondent to perform the requested act, and (3) no plain and adequate remedy at law. <em>State ex rel. Hodges v. Taft </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 591 N.E.2d 1186, 1188. The appellees argue that because R.C. 121.22 does not explicitly mention the sort of information that should be included in the board\u2019s minutes, and because R.C. 305.10 does not enumerate the same sort of information sought by White, neither the board nor its clerk had a clear legal duty to provide more copious minutes. Consequently, the appellees argue, White does not have a clear legal right to such minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">This argument is not persuasive. As we have already noted, the \u201cfull record\u201d required under R.C. 305.10 is not limited to the specific information enumerated under that section. Rather, compliance with R.C. 305.10 also requires the clerk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>of a board of county commissioners to observe R.C. 121.22. The result of these two statutes being read together results in White\u2019s clear legal right to the information she seeks, and the appellees\u2019 clear legal duty to provide that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We recognize that it is not the business of this court to miero-manage the public record-keeping procedures of local governments; public bodies should be trusted with a certain degree of latitude in the preparation of minutes and other records of their proceedings. Accordingly, we resist the temptation to prescribe any particular means of satisfying R.C. 121.22 and 305.10. Audio- or videotape recordings, word-for-word transcripts, even abstracts of the discussions indicating the identity of the speakers and the chronology and substance of their statements, are all legitimate means of satisfying the requirements of R.C. 121.22 and 305.10. Accordingly, we refrain from laying down specific guidelines, other than the dictate that for public records maintained under R.C. 121.22 and 305.10, full and accurate minutes must contain sufficient facts and information to permit the public to understand and appreciate the rationale behind the relevant public body\u2019s decision. In light of this holding, the mandamus relief ordered by the trial court in this matter, a preparation of minutes of the board\u2019s meetings, was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Finally, we address the issue of the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees. Former R.C. 121.22(I)(2) provided for an award of \u201call court costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (144 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1858.) Similarly, R.C. 149.43(C) states that a person aggrieved by a failure to observe R.C. 149.43 may commence a mandamus action and receive reasonable attorney fees for the successful prosecution of such an action. The court of appeals improperly reversed the trial judge\u2019s decision to award attorney fees after it mistakenly concluded that R.C. 121.22 and 149.43 were not implicated in this action. Since we have determined that White\u2019s action did rely on R.C. 121.22 and 149.43, we award attorney fees and order the appellant to submit evidence in accordance with S.Ct.Prac.R. XIV(4) to support her request for fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
