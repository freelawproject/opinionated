The rule does not limit the reasons for which a trial judge might dismiss a case, and we are convinced that a judge may dismiss a case pursuant to Crim.R. 48(B) if a dismissal serves the interests of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">Trial judges are at the front lines of the administration of justice in our judicial system, dealing with the realities and practicalities of managing a caseload and responding to the rights and interests of the prosecution, the accused, and victims. A court has the \u201cinherent power to regulate the practice before it and protect the integrity of its proceedings.\u201d <em>Royal Indemn. Co. v. J.C. Penney Co. </em>(1986), 27 Ohio St.3d 31, 33-34, 27 OBR 447, 449, 501 N.E.2d 617, 620. Trial courts deserve the discretion to be able to craft a solution that works in a given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>case. Certainly a court\u2019s resources in a domestic violence case are better used by encouraging a couple to receive counseling and ultimately issuing a dismissal than by going forward with a trial and impaneling a jury in a case where the only witness refuses to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">We do not suggest that in every domestic violence case where the victim refuses to testify a trial judge has the unfettered power to dismiss the case. The seriousness of the injuries, the presence of independent witnesses, the status of counseling efforts, whether the complainant\u2019s refusal to testify is coerced, and whether the defendant is a first-time offender are all factors a trial judge should consider, and factors that a reviewing court may consider in determining whether the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In this case, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in dismissing the charges. Although Cordiano\u2019s injuries were relatively serious, Busch had not physically abused her before or after the incidents at issue. The record is devoid of evidence other than Cordiano\u2019s testimony that might prove a case against Busch. The trial court methodically over a period of at least a month determined that Cordiano was not being coerced and truly did not wish to testify. The court had her August 5, 1994 affidavit to that effect. She so testified under oath in a pretrial, on two other occasions when the trial was continued, and finally on the day when the charges were dismissed. The trial judge made sure the couple was in counseling, that Cordiano wanted to see the charges dropped, and that she was not being coerced. The trial court knew that Cordiano had spoken with prosecutors and a representative of the prosecutor\u2019s witness assistance program. Cordiano also testified that she did not fear a flare-up in Busch\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">An abuse of discretion implies that the trial court\u2019s attitude, as evidenced by its decision, was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 222, 15 OBR 311, 361, 473 N.E.2d 264, 313. The trial court in this case handled the case well. It was not until Cordiano had testified on several occasions that the trial court finally dismissed the charges. Until that point, the court used a possible dismissal as an incentive for the couple to continue in counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">In this case, the trial court used its judicial power to do its best with a matter which no longer seemed to fit the court system. Trial judges have the discretion to determine when the court has ceased to be useful in a given case. The trial judge made a permissible determination here.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b746-11\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b747-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Stratton, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b747-6\">Douglas and Cook, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b747-7\">Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AO5\">concurring. While I agree that the facts in this case justify the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss on the basis of the court\u2019s discretion, that discretion should be cautiously exercised in domestic violence cases, in particular, when the motion is predicated on the victims\u2019 unwillingness to testify against their abusers.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">In cases of domestic abuse, victims of battering often try to escape from their abusive partners, only to return once the immediate shock of the attack has receded or when the abusers \u201crepent\u201d and promise to change their behavior. All too frequently, these tragedies play out in the courts, as battered victims initially agree to testify against their abusers, only to drop the charges once the victims have convinced themselves that the abusive behavior was a passing aberration. Often, the victims have no income, nowhere to go, young children to consider, and may truly love their partners and believe that the future holds hope. Sometimes, if victims continue to press charges, they are further threatened by their abusers and drop the charges out of fear. Both police and trial courts are frequently frustrated by dealing initially with a distraught and injured victim who shows up weeks later to abruptly drop all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">In this case, the trial court exercised careful discretion, continued the case several times to be sure the pattern did not recur and that counseling continued, gave the victim time to think, and carefully questioned her motives in dropping the charges. Therefore, the judge did not abuse his discretion in dismissing the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">However, there may clearly be times that the prosecution should be permitted to move forward despite the victims\u2019 objections, especially when a pattern of abuse continues and all the pressures previously mentioned weaken the victims\u2019 resolve to pursue their abusers, or if the victims fear even greater retaliation if the case is pursued by the victims themselves. Society would never tolerate such assaults against total strangers. Such conduct should not be excusable or somehow less egregious because one is in a marriage or partnership. In these circumstances, the court must provide the forum to call abusers to account for their actions.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b747-11\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ah1\">dissenting. Because a criminal case is a controversy between the defendant and the state, a court errs in dismissing a criminal complaint over the objection of the state, solely to accommodate the wishes of a complaining witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Cordiano\u2019s lack of interest in and opposition to the prosecution of Busch are of no moment. The state of Ohio is the complaining party in this case. Cordiano is, at most, a potential witness for the real party. Although the majority suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>that the prosecution in this case could not proceed \"without Cordiano\u2019s testimony, we do not know that from the record on appeal. The trial judge made no such finding. Moreover, there is no apparent reason why Cordiano could not be compelled to testify against her boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The majority construes Crim.R. 48(B) to permit dismissal of a criminal case whenever the \u201cdismissal serves the interests of justice.\u201d The \u201cinterests of justice\u201d in the criminal law discipline are punishment and deterrence of criminal behavior. This may well be different from the sociological or theological \u201cinterests of justice\u201d that appear to have motivated the trial court here and in turn the majority of this court. See <em>Dayton v. Thomas </em>(App.1980), 17 O.O.3d 255, 256-257. \u201cCourts do not assume the authority of enforcing the precepts of mere morality, nor is it their function .to declare the law of social ethics.\u201d <em>Id., </em>17 O.O.3d at 256, citing <em>State v. Baxter </em>(1914), 89 Ohio St. 269, 283, 104 N.E. 331, 335. The time to consider facts that occurred outside the crime is in sentencing. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>17 O.O.3d at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The majority concludes that since Crim.R. 48(B) does not limit the reasons that a trial judge might dismiss a case, it thereby grants broad discretion bounded only by serving the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d I respectfully disagree. Crim.R. 48(B) is procedural, not substantive. \u201c[T]he rule does not alter the pre-rule Ohio practice concerning the court\u2019s inherent power to dismiss.\u201d <em>State v. Sutton </em>(1979), 64 Ohio App.2d 105, 108, 18 O.O.3d 83, 85, 411 N.E.2d 818, 821. In fact, the rule requires the court to specify the reason for dismissal so that it may be reviewed for its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">A survey of recent cases confirms that courts have properly exercised inherent power to dismiss cases over the objection of the state for (1) want of prosecution, (2) regulation of the practice before the court, such as dismissal for prosecutorial misconduct, and (3) preservation of the defendant\u2019s statutory and constitutional rights, including speedy trial and double jeopardy issues. See, <em>e.g., State v. Hancock </em>(1990), 67 Ohio App.3d 328, 586 N.E.2d 1192; <em>Sutton, supra; State v. Long </em>(May 8, 1979), Jefferson App. No. 1290, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">The case found to be in conflict with the instant case, <em>Cleveland v. Hall </em>(Mar. 10, 1983), Cuyahoga App. No. 45179, unreported, 1983 WL 5829, states that it is improper for a trial court to dismiss the complaint just because the complaining witness changes her mind. In <em>Dayton v. Thomas, supra, </em>the appellate court similarly found that \u201c[w]hen the trial judge sustained defense counsel\u2019s motion for dismissal simply because the prosecuting witness did not wish to proceed, he deprived the State of Ohio [of] its right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>17 O.O.3d at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">The \u201cinherent powers\u201d rationale of the majority fails to bolster its position. To dismiss a complaint is not, as the majority states, within the purview of \u201c \u2018regulating] the practice before [a court] and protecting] the integrity of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>proceedings.\u2019 \u201d As the court in <em>Thomas </em>posited, \u201cinherent powers\u201d has not been applied independently of the judicial process \u2014 that is, as a factor not connected with determining or expediting the determination of judicial controversies. <em>Id. </em>Courts do not have inherent power to reject the judicial process as a means of determining controversies, over the objection of a party to a case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">I therefore respectfully dissent. I would affirm and hold that a trial court lacks authority to dismiss charges solely to assuage the complaining witness.</p>\n<judges id=\"b749-6\">Douglas, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
