See <em>Grava v. Parkman Twp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 653 N.E.2d 226, syllabus (\u201cA valid, final judgment rendered upon the merits bars all subsequent actions based upon any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>subject matter of the previous action.\u201d). Instead, Kayser challenges the common pleas court\u2019s holding in Kayser\u2019s injunction action. However, the common pleas court\u2019s judgment in the injunction matter is not before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">It is well settled that we will not indulge in advisory opinions. See <em>N. Canton v. Hutchinson </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 112, 114, 661 N.E.2d 1000, 1002, and cases cited therein. In that Kayser attacks a judgment which is not the subject of this appeal, we need not address Kayser\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the common pleas court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b366-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
