After reviewing both the record and the board\u2019s report, we conclude that Dalrymple\u2019s estate planning information was transmitted to respondent by a non-lawyer and that the non-lawyer set the initial fee before either the client or the non-lawyer consulted with respondent. The respondent entered into a relationship that allowed the client to perceive that the setting of a fee, the obtaining of information, and the possible refund of the fee- could be controlled by a non-lawyer. An attorney should avoid even the perception that his or her work can be influenced or controlled by a party other than the client. We agree with the board that a public reprimand is warranted and respondent is so reprimanded. Costs taxed to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b132-11\">Mover, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
