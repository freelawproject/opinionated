For the following reasons, we answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">At trial, Lazzaro was found guilty of violating R.C. 2921.13, Ohio\u2019s falsification statute, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">\u201c(A) No person shall knowingly make a false statement, or knowingly swear or affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, when any of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\"><em>a </em>\u2021 # &amp;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-15\">\u201c(3) The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in performing the public official\u2019s official functions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">Lazzaro was also convicted of obstructing official business under R.C. 2921.31(A), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u201c(A) No person, without privilege to do so and with purpose to prevent, obstruct, or delay the performance by a public official of any authorized act within his official capacity, shall do any act which hampers or impedes a public official in the performance of his lawful duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Lazzaro relies on our holdings in <em>Columbus v. Fisher </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 25, 7 O.O.3d 78, 372 N.E.2d 583, and <em>Dayton v. Rogers </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 162, 14 O.O.3d 403, 398 N.E.2d 781, where we held that the making of unsworn false oral statements to a police officer was not punishable conduct with the meanings of R.C. 2921.13(A)(3) or 2921.31(A), respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In <em>Fisher, </em>the defendant was convicted of violating a municipal ordinance virtually identical to R.C. 2921.13(A)(3) for giving a false name to a police officer. The <em>Fisher </em>court reviewed the history of the statute, and adopted the reasoning that for a false statement to be punishable it must be in writing and must also derive from an intent to mislead.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In <em>Rogers, </em>the defendant was convicted of violating a Dayton municipal ordinance identical to R.C. 2921.31(A) for lying to a police officer by falsely confirming the identity of her companion. Relying on the reasoning in <em>Fisher, </em>the <em>Rogers </em>court concluded that because \u201cconduct such as appellant\u2019s is not punishable under R.C. 2921.13(A)(3), which specifically addresses the making of false statements to public officials, we are reasonably led to the determination here not to extend the meaning of R.C. 2921.31 beyond that intended by the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Rogers, supra, </em>60 Ohio St.2d at 164, 14 O.O.3d at 404-405, 398 N.E.2d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The holdings in <em>Fisher </em>and <em>Rogers </em>were expressly limited to their facts by this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>State v. Bailey </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 443, 644 N.E.2d 314. In <em>Bailey, </em>the defendant was convicted under R.C. 2921.32(A)(5) for obstructing justice when she continually refused to move from the doorway of the house, thereby blocking the police from entering the house to arrest her brother, and repeatedly declared that her brother was not home. In <em>Bailey </em>we observed that both state and federal case law have \u201cfirmly established that unsworn false oral statements made for the purpose of impeding an officer\u2019s investigation are punishable * * (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 446, 644 N.E.2d at 316. We held at the syllabus that \u201c[t]he making of unsworn false oral statements to a law enforcement officer with the purpose to hinder the officer\u2019s investigation of a crime is punishable conduct within the meaning of R.C. 2921.32(A)(5).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">In view of our recent decision in <em>Bailey, </em>we conclude that Lazzaro\u2019s reliance on <em>Fisher </em>and <em>Rogers </em>is misplaced. Although <em>Bailey </em>did not overrule those cases, it did limit them to their facts, as the specific statutes involved in each were not directly before this court at that time. However, both R.C. 2921.13(A)(3) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>2921.31(A) are the subject of review in the instant case, and we conclude that the sound reasoning expressed in <em>Bailey </em>applies equally to both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Lazzaro argues that it would be an improper retroactive application of our decision in <em>Bailey </em>to the facts at bar because <em>Bailey </em>was not announced until after Lazzaro\u2019s convictions, but before review of the case by the court of appeals. We disagree. \u201cThe general rule is that a decision of a court of supreme jurisdiction overruling a former decision is retrospective in its operation, and the effect is not that the former was bad law, but that it never was the law.\u201d <em>Peerless Elec. Co. v. Bowers </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 209, 210, 57 O.O. 411, 129 N.E.2d 467, 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Lazzaro also argues that the doctrine that mere exculpatory denials cannot be punished should apply to her responses to Kish. See <em>Columbus v. New </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 221, 1 OBR 244, 438 N.E.2d 1155. But, see, <em>United States v. Steele </em>(C.A.6, 1991), 933 F.2d 1313, 1320. However, this doctrine does not extend to the facts in the present case because the questions asked by Kish of Lazzaro did not implicate her Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination. Accordingly, we make no decision regarding its applicability to the statutes reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The record indicates that Lazzaro embarked upon a course of conduct aimed at limiting the police investigation in such a way that the assault on Newman would be ruled accidental. One way was by allowing the only witness to the assault, Julie Swindell, to leave work without speaking to Kish. Neece testified that when he talked with Lazzaro soon after the assault, she told him that she had. already taken Swindell\u2019s statement, and that Swindell would not be talking to the police. This suggests that Lazzaro did not merely passively fail to assist Kish\u2019s investigation, but actively chose which witnesses Kish would encounter. Lazzaro furthered the concealment of this key witness by denying her existence. Specifically, when Kish t\u00e9stified at trial, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cA I asked [Lazzaro] if there was [sic] any witnesses, and she said no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">\u201cQ Are you sure of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">\u201cA I\u2019m positive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201cQ And her response was what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">\u201cA That there wasn\u2019t any.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">Kish also testified that Lazzaro was present during Neece\u2019s entire explanation of the assault: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-15\">\u201cQ And Mrs. Lazzaro was present during this entire presentation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-16\">\u201cA That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-17\">\u201cQ And demonstration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-18\">\u201cA That\u2019s right. He demonstrated it next.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>\u201cQ Did she ever tell you she had conflicting information to that report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cA No, she did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201cQ Did you make efforts again to ascertain if there were any possible witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201cA Yes, I did. Before I released Mr. Neece I asked Mr. Neece also if there were any witnesses, and he said no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">\u201cQ In Mrs. Lazzaro\u2019s presence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">\u201cA In Mrs. Lazzaro\u2019s presence. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">ii * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">\u201cQ At any time did anyone say there\u2019s another witness to see, maybe your decision [of no criminal act] is a little hasty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">\u201cA No, they did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">There can be no doubt that the statements and actions of Lazzaro conveyed false information regarding the existence of another witness and the possibility of a criminal act. A trier of fact could reasonably conclude from the evidence that Lazzaro intended to mislead and impede the investigation conducted by Kish.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">The General Assembly has adopted legislation intended to discourage individuals from purposely giving false information that hinders public officials in the performance of their duties. Complete and honest cooperation with the law enforcement process by all citizens is essential to the effective operation of the justice system. <em>Columbus v. New </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 221, 227, 1 OBR 244, 249, 438 N.E.2d 1155, 1160. Therefore, we hold that the making of an unsworn false oral statement to a public official with the purpose to mislead, hamper or impede the investigation of a crime is punishable conduct within the meaning of R.C. 2921.13(A)(3) and 2921.31(A). Our decisions in <em>Columbus v. Fisher </em>and <em>Dayton v. Rogers </em>are hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-17\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b396-18\">Resnick, Cook and Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b396-19\">Cook and Stratton, JJ., concur separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b396-20\">F.E.

I concur in the majority opinion. There does not seem to be any dispute over the law, but rather how the law applies to these facts. Was Lazzaro merely confused about her conflicting duties, as the dissent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>alleges, or was she trying to hide patient abuse to protect her nursing home, as the jury found? Did she call the police again because she realized a discrepancy, or because she knew the facts were about to come out? The jury was in the best position to weigh credibility (both hers and Officer Kish\u2019s), to judge motive, and to decide whether the evidence supported the charge beyond a reasonable doubt that Lazzaro <em>intended </em>to impede the investigation. Therefore, since the weighing of the evidence is the real issue here, and the evidence can clearly be read as the jury found, I would affirm the court of appeals and the jury\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-6\">Cook, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b397-7\">Francis E. Sweeney, Sr., J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8J\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the appellant\u2019s convictions for obstructing official business (R.C. 2921.31[A]) and falsification (R.C. 2921.13[A][3]). I believe the General Assembly never intended to criminalize the situation which occurred here. Therefore, I would reverse the court of appeals\u2019 decision, which affirms the appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">In reaching my decision, I carefully considered the evidence presented at trial. According to this evidence, it was appellant who summoned the police to the nursing home on October 7, 1993. The police dispatch tape recorded her telephone conversation, where she stated: \u201cI have an employee that \u2014 well, I have a resident that has a bloody nose and <em>an employee I suspect of punching him in the nose.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In response to appellant\u2019s call, Patrolman Michael Kish reported to the nursing home to investigate. This investigation lasted a total of thirty-two minutes, when Kish left his cruiser to when he re-entered it to leave the scene. Only ten minutes of his investigation was spent talking to the suspect, Noel Neece, Jr., and appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">When interviewed by Kish, Neece stuck to his original story that it was an accident. Appellant knew that another nurse\u2019s aide, Julie Swindell, had given conflicting statements; however, appellant did not know at the time what had really occurred. Appellant had just received the report of this incident about one hour beforehand, and she was in the process of collecting information, so she could reach her own determination of what had occurred. Appellant also stated that she was overwhelmed and had \u201ctunnel vision\u201d because she did not know what her responsibilities were to the patient, the nursing home, the witness, and the suspect. Therefore, appellant did not volunteer Swindell\u2019s name. In addition, she testified that Kish never asked her if there were any witnesses. Instead, the officer only asked whether the patient had a roommate, to which she replied \u201cyes.\u201d Of course, Patrolman Kish\u2019s testimony differs from appellant\u2019s. Kish testified that he asked appellant if there were other witnesses, and she said \u201cno.\u201d Kish also testified that he asked if the patient had a roommate.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Before leaving the nursing home, Kish told appellant he did not think a criminal act had occurred. However, he told appellant to call him if it was later determined that the patient\u2019s nose was broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The next day, Friday, October 8, 1993, appellant began preparing her report concerning the incident for the State Department of Health. In her seven years as the administrator, this was the first time she had dealt with a case of physical patient abuse. In connection with preparing her report, appellant learned the extent of the patient\u2019s injury and obtained a copy of Kish\u2019s police report. After considering all the information, appellant concluded that Neece had intentionally struck the patient. Her report to the state, which she sent on October 11, 1993, reflects her conclusion that patient abuse had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">After reaching this conclusion, appellant realized that the police report and her report to the state were conflicting. She did not want to make the police officer look ridiculous, and she realized that Kish had reached his conclusions because he did not know that the patient\u2019s nose was broken or that Swindell had offered a different version from the suspect\u2019s version. After speaking with the head of night security at the nursing home (an off-duty sergeant for the Avon police) on October 11, 1993, appellant called the police station to give Kish this new information. As a result of appellant\u2019s disclosure, the case was reopened and Neece was arrested for assaulting the patient and ultimately pled guilty to that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Based upon these facts, appellant was convicted of obstructing official business (R.C. 2921.31[A]) and falsification (R.C. 2921.13[A][3]). In order to sustain a conviction for obstructing official business, the state was required to prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant (1) performed any act which hampered or impeded a public official in the performance of his lawful duties, and (2) with <em>a purpose </em>to prevent, obstruct, or delay performance by a public official of any authorized act within his official capacity. (Emphasis added.) To prove falsification, the state was required to show that appellant (1) <em>knowingly </em>made a false statement, (2) <em>with purpose </em>to mislead public official in performing his official function. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">At oral argument, the prosecutor admitted that the state had to prove appellant\u2019s intent in committing these crimes. Further, the prosecutor conceded, despite all the legal rhetoric in his appellee brief to the contrary, that the only evidence he had to prove this intent was Patrolman Kish\u2019s testimony that appellant stated in response to his inquiry that there were no witnesses. The prosecutor then argued that if Kish\u2019s testimony was true, then intent could be inferred from appellant\u2019s oral statement. This was the sum and substance of the evidence the state produced to prove appellant guilty of these charges. In my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>mind, this evidence, which was disputed, is wholly inadequate to prove these crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Instead, the evidence clearly shows that appellant was confused and did not know what her responsibilities were when confronted with the police investigation. This confusion is understandable. As the administrator of the nursing home, she was faced with the task of knowing, understanding and juggling her responsibilities to the patient, nursing home employees of the nursing home, and governmental authorities. Nevertheless, appellant discharged her duties under the law. She immediately reported the incident to the police, suspended the suspected wrongdoer, and proceeded to prepare her report to the Department of Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">After she digested all the information, she arrived at her conclusion that Neece had intentionally struck the patient. This conclusion was recorded in her state report. Because of her concern that her report and the police report did not match, she initiated contact with Patrolman Kish to provide him with all the information she had. She had no legal responsibility to do so. It was not her job to do the investigation for the police. Her only legal obligation was to report a suspected crime, which she did on October 7. However, solely based upon her voluntary actions, Neece was arrested for his crime and charged accordingly. Justice prevailed when Neece entered his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">I am at a loss to understand why the majority wants to punish appellant\u2019s actions. By upholding criminal convictions under these facts, I am afraid that today\u2019s decision today will have a far-reaching impact on every conversation between a law enforcement officer and a private citizen. Faced with the very real threat of criminal prosecution if an oral statement is later corrected, a citizen may very well be discouraged from providing any information to the police. In other words, the police, who already have a difficult job in ferreting out crime, have just been dealt a blow to their ability to combat crime. Instead, I believe the goal of obtaining accurate information about criminal misconduct can best be served by shielding from prosecution witnesses who voluntarily come forward to correct a police officer\u2019s misunderstanding about the case. Accordingly, I would reverse appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b399-7\">Pfeifer, J., wholeheartedly concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
