In Section 8.01 of the stock purchase agreement, National city agrees \u201c * * * to defend, indemnify and hold [Case] * * * harmless * * * against any and all * * * suits * * In contrast, Section 8.03 provides only that \u201cno indemnification\u201d shall be made with respect to \u201cExcluded Claims.\u201d Therefore, since the present declaratory action seeks to enforce the duty to defend contained in Section 8.01 of the agreement, the exclusions in Section 8.03(c) are inapplicable, since they only apply to the duty to indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">The court of appeals erred when it concluded that any duty to defend under Section 8.01 of the stock purchase agreement became \u201cinsignificant,\u201d since indemnification was specifically excluded by Section 8.03(c) for the damages alleged in the Roush complaint. This holding was contrary to the contracted responsibilities explicitly included in the stock purchase agreement. Parties may contract for a duty to defend broader than the duty to indemnify, and the parties to this stock purchase agreement did so. The contractual right to have another party provide a defense in a civil action is by no means \u201cinsignificant\u201d \u2014 it is a valuable right, and therefore may very well be sought in contract negotiations, even if it does not come with the further right to obtain indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">Since National City\u2019s duty to defend applies to \u201cany and all\u201d claims, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Willoughby Hills v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 177, 9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>OBR 463, 459 N.E.2d 555, controls. In <em>Willoughby Hills, </em>this court held in the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cWhere the insurer\u2019s duty to defend is not apparent from the pleadings in the action against the insured, but the allegations do state a claim which is potentially or arguably within the policy coverage, or there is some doubt as to whether a theory of recovery within the policy coverage has been pleaded, the insurer must accept the defense of the claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The trial court found that the allegations against Case in the Roush complaint were \u201cpotentially or arguably\u201d within National City\u2019s duty to defend, and that National City presented no evidence of actual facts which controverted those allegations. Because the allegations were sufficient to establish coverage for the duty to defend under Section 8.01, and because the 8.03(c) exceptions are inapplicable to that duty under the specific terms of the stock purchase agreement, we find that National City has a duty to defend Case in the Roush litigation. We accordingly reverse the judgment of the appellate court and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, T.

Bryant, J., of the Third Appellate District, sitting for Wright, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b478-11\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AjD\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent because I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of this contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">Section 8.01 of the stock purchase agreement in question is entitled \u201cIndemnification by Seller.\u201d Subsection 8.01(c) requires National City to defend, indemnify and hold Case and its personnel harmless for any damage suffered or incurred by reason of the conduct of the business by National City or any other activity of National City occurring on or prior to the closing date, <em>excepting </em>Excluded Claims. \u201cExcluded Claims\u201d are defined in section 8.03 of the stock purchase agreement. Subsection 8.03(c) specifically excludes any claim related to the conduct of business by National City occurring prior to the closing date that arises as a result of the wrongdoing of insiders. \u201cInsiders\u201d is defined in Article III of the stock purchase agreement to specifically include H.E. Schmidt III, who is the alleged wrongdoer in virtually every allegation concerning Case in the Roush complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Because the claims asserted against Case in the Roush litigation squarely fall into the subsection 8.03(c) exception, National City has no duty to defend Case. The majority\u2019s conclusion to the contrary is based on an isolated reading of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>section 8.03 of the stock purchase agreement rather than an interpretation of that agreement as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">In reaching its conclusion, the majority emphasizes that the language of section 8.03 does not include \u201cduty to defend.\u201d To have included that language in section 8.03, however, would have been redundant. Section 8.01 itself excepts National City\u2019s duty to <em>defend, indemnify and hold Case harmless </em>in situations that are the subject of an Excluded Claim as defined in section 8.03. Section 8.03, in turn, merely reiterates its purpose as expressed in section 8.01, stating that \u201cno indemnification <em>under the provisions of this Article VIII </em>shall be made with respect to any Damages suffered or incurred with respect to any of the following * * (Emphasis added.) The exception is created in subsection 8.01(c). Section 8.03 defines the <em>activities </em>included in that exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">There is no reason for the contract to restate in section 8.03 the duties owed by National City to Case under section 8.01, as section 8.01 creates a general duty to defend, indemnify and hold the buyer harmless from the types of damages set forth in that section. Nor is the scope of the exception created in section 8.01(c) limited by the absence of the term \u201cdefend\u201d in section 8.03. Instead, the phrase \u201cindemnification under the provisions of this Article VIII\u201d merely references section 8.01, which includes within the ambit of \u201cIndemnification by Seller\u201d the duties to indemnify, defend and hold Case harmless for certain activity. Subsection 8.01(c) expressly excepts National City\u2019s duties to indemnify, defend and hold Case harmless with respect to the types of activity defined as Excluded Claims in section 8.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The situation is analogous to an insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured under an insurance contract. Allegations in a complaint stating a claim which is potentially or arguably within the policy coverage invokes the duty to defend <em>unless </em>defense of that claim is specifically excluded. <em>Zanco, Inc. v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 114, 11 OBR 413, 464 N.E.2d 513. National City\u2019s duty to defend the claims appearing from allegations in the Roush complaint is specifically excluded through the operation of subsection 8.01(c) and subsection 8.03(c) of the stock purchase agreement. As such, the appellate court correctly concluded that National City owes Case no duty to defend against the allegations contained in the Roush complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Therefore, I would affirm the appellate court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
