The statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-11\">\u201c(A) This section shall be liberally construed to require public officials to take official action and to conduct all deliberations upon official business only in open meetings, unless the subject matter is specifically excepted by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">The statute also requires public bodies to keep minutes of their meetings. R.C. 121.22(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-13\">\u201cAll meetings of any public body are declared to be public meetings open to the public at all times. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-14\">\u201cThe minutes of a regular or special meeting of any such public body shall be promptly prepared, filed, and maintained and shall be open to public inspection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>In <em>State ex rel. Fairfield Leader v. Ricketts </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 97, 564 N.E.2d 486, this court applied the Sunshine Law to supposedly \u201cinformal\u201d meetings where discussions of public interest were held. In <em>Fairfield Leader, </em>the Fairfield County Commissioners met at a hotel on a Saturday morning for a \u201cworkshop\u201d or \u201cretreat\u201d with a majority of the trustees of Violet Township and a majority of the members of the council of the village of Pickerington. Topics for the meeting included water and sewer service, traffic patterns, and land use planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Construing an earlier, similar version of R.C. 121.22(C), this court issued a writ of mandamus compelling the commissioners and the trustees separately to prepare minutes describing their discussions. This court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">\u201c[Wjhere, as here, the members of a public body agree to attend, in their official capacity, a meeting where public business is to be discussed and a majority of the members do attend, R.C. 121.22(C) necessitates that minutes of the meeting be recorded.\u201d 56 Ohio St.3d at 102, 564 N.E.2d at 491.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">In this case, members of council agreed to attend a scheduled meeting to discuss public business. However, unlike in <em>Fairfield Leader, </em>a majority of council members were not present at any one session. R.C. 121.22(B)(2) defines a \u201cmeeting\u201d as \u201cany prearranged discussion of the public business of the public body by a majority of its members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">The question becomes whether a public body may circumvent the requirements of the statute by setting up back-to-back-meetings of less than a majority of its members, with the same topics of public business discussed at each. We hold that the statute prevents such maneuvering to avoid its clear intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">First, we note that the statute states that it \u201cshall be liberally construed.\u201d R.C. 121.22(A). A liberal construction of the definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d would include the back-to-back sessions held by council in this case. The elements of the statutory definition of a meeting are (1) a prearranged discussion, (2) a discussion of the public business of the public body, and (3) the presence at the discussion of a majority of the members of the public body. The council meetings certainly fit within the first two elements. As to the third element, back-to-back sessions discussing exactly the same public issues can be liberally construed as two parts of the same meeting. A majority of council members thus did attend the \u201cmeeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Also, when construing a statute, this court\u2019s \u201cparamount concern\u201d is the statute\u2019s legislative intent. <em>State v. S.R. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 590, 594, 589 N.E.2d 1319, 1323. This court avoids adopting a construction of a statute that would \u201cresult in circumventing the evident purpose of the enactment.\u201d <em>Daiquiri Club, Inc. v. Peck </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 52, 55, 50 O.O. 26, 28, 110 N.E.2d 705, 707. We must also construe statutes to avoid unreasonable or absurd results. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>R.C. 1.47(C); <em>State ex rel. Brown v. Milton-Union Exempted Village Bd. of Edn. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 531 N.E.2d 1297, 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">To find that Cincinnati\u2019s game of \u201clegislative musical chairs\u201d is allowable under the Sunshine Law would be to ignore the legislative intent of the statute, disregard its evident purpose, and allow an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The statute requires that governmental bodies \u201cconduct all deliberations upon official business only in open meetings.\u201d R.C. 121.22(A). Its very purpose is to prevent just the sort of activity that went on in this case \u2014 elected officials meeting secretly to deliberate on public issues without accountability to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">R.C. 121.22(G) does recognize that certain sensitive information is best discussed privately among members of a public body. Thus, the statute allows for \u201cexecutive sessions\u201d of a public body, where the public may be barred. Subsection (G) requires that certain procedures be followed before an executive session may be called, conditions which were not met in this case. The statute does not prohibit impromptu hallway meetings between council members \u2014 the statute concerns itself with prearranged discussions. It does not prohibit member-to-member prearranged discussions. The statute concerns itself only with situations where a majority meets. Although a majority of council members were not in the same room at the same time, a majority of them did attend a prearranged meeting to deliberate on issues of great interest to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">To rule in Cincinnati\u2019s favor would be to endorse the behavior undertaken by city council and the city manager in this case and make it applicable to every city council meeting in Ohio. The statute that exists to shed light on deliberations of public bodies cannot be interpreted in a manner which would result in the public being left in the dark. The Ohio Sunshine Law cannot be circumvented by scheduling back-to-back meetings which, taken together, are attended by a majority of a public body.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">One of two remaining questions is whether the Sunshine Law applies to Cincinnati City Council. The city\u2019s charter provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">\u201cThe laws of the state of Ohio not inconsistent with this charter, except those declared inoperative by ordinance of the council, shall have the force and effect of ordinances of the city of Cincinnati; but in the event of conflict between any such law and any municipal ordinance or resolution the provisions of the ordinance or resolution shall prevail and control.\u201d Section 1, Article II, Cincinnati City Charter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">The city\u2019s charter addresses the openness of council sessions by stating that \u201c[t]he proceedings of the council shall be public.\u201d Section 5, Article II, Cincinnati <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>City Charter. That is certainly not inconsistent with the Sunshine Law, and the Law therefore applies to Cincinnati City Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The only remaining question, then, is whether the Post\u2019s requested relief is appropriate. It is. This court has previously held in <em>Fairfield, Leader </em>that mandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel the preparation of minutes of the meetings of a public body. 56 Ohio St.3d at 102-103, 564 N.E.2d at 491-492.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">We therefore grant the requested writ and order the city of Cincinnati to prepare and make available to the public minutes of the series of back-to-back meetings held by members of city council between June 21 and June 26, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b675-9\">Moyer, C.J., Cook and Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b675-10\">Moyer, C.J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b675-11\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b675-12\">Moyer, C.J., concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"ABKd\">I concur in the grant of the requested writ. The majority does not, however, address relator\u2019s prayer for attorney fees asserted pursuant to R.C. 149.43(C). The majority\u2019s decision not to address the question will result in the denial of relator\u2019s request for an award of attorney fees. I believe this to be the correct decision and write to briefly explain my position on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">Paragraph two of the syllabus of <em>State ex rel. Fox v. Cuyahoga Cty. Hosp. Sys. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 108, 529 N.E.2d 443, states, \u201cThe award of attorney fees under R.C. 149.43(C) is not mandatory.\u201d The purpose of the attorney fee provision is to discourage state officials, agencies and their legal counsel from engaging in conscious circumvention of statutory mandates. In <em>Fox, </em>we held that relators \u201cmust demonstrate a sufficient benefit to the public to warrant the award of attorney fees. The court may also consider the reasonableness of respondents\u2019 refusal to comply, since attorney fees are regarded as punitive. Respondents argue that they acted in good faith and presented serious legal issues regarding [respondents\u2019 obligation to maintain open records]. We find no evidence of bad faith on the part of respondents. There was a reasonable legal basis for respondents\u2019 refusal to produce the requested documents and relators\u2019 prayer for attorney fees is therefore denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 529 N.E.2d at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">The award of attorney fees to relator in this case would be the equivalent of a sanction against council and its legal advisors for actions which amount to conscious misdeeds. I am not convinced that the meetings at issue constitute the kind of conscious circumvention of the law that calls not only for correction, but for sanction as well. A reasonable (though ultimately unpersuasive) argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>could be made for the legality of the actions of council in this case. The facts were unique and not previously reviewed by this court in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Under such circumstances it would be unreasonable to impose upon the Cincinnati City Council and its attorneys a sanction for the violation of laws which were not so clearly broken that a reasonable argument could not be made for the legality of the procedure. Moreover, the imposition of a sanction in this case would not serve the deterrent purpose of the statutory attorney fee provision of the Ohio Sunshine law.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Because I would not grant an award of attorney fees under R.C. 149.43(C) where there is a reasonable legal basis for respondents\u2019 actions and where such conduct has not previously been considered by this court, I concur in the denial of relator\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b676-6\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABo8\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. The majority grants the requested writ and I concur. The majority does not, however, discuss the allowance of attorney fees as prayed for by relator in its complaint and supported in its reply brief at Proposition of Law No. Five. I would grant the relator its costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">It is nigh impossible to distinguish this case from our holding in <em>State ex rel. Fairfield Leader v. Ricketts </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 97, 564 N.E.2d 486. In that case, under very similar circumstances (but, arguably, less egregious), we allowed an award of over $36,000 in costs and attorney fees to a newspaper which sued, successfully, to require a municipal council to prepare minutes of a previously held closed session. See (1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 1414, 586 N.E.2d 122. The result here should be no different especially given that, I believe, attorney fees are mandatory pursuant to R.C. 149.43(C). Further, it is arguable that by logical extension, R.C. 121.22(I)(2)(a) might apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">In any event, the majority does not award fees and I must respectfully, but vigorously, dissent from that part of the majority\u2019s judgment. I concur in the balance of the opinion and the judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b676-9\">Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
