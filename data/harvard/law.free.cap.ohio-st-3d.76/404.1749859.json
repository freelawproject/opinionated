Johnson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 384, 533 N.E.2d 775. Claimant must prove actual IEC and a causal relationship to the allowed conditions. <em>State ex rel. Apgar v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 5, 535 N.E.2d 1364. An injury that has healed cannot impair a claimant\u2019s capacity to earn.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The commission found neither, based on an absence of medical restrictions or limitations. If supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d this finding would be a valid basis for denial of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The commission asserts that the appellate court improperly reversed who has the burden of proof in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">\u201cThe Court [of Appeals] totally ignored the relator\u2019s [claimant\u2019s] evidence, and instead focused solely on whether the evidence relied upon by the Industrial Commission proved that relator did not have an impaired earning capacity. This is prejudicially erroneous, as it places the burden on the Industrial Commission to prove that a claimant does not have an impairment of earning capacity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The commission confuses burden of proof with evidentiary review. The focus is naturally on the commission\u2019s evidence, since it is the commission\u2019s burden to support its orders with \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. This is not the same as forcing the commission to disprove claimant\u2019s allegation of IEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">In this case, the commission\u2019s order is not supported by the evidence. The appellate court, through its referee, suggested that the McCloud, Walker and Howard reports \u2014 which pre-dated the permanent partial disability application by sixteen, thirty-one, and sixteen months respectively \u2014 were stale and not, therefore, \u201csome evidence\u201d in support. This is a valid conclusion under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">A finding of evidentiary staleness should always be approached cautiously. More relevant than the time at which a report was rendered are the content of the report and the question at issue. For example, where the issue is maximum medical improvement, a report that finds a permanent impairment is rarely rendered invalid by the passage of time. Conversely, the changeable nature of a claimant\u2019s ability to work is often affected by time.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">In this case, the commission\u2019s own actions substantiate the appellate court\u2019s reasoning. When forced to select the medical evidence that most accurately reflected the degree of claimant\u2019s permanent partial disability in 1991, the commission on May 21, 1991 rejected the McCloud, Walker and Howard reports and relied on Dr. Culberson\u2019s April 1991 narrative. The court of appeals did not, therefore, err in finding that the Walker, McCloud and Howard reports were not \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s denial of IEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">The removal of these reports leaves Dr. Culberson\u2019s report as the sole evidence on which the commission\u2019s findings rest. Like the other reports, the Culberson report does not support the challenged order. Dr. Culberson does not corroborate the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant had no medical limitations on his ability to earn. Dr. Culberson never addressed this question, so he provides no definitive substantiation or refutation of that finding. Moreover, his finding of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>thirty-nine percent impairment seems inconsistent with the commission\u2019s determination that nothing was physically wrong with claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">For these reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
