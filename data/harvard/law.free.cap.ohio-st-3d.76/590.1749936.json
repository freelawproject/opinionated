Permanent total disability compensation eligibility, therefore, hinges on the interpretation given to claimant\u2019s nonmedical disability factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">The commission\u2019s favorable assessment of claimant\u2019s age is consistent with <em>State ex rel. Ellis v. McGraw Edison Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 92, 609 N.E.2d 164. There, we upheld the commission\u2019s prerogative to classify as an asset the age of a claimant who was only one to two years younger than the claimant at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">The commission\u2019s positive characterization of claimant\u2019s education, on the other hand, is not supported by the record. While the tenor of the commission\u2019s order suggests that the commission recognized the limitations imposed by claimant\u2019s eighth grade education, it also implies that claimant\u2019s educational deficit was overcome by his two years of vocational training. This reasoning, however, ignores that claimant\u2019s training prepared him for sheet metal labor \u2014 a job now beyond his physical abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">The pivotal factor in the commission\u2019s decision appears to have been claimant\u2019s work history. We note initially that the commission\u2019s favorable assessment of claimant\u2019s telegram delivery job is an abuse of discretion. Claimant delivered telegrams by bicycle in the late 1950s while in his teens. Even assuming that such a job exists today, we find that this particular occupational experience is so remote \u2014 both vocationally and chronologically \u2014 as to make the experience of negligible re-employment value.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">Much more relevant is the commission\u2019s assessment of claimant\u2019s sheet metal experience. Claimant\u2019s sheet metal experience was mainly as a foreman. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>commission focused on this experience and concluded that claimant possessed skills that made him amenable to supervisory work of a less strenuous nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">We do not find this determination to be an abuse of discretion. While we recognize that claimant\u2019s supervisory duties were not exclusively sedentary, other responsibilities included the assignment of work duties, training of new employees, hiring and firing of workers, and assisting the engineering department with product design. The commission interpreted these personnel duties as providing experience transferable to other work. Thus, at a minimum, the commission did not view claimant\u2019s work history as an insurmountable barrier to re-employment or retraining. Finding no evidence that the amount of time spent on physical duties was vastly disproportionate to that spent on managerial tasks, we cannot characterize this finding as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Viewing the commission\u2019s analysis in its totality, we find that it is supported by \u201csome evidence\u201d and adequately sets forth the reasoning upon which it rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b723-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
