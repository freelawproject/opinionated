We agree with the court of appeals that there was \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">In <em>State ex rel. Baker Material Handling Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 202, 631 N.E.2d 138, paragraph two of the syllabus, we held that: \u201cAn employee who retires prior to becoming permanently and totally disabled is precluded from eligibility for permanent total disability compensation only if the retirement is voluntary and constitutes an abandonment of the entire job market.\u201d The present claimant does not allege that he was permanently and totally disabled when he retired. Resolution of this issue, therefore, depends upon the character and extent of claimant\u2019s retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">We have previously held that a claimant who initiates his or her retirement for reasons unrelated to the industrial injury is considered to have voluntarily retired. <em>State ex rel. Rockwell Internatl. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 44, 531 N.E.2d 678. In light of McAtee\u2019s rejection of permanent total disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>retirement benefits, we find that there was \u201csome evidence\u201d that his retirement was unrelated to his injury and, hence, voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">As for the question of whether McAtee abandoned the entire labor force, the commission\u2019s order does not explicitly address that issue. However, the commission relied on all of the evidence in the file and adduced at the hearing, and that evidence can only lead to the conclusion that McAtee abandoned the work force. His early retirement and receipt of Social Security benefits, his application for pension benefits, and his failure to seek other employment following his departure from Chrysler, all demonstrate his intent to leave the labor force. Accordingly, we find that the disposition of the abandonment issue was implicit in the commission\u2019s order. The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b781-7\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b781-8\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b781-9\">F.E.
