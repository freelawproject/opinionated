First, is the promulgation of Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) invalid due to BWC\u2019s failure to comply with R.C. Chapter 119? Second, does BWC owe a duty, by virtue of the asserted improper promulgation of Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D), either to grant retroactive effect to Hoover\u2019s notice of withdrawal or to calculate Hoover\u2019s assessment for the first half of 1990 under the pre-1990 standard? For the reasons that follow, we hold that Hoover has no right to BWC\u2019s performance of the requested acts, regardless of whether Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) was promulgated properly. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment denying the writ of mandamus and do not pass upon the alleged invalidity of Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">In 1989 and before, Hoover participated in the handicap reimbursement program established under R.C. 4123.343. This statute, enacted in 1955 to encourage employment of disabled workers, charges employee injury claims . attributable to a preexisting handicap to the surplus portion of the state insurance fund. Fulton, Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1991) 312, Section 14.15; Young, Workman\u2019s Compensation Law of Ohio (2 Ed.1971) 288, Section 17.5. The surplus fund either pays such claims directly or reimburses self-insured employers for paid handicap claim expenses. Fulton, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Since the 1986 enactment of R.C. 4123.343(G), 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 745, self-insured employers have been allowed to withdraw from or \u201copt out\u201d of the handicap reimbursement program. In June 1990, Hoover gave notice of its \u25a0withdrawal mainly to avoid the consequences of R.C. 4123.35(1), effective November 3,1989. 143 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3197, 3328. Beginning on July 1,1990, R.C. 4123.35(1) authorized a new basis for calculating the assessment of participating self-insured employers to compensate the surplus fund and to finance the program. Previously, all self-insurers contributed to the surplus fund by paying a percentage of the payroll-based premium they would have paid as a state fund employer, and self-insurers participating in the handicap reimbursement program paid an additional percentage of that premium. Young, <em>supra, </em>at 237, Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>13.6; Fulton, <em>supra, </em>at 310-311, Section 14.13; Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-30(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The new handicap reimbursement assessment was to be calculated based on the \u201cpaid compensation\u201d expended by each self-insurer in the preceding year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Apparently, it was also to be calculated separately and only in relation to other self-insurers, such that handicap claim costs were no longer spread over all employers according to their classification of hazard. See Fulton, <em>supra, </em>at 311, Section 14.13. This change, together with the 12.4 percent rate Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> applied to the self-insurer\u2019s paid compensation, allegedly increased Hoover\u2019s assessment by six hundred percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Hoover claims that it would have opted out of the handicap reimbursement program timely, that is, before December 31, 1989, with better notice of the new assessment rate in Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D). Hoover\u2019s speculation as to this possibility, however, is insufficient to justify retroactive relief from the assessment. Moreover, Hoover\u2019s cited <em>authority </em>\u2014 Condee <em>v. Lindley </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 90, 12 OBR 79, 465 N.E.2d 450 \u2014 does not establish a right to this or other affirmative relief upon the invalidation or rescission of a regulation pursuant to R.C. 119.02. In <em>Condee, </em>we invalidated a Tax Commissioner\u2019s policy for apportioning the tax value of public utility property because the policy had not been formally promulgated in accordance with R.C. Chapter 119. We did not go further and attempt to correct the inequity challenged by the complaining county auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Nor has Hoover shown a clear right to assessment for the first half of 1990 under pre-1990 standards. The parties agree that the enactment of R.C. 4123.35(1) changed the self-insurers\u2019 handicap reimbursement assessment from a percentage of the payroll-based premium under former Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-30(B) to a calculation based on paid compensation. Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-30(B), therefore, has been superseded by R.C. 4123.35(1). <em>DLZ Corp. v. Dept. of Adm. Serv. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 777, 781, 658 N.E.2d 28, 31 (\u201cAn administrative rule that would preclude the use of a statute must yield to the statute.\u201d). See, also, <em>State ex rel. Kildow v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 573, 581, 1 O.O. 235, 238, 192 N.E. 873, 876, and <em>State ex rel. Galloway v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 496, 13 O.O. 102, 17 N.E.2d 918, paragraph one of the syllabus (rules in conflict with express provisions of statutes are unenforceable).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">For this reason, Hoover\u2019s cited authority for invoking the previous assessment <em>standard </em>\u2014 State <em>ex rel. Reider\u2019s, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 242, 549 N.E.2d 532 \u2014 also does not apply here. In <em>Reider\u2019s, </em>the Court of Appeals for Franklin County invalidated a resolution in which the Industrial Commission declared a \u201ctemporary moratorium\u201d on processing applications for self-insured status. The court held that the temporary moratorium \u201cwas but a thinly veiled attempt to rescind a preexisting rule, as defined by R.C. 119.01(C), by resolution,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 245, 549 N.E.2d at 534, and it ordered that the applications for self-insurance be processed in accordance with the preexisting rule. However, the <em>Reider\u2019s </em>court was not confronted with an intervening statute, similar to R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>4123.35(1), that had changed the procedure for processing these applications and was in conflict with the preexisting rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Finally, Hoover complains that the court of appeals\u2019 decision \u2014 to deny mandamus despite its conclusion that Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) was invalid \u2014 left the parties \u201cin limbo\u201d as far as the assessment of self-insured employers participating in the handicap reimbursement program. However, the invalidation of an administrative rule does not, as Hoover seems to argue, necessarily leave the regulated agency rudderless in carrying out statutory duties. Rather, the agency must still execute authority reasonably and in a manner consistent with the objectives and standards that governing statutes impose. See, <em>e.g., Dressler Coal Corp. v. Call </em>(1981), 4 Ohio App.3d 81, 85, 4 OBR 161, 166, 446 N.E.2d 785, 789 (agency permissibly enforced statutory standards with internally developed evaluation criteria where its previously adopted rules had been enjoined and new rules had not yet been promulgated). Thus, even if we were to declare Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) invalid as improperly promulgated, BWC would nevertheless have been required to execute its charge under R.C. 4123.35(1) in accordance with R.C. Chapter 4123 and other applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">For a writ of mandamus to issue, Hoover must establish that it has a clear legal right to BWC\u2019s performance of a clear legal duty, and that Hoover has no adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Huntington Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Duryee </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 530, 653 N.E.2d 349. Hoover has failed to satisfy this standard. Accordingly, the court of appeals correctly denied the requested writ of mandamus and its judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b754-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

We have before us an appeal (Hoover) and a cross-appeal (BWC). I concur with the ultimate judgment of the majority. I also concur with the majority\u2019s treatment of Hoover\u2019s appeal. I respectfully dissent from the judgment of the majority which, in effect, ignores the very important issue and concept brought to us by BWC\u2019s cross-appeal and our allowance thereof. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent as to that portion of the majority\u2019s judgment and would, instead, reverse the court of appeals on the issue presented by BWC and find the cross-appeal of BWC to be well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">In its cross-appeal, BWC contends that promulgation of Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) represents \u201caction [taken] under\u201d R.C. 4123.34 and is, therefore, excepted from R.C. Chapter 119 rule-making. I agree. Thus, I would hold that (1) R.C. 4123.34, together with R.C. 4123.29, confers on BWC the authority to set rates, including rates for assessing self-insured employers, to maintain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>solvency of the surplus fund, (2) Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) establishes a rate for this purpose, and, therefore, (3) Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) represents action under R.C. 4123.34 and is excepted from R.C. Chapter 119 compliance. I would, therefore, reject the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) was invalidly promulgated.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Hoover contends that it did not receive sufficient notice of the new assessment rate in Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) because the regulation was promulgated pursuant to the abbreviated rule-making procedures in R.C. 111.15 (rule effective ten days after proper filing). Hoover maintains that the thirty-day notice and hearing procedures in R.C. 119.03 applied. In defining the agencies to which R.C. Chapter 119 applies, R.C. 119.01(A) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\"><em>\u201cSections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code do not apply </em>* * * <em>to the actions of the </em>industrial commission and <em>bureau of workers\u2019 compensation under </em>* * * <em>sections 1123.29 </em>[authorizes administrator to, <em>inter alia, </em>fix premium rates to maintain state insurance fund], <em>1123.31 </em>[authorizes administrator to fix and maintain premium rates for state insurance fund and for creation and maintenance of surplus fund], 4123.341, 4123.342, 4123.40, 4123.411, 4123.44, 4123.441, 4123.442, and divisions (B), (C), and (E) of section 4131.14 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The court of appeals found that the promulgation of Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) involved more than just BWC \u201caction under * * * R.C. 4123.34\u201d; it also represented action taken under R.C. 4123.343 and 4123.35, in that the rule set rates to be applied to the compensation paid by self-insurers participating in the handicap reimbursement program. Neither R.C. 4123.343 nor 4123.35 is excepted by R.C. 119.01(A). Thus, the court of appeals found that the promulgation of Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) required compliance with R.C. Chapter 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">BWC disputes this finding, arguing, in effect, that (1) R.C. 4123.34 confers the broad authority under which BWC sets all rates to maintain the state insurance and surplus funds and, therefore, (2) all rate setting is excepted from R.C. Chapter 119 compliance. The fact that the formula for calculating the rate appears elsewhere in R.C. Chapter 4123 is, according to BWC, irrelevant, since the \u201caction\u201d is still rate-setting. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">R.C. 4123.29 and 4123.34 establish the state insurance fund and, more important for this case, the surplus fund into which R.C. 4123.35(1) assessments are paid. These statutes also require BWC to set premiums according to payroll-based basic and merit rates and to guarantee the solvency of these funds. Thus, rate-setting which establishes premiums or premium-based assessments, as were paid by self-insured employers under Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-30, is fundamentally \u201caction [taken] under\u201d R.C. 4123.29 and 4123.34. Accordingly, to the extent that BWC determined a self-insurer\u2019s contribution to the surplus fund on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>basis of premiums authorized by R.C. 4123.29 and 4123.34, those acts were excepted from R.C. Chapter 119 pursuant to R.C. 119.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Hoover recognizes that premium rate-setting is excepted from R.C. Chapter 119 rule-making. However, since the new Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) assessment is authorized by R.C. 4123.35(1) and is no longer a percentage of the premiums authorized by R.C. 4123.29 and 4123.34, Hoover maintains that the premiums paid by state fund employers must be distinguished from the assessments that self-insured employers pay and that imposing an assessment constitutes action only under R.C. 4123.35(1). BWC gives no credence to the premium/assessment distinction, arguing that a self-insurer\u2019s assessment is equivalent to the premium all employers are obligated to pay to maintain the solvency of the state insurance fund and the surplus fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">While I am not prepared to say, based on the arguments before us, that premiums and assessments are, for all purposes, equivalent, I do believe that to accept Hoover\u2019s distinction requires us to ignore that all employers, whether they pay premiums as state fund employers or assessments as self-insurers, are responsible in some measure for maintaining the surplus fund. More specifically, while R.C. 4123.35(B) relieves self-insurers of premiums attributable to wage compensation and medical and funeral expenses, these employers must still \u201cpay into the state insurance fund such amounts as are required to be credited to the surplus fund in [R.C. 4123.34(B)]\u201d under R.C. 4123.35(D). The self-insurer\u2019s assessment, therefore, represents its share of the premium amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The new assessment authorized by R.C. 4123.35(1), while no longer based on a percentage of the premium, serves the same purpose. The assessment represents the self-insured employer\u2019s share of the costs of maintaining the surplus and various other funds. As a result, premiums and assessments are both chargeable pursuant to the basic authority in R.C. 4123.29 and 4123.34, and rules governing them are excepted from compliance with R.C. Chapter 119. Accordingly, I would hold that assessments and premiums are sufficiently related, at least insofar as deciding which rule-making procedures apply, to find that both are generated pursuant to the rate-making authority of R.C. 4123.29 and 4123.34.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Moreover, the non-payroll basis for the new assessments \u2014 paid compensation \u2014 does not sever the fundamental connection of premiums and assessments to R.C. 4123.29 and 4123.34 rate-setting. Where payroll is not an adequate measure for determining the premium to be paid for the degree of hazard, R.C. 4123.29(A)(2) authorizes premiums calculated on \u201csuch other basis, consistent with insurance principles, as is equitable in view of the degree of hazard.\u201d Thus, while payroll is ordinarily the basis for determining contributions to the state insurance fund, other equitable means may be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Therefore, Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D) was properly promulgated under R.C. 111.15 because it represents \u201caction [taken] under\u201d R.C. 4123.29 and 4123.34 rate-making authority. R.C. 119.01(A) excepts such action. Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-32(D), therefore, is not invalid, and the court of appeals\u2019 judgment holding otherwise should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Accordingly, I concur in part and dissent in part. I would affirm on the appeal and reverse on the cross-appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
