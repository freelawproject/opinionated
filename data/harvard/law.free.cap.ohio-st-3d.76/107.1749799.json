Pursuant to the mandate of R.C. 2929.05(A), we have considered each of appellant\u2019s propositions of law and have reviewed the sentence for appropriateness and proportionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">We have previously held that R.C. 2929.05 does not require this court to address and discuss, in opinion form, each and every proposition of law raised in a capital case. See, <em>e.g., State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 628, 653 N.E.2d 675, 680; <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 520 N.E.2d 568, 570. Accordingly, we continue to adhere to our view on this issue and address only those issues that warrant discussion. For the following reasons, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment and uphold Davis\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">The Guilt Phase A</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">\n<em>Venue/Pretrial Publicity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">The critical issue in Davis\u2019s first proposition of law is whether the trial court\u2019s refusal to change venue violated Davis\u2019s fair trial rights. In order to safeguard the fair trial rights of a defendant, a trial court can change venue \u201cwhen it appears that a fair and impartial trial cannot be held\u201d in that court. Crim.R. 18; R.C. 2901.12(K). In <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 479, 653 N.E.2d 304, 313, we reaffirmed our position that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[a] change of venue rests largely in the discretion of the trial court, and * * * appellate courts should not disturb the trial court\u2019s [venue] ruling * * * unless it is clearly shown that the trial court has abused its discretion.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citing <em>State v. Maurer </em>[1984], 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 250, 15 OBR 379, 388-389, 473 N.E.2d 768, 780, quoting <em>State v. Fairbanks </em>[1972], 32 Ohio St.2d 34, 37, 61 O.O.2d 241, 243, 289 N.E.2d 352, 355.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Davis asserts that constant and excessive prejudicial media coverage before and during his trial made it impossible to seat an impartial jury, in spite of the trial court\u2019s precautions and efforts during voir dire. The majority of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>publicity about this case was disseminated in November and December 1991. The trial did not take place until May 1992. Compare <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 559 N.E.2d 710 (delay of trial to February from September arraignment found to have helped dissipate any effects from the pretrial publicity). While newspaper articles did reference Perkins\u2019s murder following a similar incident in March 1992, two months prior to trial, the articles mentioned the murder only briefly, and with no details.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Pretrial print and electronic media coverage of the crime, while significant, did not act to deprive Davis of a fair trial. In <em>State v. Bayless </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 73, 98, 2 O.O.3d 249, 262, 357 N.E.2d 1035, 1051, we concluded that \u201ca careful and searching <em>voir dire </em>provides the best test of whether prejudicial pretrial publicity has prevented obtaining a fair and impartial jury from the locality.\u201d The transcript of voir dire indicates that publicity in this case, while significant, was not pervasive. Moreover, the trial court took substantial measures to ensure that pretrial publicity did not prejudice Davis\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The trial court individually questioned over sixty veniremen and all but a few were queried as to the impact of pretrial publicity. While a sizable majority knew at least some details of the crime, ten knew nothing about the crime at all, and another eight had only vague, sketchy knowledge. The trial court readily excused those in the venire who had formed fixed opinions or were otherwise unsuitable. As such, the trial jury was not tainted by excessive exposure to pretrial publicity. In support of this conclusion, the record shows that the defense made only four challenges for cause and waived half of its peremptory challenges. Cf. <em>Murphy v. Florida </em>(1975), 421 U.S. 794, 803, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 2037, 44 L.Ed.2d 589, 596; and <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 5, 514 N.E.2d 407, 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Davis also maintains that there was \u201ccontinuous\u201d media coverage during voir dire. However, the record does not show the content or amount of such coverage at that time. Moreover, the court instructed all veniremen at the outset not to read, watch, or listen to any media accounts of the trial until being dismissed from the case, and there is no evidence that anyone disobeyed this warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the media coverage surrounding this case was not so pervasive and sensational as to preclude a fair trial in Cuyahoga County.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">In addition to the general publicity issue, Davis also asserts that publication by the media of his criminal record, along with information \u201chighly probative of his guilt,\u201d was enough to create a presumption of prejudice. However, this claim ignores the mandate of <em>Murphy v. Florida, </em>which held that pretrial publicity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>about a defendant\u2019s criminal record does not create an automatic presumption of prejudice. <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S. at 798, 95 S.Ct. at 2035, 44 L.Ed.2d at 593-594.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Davis\u2019s first proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\n<em>Pretrial Lineups</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Davis\u2019s second proposition of law similarly lacks merit. He proposes that we rule that the trial court erred in failing to suppress the identification testimony of three witnesses at trial because the witnesses\u2019 identifications resulted from unduly suggestive lineups and were not otherwise reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Mattie Baker, Nancy Brown, and Diane Tome, who saw Davis in downtown Cleveland on November 26, around 7:45 in the vicinity of the parking lot where the abduction occurred, all identified Davis in lineups as the man they saw on November 26,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">When a witness has been confronted with a suspect before trial, due process requires a court to suppress an identification of the suspect if the confrontation was unnecessarily suggestive of the suspect\u2019s guilt and the identification was unreliable under all the circumstances. <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 438, 588 N.E.2d 819, 830-831, citing <em>Manson v. Brathwaite </em>(1977), 432 U.S. 98, 116, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2254, 53 L.Ed.2d 140, 155, and <em>Neil v. Biggers </em>(1972), 409 U.S. 188, 196-198, 93 S.Ct. 375, 381-382, 34 L.Ed.2d 401, 410-411. However, no due process violation will be found where an identification does not stem from an impermissibly suggestive confrontation, but is instead the result of observations at the time of the crime. <em>Coleman v. Alabama </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 1, 5-6, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 2001, 26 L.Ed.2d 387, 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">The day after the murder occurred, Baker and Brown picked Davis out of a lineup and identified him as the man they saw with Amy Perkins. A week later, Tome also picked Davis out of a lineup as the man she saw near the crime scene shortly before the kidnapping. Davis claims these lineups were unnecessarily suggestive, because the other participants looked so unlike him that he stood out.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">On both November 27 and December 3, Davis was lined up with five other black males. All, including Davis, had facial hair; however, the complexions of the men varied and none had a bushy, curly hairstyle like Davis\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">A defendant in a lineup need not be surrounded by people nearly identical in appearance. <em>New York v. Chipp </em>(1990), 75 N.Y.2d 327, 336, 553 N.Y.S.2d 72, 77, 552 N.E.2d 608, 613. \u201c[E]ven * * * significant dissimilarities of appearance or dress\u201d will not necessarily deny due process. 1 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure (1984) 587, Section 7.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Davis also argues that he was the only one in either lineup with jail slippers on his feet and no street clothes under his jail uniform. However, this did not affect the integrity of the lineups. Baker, Tome, and Detective Leo Allen of the Cleveland Police Department testified that the participants\u2019 street clothes were not visible under the jail uniforms. Their footwear may have been visible, but the witnesses were told to look at faces only. Baker thought all the participants \u201chad on basically the same slippers,\u201d and Tome could not recall whether they had any footwear on.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Even if we were to accept Davis\u2019s contention that the lineups were unnecessarily suggestive, the identifications were nonetheless reliable under the totality of the circumstances. In order to determine the reliability of the identification, we must consider (1) the witness\u2019s opportunity to view the defendant at the time of the incident, (2) the witness\u2019s degree of attention, (3) the accuracy of the witness\u2019s prior description, (4) the witness\u2019s certainty when identifying the suspect at the time of the confrontation, and (5) the length of time elapsed between the crime and the identification. <em>Waddy, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 439, 588 N.E.2d at 831, citing <em>Neil, </em>409 U.S. at 199-200, 93 S.Ct. at 382, 34 L.Ed.2d at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Baker knew Davis, having seen him more than twenty times before. While she testified at trial that she saw Davis on television before the lineup, at the voir dire of identification witnesses she did not so testify, and Davis did not renew his motion to suppress in light of Baker\u2019s trial testimony. See <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 45, 630 N.E.2d 339, 348. Davis also argues that Detective Allen tainted Baker\u2019s identification by asking her \u201cto identify Wiley Davis in a lineup.\u201d However, Baker testified that she did not recall Allen\u2019s exact words, and even if Allen did use Wiley Davis\u2019s name, Baker recognized Davis only because of his employment at the restaurant she frequented and did not know him by name. Even assuming Allen used Davis\u2019s name, that would not affect the reliability of Baker\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Brown\u2019s identification is also rehable. She had a good opportunity to see the driver as the car rolled past her, close at hand and \u201cslow enough for me to get a good look * * *.\u201d Her attention was undivided, and her identification was positive. While Davis claims Brown\u2019s identification was tainted by news coverage, Brown testified that she did not see any photos of Davis in the news media before the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Of the three identifications, Tome\u2019s is the most problematic; however, her testimony at trial merely placed Davis near, but not at, the parking lot about half an hour before Baker placed him in the car with the victim. Independent of Tome\u2019s testimony, the state produced overwhelming proof that Davis was Perkins\u2019s killer. Accordingly, even assuming error in the trial court\u2019s admission of Tome\u2019s identification testimony, we would be unable to conclude that such error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>compels a reversal of Davis\u2019s conviction. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 290, 6 OBR 345, 353, 452 N.E.2d 1323, 1333, citing <em>Harrington v. California </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 250, 254, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 1728-1729, 23 L.Ed.2d 284, 287-288.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Davis\u2019s second proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\n<em>Attempted Rape</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">We find merit in Davis\u2019s third proposition of law, in which he contends that the state failed to prove him guilty of the attempted rape specifications. Attempted rape requires that the actor (1) intend to compel submission to sexual conduct by force or threat, and (2) commit some act that \u201c \u2018convincingly demonstrate^]\u2019 \u201d such intent. See <em>State v. Heinish </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 231, 238-239, 553 N.E.2d 1026, 1035, quoting <em>State v. </em>Woods (1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 127, 132, 2 O.O.3d 289, 292, 357 N.E.2d 1059, 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The only evidence supporting the attempted rape specifications is Gwendolyn Brice\u2019s testimony that just before Davis shot Perkins, Brice saw Perkins trying to push Davis away, acting as if \u201cshe [Perkins] didn\u2019t want to do [something,\u201d the fact that Perkins was nude when Davis dumped her from the car, and the forensic evidence showing that there were possible finger marks on Perkins\u2019s left thigh.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">While removing the victim\u2019s clothing can amount to a \u201csubstantial step\u201d toward the commission of rape, <em>State v. Powell </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 255, 261, 552 N.E.2d 191, 198, a defendant cannot be convicted of attempted rape <em>solely </em>on evidence that he removed the victim\u2019s clothing. There must be evidence indicating purpose to commit rape instead of some other sex offense, such as gross sexual imposition, R.C. 2907.05, which requires only sexual <em>contact. </em>See <em>Heinish, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 238-239, 553 N.E.2d at 1035. In <em>Heinish, </em>this court found that a victim\u2019s partial nudity combined with saliva on the crotch of her blue jeans was insufficient to show intent to rape. Justice Wright, writing for a majority of the <em>Heinish </em>court, commented that while \u201c[o]ne may be tempted to speculate and indeed strongly suspect that crimes other than a murder were committed * * *, we would be remiss in performing our duties of review if we let the attempted rape conviction stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239, 553 N.E.2d at 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Brice\u2019s testimony that Perkins seemed to be trying to push Davis away from her shortly before the shooting occurred is not strongly corroborative of Davis\u2019s intent to accomplish sexual conduct. Further, there was no testimony that imprints suggestive of finger marks left on Perkins\u2019s thigh were indicative of an attempt to compel sexual conduct as opposed to sexual contact. Contrast <em>State v. Scudder </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 643 N.E.2d 524 (where, along with other evidence indicative of the defendant\u2019s intent to commit rape, the court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>bloody hand marks on the victim\u2019s thighs were in such a pattern so as to indicate that the killer had tried to force the victim\u2019s legs apart).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Based on the evidence presented, we find there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Davis attempted to rape Perkins. Accordingly, we must reverse the attempted rape specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Despite our reversal of Davis\u2019s attempted rape specifications, we are not required to vacate his death sentence. We must independently reweigh the remaining aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors. See <em>Clemons v. Mississippi </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 738, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 108 L.Ed.2d 725. Accordingly, we sustain Davis\u2019s third proposition of law, reverse the court of appeals with respect to the attempted rape specifications, and exclude those specifications from our independent review of aggravating circumstances and mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">\n<em>Aggravated Robbery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Davis claims in his fourth proposition that there was insufficient evidence of aggravated robbery to support a conviction. R.C. 2911.01(A)(2) states, \u201cNo person, in attempting or committing a theft offense, * * * shall * * * [ijnflict or attempt to inflict serious physical harm on another.\u201d Davis argues that the prosecution failed to prove a \u201ctheft offense\u201d under R.C. 2913.02. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Amy Perkins\u2019s husband, David, testified that Amy \u201chabitually\u201d wore \u201ca combination engagement and wedding ring\u201d consisting of twelve small diamonds and a two-carat marquise, \u201cand she also habitually wore a Rolex watch * * David specifically said Amy \u201cwore the items every day.\u201d Thus, even though David could not testify from personal knowledge that Amy wore the items on the day she was murdered, a jury could reasonably infer that she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">Nancy Brown, who saw Amy immediately after she was pushed out of the car, specifically testified that Amy had \u201cno jewelry, no clothing, nothing on.\u201d David Perkins testified that the watch and ring were \u201cmissing\u201d and he never saw them again. Amy\u2019s belongings which were found in the Toyota \u201cappeared to have been rifled through.\u201d The majority of the evidence supporting Davis\u2019s conviction of a theft offense is circumstantial; however, circumstantial evidence inherently possesses the same value as direct evidence. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph one of the syllabus. Such evidence, when coupled with the circumstances of the kidnapping and murder, is sufficient for a rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that a theft offense took place. See <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 632, 653 N.E.2d 675, 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Davis\u2019s fourth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Penalty Phase A</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">In his eleventh proposition of law, Davis argues that the trial court improperly gave the jury an \u201cacquittal first\u201d instruction during the penalty phase of the trial. In support of this proposition, Davis cites <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 213, 533 N.E.2d 286, wherein this court outlined the progression that a jury must follow when the trial court charges it on the indicted offense as well as a lesser included offense or offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">\u201c\u00c1 jury must unanimously agree that the defendant is guilty of a particular criminal offense before returning a verdict of guilty on that offense. If a jury is unable to agree unanimously that a defendant is guilty of a particular offense, it may proceed to consider a lesser included offense upon which evidence has been presented. The jury is not required to determine unanimously that the defendant is not guilty of the crime charged before it may consider a lesser included offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-11\"><em>Thomas </em>dealt with jury instructions regarding a guilt determination and therefore is not directly applicable to the death penalty versus life imprisonment recommendation that a jury is required to make in the penalty phase of a capital case. Nevertheless, Davis\u2019s argument that a \u201cproper [jury] instruction would have informed the jury that had the state failed to prove the principal] charge or had the jury been unable to agree on whether the state had failed to prove the elements of the greater offense[,] it could have considered the lesser charge\u201d raises an issue identical to that which formed the basis of our recent decision to overturn a death sentence in <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 661 N.E.2d 1030. Because the pertinent jury instructions given in this case are distinguishable from those given in <em>Brooks, </em>however, this case warrants dissimilar disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">In <em>Brooks, </em>the trial court charged the jury that \u201c \u2018[y]ou are now required to determine <em>unanimously </em>that the death penalty <em>is inappropriate before </em>you can consider a life sentence.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 159, 661 N.E.2d at 1040. As a result of this instruction, the jury was required to issue a death sentence recommendation unless each juror was convinced that the death penalty was inappropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 160, 661 N.E.2d at 1041. The <em>Brooks </em>court found error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the trial court\u2019s instruction because it was in direct conflict with R.C. 2929.03(D)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The <em>Brooks </em>court concluded that the erroneous jury instruction was prejudicial to the defendant because it gave jurors the impression that a single juror could not prevent a death penalty recommendation on his or her conviction that the aggravating circumstances in a case do not outweigh the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Davis cites the following portion of the trial court\u2019s jury instructions in support of his argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201cOn the other hand, if after considering all of the relevant evidence raised at trial, the testimony, other evidence, the unsworn statement of Wiley Davis, Jr. and the arguments of counsel, you find that the state of Ohio failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances which the defendant, Wiley Davis, Jr., was found guilty of committing, outweigh the mitigating factors, then you will return your verdict reflecting your decision; that is, you must find that the State has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances which the defendant was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">\u201cIn this event you will then proceed to determine which of the two possible life imprisonment sentences to recommend to the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">However, Davis has omitted the first portion of the trial court\u2019s charge, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\"><em>\u201cIf all twelve members of the jury </em>find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances which Wiley Davis, Jr. was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors, if any, then you must return such finding for the Court.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">When read as a whole, the trial court\u2019s instruction effectively informed the jury that a death penalty recommendation could be returned only after a unanimous vote that the aggravating circumstances that Davis was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factor presented in the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, unlike the instructions given in <em>Brooks, </em>the jury was not instructed that it was required to <em>unanimously </em>determine that the death penalty was inappropriate before it could consider the life sentence alternatives. Nevertheless, it cannot be disputed that the jury instruction given in this case lacks the clarity of the model instruction contemplated in <em>Brooks, </em>which urges trial courts to underscore a solitary juror\u2019s ability to prevent a death penalty recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">In the instant case, in addition to giving the contested charge, the trial court read the verdict forms to the jury and thereafter charged it that all twelve jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>were required to be in agreement before returning any of the verdicts. The court also instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201cNow, your initial conduct upon entering the jury room, again, is a matter of importance. You should consult with each other; consider each other\u2019s views, and deliberate with an objective of reaching an agreement, if you can do so, without doing violence to your individual conscience and good judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\u201cYou should do so only after a discussion and a consideration of the case with your fellow jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\u201cRemember, each of you is equal in the jury room, and you shouldn\u2019t hesitate to change your opinion if convinced by your fellow jurors that you are wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">\u201cHowever, do not surrender any honest conviction in order to be congenial, or to reach a verdict solely of the belief of the other jurors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Upon review of all of the instructions given in this case, it is clear that the jury was adequately informed that unanimity was required to return a death penalty recommendation. Each juror was made aware that he or she could prevent a death penalty recommendation by finding that the aggravating circumstances in the case do not outweigh the mitigating factors \u2014 an essential fact which sets this case apart from <em>Brooks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Because Davis has failed to demonstrate that his right to a fair trial was prejudiced as a result of the contested jury instruction, we overrule his eleventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">In his fifth proposition of law, Davis contends that, in order to convict on the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specifications, the jury had to find <em>unanimously </em>either that Davis was the principal offender or that he killed with prior calculation and design. Davis claims error because the jury was not so instructed; however, Davis did not request any such instruction at trial. Under the plain error rule, Davis can prevail only by showing that \u201cbut for the [alleged] error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1979), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">We find that the alleged error here was not outcome-determinative. The jury convicted Davis of aggravated murder on Count One of the indictment. To do so, the jury had to unanimously find prior calculation and design. Further, because there was no evidence produced at trial that a second actor participated in committing the aggravated murder, the jury\u2019s unanimous verdict necessarily includes a finding that Davis was the principal offender. \u2022 See <em>State v. Woodard </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 70, 74-75, 623 N.E.2d 75, 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">Count Two of the indictment charged Davis with killing Perkins in the course of committing, attempting, or fleeing the commission or attempted commission of \u201cKidnapping <em>and/or </em>Aggravated Robbery <em>and/or </em>Rape.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Davis contends that the jury had to unanimously determine which felony had been committed, and should have been so instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Again, Davis did not request such an instruction, waiving this issue absent plain error. We find that the alleged error was not outcome-determinative. Although Count Two was worded disjunctively, both it and Count One carried a separate felony-murder specification for . each of the felonies alleged. The jury convicted Davis of each specification individually. The jury also separately convicted Davis of kidnapping (Count Three) and aggravated robbery (Count Four). Because the jury made a separate, unanimous finding of guilt as to each of the predicate felonies, there is no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Davis\u2019s fifth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\n<em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">In his seventh proposition of law, Davis maintains that three comments in the prosecutor\u2019s penalty-phase closing argument were improper. He argues that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s unsworn statement, an appeal to the jury\u2019s sense of outrage, and an argument on nonstatutory aggravating circumstances were all improper. However, the only comment to which Davis objected at trial was the prosecutor\u2019s reference that Amy Perkins \u201cdied a horrible death,\u201d was dumped onto the street \u201clike garbage * * * with no clothes on, for anybody to take a look at her,\u201d and had a large head wound that steamed in the cold air.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">While we find that most of the disputed statement was fair comment on the evidence and within the bounds of the prosecutor\u2019s wide latitude in closing argument, the reference to the steaming head wound is arguably improper because it tended to focus attention on the grotesque aspects of the crime. Cf. <em>Thompson, </em>33 Ohio St.3d at 14-15, 514 N.E.2d at 420; <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 407-408, 613 N.E.2d 203, 208. However, the prosecutor\u2019s improper comment was isolated and did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. Therefore, it does not constitute reversible error. See <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 220, 102 S.Ct. 940, 947, 71 L.Ed.2d 78, 88, fn. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">Because Davis failed to object at trial to the following comments, he waived any error unless he can demonstrate plain error. However, we need not invoke a plain error analysis, as neither of the complained of prosecutorial comments constituted misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">Davis first complains of the prosecutor\u2019s comment that Davis\u2019s unsworn statement \u201cwas not subject to cross-examination.\u201d Davis claims that such a comment is forbidden by <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 528 N.E.2d 542, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>DePew </em>holds that \u201cthe prosecutor may comment that the defendant\u2019s statement has not been made under oath * * *, but such comment must be limited to reminding the jury that the defendant\u2019s statement was not made under oath, in contrast to the testimony of all other witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. DePew </em>limits only prosecutorial comment on the lack of an oath. In contrast, prosecutorial comment on the lack of cross-examination is consistent with <em>DePew. </em>See <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 579, 605 N.E.2d 884, 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Davis additionally bases an allegation of misconduct on the prosecutor\u2019s comment that \u201c[t]he Judge is going to instruct you that you must consider the nature of the offense, the history, character, and background of the offender.\u201d Davis claims that the prosecutor could not discuss these issues, since the defense did not raise them in mitigation. <em>DePew, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">However, under R.C. 2929.04(B) the jury must consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the offender\u2019s history, character, and background, whether the defense raises these issues or not. Therefore, it is proper for a prosecutor to discuss them. <em>State v. Gumm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 416-423, 653 N.E.2d 253, 259-264. As such, we find that the prosecutor here did not try to mislead the jury into considering and weighing these factors as aggravating circumstances, see <em>id. </em>at 422, 653 N.E.2d at 263-264, and overrule Davis\u2019s seventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\n<em>Merger</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">In his fifteenth proposition of law, Davis contends that the trial court erred by failing to merge the two aggravated murder counts before submitting the question of penalty to the jury. However, pursuant to <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 5, 520 N.E.2d 568, 572, this is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">We conclude that the trial judge should have merged the two counts before finally sentencing Davis. See <em>State v. Huertas </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 22, 28, 553 N.E.2d 1058, 1066. Accordingly, we merge the two convictions so that a single death sentence remains. <em>State v. Hawkins </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 339, 346, 612 N.E.2d 1227, 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Because the error in sentencing was merely procedural and did not involve any substantial right, it constitutes harmless error. <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 317-318, 528 N.E.2d 523, 538-539. Accordingly, we merge Davis\u2019s aggravated murder convictions and overrule Davis\u2019s fifteenth proposition of law in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Sentencing Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In his fourteenth proposition, Davis contends that the trial court\u2019s sentencing analysis was flawed. However, errors in the sentencing opinion can be corrected by this court\u2019s independent reweighing of aggravation and mitigation. See, <em>e.g., State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 191-192, 631 N.E.2d 124, 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Davis argues that the opinion was factually inaccurate. The opinion states, \u201cOnce [Davis] had isolated his innocent victim, he moved with practiced precision.\u201d It continues with the statement that Davis \u201cmade Amy Perkins beg and plead for her life.\u201d While these statements are not supported by the record, this court\u2019s independent review can correct that problem by not relying on them. <em>Allen, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 643, 653 N.E.2d at 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Further, while we find that the opinion conveys a tone of moral outrage, the opinion\u2019s substance does not support Davis\u2019s inference that the trial court considered and weighed the nature and circumstances as a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance. Therefore, this proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Davis claims in his thirteenth proposition that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to preserve the claims presented in his fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">We find that Davis\u2019s counsel did not perform deficiently. The disputed propositions either did not constitute error or were harmless. Further, given the strong evidence of guilt and the inconsequential mitigation, we find that these alleged errors are not prejudicial under <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, because they do not undermine any confidence in the reliability of the result. There can be no claim \u201cthat the decision reached would reasonably likely have been different absent the [alleged] errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d at 699; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 143, 538 N.E.2d 373, 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">Davis\u2019s thirteenth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">Independent Sentence Assessment</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b251-16\">\n<em>Aggravating Circumstances v. Mitigating Factor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-17\">Having found that the evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that Davis committed the murder while committing or attempting to commit aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>robbery and kidnapping, we now turn to our independent assessment of whether the aggravating circumstances Davis was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factor adduced by Davis. We determine that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factor presented beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The defense essentially proffered no mitigating factors at all, except brief pleas for mercy by Davis, his wife, his sister, and his employer. Davis\u2019s entire unsworn statement was: \u201cI am a little nervous right now, but I respect you all and you all\u2019s decision, and I just beg you all, spare my life.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u201cI understand what the Perkins family is going through, but my family is going through it too. That\u2019s all I got to say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Davis\u2019s counsel expressly disclaimed reliance on the specific mitigating factors in R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) through (6) and relied solely on R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) \u2014 \u201cAny other factors that are relevant to * * * whether the offender should be sentenced to death.\u201d In very brief closing argument, counsel asked for mercy, emphasized the jury\u2019s \u201ctremendous\u201d responsibility, and asserted that \u201c[t]here must be something there worth saving\u201d because Davis\u2019s employer had testified for him in both phases of trial, whereas \u201c[m]ost employers would distance themselves * * * from someone charged with a crime.\u201d The defense was unable to produce anything more, despite an extensive investigation that included a thorough search for mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">While pleas for mercy made by Davis\u2019s wife, sister, and employer deserve some consideration, see <em>State v. Webb </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 325, 342-343, 638 N.E.2d 1023, 1038, the mercy pleas practically stand alone as mitigating evidence. There is little or no mitigation in the nature and circumstances of the offense. Further, the defense presented no evidence of Davis\u2019s history, his character, or background.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Davis was convicted of two valid death specifications: kidnapping and aggravated robbery. Because these outweigh the mitigating factor beyond a reasonable doubt, we find that the death sentence is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">\n<em>Proportionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">We also conclude that the penalty imposed is proportionate when compared with similar capital cases. This court has upheld death sentences in two cases involving kidnapping and aggravated robbery. See <em>State v. Roe </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 18, 28-29, 535 N.E.2d 1351, 1363, and <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 530-531, 605 N.E.2d 70, 85. Moreover, the court has often upheld death sentences where only one of these aggravating circumstances existed. See, <em>e.g., State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 513 N.E.2d 267, and <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 141, 652 N.E.2d 710 (kidnapping); <em>State v. Clark </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 252, 527 N.E.2d 844, <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 651 N.E.2d 965, <em>State v. Allen, supra </em>(aggravated robbery). Thus, the sentence is proportionate to those imposed in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals with respect to Davis\u2019s conviction of the attempted rape specifications and the merger of Davis\u2019s aggravated murder convictions and affirm its judgment and the sentence imposed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-10\">Moyer, C.J., F.E.

R.C. \u00a7 2929.022, \u00a7 2929.03 and \u00a7 2929.04 and Crim.R. 11(C)(3) place an unconstitutional burden on the accused\u2019s right to a jury trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and his rights to be free from compulsory self-incrimination under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">\u201cE. R.C. \u00a7 2929.03 fails to provide a meaningful basis for distinguishing between life and death sentences, as it does not explicitly require the jury, when it recommends life imprisonment, to specify the mitigating factors found, or to identify its reasons for such sentence.
