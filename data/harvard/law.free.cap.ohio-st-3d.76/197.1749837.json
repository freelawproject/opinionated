For the reasons to follow, we find that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The commission is exclusively responsible for judging evidentiary weight and credibility. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. Claimant\u2019s contention that McCloud\u2019s report is nonprobative simply because it predates the claimed disability period lacks merit. Certainly, the probative value of a medical report may be lessened by later changes in the claimant\u2019s condition, and the longer the time between the report and the disability alleged, the more likely this is to have occurred. Claimant, however, has failed to show that McCloud\u2019s report was no longer probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In this case, it must be remembered that claimant first claimed permanent total disability compensation on December 1, 1989. Permanent total disability compensation was denied on April 18, 1990 and claimant reapplied less than two months later. Because of the extremely short time between denial and reapplication, it is reasonable to say that claimant has been alleging permanent total disability consistently since December 1, 1989. In other words, the condition alleged in 1990 was no different from that alleged in 1989, and McCloud\u2019s report preceded claimant\u2019s original application for permanent total disability compensation by only eleven days. Claimant .cannot, therefore, sustain her claim of staleness.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Equally important, the court of appeals never reconciled its conclusion that Baroff demonstrated a significant physical worsening with the fact that Baroffs impairment figure was only half of what McCloud had observed the previous year. This suggests improvement, not decline. Comparison of other medical evidence reinforces this conclusion. The 1989 and 1990 reports of Dr. DiDomenico \u2014 claimant\u2019s own doctor \u2014 are almost identical. This again negates the suggestion that claimant\u2019s condition had appreciably worsened over the relevant time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The court of appeals found that Dr. Baroffs later report rendered Dr. McCloud\u2019s report no longer probative because Baroffs narrative listed \u201cseveral relevant\u201d findings that had arisen since McCloud\u2019s examination. We disagree. Baroffs reference to \u201cdiffuse osteopenia\u201d and \u201cdegenerative joint disease\u201d is irrelevant, since the claim is allowed only for a simple strain/sprain. Moreover, when the two reports are closely compared, they are actually very similar. Identical findings include: (1) normal gait; (2) absence of radiating pain; (3) uniform deep tendon reflexes; (4) no muscle spasm; (5) limited flexion; (6) normal leg strength; and (7) negative radicular testing. The only significant differences between the two are Dr. Baroffs findings of <em>mild </em>sacroiliac tenderness and <em>mild </em>sciatic notch tenderness. These discrepancies do not support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>appellate court\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s condition worsened so dramatically between the time of the Baroff and McCloud exams as to make the latter\u2019s report nonprobative.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Having found that Dr. McCloud\u2019s report is \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s order, we turn finally to the question of <em>Noll </em>compliance. In this case, the order\u2019s explanation, although brief, adequately sets forth the reasoning underlying the commission\u2019s decision. It indicates that, based on the medical and other evidence, claimant\u2019s physical restrictions were so insignificant as to allow for reemployment despite an age and work history that are not necessarily conducive to retraining. <em>Noll </em>has accordingly been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b333-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Cook and Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b333-9\">Douglas, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b333-10\">F.E.
