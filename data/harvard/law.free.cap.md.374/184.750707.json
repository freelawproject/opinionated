More than five years after the original judgments had been entered, the Circuit Court for Carroll County, purportedly acting pursuant to timely filed Maryland Rule 4-345(b) motions, altered the charges in the indictment counts to which the defendant had pled guilty, and for which he had been legally sentenced, to other crimes which the State had initially charged in other counts, but which the State had nolle prossed at the time of sentencing. The court then modified the sentences to probation before judgment, a statutorily prohibited disposition of the charges to which the defendant had pled guilty. We shall reverse for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In 1996 a Carroll County grand jury returned multi-count indictments against the respondent, David Crary Griswold (Griswold), charging that he had committed sexual offenses more than ten years before with children under the age of fourteen. At the time of the earliest of the offenses Griswold was in his thirties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, in case K-1996-23295, Gris-wold was charged with four counts involving a male victim who was then approximately six years old. Count I alleged a violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 464B, providing in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201c \u00a7 464B. Third degree sexual offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">\u201c(a) <em>Elements of offense. </em>\u2014 A person is guilty of a sexual offense in the third degree if the person engages in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">\u201c(3) Sexual contact with another person who is under 14 years of age and the person performing the sexual contact is four or more years older than the victim[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Count II in indictment 23295 charged a violation of Article 27, \u00a7 464C, which in relevant part read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\u201c \u00a7 464C. Fourth degree sexual offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\u201c(a) <em>Elements of the offense. </em>\u2014 A person is guilty of a sexual offense in the fourth degree if the person engages:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A08\">\u201c(1) In sexual contact with another person against the will and without the consent of the other person[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The remaining counts in No. 23295 charged common law battery and child abuse in violation of Article 27, \u00a7 35C.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The second case with which we are concerned on this appeal is K-1996-23296. The victim was Griswold\u2019s niece, who was born in 1980. The criminal acts were alleged to have occurred between 1987 and 1994. Counts I and II in that indictment charged third degree sexual offense in violation \u00a7 464B(a)(3), and Counts III and IV charged fourth degree sexual offense in violation of \u00a7 464C. The remaining counts in No. 23296 charged sexual child abuse of a family member, common law battery, and indecent exposure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">On January 17, 1997, Griswold pled guilty to the first counts, charging third degree sexual offense, in the two indictments involved in this appeal, and the State nolle prossed all of the other counts of both indictments. That day, the court sentenced Griswold on each of the two counts of third degree sexual offense to five years, to be served concurrently. The circuit court suspended the execution of the sentence and released Griswold on probation, under a number of conditions. These included home confinement between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m. for a period of 180 days, that he continue counseling with his physician, that he have no contact with the male victim, and that there be no unsupervised contact with any children under eighteen years of age. These sentences were not illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Within ninety days of the imposition of these sentences Griswold filed identical motions in each case, headed, \u201cMotion for Modification or Reduction of Sentence.\u201d He moved \u201cpursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(b) for a modification and/or reduction of sentence imposed in the above case.\u201d The motions simply described the sentences imposed and asked the court to \u201cconsider revising its judgment and sentence in the above-captioned case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Maryland Rule 4-345, \u201cSentencing-Revisory power of court,\u201d provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201c(b) Modification or reduction \u2014 Time for. The court has revisory power and control over a sentence upon \u00e1 motion filed within 90 days after its imposition ... in a circuit court, whether or not an appeal has been filed. Thereafter, the court has revisory power and control over the sentence in case of fraud, mistake or irregularity!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201c(d) Open court hearing. The court may modify, reduce, correct, or vacate a sentence only on the record in open court, after hearing from the defendant, the State, and from each victim or victim\u2019s representative who requests an opportunity to be heard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The State responded to the motions, asserting that the sentence was \u201cfair, reasonable and within the statute,\u201d that there was no \u201cunconscionable burden\u201d on Griswold, and that \u201cnothing has occurred since the time of sentencing to warrant a reduction in the sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">By longhand notations on the margins of the motions, the court directed that they be held <em>sub curia, </em>awaiting the decision of counsel as to when a hearing would be requested. A hearing was requested in late December 1998, but canceled the following month. In September 2001 Griswold again requested a hearing on the pending motions. At that hearing, held January 10, 2002, Griswold asked for probation before judgment (P.B.J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>When Griswold was originally sentenced, Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol), Article 27, \u00a7 641, dealing with P.B.J., contained a limitation on that type of disposition that is relevant here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That limitation, found in \u00a7 641(a)(4), read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM0\">\u201cNotwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, a court may not stay the entering of judgment and place a person on probation for a violation of any of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 462 through 464B of this article for an offense involving a person under the age of 16 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">At the time of the revision of the judgments to P.B.J. in the instant matter, the limitation was found in Maryland Code (2001), \u00a7 6-220(d)(3) of the Criminal Procedure Article (CP), reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">\u201cNotwithstanding subsections (b) and (c) of this section, a court may not stay the entering of judgment and place a defendant on probation for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201c(3) a violation of any of the provisions of Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 462 through 464B of the Code for a crime involving a person under the age of 16 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">At the January 10, 2002 hearing on the motion Griswold\u2019s counsel, in part, argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">\u201cI would ask you to consider modifying this to a P.B.J. I think we had two Third Degree Sex Offenses, which typically cannot be modified....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">\u201cI would ask you to consider modifying the Third Degree Convictions to Fourth so they could then be P.B.J.... I\u2019m asking this on behalf of his mother. I ask that she not have to live with the conviction that\u2019s on his record. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need for him to be reporting as a sex offender on an annual basis or to be on any list.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The State expressly opposed the requested modifications with respect to cases 23295 and 23296 on the ground that \u201c[a] P.B.J. cannot be given as they are Third Degree Sex Offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">After taking the matter under advisement, the circuit court, on March 6, 2002, caused the docket to reflect the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlM\">\u201cORDERED, that Defendant\u2019s convictions in K-96-23295 and K-96-23296 of Art. 27, \u00a7 464B, Third Degree Sexual Offense be, and they hereby are, modified to Art. 27, \u00a7 464C, Fourth Degree Sexual Offense; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXV\">\u201cORDERED, that Defendant\u2019s convictions in ... K-96-23295 and K-96-23296, Art. 27, \u00a7 464C, Fourth Degree Sexual Offense be, and they hereby are, modified to Probation Before Judgment, pursuant to Md. Criminal Procedure Code Ann. \u00a7 6-220 (2001).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The State timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court issued the writ of certiorari on its own motion prior to consideration of the matter by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">A single question is presented by the State, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">\u201cWhere Griswold was convicted and sentenced on two third degree sexual offense convictions, did the circuit court err when it later changed the convictions to fourth degree sexual offenses in order to modify Griswold\u2019s sentence to probation before judgment?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">In answer to that question the State submits that the circuit court violated CP \u00a7 6 \u2014 220(d)(3) when it modified the sentences for third degree sexual offense to P.B.J. In opposition, Gris-wold\u2019s principal submission is that P.B.J. was imposed for convictions of fourth degree sexual offenses, dispositions which were not prohibited by statute. The result, he contends, is that the State has no right of appeal and that the appropriate mandate is to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">A limited right of appeal by the State is conferred by Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-302(c) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ). Pertinent here is subsection (2) which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201c(c) In a criminal case, the State may appeal as provided in this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201c(2) The State may appeal from a final judgment if the State alleges that the trial judge failed to impose the sentence specifically mandated by the Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Resolution of the principal issue between the parties ultimately turns on the appropriate analysis for applying CJ \u00a7 12-302(c)(2). Under the State\u2019s analysis, we are to compare the original charging document to the modified sentence. At the initial sentencing Griswold pled guilty to third degree sexual offenses and the sentences imposed were not prohibited by the predecessor of CP \u00a7 6-220(d)(3). In the State\u2019s view, the circuit court changed those judgments of conviction by modifying the sentence element thereof to a statutorily prohibited sentence while, throughout, the determination of guilt remained, in legal effect, the commission of third degree sexual offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">On the other hand, Griswold\u2019s position looks at the proceedings below as consisting of distinct steps. First, per the timely filed Rule 4-345 motions, there was a modification from third degree to fourth degree sexual offenses of the guilt determination element of the judgments. Then there was a modification of the sentences to sentences that are lawful for fourth degree sexual offenses. Consequently, argues Gris-wold, there being no sentence specifically mandated by the Code for fourth degree sexual offenses, there is no right of appeal by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The State presents the proper analysis, as demonstrated by our decision in <em>State v. Hannah, 307 Md. 390, 514 </em>A.2d 16 (1986). There the defendant pled guilty to common law robbery and to the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol, 1985 Cum. Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 36B, mandated a minimum five year sentence for the handgun violation. At sentencing, the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>court struck the plea of guilty to the handgun offense and entered P.B.J. On the robbery count Hanna was sentenced to ten years, all but two suspended, followed by five years probation. On the State\u2019s appeal of the disposition of the handgun charge, this Court reversed and remanded for imposition of the statutorily mandated minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In this Court, Hanna challenged the State\u2019s right to appeal under CJ \u00a7 12-302(c)(2). He contended that, by first striking the plea of guilty to the handgun charge and then imposing P.B.J., the circuit court had not entered a final judgment on the handgun count, thereby rendering CJ \u00a7 12-302(c)(2) inapplicable. As part of that argument Hanna sought to distinguish <em>State ex rel. Sonner v. Shearin, </em>272 Md. 502, 325 A.2d 573 (1974), and <em>State v. Wooten, </em>277 Md. 114, 352 A.2d 829 (1976), as cases in which sentences had been imposed and then execution of the sentences suspended. Rejecting that argument we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">\u201cThis Court recognized the State\u2019s appeals in <em>Sonnet </em>and in <em>Wooten </em>to have been taken from appealable orders not because those orders suspended sentences which had earlier been imposed, if only by an instant, but because, by virtue of some other provision of law, the orders allegedly were beyond the authority of the sentencing courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\"><em>Hannah, </em>307 Md. at 400, 514 A.2d at 21. We then held that P.B.J. is a \u201cfinal\u201d judgment within the meaning of CJ \u00a7 12-203(c)(2). Thus, in <em>Hannah, </em>we looked through the striking of the guilty plea to the offense charged to determine whether a Code mandated sentence had been imposed. Here, the appropriate analysis looks through the purported modification by the circuit court of the first counts in the indictments and looks to the charges brought by the State to which Griswold pled guilty. P.B.J. is not a permitted disposition of the grand jury\u2019s charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\"><em>Shilling v. State, </em>320 Md. 288, 577 A.2d 83 (1990), involved a subsection of the P.B.J. statute which is a companion to the prohibition against P.B.J. involved in the instant matter. Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.), Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>27, \u00a7 641(a)(2), now CP \u00a7 6-220(d)(1), prohibited P.B.J. for a second or subsequent violation of the driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence prohibitions of Maryland Code (1977, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 21-902(a) of the Transportation Article. There, in describing the operation of CJ \u00a7 12-302(c)(2), Judge Cole, writing for the Court, said that the statute \u201cconfers a right of appeal on the State under circumstances where the State alleges that the trial court failed to impose a sentence specifically mandated by the statute <em>under which the defendant is </em>charged.\u201d <em>Shilling, </em>320 Md. at 294, 577 A.2d at 86 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The instant matter presents an even more compelling case for appealability under CJ \u00a7 12-302(b)(2) than was presented in <em>Hannah. </em>In <em>Hannah, </em>no final judgment had been entered when the guilty plea was stricken, so that the court retained broad discretionary power to strike that plea. Here, the circuit court, in its first step, undertook to modify that portion of the judgment of conviction \u201cdefining a defendant\u2019s culpability.\u201d <em>Shilling, </em>320 Md. at 293, 577 A.2d at 85. Griswold argues that the authority for that alteration is Rule 4-345(b). That rule, however, limits the circuit court\u2019s revisory power to a \u201csentence.\u201d In <em>Webster v. State, </em>359 Md. 465, 754 A.2d 1004 (2000), we said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201c[t]he meaning of \u2018sentence\u2019 in the criminal context is clear \u2014 it refers to the act of the court in pronouncing sentence, announcing the sanction that is being imposed on the defendant. It is that part of the final judgment that postdates the rendition of a verdict of guilty. But a trial court may modify a sentence. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-345(b)[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 482, 754 A.2d at 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">A more fundamental defect in Griswold\u2019s position is that the circuit court had no authority to alter the charging document over the objection of the State\u2019s Attorney. The first counts of the indictments, to which Griswold pled guilty, charged third degree sexual offense, but the circuit court, years later, undertook to alter those charges to fourth degree sexual offenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>which had been charged in later counts in the indictments. The State\u2019s Attorney had disposed of the fourth degree sexual offenses by nolle prosequi. Maryland Rule 4-247(a) provides, in relevant part, that \u201cthe State\u2019s Attorney may terminate a prosecution on a charge and dismiss the charge by entering a nolle prosequi on the record in open court.\u201d This Court views as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">\u201cwell settled that \u2018the entry of a nolle prosequi is generally within the sole discretion of the prosecuting attorney, free from judicial control and not dependent upon the defendant\u2019s consent,\u2019 <em>Ward v. State, </em>290 Md. 76, 83, 427 A.2d 1008, 1012 (1981); <em>see also In re Darren M., </em>358 Md. 104, 112, 747 A.2d 612, 616 (2000) ... and that it \u2018may be entered as to an entire charging document, or one or more counts, or even a part of a count.\u2019 <em>Ward, </em>290 Md. at 83, 427 A.2d at 1012.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\"><em>State v. Martin, </em>367 Md. 53, 55, 785 A.2d 1270, 1271 (2001). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">\u201ca nolle prosequi discharges the defendant on the charging document or count which was nolle prossed, and ... it is a bar to any further prosecution under <em>that </em>charging document or count.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\"><em>Ward v. State, </em>290 Md. at 84, 427 A.2d at 1012-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Nor can we view the circuit court\u2019s alteration of the first counts in the indictments as an amendment, because it was made after verdict and the \u201camendment\u201d changed \u201cthe character of the offense charged.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-204.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The changes to fourth degree sexual offense eliminated the element that the victims were under fourteen years of age while Griswold was more than four years older than those victims. Even if the amendment had been attempted before the guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>plea was entered, that substantial a change could not be made without the consent of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">This is not a case like <em>Chertkov v. State, </em>335 Md. 161, 642 A.2d 232 (1994), where the State argued the illegality of the modified sentence based on the violation of a Maryland Rule of Procedure. In <em>Chertkov </em>the defendant pled guilty to misdemeanor medicaid fraud and conspiracy to commit felony medicaid fraud. The plea was entered pursuant to a plea agreement, approved by the court pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-243(c), under which the defendant was sentenced to three years incarceration, all but 179 days suspended, followed by five years probation and 1500 hours of community service. <em>Id. </em>at 164, 642 A.2d at 233. Pursuant to a timely filed motion under Maryland Rule 4-345, the defendant sought revision of the sentence after service of the unsuspended portion thereof. Over the State\u2019s objection, the circuit court entered P.B.J. The State noted an appeal, contending that the sentence was illegal because the court\u2019s action violated Rule 4-243, governing plea bargains. Although we agreed with the State that the modification of the sentence violated the court\u2019s obligations under the plea bargain rule, the appeal was dismissed. This was because, when CJ \u00a7 12-302(c)(2) \u201creferred to a failure to impose the sentence specifically mandated by the Code, it was not referring to the Maryland Rules or anything else other than the statutory law of this State.\u201d <em>Chertkov, </em>335 Md. at 169, 642 A.2d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Similar to <em>Chertkov </em>is <em>Cardinell v. State, </em>335 Md. 381, 644 A.2d 11 (1994). The defendant had been found guilty of drug offenses and lawfully sentenced. After the circuit court had denied a timely filed Rule 4-345 motion to revise the sentence, the defendant filed a second Rule 4-345 motion, well beyond the time limit of ninety days from imposition of sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 385, 644 A.2d at 13. Based on that motion the circuit court revised the sentence, and the State appealed under CJ \u00a7 12-302(c)(2), alleging noncompliance with the time limits in Rule 4-345 as the illegality in the modified sentence. Although <em>Cardinell </em>was later overruled on other grounds by <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 785 A.2d 1275 (2001), this Court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>unanimous in concluding that \u00a7 3 2 \u2014 302(c)(2) did not authorize the State\u2019s appeal. <em>Cardinell, </em>335 Md. at 387, 644 A.2d at 14. See <em>also State v. Green, </em>367 Md. at 84-85, 785 A.2d at 1288-89 (Wilner, J., concurring); <em>State v. Warfield, </em>148 Md.App. 178, 181, 811 A.2d 382, 384 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Neither <em>Chertkov </em>nor <em>Cardinell </em>involved crimes for which the Code mandated or prohibited a specific sentencing disposition. In those cases the State sought to substitute a rule violation for a statutory mandate or prohibition applicable to the crime of which the defendant was guilty. Comparison of the sentence that had been imposed to the rule violation did not satisfy CJ \u00a7 12-302(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We will not extend the holdings of <em>Chertkov </em>and of <em>Cardinell </em>to preclude the State\u2019s reliance on violations of the Maryland Rules of Procedure in order to demonstrate that the portion of the judgment of conviction determining criminal culpability has been altered, in violation of the Rules, to a crime which is different from that on which a mandatory sentence was originally imposed and which carries no sentence specifically mandated by the Code. The obvious purpose of CJ \u00a7 12-802(c)(2)\u2019s conferral of a right of appeal on the State from the imposition of sentences contrary to a specific mandate of the Code is to insure that the courts carry out the legislative policy embodied in statutes mandating or prohibiting certain sentences for certain crimes. The purpose of those statutes, including CP \u00a7 6 \u2014 220(d)(3), easily could be thwarted if circuit courts could, in violation of the Rules of Procedure, amend charging documents over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, resurrect nolle prossed counts, substantially change offenses from those on which the determination of guilt was predicated, and, by those means, produce a judgment of conviction for a crime for which the Code does not mandate any sentencing requirement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Consequently, the State\u2019s appeal lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Griswold also makes some ancillary arguments which will not long detain us. First, he suggests that there is no violation of CP \u00a7 6 \u2014 220(d)(3) because a lawful sentence was originally imposed, and the modified sentence was based upon an offense for which Griswold originally could have been found guilty. In <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. at 83, 785 A.2d at 1288, we rejected \u201cthe petitioner\u2019s alternate argument that because the Circuit Court originally sentenced him as [the statute there involved] requires, the court did not fail to impose the sentence specifically mandated by the Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Griswold also cites <em>Madison v. State, </em>205 Md. 425, 431, 109 A.2d 96, 99 (1954), for the proposition that all judgments are under the control of the court during the term in which they are entered. We note that, under Maryland Rule 16-107.a, terms of the circuit courts now exist only for \u201caccounting and statistical reporting purposes.\u201d In any event, Gris-wold does not demonstrate that the revision of the judgment of conviction in 2002 took place in the same term of court as the imposition of the lawful sentence in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">For the foregoing reasons we enter the following mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR REINSTATEMENT OF THE JUDGMENTS OF CONVICTION IN K-1996-2S295 AND IN K-1996-23296.
