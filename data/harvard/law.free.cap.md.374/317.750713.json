Consequently, we shall not reach the issue of whether \u00a7 8-107 of the Real Property Article applies to leases other than those for long term ground rents. In addition, we shall not reach an alternative argument by the petitioner concerning the timeliness of Shafer\u2019s counterclaim for a declaratory judgment in light of Maryland Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-103 of the Estates and Trusts Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In July 1942, Walter and Beulah Deibert purchased a 121 acre farm on the Downsville Pike in Washington County, Maryland. The farm was the site of the family home until 1957 when the Deiberts purchased another lot across the street and built a new home. Charles Shafer, who married the Deibert\u2019s daughter, Jeanette, in 1944, testified that Walter Deibert asked him to move to the Deibert farm in the spring of 1968, to help Deibert farm the land. At that time, the Shafers had been living with his parents. Charles and Jeanette Shafer moved to the Deibert farm in March 1968, and Shafer continued to reside at the farm after Jeanette Shafer\u2019s death in May 1998. During this time, relations between the Shafers and the Deiberts were cordial; they were \u201cfamily for fifty-seven years,\u201d according to Shafer. He also testified that the Deiberts were at the farm every day during \u201cworking time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>While the Shafers occupied the farm, the arrangement was informal, and never reduced to writing. Shafer testified that Walter Deibert had asked the Shafers to pay the Deiberts $125 per month, purportedly to help pay for taxes and insurance on the property. In fact, the Shafers made no such regular payment. From the time they moved in to the date of Mrs. Deibert\u2019s death in November 1998, Shafer had paid the Deiberts a total of $750.00 by two checks, the first dated May 29, 1968, and the second dated October 1, 1970. Shafer admitted in his testimony that there was no indication at the time of payment that the checks were for rent. Throughout the period of Shafer\u2019s occupancy, the Deiberts paid the property taxes on the farm. Shafer testified that he paid insurance on only the four buildings he considered his own, a hog-pen, a cattle feeding station and two machine sheds that he had constructed on the property. The Deiberts continued to pay insurance for all other buildings on the property and the farmland.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The Deiberts assisted the Shafers financially several times over the years. In 1967, the Deiberts co-signed two bank loans for Shafer. In 1984, the Deiberts loaned $1,300 to the Shafers. There is no indication in the record whether this loan was repaid. In June 1993 the Deiberts gave the Shafers $ 9,357.39, with the understanding that Jeanette Shafer\u2019s share of her parents\u2019 estate would be reduced by the corresponding amount.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shafer declared bankruptcy in 1996, and he did not list the Deiberts as creditors or the farm as an asset in the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Walter Deibert died on June 5, 1990, and Beulah Deibert died on November 18, 1998. In a 1979 will, Mrs. Deibert included a provision allowing her to make advancements to her children. In March 1991, Mrs. Deibert executed a \u201cMemorandum of Advancement,\u201d in accordance with the 1979 will, with the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u201cSince my daughter Jeannette and her husband have been living rent-free on my farm, the rent she otherwise would have paid is to be deemed an advancement.... The amount to be deducted ... is $125 times the number of months she lives on the farm from March 1, 1979<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> until the date of my death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">On October 3,1997, Mrs. Deibert executed a new will, in which she bequeathed the residue of her estate to her daughters \u201cin equal shares.\u201d This will contained a paragraph with respect to the share of Jeanette Shafer, which provided for the following adjustments in calculating her share of the estate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqx\">\u201cIn June 1993 I gave to my daughter Jeannette Shafer the sum of Nine Thousand Three-Hundred Fifty-Seven and Thirty-Nine Hundredths ($9,357.39) Dollars. Further, my daughter Jeannette Shafer and her husband have been living rent-free at my farm since March 1, 1969. I direct that the aforesaid cash gift be treated as an advancement to my daughter. I also direct that a sum calculated at the rate of One-Hundred Twenty-Five ($125.00) Dollars per month commencing March 1, 1969 for each month that my daughter Jeannette Shafer and/or her husband reside at my farm until my death be treated as an advancement to my daughter, Jeannette Shafer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Mrs. Deibert designated two of her daughters, Catherine Delauter and Doris James, as her personal representatives in this will.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">At the time of her death, Mrs. Deibert was residing in an assisted living facility. Prior to her death, Catherine Delauter and Doris James, in their capacity as Mrs. Deibert\u2019s attorneys in fact, had tried to get Shafer to vacate the farm so that they would be able \u201cto ground rent the farm to [obtain] some more money to pay for [Mrs. Deibert\u2019s living] expenses.\u201d They had sent Shafer a notice to quit dated August 20, 1998, asking that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>he vacate the premises by March 1, 1999. On August 25, 1998, Delauter and James, in their capacity as attorneys in fact for Mrs. Deibert, entered into a contract of sale for the farm in the amount of $587,000. When Mrs. Deibert died in November, Shafer claimed that he was on an \u201cagricultural tenancy\u201d and that the notice was too short for him to get his crops out. The Estate\u2019s attorney sent a revised notice to quit, extending the date to April 1, 1999. Shafer continued to occupy the farm after April 1,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The Estate then instituted in the District Court of Maryland an ejectment action against Shafer pursuant to \u00a7 8-402 of the Real Property Article, so as to make it possible for the Estate to sell the property and complete the distribution under Mrs. Deibert\u2019s will. The action was subsequently transferred to the Circuit Court for Washington County when Shafer requested a jury trial. Shafer filed a counterclaim on May 17, 1999, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Estate\u2019s interest in the property had been terminated by the operation of \u00a7 8-107 of the Real Property Article because no rent had been demanded or paid for over twenty years. The Estate filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaim, arguing that it was filed more than six months after the date of Mrs. Deibert\u2019s death and was, therefore, untimely under \u00a7 8-103 of the Estates and Trusts Article. The Circuit Court denied the Estate\u2019s motion to dismiss. Following a trial on the merits, the court submitted the question of the existence of a lease to the jury. The jury returned a special verdict in favor of Shafer, finding that a lease existed and that no rent had been paid or demanded for more than twenty years. The court then entered a declaratory judgment determining that Shafer had title to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The Estate filed a notice of appeal and, prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari. The petitioners argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the arrangement between the Deiberts and Shafer created a \u201cpermissive use\u201d between family members and not a lease, that even if a lease existed, \u00a7 8-107 of the Real Property Article was intended to apply only to ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>rents, and that Shafer\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d was not timely filed under \u00a7 8-103 of the Estates and Trusts Article. This Court granted the certiorari petition, <em>DeLauter v. Shafer, </em>361 Md. 231, 760 A.2d 1106 (2000), and we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court. As previously indicated, we hold that there was no lease between the Dieberts and Shafer. Accordingly, we need not and do not reach the other issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">It has long been the law in Maryland that, where the relevant facts are undisputed, \u201cthe question whether the relation of landlord and tenant existed between the parties ... [is] a question of law to be determined by the Court upon the consideration of the facts,\u201d <em>Howard v. Carpenter, </em>22 Md. 10, 23 (1864). In the <em>Howard </em>case, this Court reversed a judgment based on a jury\u2019s determination that a lease existed; our predecessors held that, on the undisputed facts, the alleged lessee\u2019s \u201cpossession was permissive\u201d and that no lease existed. <em>Id. </em>at 25. And in <em>Baltimore v. Baltimore Steam Packet Co., </em>164 Md. 284, 164 A. 878 (1933), this Court reversed a trial court determination that a particular arrangement created a mere license, and held that a lease had been established. <em>See, </em>in addition, <em>Hayes v. Covington, </em>183 Md. 506, 510, 39 A.2d 475, 477 (1944); <em>Tizer v. Tizer, </em>162 Md. 489, 494-496, 160 A. 163, 165 (1932); <em>Emrich v. Union Stock-Yard Co., </em>86 Md. 482, 485, 38 A. 943, 944 (1897); <em>Allen v. Lambden, </em>2 Md. 279, 282-283 (1852); <em>Nicholson Air v. Allegany County, </em>120 Md.App. 47, 63, 706 A.2d 124, 132 (1998). <em>See also, e.g., Progressive Friendship Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Rose, </em>235 Md. 169, 174, 201 A.2d 8, 11 (1964) (\u201cSince a lease is a form of contract its creation ... [is] subject to the general rules governing the creation ... of contracts in general\u201d); <em>Kikas v. Baltimore County, </em>200 Md. 360, 364-366, 89 A.2d 625, 626-628 (1952); <em>Cook v. Boehl, </em>188 Md. 581, 590-591, 53 A.2d 555, 560 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">\u201cWhether the contract is a lease or a license depends upon the intention of the parties,\u201d <em>Norman v. Century Athletic Club, </em>193 Md. 584, 594, 69 A.2d 466, 470 (1949). As with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>other contracts, however, the intention of the parties is determined by an \u201cobjective interpretation\u201d of the writings and surrounding circumstances. <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 435-436, 727 A.2d 358, 363 (1999). We examine \u201cwhat a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought [the arrangement] meant.\u201d <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 436, 727 A.2d at 363, quoting <em>General Motors Acceptance v. Daniels, </em>303 Md. 254, 261, 492 A.2d 1306, 1310 (1985). \u201cMaryland courts should examine the character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of execution.\u201d <em>Pacific Indemnity v. Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>302 Md. 383, 388, 488 A.2d 486, 488 (1985), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Professor Tiffany summarized the distinction between a license and lease as follows (1 Tiffany, <em>The Law of Real Property </em>\u00a7 79, at 117-118 (3d ed.1939), footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">\u201c \u00a7 79. License and lease distinguished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">A tenancy involves an interest in the land passed to the tenant and a possession exclusive even of the landlord except as the lease permits his entry, and saving always the landlord\u2019s right to enter to demand rent or to make repairs. A mere permission to use land, dominion over it remaining in the owner and no interest in or exclusive possession of it being given, is but a license. That one who is tenant under a lease has the possession of the land serves to distinguish him from a licensee, that is, a person to whom is given merely permission to use the land for a specified purpose. Such a person has not the possession of the land, this remaining in the licensor, and he has not, it seems, any interest in the land which he can assert as against a third person, that is, he has no rights in rem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">\u201cThe question whether an instrument is a lease, creating an estate in favor of another and the consequent relation of tenancy, or is merely a license, is one properly of the construction of the language used, as showing an intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>to give possession vel non. That this is so has been quite often recognized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In an earlier treatise, Tiffany pointed out that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u201cif the language used purports to give another the right to use the land only for a specific purpose, and there is nothing to show an intention to give the right of possession, a tenancy cannot be regarded as arising.\u201d 1 Tiffany, <em>Landlord and Tenant </em>\u00a7 7, at 25 (1910).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-7\"><em>See also Miller v. State, </em>174 Md. 362, 368, 198 A. 710, 714 (1938) (\u201cDuring the term of the tenancy, unless permitted by the terms of the lease, a landlord has no more right to enter premises possessed by the tenant than a stranger would have\u201d); <em>Kessler v. Equity Management, Inc., </em>82 Md.App. 577, 586, 572 A.2d 1144, 1149 (1990) (\u201cIt is an elementary principle of real property law that a tenant has a right of possession of demised premises to the exclusion of the landlord\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Other important factors indicating that the use of premises was under a license and not a lease are whether any facts \u201cshow[ ] that [the alleged tenant] was recognized as tenant by the\u201d owner and whether \u201crent was paid,\u201d <em>Howard v. Carpenter, supra, </em>22 Md. at 25. <em>See University Plaza v. Garcia, </em>279 Md. 61, 66, 367 A.2d 957, 960 (1977) (\u201c[I]n this State rent is ... payment for the tenant\u2019s use, possession and enjoyment of the land\u201d); <em>Worthington v. Cooke, </em>56 Md. 51 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Turning to the case at bar, it is clear that no lease existed between the Deiberts and Charles Shafer. Shafer never had exclusive possession of the farm, and his own testimony was that the Deiberts were at the farm every day during \u201cworking time.\u201d The testimony concerning the $125 per month payments, which were never regularly made, was that they were to help pay taxes and insurance. They were not designated as \u201crent.\u201d Moreover, the only writings concerning rent, namely Mrs. Deibert\u2019s 1991 memorandum and her 1997 will, stated that the Shafers were living at the farm rent free. There was never a demand for rent. No writings characterized this family relationship as one of landlord-ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ant. Shafer did not list the Deiberts as creditors in his bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Section 8-107 of the Real Property Article, upon which Shafer\u2019s case is based, applies when there is \u201cspecific rent reserved out of particular property\u201d under a lease, and there is no demand or payment of the \u201cspecific rent\u201d for 20 consecutive years. It would be anomalous to apply this statute in a case where no rent at all was provided for, and where parents simply furnished a place to live for their child and her spouse. In sum, the undisputed facts show that Charles Shafer simply had a license to live on the Dieberts\u2019 farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR THE ENTRY OF A JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

Maryland Code (1974, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), \u00a7 l-101(h) of the Real Property Article, provides that \" \u2018Lease\u2019 means any oral or written agreement, express or implied, creating a landlord and tenant relationship, including any \u2018sublease\u2019 and any further sublease.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-11\">. Section 8-107 of the Real Property Article states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">\"If there is no demand or payment for more than 20 consecutive years of any specific rent reserved out of a particular property or any part of a particular property under any form of lease, the rent conclusively is presumed to be extinguished and the landlord may not set up any claim for the rent or to the reversion in the property out of which it issued. The landlord also may not institute any suit, action, or proceeding to recover the rent or the property. However, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>landlord is under any legal disability when the period of 20 years of nondemand or nonpayment expires, he has two years after the removal of the disability within which to assert his rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\">.
