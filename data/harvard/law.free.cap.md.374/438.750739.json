Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Respondent was admitted as a member of the Bar of this Court on June 23, 1998, and maintains an office for the practice of law in Glen Burnie, Maryland. The Petition for Disciplinary Action in this case was based upon the complaint of Phyllis J. Klingenberg, BC Docket No. 2002-104-2-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Judge North\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">\u201cFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">\u201cThis Court having considered all testimony admitted, all documentary evidence admitted, and arguments of counsel, makes the following written statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">\u201cPhyllis Klingenberg (Klingenberg) was in danger of losing her home by foreclosure because she was five months delinquent on her mortgage as of August 2001. Klingenberg, a cashier at Giant Food for thirteen years, received in the mail a letter from Thomas Granger (Respondent) dated August 6, 2001, informing her of certain rights and obligations concerning the impending foreclosure, and of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>availability of Respondent to provide legal services to \u2018stop the sale, and put a \u201cfence\u201d around [her] home.\u2019 After receiving the letter, Klingenberg called Respondent on August 11, 2001, to make an appointment to discuss saving her home. She spoke directly to Respondent, who told her the costs for filing a petition for bankruptcy, the documents that were needed, and the cost for his representation. Klingenberg told Respondent she did not have much money. She asked about a payment plan and if he would accept $200 to get started on her case. Respondent agreed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">\u201cOn August 12, 2001 at 3:00 p.m. Klingenberg and her adult son came from Belair, Maryland to Respondent\u2019s office in Glen Burnie for their initial appointment. They stayed until about 7:00 p.m. According to [complainant] and her son, no one else was at Respondent\u2019s office until fifteen minutes before their departure when Respondent\u2019s administrative assistant, Martha Tsitsiwu (Martha), arrived. According to Martha, she received a phone call from Respondent at 1:00 p.m. on August 12, 2001 asking her to come in. She arrived at 1:45 p.m. She testified she was in the office prior to the arrival of the Klingenbergs and did not leave until after their departure. On this point, the Court finds the Klingenbergs to be the more credible historians because their visit was not only of dire importance to Klingenberg, but it was a completely unique experience for her and her son. In contrast, Martha testified she assisted Respondent part-time for about two and one-half years. There is no reason to believe Martha was lying, but there is reason to believe she was mistaken because she testified her only interaction with the Klingenbergs was to copy a receipt for the $200 payment, and she was doing other tasks while Respondent was interviewing Klingenberg. The Klingenbergs testified Martha also provided them with a map to the Trustee\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">\u201cWhen Klingenberg came to Respondent\u2019s office on August 12, she brought with her all the documents Respondent requested by telephone the previous day, along with her $200 payment. The foreclosure on her home was scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>for August 28, 2001, a fact which Respondent acknowledges was communicated to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">\u201cAccording to Klingenberg, Respondent had asked her to bring pay stubs, two years of income taxes, deeds, the settlement sheet on her home, any charge card bills, and all other bills. She brought these documents with her, and Respondent told her that she had brought all necessary papers for him to file the petition and that she was very organized.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Klingenberg\u2019s son, who was a sequestered witness, confirmed Respondent made these comments to Klingenberg. Respondent told her there was no need for her to return. She stated she signed a blank petition while in his office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201cRespondent testified that Klingenberg did not bring all the necessary documents and was told she had to come back with additional documents and more money before he could file the petition. He testified at the trial of this matter that he did not want to be pushy about money. However, in Respondent\u2019s answer to interrogatory number 10 he stated \u2018Lpjrior to filing of the Chapter 13 Petition, Ms. Klingenberg was told to bring the <em>balance </em>of the fee,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> proof of additional income, and other documentation needed to complete the petition.\u2019 (emphasis added) In Respondent\u2019s answer to interrogatory number 11, he further stated, \u2018Ms. Klingenberg was told, in the presence of her son and Martha, that Respondent would require additional money to complete the petition. Additionally, Ms Klingenberg was informed that a two hour signing and review meeting would be needed prior to filing.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201cAlthough Respondent knew Klingenberg\u2019s home would go to foreclosure on August 28, 2001, he never called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Klingenberg or sent her any letters reminding her of the urgency for her to return with documents and money. Respondent testified at trial that he does not recall the dates Klingenberg was told to come back. Martha testified that an appointment was scheduled for Klingenberg to return with more bills and statements. However, in response to the Court\u2019s question, she stated that no appointment date was set and that Klingenberg was simply told to get in touch with Respondent in the next week with the documents necessary for Respondent to start the case. The Court finds as a fact that Klingenberg was never told to come back with more documents and money before Respondent would file the petition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court further finds that Respondent led Klingenberg to believe that nothing more was required of her prior to his filing of the petition, and she was not told she would see Respondent prior to attending a meeting in Baltimore at the Trustee\u2019s office; a meeting at a location for which she was given a map with directions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">\u201cIt is not in dispute that Respondent told Klingenberg on the phone on more than one occasion that the petition had been filed and that her home was safe. Even when Klingenberg told Respondent in a telephone conversation that a woman came to her home seeking to buy it, that she had seen her house listed in the newspaper, and after Klingenberg told Respondent she received a card from the person who purchased her home on August 28, 2001, Respondent continued to tell Klingenberg that was impossible and her home was safe. There is no evidence that Respondent, when advised of these facts, ever checked on the status of her case or confirmed that he had, in fact, filed her petition. Respondent never filed Klingenberg\u2019s bankruptcy petition and her house was sold. At trial Respondent testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>he believes he confused Klingenberg\u2019s case with that of the Kalinowski\u2019s, which he had filed the previous Friday. However, Respondent never printed Klingenberg\u2019s petition from the computer until after her house was sold. Klingenberg was the only client with whom respondent met on Sunday, August 12, 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">\u201cRespondent testified that after the sale of Klingenberg\u2019s home he asked her if she would allow him to try to set aside the sale of her home at no charge to her. He described the various attacks he could make on the notice, auction, or sale of her home, but she refused to allow him to take any further action on her behalf. She came to his office and collected all her papers. Respondent refunded her $200.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201cWhen Respondent was asked on cross-examination to explain what happened in regard to the failure to file the petition,' Respondent stated essentially that he just forgot about this case at some point because his office was busy and the client did not come back. Respondent further stated that had Klingenberg returned, his office would have prepared for the appointment. He left her file on a table, and he only worked on active cases. He testified her case sort of fell through the cracks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201c... [Respondent\u2019s] concentration is in debtor law, which includes the filing of bankruptcy petitions. Ninety percent of his practice is debtor law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">\u201cIn response to inquiry from bar counsel Respondent wrote a letter to Mr. Grossman dated October 14, 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">\u201cThe Petitioner urges the Court to find that Respondent has violated Rules 1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4, 8.1 and 8.4 of the rules of Professional Conduct....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">\u201cThe Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rule 1.1 because he did not provide competent representation to Klingenberg. Since Respondent testified he specializes in debtor law, the Court can reasonably conclude that Respondent possesses the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>knowledge and skill to handle Klingenberg\u2019s case. Respondent also testified to the procedure he would use to file the petition, to time lines, to meeting at the trustee\u2019s office, to the information and documents he would require. Unfortunately, based on the evidence it does not appear that he exercised the thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary to represent Klingenberg in that following the meeting of August 12, 2001 he took no further action to protect her home from foreclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cIt also appears by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rule 1.2(a) because he did not abide by his client\u2019s \u2022 decision to immediately file the petition for bankruptcy given the deadline of August 28, 2001. Klingenberg made it clear that her purpose in hiring Respondent was to save her home from foreclosure. Respondent assured her on numerous occasions he would protect her home and 'put a fence around it.\u2019 He did not take the necessary steps to abide by her decision to file for bankruptcy, therefore, he violated his duty in regard to scope of representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">\u201cRule 1.3 has also been violated because Respondent did not act with reasonable diligence or promptness. In agreeing to represent Klingenberg, Respondent fully understood that acting promptly was of the utmost importance, yet he did not act promptly or act at all. Due diligence required Respondent, when faced with Klingenberg\u2019s questions about seeing her home listed for sale in the paper, having a potential buyer come to her home, and being advised that someone had purchased her home, to immediately check on her case by confirming receipt by the bankruptcy court of her petition. He never made any inquiries to ensure her petition had been properly filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201cThe Court further concludes that Respondent did not keep Klingenberg reasonably informed of the status of her case or respond honestly or, at a minimum, without negligence to her request for information about the security of her ownership in her home, all in violation of Rule 1.4(a). Respondent repeatedly told Klingenberg her home was safe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>and not to worry, and that the petition had been filed when, in fact, none of that was true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">\u201cIn regard to Rule 1.4(b) Respondent did not, by his own admissions to bar counsel, make clear to Klingenberg how much money would be due and when, what, if any, additional documents were required, and most importantly whether there were any financial, legal, or procedural impediments to the filing of her petition. If additional documents were needed, and had that fact been made clear to Klingenberg the Court concludes that she most assuredly would have complied given her anxiety over losing her home. Respondent, therefore, violated the requirements of Rule 1.4(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cThe Court regrettably finds that Respondent has also violated Rule 8.1 because he knowingly made a false statement of material fact. Respondent testified that he sent Klingenberg a letter urging her to come in with the documents because time was running out. Had Respondent sent such a letter to Klingenberg, surely he or Klingenberg would have a copy of it. Klingenberg and Respondent both testified that there was not communication flowing between them August 12, 2001 through August 28, 2001. Both cannot be true. Since no such document was admitted into evidence, the Court finds no letter was sent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201cThe Court does not find credible Respondent\u2019s statement that the \u2018Klingenbergs said they would think about it. They never responded after that.\u2019 Klingenberg\u2019s phone records, which were admitted into evidence, show phone calls from her to Respondent\u2019s office on August 13, August 15, August 22, August 28, 2001 and thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201cAlso, Respondent\u2019s statement to bar counsel in his October .14, 2001, letter \u2018[s]ince she had only paid a small payment, this case was handled differently, it was not labeled as a deadline file, and it was not placed in the new files to be worked,\u2019 flies in the face of his trial testimony where he stated he thought he had filed the petition, but confused her case with the Kalinowski case. It further conflicts with his trial testimony wherein he stated that he intended to file her petition and she could pay by September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>12, 2001 with a discount or pay thereafter, without a discount. Respondent has violated Rule 8.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">\u201cFor the reasons stated above, Respondent has violated Rule 8.4(c) by misrepresenting material facts to both bar counsel and to Klingenberg regarding the filing of her petition. Moreover, this failure to truthfully report the facts regarding his representation of Klingenberg to bar counsel was conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice [which comprises a violation of Rule 8.4(d) ]. It is bar counsel\u2019s responsibility to investigate allegations made by a client against a lawyer; and being provided with truthful and accurate information is critical to such an investigation. Accurate information is essential to bar counsel\u2019s decision to take any action justice may require.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u201cAll of the above conclusions of law are based on clear and convincing evidence.\u201d [Citations omitted.] [Some footnotes omitted.][Some alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">II.

We hold that respondent has failed to establish facts by a preponderance of evidence sufficient to overcome all but one of Judge North\u2019s findings and conclusions. Therefore, we overrule all but one of respondent\u2019s exceptions. Petitioner has filed one general exception in this Court to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. We sustain petitioner\u2019s exception in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">III. Discussion \u2014 The Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Respondent has filed nineteen exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Respondent\u2019s first ten exceptions, however, for all intents and purposes, can be merged into a general exception objecting to different factual findings made by the hearing judge in light of the testimony she heard and the facts presented to her at respondent\u2019s hearing. In his first ten exceptions, excluding his exception number five, respondent has done nothing more than reiterate excerpts of the testimony given at the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>and/or rewrite excerpts of the hearing judges findings. To support these exceptions respondent proffers little, or most often, no arguments or reasons to substantiate his exceptions; rather he merely emphasizes the contrary testimony that was given or the contrary facts that were presented to the hearing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">As indicated <em>supra, </em>we accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of facts as they are not clearly erroneous and, as such, we shall not disturb her factual findings. Most important, we \u201ckeep in mind that it is elementary that the hearing judge \u2018may elect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon.\u2019 \u201c <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17-18, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kemp, </em>303 Md. 664, 675, 496 A.2d 672, 677 (1985)). Such deference is given because the hearing judge is in the best position to assess first hand a witness\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Ultimately, Judge North found, after a full hearing at which the witnesses on whose testimony respondent relies, including his own testimony, were heard and observed, that the testimony of the complainant, Klingenberg, and her son, was more credible than the testimony proffered by respondent, his secretary and his paralegal assistant. The testimony and facts before the hearing judge constituted clear and convincing evidence for Judge North to find as she did. As a result, we overrule these factual exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We quickly dispense with respondent\u2019s fifth exception to the finding that \u201cKlingenberg\u2019s son, who was a sequestered witness, confirmed Respondent made these comments [about needed documents].\u201d (alteration added). Respondent argues that the hearing judge attempted to \u201clend more credibility\u201d to the testimony of Klingenberg\u2019s son by noting that he \u201cwas a sequestered witness.\u201d All of the witnesses were sequestered. This argument is without merit. It is clear that the hearing judge was merely stating fact. We see no reason to further comment on this exception and thus, overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>In the following paragraphs we shall next discuss respondent\u2019s exceptions tailored to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law; they are respondent\u2019s exceptions eleven through nineteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Respondent\u2019s eleventh exception is to the conclusion that \u201cSince Respondent testified he specializes in debtor law, the Court can reasonably conclude that Respondent possesses the legal knowledge and skill to handle Klingenberg\u2019s case.\u201d Respondent accurately argues that he \u201cdid not testify that he <em>specialized </em>in debtor law.\u201d During the hearing, Bar Counsel asked respondent \u201cDoes your practice concentrate in any particular area?\u201d Respondent replied \u201cI practice debtor law,\u201d illustrating that he never used the word specialize and that his response cannot be used in that manner because the term concentrate and specialize have different meanings. Regardless of the hearing judge\u2019s inaccurate account of respondent\u2019s testimony on this point, the semantics of the language used does not warrant the Court to overturn the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that respondent did not provide competent representation to Ms. Klingenberg. There was a clear perception, due to the testimony about his legal practice, that respondent possessed the requisite legal knowledge and skill to handle Ms. Klingenberg\u2019s case because he, admittedly, practiced debtor law. We note that respondent was the one who initially contacted Ms. Klingenberg by unsolicited letter stating that he might be able to provide her legal services particular to her bankruptcy matter. Additionally,\u2019the record reflects that respondent has handled numerous bankruptcy cases, supporting the hearing judge\u2019s general conclusion that he possessed the general knowledge and skill necessary to represent Ms. Klingenberg and that he was, due to his type of practice, whether he \u201cspecialized in\u201d or \u201cconcentrated in\u201d or \u201cpracticed\u201d debtor law, aware of the thoroughness and preparation that would be necessary to undertake and carry out such a case. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Respondent\u2019s twelfth exception is to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that respondent violated Rule 1.2(a), per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>taining to scope of representation, because \u201che did not abide by his client\u2019s decision to immediately file the petition for bankruptcy given the deadline of August 28, 2001.\u201d Respondent claims this conclusion should be overturned for various reasons, <em>ie., </em>because he did not ever possess the required documents he would need to file the petition, he would have needed Ms. Klingenberg to return to the office to sign the petition, he would have needed more of his fee to file the petition, etc. For the reasons stated <em>supra, </em>wherein we accepted all of the hearing judge\u2019s findings on these factual issues, we overrule this exception. Additionally, the fact remains that having the information and interaction that he did have with Ms. Klingenberg, respondent did nothing regarding her case. Respondent undertook no action to further her case or even \u201cget the ball rolling\u201d on her bankruptcy petition knowing, himself, that the foreclosure was two weeks away. Ms. Klingenberg wanted to prevent the foreclosure on her home; to do so, respondent would have needed to file the petition immediately given the two week time frame, therefore, by doing nothing he violated Rule 1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Respondent\u2019s thirteenth exception relates to the previous exception and, specifically, to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[Respondent] did not take the necessary steps to abide by her decision to file for bankruptcy, therefore, he violated his duty in regard to scope of representation.\u201d Essentially, respondent proffers that he did all he could reasonably do in preparing for filing her bankruptcy case given what he had and that it was Ms. Klingenberg\u2019s failure to follow up with him that ultimately resulted in her petition not being filed. For the reasons just indicated, we overrule this exception; respondent failed in his scope of representation to Ms. Klingenberg because \u201call that he could reasonably do\u201d in reality, for Ms. Klingenberg amounted to complete inaction regarding her legal matter and her objective of filing for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Respondent\u2019s fourteenth exception is to the conclusion that \u201che never made any inquiries to ensure her petition had been properly filed.\u201d Respondent supports this exception by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>noting that he did, in fact, follow up on her case and that he even contacted the owner of the house on several occasions, but that Ms. Klingenberg would not grant him permission to take any action to attempt to void the foreclosure sale. This exception is without merit. Respondent\u2019s attempts to remedy Ms. Klingenberg\u2019s situation \u201cafter-the-fact\u201d do not trump his blatant lack of diligence or promptness in attending to her legal problem up until that time, which led to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 1.3 pertaining to attorney diligence. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Respondent\u2019s fifteenth exception relates to his violation of Rule 1.4(b), requiring that an attorney \u201cexplain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.\u201d He excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated this rule by not making it clear to Ms. Klingenberg how much the fees would be, when they would be due, if any other documents were needed and, most importantly, whether there were any other financial, legal or procedural impediments to the filing of her petition. The hearing judge went on to conclude that had Ms. Klingenberg known other documents were needed she would have provided them to respondent due to her \u201canxiety over losing her home.\u201d To support this exception, respondent once again relies upon the fact that he and Martha testified that respondent made the status of the situation clear by telling Ms. Klingenberg that her signature, other monies and other visits would be necessary before he could proceed with her case. As indicated <em>supra, </em>the hearing judge found the opposite to be true and the findings of the hearing judge, especially those findings relating to Ms. Klingenberg\u2019s understanding of her legal problem in light of her interview and subsequent contact with respondent, support this rule violation. Respondent did little to clearly explain her legal problem to her and certainly not to the extent to permit her to make informed decisions regarding his representation of her. We, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Respondent\u2019s remaining exceptions, sixteen through nineteen, relate to the same attorney misconduct upon which petitioner bases its sole exception which we discuss <em>infra-</em>respondent\u2019s false and misleading statements to Bar Counsel and the hearing judge about what he stated to Ms. Klingenberg in her representation and what she allegedly said to him during that time. We will sustain petitioner\u2019s sole exception and, in so doing, we overrule all but one of respondent\u2019s remaining exceptions and hold that he has proffered insufficient evidence to sustain these remaining exceptions and that the exceptions do not warrant this Court\u2019s rejection of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions regarding respondent\u2019s violations of Rules 8.1, 8.4(c) and (d). Because we sustain petitioner\u2019s sole exception and affirm the ultimate conclusion that respondent violated Rules 8.1, 8.4(c) and (d) in representing Ms. Klingenberg, we need not address specifically the merits of each of these exceptions, except for his sixteenth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">We sustain respondent\u2019s sixteenth exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cRespondent has also violated Rule 8.1 because he knowingly made a false statement of material fact. <em>Respondent testified that he had sent Klingenberg a letter urging her to come in with the documents because time was running out. </em>Had Respondent sent such a letter to Klingenberg, surely he or Klingenberg would have a copy of it. Klingenberg and Respondent both testified that there was no communication flowing between them [from] August 12, 2001 through August 28, 2001. Both cannot be true. Since no such document was admitted into evidence, <em>the Court finds no letter ivas sent.\u201d </em>[Alteration added.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADl\">Respondent argues that the hearing judge took his testimony out of context and that he never stated to bar counsel or the hearing judge that he sent a letter to Ms. Klingenberg urging her to come in with documents because time was running out in the time period between August 12th and August 28th. Based upon our independent review of the record, the record reflects that the only letter respondent testified that he sent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>excluding his initial solicitation letter, was his September 16, 2001 letter. This letter included .a refund of the $200 in fees Ms. Klingenberg had paid, explained how respondent might have been able to reverse the sale of her home, how she refused his help and how he would have attempted to rectify the sale of her home for her for free. Respondent did state in his letter to bar counsel that he \u201csent them [Klingenberg] a letter explaining that, they were running out of time.\u201d Even though respondent\u2019s September 16th letter does not, as petitioner notes, indicate explicitly \u201cthat time is running out,\u201d we hold that the September 16th letter is the one to which respondent was referring and the letter the hearing judge inaccurately concluded was not sent. It was the only letter mentioned in his testimony (other that the original solicitation letter). The hearing judge took respondent\u2019s testimony out of context to imply that he testified that he had sent an additional letter to Ms. Klingenberg between August 12th and 28th Therefore, we sustain this exception regarding the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that no letter was sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Petitioner\u2019s only exception in the case <em>sub judice </em>pertains to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that respondent violated Rules 8.1 and 8.4(c) and (d). Specific to these conclusions, petitioner excepts only to the hearing judge\u2019s failure to \u201cexplicitly find that the Respondent misrepresented to Bar Counsel that Ms. Klingenberg was to \u2018come back\u2019 to his office \u2018and sign the paper\u2019 and that she was to come back to his office prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition to pay the Respondent a fee. Those statements, m\u00e1de in correspondence and to a Commission investigator were misleading and/or false and demonstrate violations of Rules 8.1, 8.4(c) and 8.4(d).\u201d Based upon the factual findings of the hearing judge, <em>i.e., </em>her findings accepting other testimony as the true facts, not the facts as stated by respondent or his witnesses, we sustain this exception and hold that respondent misrepresented the facts to Bar Counsel and to the hearing judge in his statements regarding that which he told Ms. Klingenberg she needed to do prior to filing her petition and regarding her representation generally. Respondent\u2019s misconduct in the case <em>sub judice </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>warrants the conclusion that respondent violated Rule 8.1, 8.4(c) and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">III. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">We now consider the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Gallagher, </em>we set out the purposes of the sanctioning process when we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\u201c \u2018This Court is mindful that the purpose of the sanctions is to protect the public, to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, and to maintain the integrity of the legal profession. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Hess, </em>352 Md. 438, 453, 722 A.2d 905, 913 (1999) <em>(quoting Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Webster, </em>348 Md. 662, 678, 705 A.2d 1135, 1143 (1998)). We have stated that \u201c[t]he public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Awnah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). Therefore, the appropriate sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including consideration of any mitigating factors. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Atkinson, </em>357 Md. 646, 656, 745 A.2d 1086, 1092 (2000); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Gavin, </em>350 Md. 176, 197-98, 711 A.2d 193, 204 (1998).\u2019 <em>Clark, </em>363 Md. at 183-84, 767 A.2d at 873. In addition, we have stated that \u2018[ijmposing a sanction protects the public interest \u201cbecause it demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct which will not be tolerated.\u201d \u2018 <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 96, 753 A.2d 17, 38 (2000) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ober, </em>350 Md. 616, 631-32, 714 A.2d 856, 864 (1998)) (citation omitted).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\"><em>Gallagher, </em>371 Md. 673, 713-14, 810 A.2d 996, 1020 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\"> \u201c[T]he nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed\u201d is relevant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>sanctioning process. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pennington, </em>355 Md. 61, 78, 733 A.2d 1029, 1037-38 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Milliken, </em>348 Md. 486, 519, 704 A.2d 1225, 1241 (1998); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Montgomery, </em>318 Md. 154, 165, 567 A.2d 112, 117 (1989). The attorney\u2019s prior grievance history, <em>i.e., </em>whether the attorney has been previously charged with Rule violations and was subject to prior disciplinary proceedings, the nature of the misconduct involved in those proceedings and the nature of any sanctions imposed, as well as any facts in mitigation are similarly relevant, <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Franz, </em>355 Md. 752, 762-63, 736 A.2d 339, 344 (1999); <em>Maryland State Bar Association v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 362, 347 A.2d 556, 561 (1975), as are the attorney\u2019s level of remorse for the misconduct, <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Wyatt, </em>323 Md. 36, 38, 591 A.2d 467, 468 (1991), and the likelihood of the attorney repeating the conduct. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Freedman, </em>285 Md. 298, 300, 402 A.2d 75, 76 (1979). The likelihood of repetition of the misconduct is lessened where there is evidence that an attorney voluntarily terminates the misconduct and appreciates the seriousness of his actions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Attorney Grievance Commission, through Bar Counsel, argues that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law with the right to reapply for reinstatement no sooner than one year. Respondent, however, advocates that he should receive a public reprimand. Given the nature and quantity of respondent\u2019s violations, his recommendation of a public reprimand is inherently inappropriate. .</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">This Court has often issued sanctions of an indefinite suspension for various lengths for multiple violations of the MRPC not involving the intentional misappropriation of money. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jeter, </em>365 Md. 279, 778 A.2d 390 (2001)(indefinitely suspending an attorney with the right to reapply in six months where the hearing judge found that the attorney did not intentionally defraud his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>clients, that he violated several rules and statutes and that he was remorseful for his misconduct); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Cassidy, </em>362 Md. 689, 766 A.2d 632 (2001)(indefinitely suspending an attorney where the attorney violated MRPC 1.3 and 1.4, he was previously sanctioned for nearly identical conduct); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Cohen, </em>361 Md. 161, 760 A.2d 706 (2000)(assessing an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in six months to an attorney who violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) and (d)); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Brown, </em>353 Md. 271, 725 A.2d 1069 (1999)(issuing an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in one year).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">In its recommendations for sanctions, petitioner relies, in part, on <em>Brown, </em>353 Md. 271, 725 A.2d 1069, where this Court sanctioned Brown by imposing an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in no less than one year. The attorney in <em>Brown </em>had violated several Rules of Professional Conduct during his representation of clients resulting in three separate complaints. While much of Brown\u2019s misconduct has similarities to the case at bar, including Brown\u2019s impeding of Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, his multiple rule violations, his taking corrective measures and his genuine remorse for his conduct, it was more egregious than in this case in that Brown had previous violations and suspensions for similar conduct and was facing three complaints during his disciplinary proceeding. The current disciplinary proceedings are the first brought against respondent and his charges stem from his representations of one client, thus, is unlike the systematic violations evidenced in <em>Brown. </em>In addition, while the hearing judge properly found that respondent was not forthcoming, and essentially untruthful, to Bar Counsel during the investigation, respondent\u2019s conduct showed some remorse for his failure to adequately represent Ms. Klingenberg by his refunding of Ms. Klingenberg\u2019s $200 fee and his offering to attempt to rectify the situation by challenging the foreclosure of Ms. Klingenberg\u2019s home free of charge. Thus we hold that respondent\u2019s conduct does not warrant a one-year indefinite suspension in line with <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Respondent\u2019s conduct is more in line with <em>Cohen, supra. </em>This Court accepted the hearing court\u2019s findings in <em>Cohen, </em>when the hearing court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the attorney lacked thoroughness and preparation in violation of Rule 1.1, failed to keep his client informed of her case in violation of Rule 1.3, failed to inform his client of the status of her case in violation of Rule 1.4, made false representations to Bar Counsel in violation of Rule 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) and directly prejudiced the administration of justice by misleading Bar Counsel. While not identical, the nature and number of Cohen\u2019s violations closely parallel respondent\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">As we said in <em>Cassidy </em>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">\u201c \u2018In recent years, however, we have noticed too many instances when lawyers have agreed to represent clients and accepted fees, in part or in whole, only to completely neglect these same legal problems, causing the same clients emotional distress, financial loss, or other varying kinds of inconvenience. More often than not, these situations have been exacerbated by the lack of respect and attention extended to the courts as evidenced by the failure to file timely pleadings or to make appearances as scheduled before the court to enable proceedings to be conducted. It seems to us that this kind of persistent conduct is evidence of a lawyer\u2019s disregard of his obligation.\u2019 \u201c</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\"><em>Cassidy, </em>362 Md. at 700-01, 766 A.2d at 638 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Manning, </em>318 Md. 697, 704-05, 569 A.2d 1250, 1254 (1990)). While this language from <em>Cassidy </em>refers to a case where repeated violations existed, respondent\u2019s conduct showed similar disregard and neglect for Ms. Klingenberg, which brought her severe distress, loss and inconvenience as evidenced by the loss of her home. We therefore hold that an indefinite suspension with permission to reapply no sooner than six months is the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COST OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, FOR WHICH SUM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST THOMAS LEO GRANGER, III.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-11\">.
