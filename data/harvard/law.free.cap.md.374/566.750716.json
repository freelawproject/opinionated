The issue presented is whether appellant Linda Livering\u2019s accidental injury, suffered on a day off but while checking her work schedule at her place of employment, arose out of and in the course of her employment such that it is compensable under Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation law. We shall hold that her injury arose out of and in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Richardson\u2019s Restaurant employed Livering as a salad preparer. Richardson\u2019s owner, Bobby Resh, posted the employee work schedule each Sunday, and the new schedule operated from the following Thursday. Resh had a \u201ctendency\u201d to change the work schedule. Employees would visit or call the restaurant to verify the schedule. If there were a schedule change, Richardson\u2019s would attempt to call or visit the affected employee, or failing that, work with the employees already on site or make do without additional help. Livering could not be called regarding schedule changes because she did not have a telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">According to Livering\u2019s testimony, she was not working on November 28, 2000, and was not scheduled to work but visited the restaurant to confirm her work schedule. In the three weeks of her employment prior to this day, Livering\u2019s schedule had changed at least twice. On one occasion, she was late for work when her employer changed her starting time from noon to 7:00 a.m., and her employer inquired into her tardiness. On the day of her injury, she and her boyfriend, James Morris, visited the restaurant while in the course of running personal errands; Morris ordered a cup of coffee at the bar, and Livering checked the work schedule posted in the kitchen. After speaking briefly in the bar area with co-employee, cashier, and day manager, Louise Rainey, Livering left the restaurant. As Livering and Moms exited, she slipped and fell on the ramp just outside the door, injuring her wrist. Morris drove her to the Washington County Hospital emergency room, where she was treated for a dislocated and broken wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Livering filed a claim with the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. The Commission ruled that Livering did not sustain an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment. Livering then filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Washington County and elected a bench trial. At trial, the parties disputed whether Livering actually checked her work schedule during her visit to the restaurant. The court found that Livering was not working on the day in question and that she had checked her work schedule on the employer\u2019s premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Circuit Court affirmed the Commission, concluding that Livering \u201cdid not sustain an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment with Richardson\u2019s Restaurant, as defined under the Workers\u2019 Compensation law of Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHX\">Livering noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari on our own initiative prior to consideration by that court to consider whether Livering\u2019s accidental injury arose out of and in the course of her employment. <em>See Livering v. Richardson\u2019s, </em>372 Md. 429, 813 A.2d 257 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Before this Court, Livering argues that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that her injury did not arise out of and in the course of her employment in accordance with Maryland Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol. &amp; 2002 Supp.) \u00a7 9-101(b)(1) of the Labor and Employment Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She argues that checking her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>schedule was incident to her employment, that while Richardson\u2019s Restaurant did not require employees to check their schedules, it acquiesced in the practice, and that her activity benefitted the restaurant. Therefore, her resulting injury arose out of and in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Appellees Richardson\u2019s Restaurant and PMA Management Corporation argue that Livering\u2019s injury is not compensable. They note that not every injury that occurs on the employer\u2019s property is compensable and contend that there is no causal connection between Livering\u2019s work and her injury. In the main, they argue that her injury did not arise out of her employment because she was not required to visit the restaurant to verify her schedule; rather, her visit constituted a personal errand performed for her own convenience that did not benefit or involve the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\"> In a workers\u2019 compensation claim, a party aggrieved by a decision of the Commission may petition the Circuit Court for judicial review. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9-737. In the judicial proceedings, the decision of the Commission is prima facie correct, and the party challenging that decision bears the burden of proof. \u00a7 9-745(b); <em>see also Martin v. Beverage Capital Corp., </em>353 Md. 388, 401-02, 726 A.2d 728, 735 (1999); <em>Sica v. Retail Credit Co., </em>245 Md. 606, 612, 227 A.2d 33, 36 (1967). The petitioner may request a trial which essentially is <em>de novo. See </em>\u00a7 9-745; <em>Holman v. Kelly Catering, Inc., </em>334 Md. 480, 484, 639 A.2d 701, 703 (1994). A reviewing court \u201cshall reverse or modify the decision\u201d of the Commission if the court determines that the Commission \u201cdid not act within its powers or did not correctly construe the law.\u201d \u00a7 9-745(e)(2); <em>see also Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Vache, </em>349 Md. 526, 537, 709 A.2d 155, 160 (1998) (noting that a reviewing court \u201cmay reverse the Commission\u2019s decision when it is based on an erroneous conception of the law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides benefits to employees who suffer an accidental injury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u201carises out of and in the course of employment.\u201d \u00a7 9-101(b)(1); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 9-501 (requiring employers to compensate \u201cthe covered employee for an accidental personal injury sustained by the covered employee\u201d). The Act essentially is remedial, social legislation designed to protect workers and their families from various hardships that result from employment-related injuries. <em>See Martin, </em>353 Md. at 398, 726 A.2d at 733. It is a well-settled rule that \u201c[t]he Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act should be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes.\u201d <em>Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard, Inc. v. Hempfield, </em>206 Md. 589, 594, 112 A.2d 488, 491 (1955). Any uncertainty in the law should be interpreted in favor of the claimant. <em>See Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Cassidy, </em>338 Md. 88, 97, 656 A.2d 757, 761-62 (1995); <em>Knoche v. Cox, </em>282 Md. 447, 456, 385 A.2d 1179, 1183-84 (1978) (noting that the Court broadly interprets the term \u201carises out of\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The statute requires that the claimant satisfy two conditions precedent to bring a claim within the ambit of the Act \u2014 both \u201carises out of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment must be proven. <em>See Montgomery County v. Wade, </em>345 Md. 1, 9, 690 A.2d 990, 994 (1997); <em>Pariser Bakery v. Koontz, </em>239 Md. 586, 589, 212 A.2d 324, 326 (1965). Whether an injury arises out of and in the course of employment is determined by the facts and circumstances of each individual case. <em>Knoche, </em>282 Md. at 454, 385 A.2d at 1182; <em>Sica, </em>245 Md. at 611, 227 A.2d at 35-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\u201cArises out of\u2019 refers to the causal connection between the employment and the injury. An injury arises out of employment when it results from some obligation, condition, or incident of employment. <em>Wade, </em>345 Md. at 9-10, 690 A.2d at 994. The phrase \u201c \u2018arises out of requires, not that the performance of an employment-related task be the direct or physical cause of the injury, but, more broadly, that the injury be incidental to the employment, such that it was by reason of the employment that the employee was exposed to the risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>resulting in the injury.\u201d <em>Mulready v. University Research Corp., </em>360 Md. 51, 57, 756 A.2d 575, 578 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Judge Rodowsky, writing for the Court in <em>Mulready, </em>examined the different tests sometimes employed in determining \u201carising out of\u2019 causation. He noted two tests\u2014 one known as the increased risk test and the other known as the positional-risk test. <em>Id. </em>at 59, 756 A.2d at 579. Explaining the difference between the two tests, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">\u201cThe increased risk test requires that \u2018the employee be exposed to a quantitatively greater degree of risk than the general public.\u2019 Under the positional-risk test, \u2018an injury arises out of employment if it would not have occurred if the employee\u2019s job had not required him to be in the place where he was injured.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-7\"><em>Id., </em>756 A.2d at 579. The positional-risk test is a more liberal test than the increased risk test. <em>See id. </em>at 59, 756 A.2d at 579; <em>Montgomery County v. Smith, </em>144 Md.App. 548, 557, 799 A.2d 406, 412 (2002). The positional-risk test is essentially a \u201cbut for\u201d test. Professor Larson succinctly states the test as follows: \u201cAn injury arises out of the employment if it would not have occurred <em>but for </em>the fact that the conditions and obligations of the employment placed [the employee] in the position where he [or she] was injured.\u201d A. Larson, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 3.05 (2002); <em>see also </em>J.D. Ingram, <em>The Meaning of \u201cArising Out of\" Employment in Illinois Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, </em>29 J. Marshall L.Rev. 153, 158 (1995) (noting that under the positional-risk test \u201can injury is compensable if it would not have happened \u2018but for\u2019 the fact that the conditions or obligations of the employment put the claimant in the position where he was injured\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Maryland has adopted the positional-risk test to determine whether an injury arose out of employment. <em>See Mulready, </em>360 Md. at 66, 756 A.2d at 583; <em>Wade, </em>345 Md. at 11, 690 A.2d at 994; <em>Knoche, </em>282 Md. at 455-57, 385 A.2d at 1183-84. In <em>Mulready, </em>in the context of a traveling employee, we noted that \u201c[ujnder the positional-risk test, \u2018an injury arises out of employment if it would not have occurred if the employee\u2019s job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>had not required him to be in the place where he was injured.\u2019 \u201d 360 Md. at 59, 756 A.2d at 579. In that case, a traveling employee sustained an injury after slipping in a hotel bathtub. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 756 A.2d at 576. Mulready was staying in the hotel to conduct employer business but was not actively engaged in work at the time of her injury. The parties agreed that her injury occurred in the course of her employment but disputed whether it arose out of that employment. We reasoned that her personal act of bathing was reasonably incidental to the travel required by her employer. <em>Id. </em>at 66, 756 A.2d at 583. In effect, but for her travel, Mulready would not have been injured. We held that her injury, resulting from an incident of her employment, arose out of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The positional-risk test also encompasses injuries that occur during activities incidental to employment that are not required specifically by the employment. In <em>Wade, </em>we applied the positional-risk test and held that a police officer\u2019s injury, suffered while participating in a voluntary police department program, arose out of employment. <em>See </em>345 Md. at 9-11, 690 A.2d at 994. Officer Wade, while not on scheduled duty and while operating her personal patrol vehicle (PPV), was hit from behind by another vehicle and injured. Wade was on her way to her mother\u2019s home. Her employer, the Montgomery County Police Department, operated a program permitting, but not requiring, employees to utilize patrol vehicles for personal use, subject to certain conditions. We held that Wade\u2019s injury arose out of her employment because Wade \u201cwould not have been operating a PPV but for her employment and consequent participation in the program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 690 A.2d at 994. We found the requisite causal link between her work and her injury in that her injuries stemmed from use of her police vehicle within departmental guidelines. <em>Id., </em>690 A.2d at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">\u201cAris[ing] out of\u2019 one\u2019s employment satisfies one part of the statutory requirement. A claimant must demonstrate in addition that the injury occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 his or her employment. In determining whether an injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>occurred \u201cin the course of employment,\u201d we consider the time, place, and circumstances of the accident in relation to the employment. <em>Id., </em>690 A.2d at 995. An injury is in the course of employment \u201cwhen it occurs during the period of employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be in performance of his or her duties and while fulfilling those duties or engaged in something incident thereto.\u201d <em>Id., </em>690 A.2d at 995; <em>see also Pariser Bakery, </em>239 Md. at 590, 212 A.2d at 326. \u201cIn the course of employment\u201d is not limited to \u201cactual manipulation of the tools of work, nor to the exact hours of work.\u201d Wade, 345 Md. at 12 n. 6, 690 A.2d at 995 n. 6. In <em>Wade, </em>Judge Karwacki, writing for the Court, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdL\">\u201cAn analysis of the occupational correlation of these factors \u2018demands that the injury be shown to have arisen within the time and space boundaries of the employment, and in the course of an activity whose purpose is related to the employment.\u2019 Questions pertinent to this inquiry are: 1) when the employment began and ended, 2) whether the continuity of the period was broken, and 3) how far the employee placed himself or herself outside the employment during that period. Stated otherwise, an injury is in the course of employment when it occurs during the period of employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be in performance of his or her duties and while fulfilling those duties or engaged in something incident thereto. If the injury occurred at a point where the employee was within the range of dangers associated with the employment, it is held compensable under the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 11-12, 690 A.2d at 995 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In regard to the \u201cin the course of\u2019 test, we find instructive those cases involving off-duty or post-termination injuries sustained while on-premises to collect wages or personal property. Maryland law recognizes that collecting-wages and gathering personal effects are incidents of employment and that on-premises injuries suffered while performing these activities may occur in the course of employment. <em>See Consolidated Eng\u2019g Co. v. Feikin, </em>188 Md. 420, 52 A.2d 913 (1947); <em>Nails v. Market Tire Co., </em>29 Md.App. 154, 347 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>564 (1975). Professor Larson echoes this notion, stating that \u201c[i]njuries incurred by an employee while leaving the premises, collecting pay, or getting his clothing or tools within a reasonable time after termination of the employment are within the course of employment, since they are normal incidents of the employment relation.\u201d A. Larson, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 26.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">In <em>Consolidated Engineering Co. v. Feikin, </em>188 Md. 420, 52 A.2d 913 (1947), the claimant was a day laborer paid only for the hours he actually worked. After claimant returned to his job following an illness, he was assigned to the hot strip mill but worked only one day. He returned on Friday not intending to work but instead to pick up pay for one day\u2019s work. The company distributed pay slips in the morning but required workers to pick up their wages in the afternoon. After receiving his pay slip, claimant went to the mill and asked the location of the gang he had worked with on Monday. Approximately forty-five minutes later, he was found on the floor of the mill, severely burned. We adopted the following rule: \u201ca contract of employment is not necessarily terminated when the actual work ceases, but may continue until the workman\u2019s wages are paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425, 52 A.2d at 916. We noted that appearing at a place of employment for wages constitutes part of the employment contract and therefore is an incident of employment. <em>See id. </em>at 426, 52 A.2d at 916-17. This Court reversed the trial court\u2019s directed verdict and remanded for a new trial because the evidence was not sufficient for a ruling as a matter of law that the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment. We left open the possibility that the jury could infer that the claimant, on a day off, visited the hot strip mill on some matter in connection with his employment rather than only to socialize with other workers, thereby entitling him to compensation. <em>See id. </em>at 427-28, 52 A.2d at 917.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>In <em>Nails v. Market Tire Co., </em>29 Md.App. 154, 347 A.2d 564 (1975), a claimant was terminated from his position as head mechanic. Two days later, he returned to the company to pick up his tools that he had furnished as a condition of his employment. It was customary for employees to have two or three days to retrieve tools following termination. As the claimant removed his heavy tools, he injured his back. The Court of Special Appeals likened the employee\u2019s removal of his personal effects on termination to the collection of wages. <em>Id. </em>at 155-58, 347 A.2d at 565-66. Both activities, the court reasoned, are incidents of employment because they comprise part of the employment contract \u2014 they are necessary preparations for the orderly termination of employment. <em>Id. </em>at 156-58, 347 A.2d at 565-66. The intermediate appellate court held that the claimant\u2019s injury, sustained while removing his personal effects within a reasonable time after his termination, arose out of and in the course of his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 160-61, 347 A.2d at 567-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Checking a work schedule is similar to collecting a paycheck or removing personal effects. Collecting a paycheck and removing personal effects are essential to ending one\u2019s status as an employee; checking one\u2019s schedule is essential to continuing one\u2019s status as an employee. Checking a schedule may exhibit a stronger connection with employment because the employee-employer relationship is ongoing rather than coming to a close. Checking a work schedule is a part of one\u2019s duties; appearing to perform work comprises a fundamental aspect of an employment relationship. Checking a work schedule \u2014 like collecting wages and personal effects \u2014 is incident to employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>In the instant case, we must determine whether Livering\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of employment. Because many of the facts relevant to analyzing \u201carising out of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of\u2019 overlap in this particular case; we shall consider the two tests together. Arriving for work on time and on the days she was expected to work constituted part of Livering\u2019s duties as a restaurant employee, and checking her schedule was a necessary component of those duties. Richardson\u2019s had a tendency to change the weekly schedule. The employer neither required nor prohibited employees from visiting the establishment to check the schedule, but it knew about and acquiesced in the custom. Moreover, by unexpectedly changing the work schedule, the employer impliedly requmed employees constantly to be aware of it. Because Livering did not have a telephone in her home, she checked her schedule either by telephoning the restaurant from elsewhere or by visiting in person. She had last worked on Sunday and had seen the schedule at that time. On the following Tuesday, the day in question, Livering visited the restaurant to ensure there had been no changes. Checking her schedule was therefore incident to her employment, and her injury resulted because of her employment. She would not have been injured but for the fact that she visited the restaurant to confirm her schedule. Not only was she checking her schedule at the time of the injury, but she also was hurt on the restaurant\u2019s premises. There is a clear nexus between her work and the injury. Because appellant\u2019s injury occurred on the employer\u2019s premises while performing, and as a result of, a task incident to her employment, we hold that her injury arose out of and in the' course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Appellees maintain that, even though Livering was injured on the premises, she was on a personal errand for her own convenience that in no way involved her employer, thereby taking the injury beyond the scope of the Act. In this case, the record shows that Livering suffered an injury while on her employer\u2019s premises to check her schedule. She was not on a purely personal errand for her own convenience; under the circumstances, checking her schedule when there was a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>sonable chance that the schedule had changed benefitted her employer and was an incident of her employment. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and hold that Livering\u2019s accidental injury arose out of and in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE DECISION OF THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION COMMISSION AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE COMMISSION FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

Appellees argue to this Court that the Circuit Court did not find as a matter of fact that Livering checked her work schedule on the day of her injury. Appellees suggest that the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling that \"even finding she did check her work schedule\u201d should be read to say \"even if finding.\u201d They contend, therefore, that the trial court did not find that Livering checked her work schedule but only assumed that fact <em>arguendo. </em>Read in context, we interpret the trial court's remark as a finding that Livering checked her work schedule during her visit to the restaurant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\">.
