The relevant statutory provisions establish a rebuttable presumption that the test results generated by certain breath test instruments administered by trained test technicians are accurate. That presumption may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>be rebutted at an administrative evidentiary hearing by a showing that the specific instrument used to measure the subject\u2019s breath was malfunctioning at the time of testing or that human error caused the test to generate an inaccurate result. Respondent offered no evidence or arguments on either score before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) of the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d). Instead, he claimed generally that the type of machine used, the Intox EC/IR, had a plus or minus 0.01 range of accuracy and that that margin of error must be applied to his case, yielding a blood alcohol content (\u201cBAC\u201d) measurement below the then prevailing 0.10 benchmark for DWI. The specific issue before us is whether a general \u201cmargin of error\u201d of the \u201caccepted scientific range of accuracy\u201d of the type of test instrument used must be applied to certified test results produced by a specific Intox EC/IR machine in a prima facie case of violating Maryland Code, Title 16, \u00a7 16-205.1(f) (8) (i) (4) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The Transportation Article of the Maryland Code, Title 16 (Vehicle Laws \u2014 Driver\u2019s Licenses), Subtitle 2 (Cancellation, Refusal, Suspension, or Revocation), \u00a7\u00a7 16-201 \u2014 213 (1977, 1999 Repl.Vol. and 2000 Supp.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">... if a police officer stops or detains any person who the police officer has reasonable grounds to believe is or has been driving or attempting to drive under the influence of alcohol ... the police officer shall: (i) Detain the person; (ii) Request that the person permit a test to be taken; and (iii) Advise the person of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed for refusal to take the test,....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The type of testing authorized under \u00a7 16-205.1 is a test of breath or, under limited exceptions, a blood test to determine alcohol concentration. \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(1)(iv).

After stopping Lytle\u2019s vehicle, Officer Dickey noticed the smell of alcohol emanating from Lytle\u2019s breath. The officer administered the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test to Lytle who displayed six clues of intoxication. Officer Dickey then administered two additional field sobriety tests to Lytle who dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>played four signs of intoxication on the walk and turn test and three signs of intoxication on the one leg stand test. A preliminary breath test was administered and Lytle was arrested for driving while intoxicated and driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">After arresting Lytle, Officer Dickey requested another breathalyzer test which resulted in a reading of 0.101 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. A second test administered by the officer yielded a 0.105 reading. Consequently, Officer Dickey issued a Certification and Order of Suspension to Lytle.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">On 14 March 2001, Lytle requested a hearing before the OAH. The hearing was held before an ALJ on 12 June 2001. The Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) appeared at the hearing through its paper record of the certified test results. At the hearing, Lytle made a Motion for No Action and argued that the test result of 0.10 should be reduced below 0.10 because of the permissible variance of such test results arguably recognized in the Toxicologist\u2019s Regulations. The ALJ took the matter <em>sub cu\u00f1a </em>and granted Lytle ten days in which to file a Memorandum of Law supporting his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Lytle postulated in his memorandum that the test results of 0.10 are insufficient to show that he was subject to the sanctions of \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(1). Section 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(1) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a person may not be compelled to take a test.

For a test result indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">A. For a first offense, suspend the driver\u2019s license for 45 days; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Lytle argued that the \u201caccepted scientific range of accuracy\u201d for breath test results as stated in the Toxicologist\u2019s Regulations is plus or minus 0.01.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lytle contended therefore that his test results must be reduced by 0.01 to yield a result of 0.09, thus rendering the sanctions of \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l) inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Relying on cases from other states, Lytle observed that some require particular test results as a basis for sanction and others require a specific alcohol content before sanctions may be imposed. Lytle contended that Maryland law required that sanctions be imposed based on a specific alcohol content and not a particular test result, and therefore he was entitled to the benefit of the margin of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">On 20 June 2001, the ALJ issued an opinion concluding, as a matter of law, that the MVA failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Lytle had an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or greater at the time of testing. The ALJ\u2019s reasoning began with the premise that the statute was written using the \u201calcohol content\u201d standard. Noting that the language of \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(1), \u201cor was tested and the result indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more,\u201d contained references both to the \u201ctest result\u201d and \u201calcohol content\u201d standards, the ALJ relied on \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(T)(i)(5) to reason that the Legislature intended the statute to employ the \u201calcohol content\u201d standard. Relying on \u00a7 16-205.1 (f)(7)(i), enumerating the issues that could be raised at an administrative hearing, and specifically \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(7)(i)(5), the ALJ emphasized that the test was: \u201c[w]hether the person drove or attempted to drive a motor vehicle while having an <em>alcohol concentration </em>of 0.10 or more at the time of testing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The administrative adjudicator rationalized that the exclusion of test result language from the statement of issues that could be raised at an administrative hearing indicated the Legislature\u2019s intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>use alcohol content as the applicable standard. On this foundation, the ALJ concluded that it would \u201cbe patently unfair as well as a violation of due process not to consider and apply the margin of error, i.e. the accepted scientific range of accuracy, in [Lytle\u2019s] case.\u201d Furthermore, he concluded, again as a matter of law, that \u201c[t]he MVA has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence, that the margin of error or the accepted scientific range of accuracy was factored into the calculation of the alcohol content of Mr. Lytle\u2019s breath,\u201d and therefore the MVA failed to prove that Lytle \u201cdrove or attempted to drive a motor vehicle \u2018while having an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or greater at the time of testing\u2019 \u201d as required by \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i)(5). The ALJ ordered that \u201cno action\u201d be taken against Lytle.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">On 9 August 2001, the MVA filed a Petition for Judicial Review with the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, pursuant to Maryland Code (1984, 2000 Repl.Vol.), State Government Article, \u00a7 10-222 (\u201cthe State Administrative Procedure Act\u201d). The Circuit Court was asked to consider whether the ALJ erred when he took into account the margin of error in establishing the accurate level of Lytle\u2019s BAC breath result. Lytle reiterated in the Circuit Court the arguments he presented in the administrative proceeding. The MVA, now represented by counsel, argued that it was authorized to suspend a driver\u2019s license based on a certified test result and was not required to litigate proof of an actual breath alcohol content level. The court affirmed the decision of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The Circuit Court, like the ALJ, was unable to find any Maryland case law providing guidance on the issue. The court relied upon an Alaska case urged by Lytle. In <em>Haynes v. Alaska, </em>865 P.2d 758 (Alaska 1993), the Alaska Supreme Court held that the failure to apply the margin of error inherent in the type of testing device in favor of the person subject to license revocation was a violation of the due process rights afforded by both the federal and Alaska constitutions. The Circuit Court, agreeing with the analysis of the Alaska court, concluded that the margin of error \u201cmust be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>when determining the somewhat strict statutory standard of license revocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The MVA petitioned this Court to grant a writ of certiorari. We granted the petition to consider whether a certified and unrebutted 0.10 test result from a chemical breath test for alcohol was sufficient evidence of an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more mandating a driver\u2019s license suspension under the administrative per se provisions of \u00a7 16-205.1. 371 Md. 261, 808 A.2d 806 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The MVA argues here that the language of \u00a7 16-205.1, and its related legislative history as well as that of the statutory scheme of which it is a part, authorize the MVA to impose license suspensions based solely on certified test results. The MVA further contends, as a matter of law, that it proved Lytle\u2019s blood alcohol concentration inasmuch as he failed to submit any competent evidence to overcome the rebuttable presumption that the certified 0.10 test result in his case was accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The MVA maintains that a reading of the plain language of the statute and consideration of the overall statutory scheme reveal that \u00a7 16-205.1 is a \u201ctest result\u201d statute. The MVA reminds us that, to interpret Maryland\u2019s motor vehicle laws, we must \u201cascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature\u201d in a reasonable statutory construction that is consistent with the \u201cpurpose, aim or policy of the legislature reflected in the statute.\u201d <em>MVA v. Gaddy, </em>335 Md. 342, 346-47, 643 A.2d 442, 444 (1994). The ALJ\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 16-205.1 was incorrect therefore because his interpretation failed to construe subsection (f)(7)(i)(5) as part of a statutory scheme. Subsection (f)(7)(i), permitting challenge of \u201c[w]hether the person drove or attempted to drive a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing\u201d at an administrative hearing, must be read together with subsection (f)(7)(h), establishing that \u201c[t]he sworn statement of the police officer ... shall be prima facie evidence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>test refusal or a test resulting in an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing,\u201d to discern more accurately the legislative intent. When the two subsections are considered in tandem, the MVA suggests, it becomes clear that the Legislature intended a certified test result to be presumptive proof of a 0.10 BAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The MVA continues that the design of the \u00a7 16-205.1 administrative process reflects the Legislature\u2019s intent to sanction drunk drivers based on test results. The purpose of the administrative per se provisions were to create an administrative system that would take \u201cswift and certain action against drunk drivers.\u201d Based upon recommendations of the Task Force on Drunk and Drugged Driving (\u201cTask Force\u201d), the Legislature rewrote \u00a7 16-205.1 in 1989 to create a new administrative system governing suspension of drivers licenses. <em>See </em>House Bill 556, 1989 Md. Laws ch. 284, \u00a7 1. One of the Task Force\u2019s recommendations was to create an \u201cadministrative per se law\u201d providing for the prompt suspension of a driver\u2019s license belonging to a drunk driving suspect who \u201c[s]ubmitted to the BAC test, and the results exceeded a statutorily defined limit.\u201d <em>MVA v. Shrader, </em>324 Md. 454, 460, 597 A.2d 939, 941-42 (1991). One of the purposes of the new statute, as declared in an amendment to the preamble of House Bill 556, was \u201cestablishing <em>certain sanctions for certain test results.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The statute was amended to create mandatory sanctions imposed \u201cwhen the driver takes a test to determine alcohol concentration and fails the test.\u201d <em>Embrey v. MVA, </em>339 Md. 691, 698, 664 A.2d 911, 914 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The MVA also finds significant the Legislature\u2019s failure to incorporate proposed amendments that would have allowed drunk driving suspects to conduct a mini-trial at their administrative hearings. The Legislature refused to adopt amendments which would have allowed a driver to compel attendance of the police officer or test technician at the hearings and, instead, retained the nature of an administrative per se hearing as one where \u201ca sworn statement is prima facie evidence of a violation of \u00a7 16-205.1.\u201d The MVA asserts that the Legislature, in the formulation of the regulatory scheme, must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>accounted for the accepted scientific range of accuracy of the approved breath testing instruments as the Legislature \u201cis presumed to have had, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute and the prior law.\u201d <em>City of Baltimore v. Hackley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283-84, 477 A.2d 1174, 1177 (1984). The MVA also suggests that the Task Force heard testimony on the accuracy of breath testing machines such that it naturally follows that the Legislature was \u201cwell versed\u201d in the accuracy of breath test machines when it nonetheless created the administrative per se law.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">As noted <em>supra, </em>Lytle did not submit any evidence before the OAH to controvert the MVA\u2019s certified test results, choosing instead to challenge the statutory procedure for calculating a certified test result. By relying on the Toxicologist\u2019s Regulations, so the MVA\u2019s argument goes, both Lytle and the ALJ acted improperly because there is no \u201cstatute that authorizes the toxicologist to establish evidentiary presumptions or to allocate the burdens of production and persuasion at an MVA suspension hearing.\u201d <em>Borbon v. MVA, </em>345 Md. 267, 275, 691 A.2d 1328, 1332 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Not only was it improper to rely on the Toxicologist\u2019s Regulations as a source of authority, the ALJ misapplied those regulations. The MVA contends that the regulations do not support reducing Lytle\u2019s test result by 0.10. The toxicologist already had taken into account the general scientific accuracy of the test in his reporting protocol by, first, taking the lowest of two or three readings as the \u201ctest result;\u201d and, second, reporting the lowest test result only after it is rounded down to the second decimal place. Thus, the standards contained in the Toxicologist\u2019s Regulations support the accuracy of the Intox EC/IR test instrument and therefore do not provide a basis for impeaching Lytle\u2019s test results. The MVA concludes, therefore, that the ALJ misinterpreted the accepted scientific standards to reach his result and acted outside the scope of his authority by disregarding the statutory prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Lytle, in addition to maintaining his earlier arguments, contends that the MVA\u2019s appellate arguments were waived and are not properly before this Court because they were not raised at the administrative hearing. Lytle argues that because the MVA appeared at the administrative hearing only through its paper test results and did not present any arguments, the arguments the MVA now makes before this Court are waived based on our decision in <em>Brodie v. MVA, </em>367 Md. 1, 785 A.2d 747 (2001) (stating that \u201cin an action for judicial review of an agency\u2019s decision, ordinarily, a reviewing court may not pass upon issues presented to it for the first time on judicial review and that are not encompassed in the final decision of the administrative agency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">If the merits need to be reached, the decision of the ALJ, as Lytle sees it, is presumptively valid and must be reviewed in a light favorable to him. <em>See Mehrling v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>871 Md. 40, 65, 806 A.2d 662, 677 (2002); <em>Young v. Anne Arundel County, </em>146 Md.App. 526, 568-69, 807 A.2d 651,(2002). As to the language of the statute, he contends that it focuses on alcohol content and not test results. Lytle suggests that if \u00a7 16-205.1 permits him to challenge the \u201calcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing,\u201d acceptance of the MVA\u2019s contention that the Legislature intended reliance solely on the \u201ccertified test results\u201d would \u201cameliorate\u201d this right. Such an interpretation of the competing clauses would render one of them \u201csuperfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d In order to \u201charmonize\u201d the relevant provisions of the statute, he urges that it must be interpreted as favoring alcohol concentration and not test results. Referring to portions of the Floor Report, Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, House Bill 556 (1989), stating that the proposed administrative per se law requires imposition of sanctions when \u201cthe person takes the test and has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 or greater,\u201d Lytle interprets that to mean that the Legislature intended the statute to be an \u201calcohol content\u201d statute. Further supporting his interpretation, Lytle points to a statement from the preamble of Senate Bill 108 and House Bill 3 of the 2001 Session of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Maryland General Assembly (2001 Md. Laws ch. 4 &amp; 5) which lowered the alcohol concentration threshold to 0.08: \u201cFor the purpose of ... reducing the level of alcohol concentration for a certain administrative offense that results in the suspension of a driver\u2019s license under certain circumstances.\u201d On the basis of this, Lytle concludes that the amended statute is an alcohol content statute and states that \u201cit strains the imagination to believe that in 1989 the legislature intended for \u2018test results\u2019 to be the standard, and then in 2001, without discussion, it changed its mind and made \u2018alcohol concentration\u2019 the standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Lytle claims case law support from other jurisdictions. In addition to the Alaska case discussed <em>supra, </em>he finds succor from Nebraska, <em>Nebraska v. Bjornsen, </em>201 Neb. 709, 271 N.W.2d 839 (1978); Washington, <em>Washington v. Keller, </em>36 Wash.App. 110, 672 P.2d 412 (1983); Ohio, <em>Ohio v. Prestier, </em>7 Ohio Misc.2d 36, 455 N.E.2d 24 (1982); and Hawaii, <em>Hawaii v. Boehmer, </em>1 Haw.App. 44, 613 P.2d 916 (1980). These cases, he contends, require the application of the scientific margin of error to test results produced by breathalyzer instruments, absent statutory direction to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Finally, Lytle observes that he has a property right in his driving privilege that may not be suspended without the protections of due process. He argues that the second of three factors applicable to administrative procedural due process analysis under <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, 33 (1976), \u201cthe risk of erroneous deprivation of such [property] interest through the procedure used,\u201d is violated, and consequently he is deprived of his property right, when the results of the Intox EC/IR test are used without taking into account the 0.01 margin of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In its Reply Brief, the MVA argued that Lytle is incorrect to assert that failure to apply the margin of error test is a violation of his due process rights. Procedural due process requires \u201conly that a licensee be informed of the evidence on which the agency is relying and be given a chance to rebut such evidence.\u201d <em>Plumer v. Maryland, </em>915 F.2d 927, 931 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Cir.1990). The use of a certified test result does not deny Lytle a meaningful hearing in the constitutional sense because he had the opportunity to testify and otherwise attempt to rebut the test result at his administrative hearing. The MVA asserts that this Court, in <em>Moon v. State, </em>300 Md. 354, 478 A.2d 695 (1984), condoned the Legislature\u2019s declaration that breath test results are reliable evidence and therefore the suspension of driver\u2019s licenses based upon certified test results satisfies the constitutional requirement that the statutory scheme be free from unwarranted risk of an erroneous outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In reply to Lytle\u2019s waiver argument, the MVA asserts that its right to judicial review is preserved because it is a party aggrieved by the AL J\u2019s decision. The errors of law urged by the MVA for appellate review are \u201cexpressly \u2018encompassed in the final decision\u2019 of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Brodie, </em>367 Md. at 4, 785 A.2d at 749. It was appropriate for the MVA to appear at the hearing on its paper submission because hearings under \u00a7 16-205.1 were intended by the Legislature to be \u201cinformal and summary in nature,\u201d <em>MVA v. Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 377, 739 A.2d 58, 70 (1999), and \u201cpermit the MVA\u2019s case to be made in most instances from a documentary record.\u201d <em>Borbon, </em>345 Md. at 283, 691 A.2d at 1336. The MVA submitted a prima facie case to the ALJ when it submitted the certifications of the police officer and the test operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Lytle is incorrect in his assertion that the MVA is not entitled to have this Court consider its arguments. The State APA, \u00a7 10-222(a)(1), provides that \u201ca party who is aggrieved by the final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review of the decision.\u201d Section 10-222(f)(1) provides that \u201cjudicial review of disputed issues of fact shall be confined to the record.\u201d The dispute in this case is purely one of law. The MVA asks us to determine whether a certified, unrebutted 0.10 test result from a chemical breath test for alcohol is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>sufficient evidence of an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more mandating a driver\u2019s license suspension under the administrative per se provisions of \u00a7 16-205.1. Our conclusion will be reached by determining the legislative intent and interpreting the relevant statutory provisions. The grounds relied on by the agency are identical to the issues the MVA raises here. The ALJ determined that the statute required consideration of the margin of error because the statute is a \u201calcohol content\u201d statute and the MVA argues before us that the statute does not require consideration of the margin of error because it is a \u201ctest result\u201d statute. The MVA\u2019s arguments are properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">A court reviewing a decision of an administrative agency<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> generally is limited to determining whether there was substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings of fact and whether the agency\u2019s conclusions of law were correct. <em>MVA v. Atterbeary, </em>368 Md. 480, 490-91, 796 A.2d 75, 81-82 (2002). To determine whether an agency\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence the reviewing court must exercise deference towards an agency\u2019s fact-finding and determine only \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 68, 729 A.2d 376, 380 (1999) (quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978)). We further noted that \u201c[e]ven with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency,\u201d and \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d at 381. The issue in the present matter, the interpretation of \u00a7 16-205.1, presents a pure question of law. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), State Gov\u2019t Article, \u00a7 10-222(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The result in this case turns on the intent of the Legislature. Our analysis begins with the language of the statute as the primary source of legislative intent. When the language is clearly consistent with the apparent purpose of the statute and the result is not absurd, we have held that no further inquiry into legislative intent is required. <em>See Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 301, 783 A.2d 667, 670 (2001); <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 417, 722 A.2d 887, 895 (1999). Beyond plain meaning, the purpose of the statute may be ascertained by examining the Legislature\u2019s statement of a statute\u2019s purposes, and courts may consider other \u201cexternal manifestations\u201d or \u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d indicating the legislative intent. <em>State v. Jones, </em>340 Md. 235, 262, 666 A.2d 128, 141 (1995); <em>Eldridge v. State, </em>329 Md. 307, 312, 619 A.2d 531, 534 (1993). The language of a statute cannot be divorced from its context. <em>Atkinson v. State, </em>331 Md. 199, 212, 627 A.2d 1019, 1025 (1993). As we stated in <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987), even where the language of the statute is plain, its meaning is controlled by its context. In short, the statutory language must be construed in light of and governed by its context within the overall statutory scheme. <em>In re Keith G., </em>325 Md. 538, 542, 601 A.2d 1107, 1109 (1992). An appellate court may consider evidence such as a bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments that occurred as it passed through the Legislature, and its relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s goal in enacting the statute. <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Lytle argues that the language of \u00a7 16-205.1 is ambiguous and that recourse to the legislative history reveals that the statute was intended to be an \u201calcohol content\u201d statute, rather than a \u201ctest result\u201d statute. He supports his argument primarily on the basis that if the statute were construed that \u201ctest results\u201d triggered sanctions under \u00a7 16-205.1, it would render the language of \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i)(5) \u201csuperfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d Lytle also uses portions of the Floor Report regarding H.B. 556 of 1989 to support his argument, in particular a passage stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">[t]his bill adopts an \u2018administrative per se\u2019 law requiring the suspension of an individual\u2019s driver\u2019s license if the person is detained by police for driving or attempting to drive while intoxicated ... and the person: (1) refuses to take the test ...; or (2) the person takes the test and has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 or greater.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Lytle\u2019s reliance on the Floor Report is misplaced. The excerpt he relies on does not state that a person\u2019s license will be suspended based on his alcohol content; rather it provides that suspension will occur on the basis of a test result indicating a certain level of BAC. The emphasis is on the BAC, but only as measured by the test instrument. Lytle\u2019s fixation on the language contained in \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(T)(i)(5), \u201c[w]hether the person drove or attempted to drive a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing,\u201d focuses on a discrete portion while ignoring its overall context. The phrase \u201cat the time of testing\u201d would be surplusage if alcohol content was determinative. If alcohol content was determinative, the statute would use the words \u201calcohol content,\u201d instead of \u201calcohol concentration.\u201d Blood alcohol concentration is a specific term of measurement and use of that term refers to test results rather than the alcohol content of the person\u2019s blood stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Our examination of the pertinent statutory language, its place in the statutory scheme, and even the relevant legislative history reveals a result opposite that reached by Lytle. Lytle\u2019s argument is based on snippets of language shorn from their contextual roots. It is clear that the Legislature intend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>ed to create an administrative per se law imposing \u201ccertain sanctions for certain test results.\u201d The stated purpose of the statute and the deliberate crafting of the regulatory scheme indicate that the statute was intended to create expedient procedures that swiftly would impose penalties for drunk driving irrespective of any parallel potential criminal processes or penalties. To this end, Petitioner correctly observes that the Legislature created an administrative system that focused on test results as a basis for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The administrative procedures promulgated by the MVA pursuant to \u00a7 12-104(b) emphasize the purposes of the overall statutory scheme that includes \u00a7 16-205.1. The Code of Maryland Regulations establishes extensive procedures for checking the accuracy of the test instruments employed to implement \u00a7 16-205.1. The administrative procedures and instrument maintenance guidelines further demonstrate the intent that the swift and certain action taken be predicated on test results. Sections 16-205.1(f)(7)(i) and (ii) are self-evident of this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">(7)(i) At a hearing under this section, the person has the rights described in \u00a7 12-206 of this article, <em>but at the hearing the only issues shall be:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">1. Whether the police officer who stops or detains a person had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or attempting to drive while intoxicated, while under the influence of alcohol, while so far under the influence of any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">2. Whether there was evidence of the use by the person of alcohol, any drug, any combination of drugs, a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol, or a controlled dangerous substance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">3. Whether the police officer requested a test after the person was fully advised of the administrative sanctions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>shall be imposed, including the fact that a person who refuses to take the test is ineligible for modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive license under subsection (n)(l) and (2) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">4. Whether the person refused to take the test;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">5. Whether the person drove or attempted to drive a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">6. If the hearing involves disqualification of a commercial driver\u2019s license, whether the person was operating a commercial motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">(ii) The sworn statement of the police officer and of the test technician or analyst shall be prima facie evidence of a test refusal or a test resulting in an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">The statute further permits a sworn statement of the police officer attesting to the BAC level, as measured by an approved test instrument, to stand as prima facie evidence of the indicated BAC. \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(ii). The MVA imposes sanctions for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or higher and for persons refusing to take the test. <em>See </em>COMAR 11.11.03.01 (stating that the administrative procedures established in that chapter govern sanctions imposed on drivers \u201cwho have'refused a properly requested test or who have submitted to a test which showed a 0.10 or more alcohol concentration\u201d). Actual blood alcohol content cannot be the basis for sanctions when an unwillingness to take the test triggers sanctions. Section 16-205.1(b)(i)(2) provides that for a first offense test refusal the MVA will suspend the driver\u2019s license for 120 days, and the MVA will impose a sanction of suspension for one year for a second offense test refusal. The administrative penalties for refusing to take the test are more severe than those imposed for test results indicating a BAC that exceeds the legal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">The language throughout the statutory scheme consistently frames the measurement of alcohol content in terms of the certified test result. The repetition of the phrase \u201cwhile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>having an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing,\u201d when describing the offense, suggests that the result as determined by the test is the determinative element of the offense. No importance is given any other means of calculating alcohol content outside the final test instrument measurements of alcohol concentration. The Legislature chose a means for rendering an accurate reading of alcohol content and then drafted a statute creating procedures for taking the readings and imposing penalties based upon those readings. The provisions in the COMAR establishing the reliability of test results produced by the enumerated breathalyzer instruments further support the view that the test results are intended for administrative adjudication purposes to be an accurate measure of blood alcohol content, unless evidence is adduced that the specific machine employed in the specific driver\u2019s test was malfunctioning or the testing officer failed to follow the prescribed testing procedures in some meaningful way. Further, the procedures outlined in the Toxicologist\u2019s Regulations were designed to ensure the reliability of the test instruments and, subsequently, the reliability of the test results. Actual alcohol content is not at issue in an administrative hearing pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1 because precautions have been taken by the Legislature to ensure that the testing process is fair to the tested person and to ensure that the most accurate result possible is rendered by the testing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The ALJ incorrectly determined that the language of \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(1), \u201cor was tested and the result indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more,\u201d and the language of \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(T)(i)(5), \u201c[wjhether the person drove or attempted to drive a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing,\u201d indicated that the Legislature intended to create an \u201calcohol content\u201d statute. The ALJ\u2019s conclusions would be more justified if the statute omitted all language referring to testing and \u201cthe time of testing,\u201d and instead expressed the offense and the issue to be adjudicated at the hearing exclusively in terms of blood alcohol content. It is a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>that the words of the statute are to be read so as not to create surplusage. The ALJ\u2019s interpretation of the statute, however, creates surplusage. To read the statutory language as basing sanctions on alcohol content rather than test results creates conflict between the intent of the statute and the provisions limiting the issues to be heard at the administrative hearing. If the intent of the statute is to impose sanctions based on actual alcohol content then the issues to be heard at the administrative hearings would include evidence of alcohol content other than the test results. The statutory scheme does not require the MVA to produce any evidence of intoxication other -than the certified test results in order to make a prima facie case. It is, therefore, logical to conclude this is so because the statute intended sanctions be imposed based on test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Although the statute is plain and unambiguous when viewed as part of its overall statutory scheme, the legislative history also validates that it is a \u201ctest result\u201d driven statute. The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee explained in its Floor Report regarding House Bill 556 of 1989 that the administrative per se law was written to provide, in cases of drunk driving, \u201ca swift penalty which is separate from any criminal penalties that may be imposed for the driving offenses.\u201d Floor Report, Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, House Bill 556, at 2 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">That the statute would be a \u201ctest result\u201d statute is logical given the additional time and fiscal resources that would be required if an individual was permitted to challenge not only the alcohol concentration as evidenced by the test results, but otherwise could litigate the \u201cactual\u201d alcohol content of the person\u2019s blood stream at the time of the driving offense. A statement from the Governor\u2019s Legislative Office regarding proposed House Bill 556 stated that the bill would have the effect of \u201celiminating long delays through the criminal court process due to continuances, jury prayers, plea bargaining, and diversion programs before the offender encounters any appropriate sanctioning of his behavior. Individuals receiving a PBJ would not escape Administrative review of their fitness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>to continue to operate on the highways.\u201d The statement further asserted that \u201c[tjhis bill would ensure immediate and certain sanctions by the Administration,\u201d and \u201cspeedy Administrative sanctions would help the offender to recognize the cause and effect relationship between the offense and the sanction which would otherwise be weakened by lengthy delays in the court processes.\u201d Governor\u2019s Legislative Office, \u201cPositive Aspects of Administrative Per Se,\u201d House Bill 556 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">A letter from the Lieutenant Governor to the Chairman of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee and the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee expressed the following concerns about proposed House Bill 556:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">In Amendment No. 13 of House Bill 556, the sworn statement submitted by an arresting officer and test technician would not be admissible if the officers were summoned to appear at the administrative hearing. The Administration is concerned that the wording of this Amendment would encourage every licensee to summon a police officer and technician as a tactical maneuver to bar the sworn statement from being admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">This could result in the required appearance of virtually every arresting officer and test technician in more than 26,800 hearings (based on 1988 arrest statistics). The cost to police agencies would be overwhelming. An estimated 174,000 man hours would be required for police officers at administrative hearings and the cost in overtime hours would exceed $4 million.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">The provisions of House Bill 556, as amended, would cause serious problems in the scheduling of police officers to provide at least a minimum level of police protection to the public. In those areas of the State where police staffing is already at critically low levels, the wholesale summonsing of the officers could practically eliminate police protection. The cost in overtime to overcome the loss of manpower would also create an unreasonable burden for all of Maryland\u2019s police agencies. The projected degree of fiscal im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>pact would overwhelm th\u00e9 already high overtime expenditures that police are forced to utilize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">Under the current amendments, Maryland\u2019s law enforcement community would have neither the funds nor the personnel to adequately enforce the provisions of this bill. These projections, if they occur, might negate completely any possible benefit to highway safety that this bill was intended to make.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">I understand that discussions have occurred with Chairman Horne and Administration officials and that there has been agreement that the language from page 11, line 36 to page 12, line 5 of House Bill 556 be amended to read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">(II) 1.

Baker, Chairman, Senate Judicial Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ceedings Committee, and Delegate William S. Horne, Chairman, House Judiciary Committee, at 2-3 (30 March 1989). These extracts from the bill file for House Bill 556 attest to the Legislature\u2019s intent to create procedures that would be an expedient and effective deterrent and sanction against drunk driving. They explicitly indicate an intent to limit the issues considered at resultant administrative hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">A key component of the \u201cswift and effective\u201d procedures created by the bill was the prima facie status given the test results indicating blood alcohol concentration. The test results were intended to be the basis for sanctions, assailable only on the basis of specific test instrument defects or meaningful test-giver error at the time of testing. The preamble to House Bill 556 enumerates the purposes of the Bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">For the purpose of altering the administrative sanctions for driving or attempting to drive under certain conditions involving alcohol; altering provisions relating to the implied consent to take certain tests; altering the penalties for refusing to take a test for alcohol and <em>establishing certain sanctions for certain test results.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">(Emphasis added.) The Department of Fiscal Services\u2019 Summary of Legislation described the legislation as \u201c[a]lter[ing] the length of time a driver\u2019s license is suspended for a test result indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more at the time of testing,\u201d and \u201c[e]stablish[ing] a new procedure for a police officer to follow in the event a person refuses to take the test for alcohol or <em>takes a test for alcohol which results in an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more.\u201d </em>Department of Fiscal Services, Revised Fiscal Note to House Bill 556, at 1 (1989) (emphasis added). The purpose was to establish the test results as the basis for sanctions, hence the administrative hearings, when requested, were to be as brief and expedient as due process permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Lytle places great weight on the <em>Haynes </em>case decided by the Supreme Court of Alaska. The court decided in <em>Haynes, </em>in the <em>absence </em>of legislative history, that, a statute providing that \u201ca person commits the crime of driving while intoxicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>(DWI) if a breath analysis reveals that the person\u2019s breath sample contains 0.10 grams or more of alcohol per 210 liters of the person\u2019s breath,\u201d required the 0.01 margin of error to be applied to the test result in favor of the person taking the test. 865 P.2d at 754. The Supreme Court of Alaska reasoned that because the Alaska Legislature delegated authority to the Department of Public Safety to approve satisfactory techniques and methods of performing breath analysis of suspected drunk drivers, instead of taking it upon itself to select and approve the use of the Intoximeter 8000, the test instrument used to measure Haynes\u2019 BAC, there was no indication that the Legislature considered the 0.01 margin of error in crafting the statute. 865 P.2d at 755-56. The Alaska Supreme Court interpreted the statute to be an \u201calcohol content\u201d statute and held that, \u201c[a]bsent express legislative intent to the contrary, we hold that failure to apply the inherent margin of error of a particular testing device in favor of the person subject to license revocation violates due process of law as guaranteed by the Alaska Constitution.\u201d 865 P.2d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Two of the five members of the Alaska Supreme Court that decided <em>Haynes </em>dissented. The dissent rested on the basis that the statute was not ambiguous and should have been interpreted on its face by the majority: \u201cI do not believe that it is right to say that a statute does not mean what it appears to mean because there is no legislative history indicating that the apparent plain meaning of the statute is the actual meaning. That is what today\u2019s opinion does.\u201d 865 P.2d at 757 (Matthews, J., dissenting). The dissent found it significant that the \u201cdiscount approach\u201d to test results adopted by the majority was not used by any other jurisdiction at that time. <em>Id. </em>The statute challenged in <em>Haynes </em>limited the issues to be considered at the hearing: \u201c[t]he hearing under this section shall be limited to the issues of whether the arresting officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person was driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated and whether (2) the chemical test ... produced a result described in AS 28.35.030(a)(2).\u201d The dissent queried \u201cone must ask why a legislature would enact a statutory scheme in which actual levels of alcohol are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>critical and then preclude the state from employing non-test evidence which tends to prove that such levels exceeded legal limits in particular cases?\u201d 865 P.2d at 759. In response to its own hypothetical question, the dissent stated that the majority\u2019s analysis was flawed because \u201cthe legislature probably intended that the critical element for license revocation was merely a failing test result.\u201d 865 P.2d at 760. The dissent further found fault with the majority\u2019s due process argument, stating \u201c[gjiven my conclusion that a failing test result alone is the critical element in license revocation cases and that a driver\u2019s actual alcohol level is irrelevant,\u201d the conclusion that \u201cit is a violation of due process not to consider a testing device\u2019s inherent margin for error is plainly wrong.\u201d 865 P.2d at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Shortly after the Supreme Court of Alaska decided <em>Haynes, </em>the Alaska Legislature amended the statute to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFh\">Except for an offense under AS 28.35.280, if an offense described under this title requires that a chemical test of a person\u2019s breath produce a particular result, and the chemical test is administered by a properly calibrated instrument approved by the Department of Public Safety, the result described by statute is not affected by the instrument\u2019s working tolerance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Alaska Stat. \u00a7 28.40.060 (1996). <em>See Mangiapane v. Municipality of Anchorage, </em>974 P.2d 427 (Alaska Ct.App.1999). The purpose and effect of AS 28.40.060 was to indicate that Legislature\u2019s unequivocal decision that \u201ca .01 percent working tolerance was \u2018tolerably inaccurate,\u2019 and therefore, irrelevant to the driver\u2019s guilt under [the statute], and not in violation of state or federal due process rights.\u201d Alaska Stat. \u00a7 28.40.060 note (1996). <em>See Bushnell v. Alaska, </em>5 P.3d 889 (Alaska Ct.App.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Lytle also cites to cases from Nebraska, Ohio, Hawaii, and Washington that applied the margin of error to breathalyzer test results. <em>See Nebraska v. Bjornsen, </em>201 Neb. 709, 271 N.W.2d 839 (1978); <em>Washington v. Keller, </em>36 Wash.App. 110, 672 P.2d 412 (1983); <em>Ohio v. Prestier, </em>7 Ohio Misc.2d 36, 455 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>N.E.2d 24 (1982); <em>Hawaii v. Boehmer, </em>1 Haw.App. 44, 613 P.2d 916 (1980). None of these decisions, however, actually fuel Lytle\u2019s jurisprudential engine. The Nebraska decision relied on by Lytle was overruled by <em>Nebraska v. Babcock, </em>227 Neb. 649, 419 N.W.2d 527 (1988). Lytle mischaracterizes the position of the Hawaii courts. Lytle employs the <em>Boehmer </em>case to suggest that Hawaii law mandates giving the benefit of the margin of error to the defendant in a drunk driving case. In truth, the Supreme Court of Hawaii found that the error of margin is a relevant factor that may be considered at an administrative hearing, but it is only one factor to be weighed in determining whether it is \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that the driver\u2019s BAC level was above the legal threshold. <em>Lara v. Tanaka, </em>83 Hawai'i 24, 924 P.2d 192, 195 (1996). The Supreme Court of Hawaii held in <em>Lara </em>that, when the margin of error as applied to a BAC reading yielded a test result between the range of 0.097 and 0.117, the \u201chearing officer could conclude by a preponderance of the evidence in this case, including the margin of error, that it was more probable than not that Respondent \u2018had a blood alcohol content of .10% or more.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">A decision rendered by the Ohio Court of Appeals subsequent to the case cited and relied upon by Lytle, <em>Ohio v. Prestier, </em>7 Ohio Misc.2d 36, 455 N.E.2d 24 (1982), held that the margin of error alone does not determine the accuracy of a driver\u2019s breath test. <em>Ohio v. Graham, </em>1996 WL 612472, 1996 Ohio App. Lexis 4669. The Washington case Lytle cited, <em>Washington v. Keller, </em>36 Wash.App. 110, 672 P.2d 412, 414 (1983), also does not support directly Lytle\u2019s proposition. In that case, the Court of Appeals of Washington held that the reputed margin of error in the breathalyzer was only one factor for the trier of fact to consider when determining whether the State met its burden of proving that the BAC indicated by the breathalyzer test was correct, and the test result alone is not conclusive proof of actual blood alcohol content. 672 P.2d at 413-14. Lytle is misguided to rely on the foregoing cases from other jurisdictions to support the proposition that the margin of error must be considered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>calculate an accurate BAG level and to further support the argument that Maryland\u2019s statute should be read as an \u201calcohol content\u201d statute instead of a \u201ctest result\u201d statute. The cases he lauds as favoring his reading of the statute at best support including the margin of error as but one factor for the administrative trier of fact to consider when making a determination of a person\u2019s BAC. They do not hold that the margin of error <em>must </em>be applied in <em>all </em>cases in favor of the person tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Lytle argues that a person has a property interest in his or her driver\u2019s license, <em>Dep't of Transp. v. Armacost, </em>299 Md. 392, 474 A.2d 191 (1984), and therefore due process requirements apply to administrative proceedings affecting that property interest. Lytle reasons that the second of three factors set out by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, 33 (1976), \u201cthe risk of an erroneous deprivation of such [property] interest through the procedure used,\u201d when applied to his case, makes \u201cclear that simply using the result of the Intox EC/IR breath test would create the risk of an erroneous deprivation of [his] property interest.\u201d If applied, the margin of error would have resulted in an actual blood alcohol concentration as low as 0.09, and Lytle would not have been \u201cper se intoxicated\u201d by law. Therefore, as his theory goes, any adverse action taken by the MVA to deprive him of his driver\u2019s license property right was violative of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Lytle\u2019s argument has no merit. The due process clause functions to \u201cprotect interests in life, liberty and property from deprivation or infringement by government without appropriate procedural safeguards.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Anne Arundel County Police, </em>369 Md. 108, 141-42, 797 A.2d 770, 790-91 (2002) (citing <em>Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 332, 96 S.Ct. at 901, 47 L.Ed.2d at 18). To establish a violation of due process, the aggrieved party must show that state action resulted in a deprivation of a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. If a property interest is established then the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>must determine what procedures are required constitutionally before an individual may be so deprived. The procedures required are determined by balancing the individual and governmental interests affected by the property deprivation. <em>Armacost, </em>299 Md. at 416, 474 A.2d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We have recognized that a driver\u2019s license is a property interest protected by both the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Art. 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. 299 Md. at 418, 474 A.2d at 204. We also have stated that interpretations of federal procedural due process provisions by the Supreme Court are persuasive in our interpretation of Article 24. 299 Md. at 416, 474 A.2d at 203. The elements a court should take into consideration in balancing the private interest against the governmental interest were outlined by the <em>Mathews </em>court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\"><em>Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 334-35, 96 S.Ct. at 903, 47 L.Ed.2d at 33. In a case challenging the procedures provided by Maryland\u2019s Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program for appealing an adverse inspection result, or a revocation or non-renewal of registration, we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">The second <em>Mathews </em>consideration is addressed to the risk of an erroneous determination under the procedures provided and the benefits to be gained from the substitution of alternative procedures. Where, as here, suspension decisions are largely automatic as based upon scientifically accepted objective criteria, and prompt post-suspension judicial review is available, the likelihood of erroneous administrative determinations is minimal. <em>See [Dixon v.] Love, supra, </em>431 U.S. [105] at 113-14, 97 S.Ct. [1723] at 1727-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>1728[, 52 L.Ed.2d 172]. Consequently, little is to be gained from provision of additional procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\"><em>Armacost, </em>299 Md. at 419, 474 A.2d at 204-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Lytle insists that due process is offended unless the 0.01 margin of error is factored into the calculation of a tested person\u2019s BAC before the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license is suspended. Essential to Lytle\u2019s argument is that the existing procedures for measuring blood alcohol content are inadequate and likely to result in the erroneous suspension of a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Interpreting the statute as an \u201calcohol content\u201d statute requiring the margin of error to be factored into the final BAC reading would impose significant additional administrative and fiscal burdens upon the State. Actual alcohol content would be subject to determination at the administrative hearing and the State would be required to expend more time and resources proving the subject\u2019s BAC. Additionally, the statute would lose its per se quality and sacrifice its intended swift and expedient nature. The requirements that the test instruments be maintained and tested regularly and that the test administrator take the lowest of two or three readings rounded down to the second decimal place to arrive at the official \u201ctest result\u201d as promulgated in the COMAR are intended to ensure the scientific accuracy of the certified test result used as evidence at the administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Our statement in <em>Armaeost </em>is equally true when applied to the present matter. The statutory scheme makes suspension decisions relatively automatic, predicated upon \u201cscientifically accepted objective criteria,\u201d and prompt post-suspension review is guaranteed by the provision of an administrative hearing. The suggested additional procedure would result in a burden on the State disproportionate to the benefits to the individual. The government has a significant interest in deterring drunk driving and in removing drunk drivers from the roads. Summary suspension of driver\u2019s licenses based on reliable test results exceeding the designated acceptable limit as measured by approved breath test instruments acts as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>deterrent and promptly removes the drunk driver from the roads. Lytle\u2019s due process argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE DECISION OF THE MARYLAND OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS AND ORDER A NEW HEARING CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">This is a duplicate of the Regulations of the Toxicologist, Post Mortem Examiners Commission, State of Maryland, Regarding Tests of Breath and Blood for Alcohol adopted October 1, \u20221995, as amended October 1, 1999.

Definition of \u201cpercent by weight\u201d in alcohol tests</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ang\">Section 10-307 of the Articles of Courts and Judicial Proceedings (Chemical Tests for Intoxication-Results of Analysis and Presumptions) states that the results of chemical tests for intoxication be expressed as \u201cpercent by weight\u201d of alcohol in the subject\u2019s blood as determined by an analysis of breath or blood. \u201cPercent by weight\u201d without any qualification is inexact. An exact scientific term would be either \u201cpercent, weight by volume\u201d or \u201cpercent, weight by weight\u201d. In regard to chemical tests of breath or blood for alcohol in the State of Maryland, \u201cpercent by weight\u201d is defined as \u201cpercent, weight by volume\u201d. This is further explained to be the weight of alcohol in grams contained in 100 milliliters (cubic centimeters) or blood. This method of reporting conforms to the Uniform Vehicle Code adopted by the American Medical Association to serve as a model for all states.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">The breath testing devices are scientific instruments which determine the concentration of alcohol in a person\u2019s blood expressed as \u201cpercent by weight\u201d (grams per 100 milliliters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>of blood). It does this by analyzing a specific volume of expired breath. The weight of alcohol in the breath sample is determined and the quantity of the alcohol converted to its equivalent value in blood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">B. Radio Frequency Interference</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">A statistical study of the results of over 18,000 Validation Tests conducted on approximately 100 Breathalyzer Instruments (Model 800, 900 and 900A) during January 1, 1982 through September 30, 1982 indicates that common radio frequencies do not interfere with tests properly conducted in accordance with these Regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">C.
