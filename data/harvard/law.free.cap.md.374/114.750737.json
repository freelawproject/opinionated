After each teller complied, Coles left the bank with the money. Based on this conduct, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, sitting without a jury, convicted him of three counts of robbery. Coles challenges the robbery convictions on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he stole the money by instilling fear in the tellers. Because a rational fact finder could conclude, under the circumstances of this case, that there was sufficient evidence to satisfy the intimidation or \u201cputting in fear\u201d element of robbery, we shall affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">On Saturday, January 23, 1999, at about 10:00 a.m., Coles, wearing a baseball hat, a jacket or bulky shirt, and a scarf around his neck, entered the Dundalk branch of First National Bank of Maryland (hereinafter \u201cFirst National\u201d), approached teller Anna Estes, and gave her a bag and a note that she recalled as stating, \u201c|P]ut some money in the bag.\u201d The note also ordered her \u201cnot to hit an alarm, not to let anybody know,\u201d and to return the note. Ms. Estes, who had thirty years of experience as a teller, \u201ctried to talk him out of it\u201d and \u201ctook [her] elbow and pushed the note to the floor.\u201d Ms. Estes then placed $120, comprised of six twenty-dollar bills, into the bag, closed it, and handed it to Coles. Coles opened the bag, looked inside, and said, \u201cWhere\u2019s the note?\u201d Ms Estes responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d whereupon Coles \u201clooked at [her],\u201d and warned, \u201cWell, you better find it.\u201d Ms. Estes complied. The incident with Coles made Ms. Estes \u201ca little nervous\u201d and concerned \u201cbecause there were other people in the bank\u201d and because \u201cyou never know what could happen\u201d in such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">On Saturday, November 25, 2000, at approximately 10:00 a.m., Coles walked into the same branch of the bank, the name of which had changed from First National to Allfirst. Coles approached teller Janice Hall, who \u201cwelcomed him to Allfirst.\u201d Standing silent, Coles handed her a money market withdrawal form that had not been filled out. Ms. Hall \u201cimmediately felt something was bad.\u201d She turned the form over, and on the back was written, she recalled, \u201cPut the money in the bag, no bait money, and no one will get hurt.\u201d Ms. Hall\u2019s \u201cheart started beating really fast, and [she] got very nervous.\u201d Coles then put a bag on the counter, into which Ms. Hall placed \u201cabout $1,545.\u201d Ms. Hall tried to \u201cpush the note over,\u201d but Coles \u201cput his hand over\u201d and said, \u201cGive me back [the note].\u201d She did so \u201cas quickly as [she] could.\u201d Coles took the bag of money and left the bank. Ms. Hall related that the incident \u201cwas the scariest moment of [her] life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>About two weeks later, on December 9, 2000, Coles entered the same branch of Allfirst bank, walked over to a counter where he picked up some forms, and got in line to speak to a teller, Bernice Swann. Ms. Swann was \u201ca little suspicious about what [Coles] was doing\u201d because Coles was \u201cwriting as he was standing in line.\u201d Ms. Swann\u2019s suspicions were confirmed when Coles handed her a bag and a note, which was written on the back of a retail account transfer form. The note commanded, \u201cPut all the money in the bag no alarms thank you.\u201d Ms. Swann complied by placing $1,070 into the bag, because from her side of the teller counter, \u201cyou can\u2019t see a person,\u201d and she therefore \u201chad no idea what [Coles] had.\u201d Indeed, a photograph from the bank\u2019s security camera entered into evidence shows Coles wearing long pants, a jacket, knit cap, and dark sunglasses. Moreover, there were \u201cother people in the bank, so you comply. You do what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d After Ms. Swann placed the money in the bag, Coles left the bank. During the incident, he never said anything to Ms. Swann and did not ask her to return the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On December 16, 2000, police arrested Coles based upon information provided by his girlfriend that he had been involved in the three bank robberies. He later was charged in a nine-count criminal information filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The first three counts concerned the January 23, 1999 bank incident, charging Coles with robbery and second degree assault<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Anna Estes, and misdemeanor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>theft.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Counts four through six involved the November 25, 2000 bank incident, charging robbery and second degree assault of Janice Hall, and felony theft.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counts seven through nine covered the December 9, 2000 bank incident, charging robbery and second degree assault of Bernice Swann and felony theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">At the conclusion of a pretrial motions hearing on June 6, 2001, Coles waived his right to a jury trial. Thereafter, on June 7, 2001, the Honorable Lawrence R. Daniels of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County heard testimony from the three tellers, and reviewed documentary evidence, including two security camera photographs and the note given to Ms. Swann on December 9, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, Coles moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing, among other things, that the State had failed to prove sufficient facts to meet the intimidation element of robbery. After the Circuit Court denied Coles\u2019s motion, Coles testified that he was the individual who stood \u201cin front of\u2019 the tellers on January 23, 1999, November 25, 2000, and December 9, 2000. Coles maintained, however, that he was physically and mentally abused by his girlfriend and was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>therefore, acting under duress. At the close of his case, Coles renewed his motion <em>for </em>judgment of acquittal, which was denied by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Judge Daniels, in adjudicating Coles\u2019s guilt stated: \u201cHis confession admits that he committed these offenses, and therefore, the Court finds him guilty as charged of the three bank robberies. With regard to the lesser-included offenses of assault and theft, they merge into the robberies for sentencing purposes.\u201d Judge Daniels then sentenced Coles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">[O]n Count 1, the sentence of the Court is ten years to the Department of Corrections, that sentence being imposed under Article 27, Section 643<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> being a minimum mandatory sentence. As to the second robbery count, which is Count 4, the robbery of Janice Hall, the Court imposes a consecutive sentence of ten years to the Department of Corrections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At\">Judge Daniels further declared:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">On the third robbery count which is Count 7, the Court imposes a consecutive sentence of ten years. The Court will suspend nine of those 10 years, so the total time to be served is 21 years. When you get out of jail, you\u2019ll be on five years\u2019 supervised probation, with the other nine years hanging over your head.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Coles appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed in an unreported opinion. We granted certiorari, <em>Coles v. State, </em>370 Md. 268, 805 A.2d 265 (2002), to address the following issues, which we have rephrased:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">I. Whether the evidence in the instant case was sufficient to support Coles\u2019s convictions for three counts of robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">II. Whether the evidence was sufficient to support Cole\u2019s convictions for three counts of second degree assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">III. Whether the Circuit Court failed to pronounce a specific verdict on the counts of second degree assault, misdemeanor theft, and felony theft, and if so, whether that failure required an acquittal on those counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">We hold that under the circumstances of this case, the evidence was sufficient for a fact finder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Coles was guilty of three counts of robbery. In light of our holding, we need not, and do not, address Coles\u2019s second and third contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">The standard for determining whether evidence was sufficient to support a criminal conviction is \u201cwhether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime! ] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Moye v. State, </em>369 Md. 2, 12, 796 A.2d 821, 827 (2002) (citing <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478-79, 649 A.2d 336, 337 (1994)). In applying that standard, we \u201cview the evidence in the light most favor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>able to the prosecution\u201d and give \u201cdue regard to the [fact finder\u2019s] findings of facts, its resolution of conflicting evidence, and, significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 474, 701 A.2d 675, 685 (1997)). We do not, however, \u201cundertake a review of the record that would amount to a retrial of the case.\u201d <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 325, 765 A.2d 97. 362 Md. 275, 765 A.2d 97, 124 (2001). Indeed, our task is not to determine whether we believe that the evidence at trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Pagotto, </em>361 Md. 528, 534, 762 A.2d 97, 100 (2000). Rather, our review is limited to determining whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact\u201d could have made that determination. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">When Coles stole $120 from Ms. Estes at the Dundalk branch of First National Bank on January 23,1999, robbery, a common law crime, had a statutorily prescribed penalty including \u201cimprisonment for not more than 15 years.\u201d Maryland Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 486 (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By the time Coles stole money from Ms. Hall and Ms. Swann at the same branch of Allfirst on November 25, 2000 and December 9, 2000, the Maryland Legislature had codified the crime of robbery by repealing former Section 486 and replacing it with a revised Section 486.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Laws of Maryland 2000, Ch. 288 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u00a7 1. The revised Section 486 retains robbery\u2019s judicially determined meaning, and adds, \u201cobtaining the service of another by force or threat of force.\u201d Md.Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 486 (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The Committee to Revise Article 27,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in the Note annotating Art. 27, \u00a7 486, identified the \u201cjudicially determined meaning\u201d of robbery referred to in that Section as \u201cthe felonious taking and carrying away of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, by violence, or by putting him in fear,\u201d <em>see Darby v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 407, 413, 239 A.2d 584, 588, <em>cert. denied, </em>251 Md. 748 (1968); <em>State v. Gover, </em>267 Md. 602, 606, 298 A.2d 378, 380-81 (1973), and as \u201clarceny from the person, accompanied by violence or putting in fear.\u201d <em>See Tyler v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 158, 162, 245 A.2d 592, 595 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>252 Md. 733 (1969). Finally, the Note observed that \u201c[ujnder the common law, robbery is a specific intent crime that requires intent to permanently deprive the owner of property.\u201d <em>See Gover, </em>267 Md. at 606, 298 A.2d at 381; <em>Hadder v. State, </em>238 Md. 341, 355, 209 A.2d 70, 78 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The hallmark of robbery, which distinguishes it from theft, is the presence of force or threat of force, the latter of which also is referred to as intimidation. <em>Spitzinger v. State, </em>340 Md. 114, 121, 665 A.2d 685, 688 (1995) (\u201cRobbery requires a taking of property of any value whatsoever which is accomplished by violence or putting in fear.\u201d) Former Chief Judge Robert Murphy, writing for the Court in <em>West v. State, </em>explained that the distinction between robbery and theft, based on the presence of force or threat of force, \u201chas ancient origins in the common law.\u201d 312 Md. 197, 203, 539 A.2d 231, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>233 (1988). The distinction was described in William Hawkins\u2019 1724 <em>Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown, </em>in the chapter entitled \u201cOf Robbery\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">Sect. 2, Larceny from the Person of a Man either puts him in Fear, and then it is called Robbery; or does not put him in Fear, and then it is called barely, Larceny from the person. Sect. 3. Robbery is a felonious and violent Taking away from the Person of another, Goods or Money to any Value, putting him in Fear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 203, 539 A.2d at 233. As evidenced by at least one authority, Maryland, as early as 1826, adhered to the ancient common law distinction. John Latrobe, in <em>Justice\u2019s Practice under the Laws of Maryland, </em>published in 1826, stated in Section 1252:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9f\">Open and violent larceny from the person, or <em>robbery, </em>is the felonious and forcible taking from the person of another, of goods or money to any value, by violence, or putting him in fear. The putting in fear distinguishes it from other larcenies. 4 Blac. Comm. 242.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 203, 539 A.2d at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">In 1776 Maryland adopted its first Constitution, which provided in its Declaration of Rights that the \u201cinhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the Common Law of England ... subject, nevertheless, to the revision of, and amendment or repeal by, the Legislature of this State.\u201d This provision remained in all subsequent Constitutions of Maryland. <em>Conklin v. Schillinger, </em>255 Md. 50, 58, 257 A.2d 187, 191 (1969). Adhering to that Constitutional mandate, our decisions have consistently recognized the common law distinction between theft and robbery based on the presence of force or threat of force. <em>See, e.g., Ledvinka v. Home Ins. Co., </em>139 Md. 434, 439, 115 A. 596, 598 (1921)(\u201c \u2018Robbery\u2019 is larceny from the person, accompanied by violence or by putting in fear....\u201d); <em>Lee v. State, </em>238 Md. 224, 208 A.2d 375, 376 (1965)(same); <em>West, </em>312 Md. at 202, 539 A.2d at 233 (defining robbery, in part, as \u201clarceny from the person, accompanied by violence or putting in fear\u201d); <em>Bowman v. State, </em>314 Md. 725, 730, 552 A.2d 1303, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>1304 (1989)(same); <em>Spitzinger, </em>340 Md. at 123 n. 2, 665 A.2d at 689 n. 2 (same); <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 182, 699 A.2d 1170, 1183 (1997)(same). The October 1, 2000 codification of the crime of robbery did not modify the common law meaning of the offense, other than by declaring that: \u201c(1) [A] robbery conviction requires proof of intent to deprive another of property; or (2) Robbery includes obtaining the service of another by force or threat of force.\u201d Md.Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 486(b)(1) and (2)(1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">In <em>West, </em>we addressed \u201cthe degree of violence or putting in fear that is requisite\u201d for a robbery conviction. 312 Md. at 203, 539 A.2d at 234. The victim in that case was leaving a drug store in Baltimore City when \u201ca man just snatched [the victim\u2019s] purse from [her] hand and ... ran.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 539 A.2d at 232. The victim did not notice that her purse was gone until after the snatcher began to run from her. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the evidence was not sufficient to prove that the purse was taken with violence, or that the victim was put in fear. <em>Id. </em>at 207, 539 A.2d at 235. In so doing, we adopted the view that \u201cthe mere snatching or sudden taking away of the property from the person of another does not constitute sufficient force, violence, or putting in fear to support a robbery conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 539 A.2d at 235. We then reasoned that the victim was not even \u201caware she had been dispossessed of the purse until she saw the purse snatcher running from her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207, 539 A.2d at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Actual force is not at issue in the instant case; rather, the question is whether there was sufficient evidence of intimidation, or placing in fear, to support Coles\u2019s convictions for robbery. In support of his contention that the evidence was insufficient, Coles claims that the \u201cassault component\u201d of robbery was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt because there was no evidence that he \u201cspecifically intended to frighten the tellers,\u201d that he threatened them with \u201ca specific and immediate battery,\u201d or that he had an \u201capparent ability to carry out\u201d such a threat. Coles claims that our decision in <em>Dixon v. State, </em>302 Md. 447, 488 A.2d 962 (1985), illustrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the requisite amount and quality of evidence necessary to prove those elements of robbery and claims that the evidence in the instant case falls short of that standard. Coles\u2019s contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In <em>Dixon, </em>we stated that when \u201cintimidation or putting in fear\u201d is the \u201cgravamen of the action,\u201d the following \u201ctest\u201d is to be applied in determining the sufficiency of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9j\">[A]ny attempt to apply the least force to the person of another constitutes an assault. The attempt is made whenever there is any action or conduct reasonably tending to create the apprehension in another that the person engaged therein is about to apply such force to him. It is sufficient that there is an apparent intention to inflict a battery and an apparent ability to carry out such intention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 458-59, 488 A.2d at 967 (quoting <em>Lyles v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 265, 267, 269 A.2d 178, 179 (1970)). The defendant in <em>Dixon </em>challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for assault with intent to rob.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 450, 488 A.2d at 963. A female cashier was in her booth alone at a gas station in Baltimore City one evening when Dixon approached and failed to respond to inquiries from the cashier. <em>Id. </em>at 451- 52, 488 A.2d at 963-64. The cashier \u201cthought something was going on\u201d because Dixon had a \u201ccold, hard look ... in his eyes\u201d and was concerned because Dixon had a newspaper folded underneath his right arm, which led her to believe that he had a weapon, although she never saw a weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 452- 53, 488 A.2d at 964-65. Dixon placed a note into the drawer that received customer items, which read, \u201cI want all your money and hurry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452, 488 A.2d at 964. The cashier pushed an alarm, dropped to the floor, and waited for the police to come. <em>Id. </em>at 452, 488 A.2d at 964. Dixon fled without any money. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">To gauge whether proof of intention to inflict a battery is governed by a subjective standard, i.e. from the viewpoint of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the teller regarding his or her fear, or by an objective standard, i.e. from the circumstances of the robbery, and to determine whether the display of a weapon is necessary to show intimidation or putting in fear, we reviewed cases decided by the federal courts under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). We considered those eases to be \u201cpertinent to our [ ] inquiry\u201d because \u201c[t]he gravamen of the action [in the federal cases], as [in <em>Dixon], </em>[was] whether intimidation [had] been shown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 488 A.2d at 967-68. The federal cases upon which we relied, identified the dispositive standard as an objective one, which does not require a showing of actual fear and indicated that the actual display of a weapon is not necessary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 459-63, 488 A.2d at 967-70 (discussing <em>United States v.

We then held that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in convicting Dixon of assault with intent to rob. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 488 A.2d at 970. In so doing, we paid particular note to the fact the defendant had a \u201c \u2018cold, hard look\u2019 in his eyes,\u201d that he approached the lone cashier at night and gave her a previously written demand note, that he was carrying a newspaper in a manner that made the cashier think that Dixon had a weapon, and that the cashier hit an alarm and dropped to the floor, whereupon Dixon fled. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Coles, however, contends that <em>Dixon </em>mandates a reversal of his robbery convictions because, unlike <em>Dixon, </em>\u201cColes\u2019s actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>were not designed to suggest to the tellers that he possessed a weapon or was prepared to use actual force.\u201d In addition, Coles asserts that the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d of the instant case, \u201cdaylight hours and in the presence of others,\u201d were \u201cless menacing\u201d than in <em>Dixon. </em>Finally, Coles claims that the \u201cabsence of actual fear\u201d in the instant case \u201crepresents powerful evidence\u201d that Coles\u2019s conduct did not satisfy the constructive violence element of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Contrary to Coles\u2019s assertion, the evidence in the instant case was more than sufficient to satisfy the element of intimidation under Maryland law. During the first robbery, Coles, entered the bank wearing a baseball hat, a scarf around his neck, and a jacket or heavy shirt in which he could have concealed a weapon. He walked up to Ms. Estes and gave her a bag and a note telling her to \u201c[pjut some money in the bag,\u201d and ordering her \u201cnot to hit an alarm .. . not to let anybody know,\u201d and to return the note. That note constituted an unequivocal demand for money and an intimidating command not to let anyone know that Coles was stealing the money. The threat did not end, however, with the note. Upon discovering that Ms. Estes had not put the note in the bag, Coles \u201clooked at\u201d her and warned her that she \u201cbetter find it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">That Ms. Estes did not explicitly testify that she was afraid is of little consequence. As we pointed out in <em>Dixon, </em>proof of actual fear is not necessary when \u201cintimidation or putting in fear is the gravamen of the action.\u201d 302 Md. at 459, 488 A.2d at 967. Ms. Estes was a thirty-year veteran teller. According to her testimony, she was concerned by Coles\u2019s note and behavior \u201cbecause there were other people in the bank.\u201d She also stated that one \u201cnever know[s] what could happen at a time like th[atj,\u201d and that she \u201cwanted him out.\u201d Given the situation, Coles\u2019s demands and commands could have been interpreted by a reasonable person as suggesting a threat of bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We reach the same conclusion as to the second robbery. Coles walked up to Janice Hall, who was working as a teller at the time, and without saying anything, handed her a bag and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>note. In addition to demanding money, that note stated that if she complied, \u201cno one will get hurt.\u201d Ms. Hall tried to keep the note, but Coles \u201cput his hand over\u201d and said, \u201c[Gjive me back [the note].\u201d Ms. Hall reported that the incident was \u201cthe scariest moment of [her] life.\u201d Obviously, the language that \u201cno one will get hurt\u201d is sufficient to suggest bodily harm for non-compliance. Ms. Hall gave him the money because she actually felt intimidated and fearful, as would any reasonable person. Although actual fear is not necessary in this analysis, evidence of it is nonetheless \u201cprobative of whether a reasonable person would have been afraid under the same circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilmore, </em>282 F.3d 398, 403 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">During the third robbery, Coles, wearing a jacket in which he could have easily concealed a weapon, entered the bank, walked up to teller Bernice Swann\u2019s counter, and handed her a bag and a note that read, \u201cPut all the money in the bag no alarms thank you.\u201d Ms. Swann complied because from behind her counter, she could not \u201csee a person\u201d and therefore \u201chad no idea what [Coles] had.\u201d Moreover, there were \u201cother people in the bank, so you comply. You do what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d Viewing this testimony in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that a rational fact finder could have concluded that the demand of, \u201cPut all the money in the bag,\u201d and the command, \u201cno alarms,\u201d were sufficient to create fear of bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Coles also was wearing a jacket at the time, in which he could have easily concealed a weapon. As we observed in <em>Dixon, </em>the presence of an undisclosed weapon may be inferred from the circumstances, <em>Dixon, </em>302 Md. at 463, 488 A.2d at 970, and the presence of a deadly weapon may satisfy the constructive violence element of robbery. <em>Bowman v. State, </em>314 Md. at 725, 730, 552 A.2d at 1303, 1305 (1989). Thus, we hold that the evidence of Coles\u2019s conduct was sufficient for a rational fact finder to conclude that the constructive violence aspect of robbery was satisfied in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>In so concluding, we align ourselves with the majority of federal circuits that have addressed situations similar to the instant case while interpreting the federal bank robbery statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Gilmore, </em>282 F.3d at 403 (holding that \u201cunequivocal written and verbal demands for money to bank employees are a sufficient basis for a finding of intimidation,\u201d reasoning that \u201c[ijntimidation does not require proof of express threats of bodily harm, threatening body motions, or the physical possibility of a concealed weapon\u201d); <em>United States v.

Please give me small, unmarked bills, touch off no alarms, and alert no one for at least ten minutes. Thank you\u201d); <em>United States v.
