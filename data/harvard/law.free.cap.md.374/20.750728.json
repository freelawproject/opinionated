The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County and the Court of Special Appeals held that the former police officer\u2019s conduct was not covered by the County\u2019s self-insurance program. We agree and shall affirm the judgments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">On November 15, 1990, at approximately 2:00 a.m., Anne Arundel County police officer Michael D. Ziegler was on traffic patrol in the Pasadena area of Anne Arundel County when he effected a traffic stop of Erin Jones Wolfe, then known as Erin Kathleen Jones. Ziegler suspected Wolfe of driving while intoxicated, but, rather than arresting her, he asked her to sit in the passenger seat of his patrol car and indicated that he would drive her home. Ziegler informed the police dispatcher by radio that he was \u201cout of service\u201d and was going home to check on a faulty furnace. Instead of driving Wolfe directly home, Ziegler drove her to a remote location in the parking lot of a church in Anne Arundel County where, according to Wolfe, he raped her. He then drove her home, where she called 911 to report the rape. As a result of the incident, Ziegler was criminally charged with second degree rape and lesser offenses. He was ultimately convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>misconduct in office, for which he received a one-year suspended sentence and five years probation. He agreed to, and did, resign from the police force.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Subsequently, Wolfe brought an action in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against Ziegler, certain police officials, and Anne Arundel County. She claimed a violation of her civil rights and sought relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. She also claimed damages based on various asserted causes of action under Maryland law. The defendants removed the suit to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Wolfe\u2019s claim against Ziegler was severed from her claims against the police officials and Anne Arundel County. As to the action against Ziegler, a jury returned a $1.15 million verdict in favor of Jones and against Ziegler, awarding her both compensatory and punitive damages. The verdict was based on \u00a7 1983 and common law battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">After the entry of judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict against Ziegler, the United States District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the police officials and Anne Arundel County on the \u00a7 1983 claims against those defendants, holding that, as a matter of law, the plaintiff failed to establish a \u00a7 1983 cause of action against them. The federal court then declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over Wolfe\u2019s state law battery and negligence claims against the police officials and Anne Arundel County, and, on this basis, granted summary judgment in favor of the officials and the County. Finally, with regard to Wolfe\u2019s claim for indemnification against the County because of the judgment against Ziegler, the United States District Court \u201cconcluded that this claim of indemnification is premature.\u201d <em>Jones v. Ziegler, </em>894 F.Supp. 880, 897 (D.Md.1995). The District Court\u2019s judgment was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, <em>Jones v. Wellham, </em>104 F.3d 620 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">After the judgment against Ziegler in the federal case, Ziegler filed, with the Anne Arundel County Self-Insurance Fund Committee, a claim for indemnification. Ziegler\u2019s claim was denied by the Committee, and Ziegler appealed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals. The Board of Appeals conducted a <em>de novo </em>hearing and thereafter denied the claim on the ground that Ziegler\u2019s tortious and criminal conduct was not within the scope of his employment and that, therefore, the claim was beyond the scope of the self-insurance coverage. Ziegler did not seek judicial review of the Board of Appeals\u2019 decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Wolfe\u2019s efforts to satisfy the judgment against Ziegler were unsuccessful, and, in 1997, Wolfe filed in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County the present action against Anne Arundel County. In her complaint, as amended, Wolfe asserted in count one that the County was contractually required to indemnify Ziegler and that the County should therefore pay the full amount of the unpaid judgment, plus attorneys\u2019 fees and accrued interest, to Wolfe. Wolfe sought a declaratory judgment and money damages under count one. In counts two and three of the amended complaint, Wolfe alleged that the County was guilty of \u201cbad faith\u201d in failing to settle the civil rights claims and that the County, by defending Ziegler in the federal court action, was estopped to deny coverage to Ziegler. The complaint also recited that Ziegler had assigned to Wolfe the claims set forth in counts two and three, and that Wolfe was entitled to money damages under those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Following a hearing, the introduction of numerous exhibits, and the submission of various documents, the Circuit Court dismissed counts two and three, holding that Wolfe had failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted. The Circuit Court denied Anne Arundel County\u2019s alternative motion to dismiss all three counts on grounds of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel. Subsequently, the Circuit Court granted Anne Arundel County\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to count one, and, in its order, made the following declaration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201cThis Court is bound by the settled law found in <em>Cox v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>296 Md. 162, 165, 460 A.2d 1038, 1039-40 (1983). Plaintiff in this action has not met the two-prong test in order to hold the County liable for the acts of Officer Ziegler. To explain, although Plaintiff has shown that at one time a master-servant relationship existed between the County and Officer Ziegler, Plaintiff has not demonstrated \u2018that the offending conduct occurred within the scope of the employment of the servant or under express or implied authorization of the master.\u2019 <em>Cox, </em>296 Md. at 165, 460 A.2d at 1039-40. For this reason, the Court must deny Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment. Finding that no material fact is in dispute and that Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, in accordance with Maryland Rule 2-501, Defendant is hereby granted summary judgment as to Count I of the [amended] complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Wolfe appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the Circuit Court erred as a matter of law with respect to all three counts in the amended complaint. Anne Arundel County cross-appealed, contending that the Circuit Court should have dismissed the entire complaint on grounds of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Appeals, agreeing with the Circuit Court\u2019s rulings favorable to the County, affirmed the judgment. <em>Wolfe v. Anne Arundel County, </em>135 Md.App. 1, 761 A.2d 935 (2000). The appellate court quoted the Anne Arundel County self-insurance regulations which covered employees\u2019 actions only \u201cwhile acting within the scope of their duties as\u201d county employees, and which expressly excluded, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cwillful actions\u201d and \u201cpunitive damages.\u201d The appellate court concluded that Ziegler was not acting within the scope of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Furthermore, as alternative grounds for affirmance, the Court of Special Appeals held that Wolfe\u2019s action was barred by the final decision of the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals and principles of <em>res judicata. </em>The intermediate appellate court, pointing out that Wolfe\u2019s present action was based on the alleged self-insurance coverage for Ziegler\u2019s tortious conduct and the assignment, stated that Wolfe had no greater rights under the self-insurance program than Ziegler had. The Court of Special Appeals further stated that the Board of Appeals\u2019 decision, that there was no insurance coverage, was dispositive of the coverage issue. Since no action for judicial review of the Board of Appeals\u2019 decision had been filed within the 30-day limitations period, the Board\u2019s decision became final. Thus, according to the intermediate appellate court, the present action was barred by principles of administrative law, the statute of limitations, and <em>res judicata. Wolfe v. Anne Arundel County, supra, </em>135 Md.App. at 20-28, 761 A.2d at 945-949.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Wolfe filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting the single question of whether Anne Arundel County\u2019s self-insurance provisions covered Ziegler\u2019s tortious conduct. No issue was raised with regard to counts two and three of the amended complaint. Anne Arundel County filed a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting its alternative contention that count one of Wolfe\u2019s complaint was barred by principles of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel based upon the final decision of the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals. This Court granted both the petition and the cross-petition. <em>Wolfe v. Anne Arundel County, </em>363 Md. 205, 768 A.2d 54 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The Anne Arundel County self-insurance program has its roots in several enactments and documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Preliminarily, the Maryland Local Government Tort Claims Act, Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol), \u00a7\u00a7 5-301 through 5-304 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, requires local governments, including Anne Arundel County, to provide a legal defense in a tort suit against a county employee based on \u201cacts or omissions committed by an employee within the scope of employment with the local government\u201d (\u00a7 5-302(a)). The Act also provides that the local government, up to specified monetary limits and with certain other limitations, must pay \u201cany judgment against its employee for damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions committed by the employee within the scope of employment with the local government\u201d (\u00a7 5-303(b)). The Act contains exceptions to local government liability for, <em>inter alia, </em>malicious acts and punitive damages (\u00a7\u00a7 5 \u2014 302(b)(2)(i) and 5-303(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>In addition to Anne Arundel County\u2019s obligations under the Local Government Tort Claims Act, \u00a7 526(b) of the Anne Arundel County Charter states (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\u201cSubject to any limitation or exception that the County Council specifies by ordinance, the County Attorney shall defend any officer or employee of the County in any civil action brought against the officer or employee by reason of any act done or omitted to be done <em>in the scope of the officer\u2019s or employee\u2019s employment. </em>In any case defended by the County Attorney under this section, the County shall pay all court related expenses charged to the officer or employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Article 2 \u00a7\u00a7 5-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Anne Arundel County Code establish the County\u2019s \u201cSelf-Insurance Fund,\u201d provide for an annual appropriation to the Fund, and establish a \u201cSelf-Insurance Fund Committee\u201d to review and approve or disapprove all claims for payment where the amount exceeds $5,000. Section 5-104(d)(3) of the Code mandates that the \u201cCommittee shall ... adopt rules and regulations necessary for the operation and maintenance of the Fund, including rules to establish: (i)' the nature of losses to be paid from the Fund. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The regulations adopted by the Committee, and in effect during the events of this case, contain provisions defining an \u201cinsured\u201d for purposes of liability coverage under the self-insurance program. The regulations also contain numerous \u201cexclusions\u201d from coverage. The provisions defining an insured are as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">\u201c1. All elected or appointed officials, deputies, employees, members of special boards or commissions of the County, volunteers and aides, and officials and employees of the County Department of Health, employees of the Public Libraries of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County, Inc., and Volunteer Firefighters of Volunteer Fire Companies and Rescue Squads, <em>while acting unthin the scope of their duties as such or on behalf of the County.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>2. Police dogs with respect to the ownership, possession, custody, maintenance or use and animals while in the possession of the Anne Arundel County, Inspections and Permits, Animal Control Division.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">3. Any person or organization for whom the County is obligated by agreement to provide insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">4. Volunteer Fire Companies and Rescue Squads for which the County has agreed to provide insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">5. Paid employees of the Sheriffs Department excluding the Sheriff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">6. Temporary Deputy Sheriffs appointed in a bona fide emergency only within the scope of the specific emergency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The exclusions from coverage in the regulations consist of nine paragraphs, two of which may be relevant in the present case. Exclusions three and nine state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">\u201c3. Claims brought against an individual County employee or individual otherwise insured which are as a result of willful actions or gross negligence on the part of that individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">9. Punitive damages for or on behalf of any public official or employee of the County who is a defendant in a civil rights action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">The collective bargaining agreement, in effect during the pertinent time periods, between Anne Arundel County and the Fraternal Order of Police, which represented the collective bargaining unit of which Ziegler was a member, stated as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\"><em>\u201cSection 13.6 </em>\u2014 Civil <em>Liability Coverage</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">County agrees to provide employees with legal defense services and with indemnification for civil liability in a fashion <em>consistent </em>with both Article 2, Title 5 (Self-Insurance Fund) of the County Code and the policies, rules, and <em>regulations of the Self-Insurance Fund Committee.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>County agrees to provide employees with legal defense services and legal counsel without cost in any civil case where the plaintiff alleges that an officer should be held liable for acts alleged to be within the scope of his/her employment and/or his/her official capacity. Indemnification of compensatory damage will also be provided to any member of the unit who is made a defendant <em>in litigation arising out of acts within the scope of his/her employment.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Wolfe concedes \u201cthat the scope of an officer\u2019s employment does not encompass the rape of a citizen\u201d (petitioner\u2019s brief at 20) and that neither the Local Government Tort Claims Act nor the first paragraph defining an insured in the Anne Arundel County self-insurance regulations require the County to pay the tort judgment against Ziegler. In fact, Wolfe insists that the Court of Special Appeals \u201cclearly erred\u201d in mentioning the Local Government Tort Claims Act as one of the \u201csource[s]\u201d of the Anne Arundel County self-insurance program <em>(id. </em>at 18). Wolfe also acknowledges \u201cthat Ziegler did not qualify as an \u2018Insured\u2019 as defined\u201d in paragraph one of the self-insurance regulations <em>(id. </em>at 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Wolfe\u2019s argument is that the Anne Arundel County self-insurance program covered certain actions of an employee outside of the scope of employment, including the tortious and criminal conduct here involved. Wolfe relies upon the third definition of an \u201cinsured\u201d in the self-insurance regulations which encompasses \u201cany person or organization for whom the County is obligated by agreement to provide insurance.\u201d Next, Wolfe points to the collective bargaining agreement between the County and the Fraternal Order of the Police, and argues that the collective bargaining agreement qualifies as an \u201cagreement\u201d within the third definition of \u201cinsured\u201d in the self-insurance regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Wolfe then turns to the collective bargaining agreement\u2019s language which states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201c[indemnification of compensatory damages will also be provided to any member of the unit who is made a defendant in litigation arising out of acts within the scope of his/her employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">According to Wolfe, the traffic stop was an act by Ziegler within the scope of his employment, and the tort suit constituted \u201clitigation arising out of\u2019 that traffic stop within the meaning of the above-quoted language in the collective bargaining agreement. In arguing that the litigation, based upon rape and battery, arose out of the traffic stop, Wolfe utilizes a \u201cbut for\u201d test. She states that, \u201cbut for\u201d Ziegler\u2019s position as a police officer making the traffic stop, the rape and battery would not have occurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Maryland authority upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>which Wolfe primarily relies is a workers\u2019 compensation case, <em>Montgomery County v. Wade, </em>345 Md. 1, 690 A.2d 990 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Wolfe further argues that we should not consider paragraphs three and nine of the exclusions from coverage set forth in the self-insurance regulations. She points out that the trial court, in granting summary judgment on the ground that Ziegler was not acting within the scope of his employment and thus was not an \u201cinsured,\u201d did not reach Anne Arundel County\u2019s alternative argument based on the exclusions. Wolfe relies on the principle that \u201cwe do not ordinarily undertake to sustain a summary judgment by ruling on a ground not ruled upon by the circuit court.\u201d <em>Shpigel v. White, </em>357 Md. 117, 126, 741 A.2d 1205, 1210 (1999). <em>See also, e.g., Eid v. Duke, </em>373 Md. 2, 10-11, 816 A.2d 844, 849 (2003); <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 695, 785 A.2d 726, 729 (2001); <em>Paine-Webber v. East, </em>363 Md. 408, 422, 768 A.2d 1029, 1036 (2001). Wolfe also asserts that the exclusion for \u201cwillful actions\u201d is \u201cambiguous\u201d and \u201crenders unintelligible the coverage provided by the rules\u201d (petitioner\u2019s brief.at 38, 40).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">With regard to Anne Arundel County\u2019s argument based on <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel, Wolfe again invokes the principle that an appellate court will ordinarily review a grant of summary judgment only on the grounds relied upon by the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Anne Arundel County defends the position of both courts below that insurance coverage for Ziegler\u2019s acts depended upon his status under paragraph one of the regulations defining an \u201cinsured,\u201d and that Ziegler was not an insured under paragraph one because his tortious and criminal acts were not within the scope of his employment. The County also disagrees with Wolfe\u2019s interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement. In addition, as indicated above, the County relies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>upon the exclusions in the self-insurance regulations and principles of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Although we believe that there is much force in Anne Arundel County\u2019s arguments based on the exclusions and principles of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel, we shall not reach those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We reject Wolfe\u2019s interpretation of the Anne Arundel County self-insurance regulations as well as her interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Initially, we agree with Anne Arundel County and both courts below that Ziegler was an \u201cinsured\u201d under paragraph one of the County\u2019s self-insurance regulations and was not covered by paragraph three. Paragraph one unequivocally states that \u201c[a]ll ... employees ... of the County\u201d are insureds, and Ziegler was clearly an employee of the County. Furthermore, as we have recently emphasized, \u201c\u2018[a]ll\u2019 means \u2018all.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCarter v. </em>State, 363 Md. 705, 716, 770 A.2d 195, 201 (2001). In light of the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d in paragraph one, covering <em>all </em>employees of Anne Arundel County, there would be no reason for the additional definitions in paragraphs two through six to duplicate the coverage set forth in paragraph one and encompass particular groups of Anne Arundel County employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Moreover, the structure of all six paragraphs defining insureds makes it clear that paragraphs two through six were designed to cover special entities or persons other than regular Anne Arundel County government employees. Thus, paragraph two covers police dogs and certain animals, and paragraph four covers volunteer fireman and rescue workers who, as volunteers, are not regular county employees. Paragraphs five and six encompass employees of the Sheriff\u2019s Office and temporary deputy sheriffs. Under Maryland law, a Sheriffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>office is a state agency, and deputy sheriffs are state officials, not county officials.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Consistently with paragraphs two, four, five, and six of the definitions of \u201cinsured\u201d in the self-insurance regulations, the reference to \u201cany person or organization for whom the County is obligated by agreement to provide insurance\u201d in paragraph three was also not intended to embrace regular county employees covered by paragraph one. Instead, as suggested by Anne Arundel County in its brief, paragraph three was likely intended to refer to entities or persons, such as the Board of Education -or the Anne Arundel Community College, including their employees, which are not part of the county government, but with which Anne Arundel County is authorized to enter self-insurance pooling agreements. <em>See </em>Article 2, \u00a7\u00a7 5-101(a) and (c) of the Anne Arundel County Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Finally, Anne Arundel County\u2019s obligation to pay certain tort judgments against its employees, including county police officers, is based on the Local Government' Tort Claims Act and the Anne Arundel County Code. It is an obligation imposed by law and not simply one undertaken by agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">A critical part of the definition of an insured in paragraph one of the insurance regulations is that employees are covered only \u201cwhile acting within the scope of their duties as such or on behalf of the County.\u201d Wolfe concedes that Ziegler\u2019s tortious and criminal conduct was not within the scope of his duties as a police officer. Moreover, it is clear from our cases that he was not acting within the scope of his employment. <em>See, e.g., Ennis v. Crenca, </em>322 Md. 285, 293-296, 587 A.2d 485, 489-491 (1991); <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. 247, 254-260, 587 A.2d 467, 470-473 (1991), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Even if paragraph three of the self-insurance regulations were applicable to Ziegler, and even if the collective bargaining agreement were deemed controlling, the result would be the same.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">First, the collective bargaining agreement expressly states that \u201cindemnification\u201d of employees for civil liability shall be \u201cconsistent with ... the policies, rules, and regulations of the Self-Insurance Fund Committee.\u201d It is clear that the policies and regulations of the Self-Insurance Fund Committee are to cover employees only \u201cwhile acting within the scope of their duties.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Second, we do not agree that the subsequent language of the collective bargaining agreement, referring to \u201clitigation arising out of acts within the scope of his/her employment,\u201d has the meaning advocated for by the petitioner Wolfe.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Wolfe correctly observes \u201cthat the words \u2018arising out of require a showing of a causal relationship\u201d and that, in some contexts, the words indicate a broader causal relationship than \u201cproximate cause\u201d (petitioner\u2019s brief at 26). <em>See, e.g., Nation</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>al Indemnity v. Ewing, </em>285 Md. 145, 149, 200 A.2d 680, 682 (1964). Wolfe cites no opinion by this Court, however, which takes the position that \u201carising out of\u2019 always or normally signifies an unlimited \u201cbut for\u201d causal relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Moreover, the causal relationship referred to in the collective bargaining agreement is between the litigation and certain specified acts, namely \u201cacts within the scope of [Ziegler\u2019s] employment.\u201d The litigation arose out of the \u201cact\u201d of raping Ms. Wolfe and not out of the \u201cact\u201d of the traffic stop. The petitioner\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d causation argument might have slightly more plausibility if the collective bargaining agreement had referred to litigation based on \u201cacts arising out of the employment.\u201d The language of the agreement, however, requires that the \u201cacts\u201d be \u201cwithin the scope of his/her employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Finally, Wolfe\u2019s reliance upon <em>Montgomery County v. Wade, supra, </em>345 Md. 1, 690 A.2d 990, is misplaced. <em>Wade </em>involved an off-duty police officer who was operating her county-furnished patrol car on a personal errand when she was injured in an automobile accident. In holding that the police officer\u2019s accidental injury arose out of and in the course of her employment for purposes of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, this Court pointed out that Montgomery County permitted, and in fact encouraged, police officers to use their patrol cars while off-duty pursuant to comprehensive regulations, that her use of the car was within the County\u2019s regulations, that the officer was expected to respond to specified situations when using the patrol car while off-duty, that the County\u2019s authorizing the use of patrol cars by off-duty officers was designed to increase police presence in the community, and that the officer\u2019s use of the patrol car fell within the dual purpose doctrine recognized in workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The situation in the present case bears little resemblance to the facts in <em>Montgomery County v. Wade. </em>Ziegler\u2019s detour to the church parking lot and assault upon Ms. Wolfe was neither authorized nor permitted nor within any dual purpose doctrine. It was criminal. If Ms. Wolfe had been able to injure. Ziegler by resistance when he was assaulting her, Ziegler\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>injury would clearly not be covered by the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>See, e.g., Scherr v. Miller, </em>229 Md. 538, 546, 184 A.2d 916, 921 (1962) (If \u201cthe claimant had stepped aside from his employment to initiate ... the alleged assault, then the ... claimant is not entitled to recover\u201d workers\u2019 compensation benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">In sum, both the Court of Special Appeals and the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County correctly held that Ziegler\u2019s attack upon Ms. Wolfe was not covered by the Anne Arundel County self-insurance program.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\">.

In this Court, Anne Arundel County construes the portion of the Court of Special Appeals' opinion, setting forth the alternative grounds for affirmance, as relating only to counts two and three of Wolfe's amended complaint.

Wolfe's theory is set forth in her brief as follows (petitioner's brief at 29-30):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">\"The traffic stop of Ms. Jones [Wolfe] on suspicion that she was driving while intoxicated was unquestionably an act within the scope of his [Ziegler's] employment. <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. 247, 260, 587 A.2d 467 (1991) (\u2018[o]rdinarily when stopping a motorist * * * a police officer is acting within the scope of his employment\u2019). <em>See Montgomery County v. Wade, </em>345 Md. 1, 17 n. 8, 690 A.2d 990 (1997) (\u2018any\u2019 stop executed by a police officer, on-duty or off-duty, 'is part of that officer\u2019s regular employment\u2019). It was also within the scope of Ziegler\u2019s employment and a legitimate 'police function\u2019 for him to ask an inebriated motorist to enter his police vehicle and to drive it from the location of the traffic stop to her home, where he dropped her off. <em>See, id. </em>at 17, 690 A.2d 990 (\u2018an officer utilizing a PPV off duty is performing a police function\u2019). The County benefitted from Ziegler\u2019s use of his marked police vehicle for such purpose, in the form of 'increased police presence in the County\u2019 <em>(id.) </em>and in the promotion of traffic safety by transporting an impaired driver who otherwise might, have endangered the public by operating her own vehicle. Once Ms. Jones entered Ziegler\u2019s police cruiser, as directed by Ziegler, she was effectively in his custody and continually subject to his authority as a police officer. While Ziegler\u2019s detour to a secluded location and rape of Ms. Jones was undoubtedly a misuse of that authority and outside the scope of his employment, \u2018but for' his position as a County police officer he could not have gained access to and control of his victim and the opportunity to rape her inside the police vehicle authorized for his use by the County. The chain of events culminating in the rape was incidental to, and inextricably connected with, Ziegler's initial performance of legitimate police functions and his continuing exercise of authority as a police officer, so as to incur liability as a defendant in \u2018litigation arising out of acts within the scope\u2019 of his official law enforcement duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\">. It is questionable whether this principle is applicable when this Court's grant of certiorari explicitly embraces an issue not ruled upon by the trial judge in granting summary judgment. <em>Cf.
