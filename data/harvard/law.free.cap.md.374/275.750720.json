The Circuit Court for Harford County denied the motion to suppress, filed by the respondent, Kai Ruchell Lee, ruling that the possibility of the destruction of the cocaine recovered was an exigent circumstance that justified the unannounced entry. The Court of Special Appeals reversed. <em>Lee v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 79, 774 A.2d 1183 (2001). It held that the failure to knock and announce, without justification, rendered the entry, albeit with a valid warrant, unreasonable and requires exclusion of the evidence seized. <em>Id. </em>at 94, 774 A.2d at 1192. Application of the doctrine of inevitable discovery under the circumstances of this case, the intermediate appellate court concluded in response to the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration, \u201cwould render the knock- and-announce provision of the Fourth Amendment meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We granted the writ of certiorari at the petitioner\u2019s request and, for the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">During the month of August, 1998, the respondent made two separate sales of cocaine to a confidential informant, acting at the direction of the Baltimore County Police. After subsequent police surveillance, a warrant to search the respondent\u2019s home in Harford County was obtained from a District Court judge. The warrant did not contain a \u201cno-knock clause;\u201d authorizing entry, even by force, without first knocking and announcing police presence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The Court of Special Appeals described the search as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">\u201cEarly on a weekday morning late in September 1998, a large combined task force of law enforcement officers from the Baltimore County Police Department, the Harford County Sheriffs Office, the Harford County Police Department, and the Maryland State Police, assembled in front of a single-family, colonial style home in a residential area of Harford County. The task force, which arrived in several cars and trucks, surrounded the home, while eight Harford County deputy sheriffs, wearing black hoods and fatigue style uniforms, battered down the door of Lee\u2019s home with a two handled \u2018ram,\u2019 which is essentially a pipe filled with concrete. Once inside, the task force \u2018secured the premises\u2019 by dispersing throughout the house. Task force officers handcuffed two adults found upstairs in the master bedroom, gathered three small children from other bedrooms, and then herded all five members of the household together in the downstairs family room. The task force leader, a Maryland State Police trooper, and the Harford County deputy sheriffs then summonsed the remaining task force officers to enter and search the entire house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\"><em>Lee, </em>139 Md.App. at 81-82, 774 A.2d at 1185. Seized in the search were a clear plastic bag containing 26 grams of co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>caine<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; four smaller baggies containing a total of 6.6 grams of cocaine; $1,369 dollars in U.S. currency; a rental agreement; and a 1986 white Chevy Astro Van. The respondent, who acknowledged that the cocaine seized was his, was arrested and charged with possession with the intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Before trial, the respondent moved to suppress the evidence seized during the search. He asserted that the search was invalid because the task force, lacking a reasonable suspicion to believe exigent circumstances existed to permit its doing so, failed to knock and announce its presence before entering his home. The motion was denied by the Circuit Court for Harford County. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\u201c[The police] make a determination that they are going to enter without first knocking. They make that determination based on the hand-to-hand buys that were known---They make that determination based on the ease with which evidence may be destroyed. They make that determination on the basis of the fact that they had a reasonable expectation they would find cocaine in that location and that Mr. Lee was known to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">sir % * * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">\u201cSo when I look at the fact that they arrived there, [the officer] brings the warrant, they have a discussion about what they are going to do and .they make a decision, at that time, based on those factors, that they are going to enter without first knocking and the reason is ... because of the ease with which the evidence could be destroyed. When I look at the totality of the circumstances in this case I have no reason to doubt that that was a tactical decision they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>made and based on the totality of the circumstances it was an appropriate one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The respondent noted an appeal of that judgment to the Court of Special Appeals, which, as we have seen, reversed. The intermediate appellate court held that the failure of the police to knock and announce their presence prior to entering the respondent\u2019s residence was not justified by exigent circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">\u201cIt is clear that, although Maryland law and the opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States presumptively require knocking and announcing before entry when searching with a proper warrant, the law also forgives the failure to do so when there are legally sufficient exigent circumstances. It is equally clear that there is no blanket or <em>per se </em>exception for drug searches. Rather, in each case, the police must articulate a reasonable suspicion, based upon, particularized facts, that exigent circumstances exists which justify not knocking and announcing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">\u201cAt the suppression hearing, the only witnesses to testify were two Maryland State Police troopers called by the State, one of whom testified primarily about having taken a statement from the appellant and not about the conduct of the search. The other trooper, who led the task force, candidly admitted that the only reason he had for not knocking and announcing was that this was a cocaine case, and he always battered down the doors in cases where the object to be seized was narcotics, such as cocaine, that could be easily \u2018flushed down the toilet.\u2019 The trooper testified that the only exceptions would occur, hypothetically, if the quantity of drugs exceeded the occupant\u2019s ability to dispose of them, or the occupants were not at home. The State was unable to elicit from the task force leader any particularized evidence about Lee, Lee\u2019s home, or anything else that would qualify as exigent circumstances, as contemplated by <em>Wil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>son<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Richards.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATN\"><em>Lee, </em>at 89-90, 774 A.2d at 1189-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The State filed a motion for reconsideration, asking the court to address whether exclusion of the evidence was required in view of the inevitable discovery doctrine, arguing that, in any event, it would have been discovered inevitably pursuant to the validly issued search warrant. Although the Court of Special Appeals granted the motion for reconsideration, it rejected the inevitable discovery argument. That exception should not be applied in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the intermediate appellate court opined, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">\u201cTo apply the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule in this instance would render the knock-and-announce provision of the Fourth Amendment meaningless. The application of inevitable discovery in such cases negates the rule against per se exceptions to the knock-and-announce requirement. The United States Supreme Court has twice unanimously affirmed the requirement to knock and announce. In light of two rulings from the nation\u2019s highest court, finding this requirement to exist in both our common law and the Constitution, it would be wrong and utterly inconsistent for Maryland, in effect, to expunge this requirement and establish such an exception as was created in Michigan,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by attaching the doctrine of inevitable discovery to violations of the well established knock-and-announce requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 94, 774 A.2d at 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">We granted the State\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari, <em>State v. Lee, </em>366 Md. 246, 783 A.2d 221 (2001), to address this case of first impression. In its petition, the State did not challenge the determination by the intermediate appellate court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>there were no exigent circumstances at the time of the unannounced entry. Thus, we will address only whether the doctrine of inevitable discovery applies under the facts of this case. Stated differently, all we shall decide is the correctness of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that the evidence seized should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">A. The Knock and Announce Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">It is well settled in Maryland, and long has been so, that a police officer executing a search warrant \u201cmust give proper notice of his purpose and authority and be denied admittance before he can use force to break and enter\u201d the premises to be searched. <em>Henson v. State, </em>236 Md. 518, 521-22, 204 A.2d 516, 518-19 (1964); <em>Goodman v. State, </em>178 Md. 1, 8, 11 A.2d 635, 639 (1940) (\u201cA demand is necessary prior to the breaking in of the doors only where some person is found in charge of the building to be searched.\u201d); <em>Frankel v. State, </em>178 Md. 553, 561, 16 A.2d 93, 97 (1940) (citing <em>Cornelius on Search and Seizure, </em>2nd Ed., sec. 218, for \u201cthe rule that an officer, in executing a warrant to enter a house, which warrant is valid on its face, may break open the doors if denied admittance, but a demand is necessary prior to breaking doors when the premises are in charge of someone\u201d). In <em>Henson, </em>the appellant argued, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat the police officers who executed the search warrant broke open the door of the house being searched without first announcing who they were and making demand that entry be granted, and that this was illegal and vitiated all that followed.\u201d 236 Md. at 520, 204 A.2d at 518. Characterizing the claim as the extension of \u201cthe old rule,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 521, 204 A.2d at 518, and one \u201cof long standing,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 522, 204 A.2d at 519, which has been codified in federal law and a number of the states, <em>id., </em>citing <em>Miller v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 301, 309 n. 8, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 1195 n. 8, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332, 1338 n. 8 (1958),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Court stated the reasons underlying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>rule: \u201cthe law abhors unnecessary breaking or destruction of any house,\u201d <em>id., </em>citing <em>Semayne\u2019s Case, </em>77 Eng. Rep. 194 (K.B.1603)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u201cthe dweller in the house would not know the purpose of the person breaking in, unless he were notified, and would have a right to resist seeming aggression on his private property.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Launock v. Brown, </em>106 Eng. Rep. 482 (K.B.1819).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court observed, however, that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>rule often has been made subject to qualifications and exceptions even in states with statutes, so that by judicial decision announcement and demand are not a requisite where the facts make it evident the officers\u2019 purpose is known or where they would frustrate the arrest, increase the peril of the arresting officer or permit the destruction of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For that proposition, it cited, among other authorities, <em>Miller, </em>357 U.S. at 309, 78 S.Ct. at 1195, 2 L.Ed.2d at 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The Court held that the entry by breaking and without warning in that case was \u201creasonable, permissible and legal and the evidence seized was admissible against the appellant.\u201d 236 Md. at 524, 204 A.2d at 520. Supporting that holding was the Court\u2019s conclusion that, \u201c[practicalities and exigencies in searches for narcotics require the element of surprise entry, for if opportunity is given all evidence easily may be destroyed during the time required to give notice, demand admittance and accept communication of denial of entry,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 523, 204 A.2d at 519, and the testimony of the officer in charge of those executing the warrant, that his \u201cexperience in the past twelve years [has been] when you knock on a door when you suspect drugs being on the premises, they are often disposed of by Hushing down the toilet or thrown out in some manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 204 A.2d at 519-520. As to the former, the Court quoted, with approval, Kaplan, <em>Search and Seizure, A No Man\u2019s Land in the Criminal Law, </em>49 Cal. L.Rev. 474, 502 (1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201c... it would seem that the perfection of small fire-arms and the development of indoor plumbing through which evidence can quickly be destroyed, have made [statutes requiring notice and entry before the use of force to enter] ... a dangerous anachronism. In many situations today ..., a rule requiring officers to forfeit the valuable element of surprise seems senseless and dangerous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">As <em>Henson </em>indicates, the Supreme Court of the United States has commented on the vintage of the knock and announce rule. <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>514 U.S. 927, 931-34, 115 S.Ct. 1914, 1916-18, 131 L.Ed.2d 976, 980-82 (1995); <em>Sabbath v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 585, 589, 88 S.Ct. 1755, 1758, 20 L.Ed.2d 828, 833 (1968); <em>Miller, supra, </em>357 U.S. at 306-08, 78 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>S.Ct. at 1194, 2 L.Ed.2d at 1337-38. In <em>Miller, </em>after the Court traced the history of the rule, it concluded that \u201c[t]he requirement of prior notice of authority and purpose before forcing entry into a home is deeply rooted in our heritage and should not be given grudging application.\u201d 357 U.S. at 313, 78 S.Ct. at 1198, 2 L.Ed.2d at 1340. Although the entry in that case was \u201ctested by criteria identical with those embodied in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 306, 78 S.Ct. at 1194, 2 L.Ed.2d at 1336, the <em>Miller </em>Court observed that Congress \u201ccodif[ied] a tradition embedded in Anglo-American law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313, 78 S.Ct. at 1198, 2 L.Ed.2d at 1340. <em>See Wilson, </em>514 U.S. at 933-34, 115 S.Ct. at 1917-18, 131 L.Ed.2d at 982; <em>Sabbath, </em>391 U.S. at 591 n. 8, 88 S.Ct. at 1759 n. 8, 20 L.Ed.2d at 834 n. 8. In both <em>Miller </em>and <em>Sabbath, </em>the Court held inadmissible evidence obtained as a fruit of an arrest effected in violation of the knock and announce rule. In neither case was the remedy of exclusion of the evidence challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Despite the vintage of the knock and announce rule and its deep roots in Anglo-American jurisprudence, it was not until <em>Wilson </em>that the Supreme Court \u201cconstitutionalized\u201d the doctrine, by squarely holding that the knock and announce principle \u201cis an element of the reasonableness inquiry under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d 514 U.S. at 934, 115 S.Ct. at 1918, 131 L.Ed.2d at 982. In that case, the Supreme Court of Arkansas, having rejected the accused\u2019s argument that the knock and announce principle is required by the Fourth Amendment and \u201cconcluded that neither Arkansas law nor the Fourth Amendment required the suppression of the evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 930, 115 S.Ct. at 1916, 131 L.Ed.2d at 980, affirmed the accused\u2019s drug convictions. The High Court reversed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">\u201cGiven the longstanding common-law endorsement of the practice of announcement, we have little doubt that the Framers of the Fourth Amendment thought that the method of an officer\u2019s entry into a dwelling was among the factors to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a search or seizure. Contrary to the decision below, we hold that in some circumstances an officer\u2019s unannounced entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>into a home might be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 934, 115 S.Ct. at 1918, 131 L.Ed.2d at 982 It cautioned, however, that the \u201cflexible requirement of reasonableness should not be read to mandate a rigid rule of announcement that ignores countervailing law enforcement interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 934, 115 S.Ct. at 1918, 131 L.Ed.2d at 982. Indeed, the Court acknowledged that considerations of officer safety and the ease with which drugs may be destroyed \u201cmay well provide the necessary justification\u201d for unannounced entries. <em>Id. </em>at 937, 115 S.Ct. at 1919, 131 L.Ed.2d at 984. Consequently, the Court characterized its opinion to \u201csimply hold that although a search or seizure of a dwelling might be constitutionally defective if police officers enter without prior announcement, law enforcement interests may also establish the reasonableness of an unannounced entry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936, 115 S.Ct. at 1919, 131 L.Ed.2d at 984. Rather than \u201cattempt a comprehensive catalog of the relevant countervailing factors,\u201d it left \u201cto the lower courts the task of determining the circumstances under which an unannounced entry is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936, 115 S.Ct. at 1919, 131 L.Ed.2d at 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">That the High Court intended the determination of the factors that inform the reasonableness of an unannounced entry to be made on a case by case basis has subsequently been confirmed. In <em>Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 137 L.Ed.2d 615 (1997), that Court addressed whether a blanket exception to the knock and announce rule was permissible when police execute a search warrant in felony drug investigations. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin, concluding that <em>Wilson </em>did not preclude <em>per se </em>rules with respect to the knock and announce requirement, reaffirmed a <em>pre-Wilson </em>holding that police officers need never knock and announce their presence when executing a search warrant pursuant to a felony drug investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 387-88, 117 S.Ct. at 1418, 137 L.Ed.2d at 620. The High Court reversed. Although reiterating what was recognized in <em>Wilson, </em>\u201cthat the knock-and-announce requirement could give way \u2018under cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>cumstances presenting a threat of physical violence\u2019 or \u2018where police officers have reason to believe that evidence would likely be destroyed if advance notice were given,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 391, 117 S.Ct. at 1420, 137 L.Ed.2d at 622, and characterizing as \u201cindisputable\u201d the fact that \u201cfelony drug investigations may frequently involve both of these circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 391, 117 S.Ct. at 1420, 137 L.Ed.2d at 622-23, the Court rejected the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s rationale for adoption of the <em>per se </em>rule, identifying two \u201cserious concerns\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxF\">\u201cFirst, the exception contains considerable overgeneralization. For example, while drug investigation frequently does pose special risks to officer safety and the preservation of evidence, not every drug investigation will pose these risks to a substantial degree. For example, a search could be conducted at a time when the only individuals present in a residence have no connection with the drug activity and thus will be unlikely to threaten officers or destroy evidence. Or the police could know that the drugs being searched for were of a type or in a location that made them impossible to destroy quickly. In those situations, the asserted governmental interests in preserving evidence and maintaining safety may not outweigh the individual privacy interests intruded upon by a no-knock entry. Wisconsin\u2019s blanket rule impermissibly insulates these cases from judicial review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201cA second difficulty with permitting a criminal-category exception to the knock-and-announce requirement is that the reasons for creating an exception in one category can, relatively easily, be applied to others. Armed bank robbers, for example are, by definition, likely to have weapons, and the fruits of their crime may be destroyed without too much difficulty. If a <em>per se </em>exception were allowed for each category of criminal investigation that included a considerable \u2014 albeit hypothetical \u2014 risk of danger to officers or destruction of evidence, the knock-and-announce element of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness requirement would be meaningless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 393-94, 117 S.Ct. at 1421, 137 L.Ed.2d at 623-24 (footnote omitted). The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\u201cThus, the fact that felony drug investigations may frequently present circumstances warranting a no-knock entry cannot remove from the neutral scrutiny of a reviewing court the reasonableness of the police decision not to knock and announce in a particular case. Instead, in each case it is the duty of a court confronted with the question to determine whether the facts and circumstances of the particular entry justified dispensing with the knock-and-announce requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 394, 117 S.Ct. at 1421, 137 L.Ed.2d at 624. It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">\u201cIn order to justify a \u2018no-knock\u2019 entry, the police must have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the destruction of evidence. This standard \u2014 as opposed to a probable cause requirement \u2014 strikes the appropriate balance between the legitimate law enforcement concerns at issue in the execution of search warrants and the individual privacy interests affected by no-knock entries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 394, 117 S.Ct. at 1421-22, 137 L.Ed.2d at 624.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The issue this case presents, whether the inevitable discoveiy exception to the exclusionary rule, enunciated in <em>Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984), renders evidence seized during a search conducted in violation of the knock and announce rule admissible was made to, but not decided by, the <em>Wilson </em>Court. Declining to address it and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>a companion argument based on the \u201cindependent source\u201d doctrine, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">\u201cRespondent and its <em>amici </em>also ask us to affirm the denial of petitioner\u2019s suppression motion on an alternative ground: that exclusion is not a constitutionally compelled remedy where the unreasonableness of a search stems from the failure of announcement. Analogizing to the \u2018independent source\u2019 doctrine applied in <em>Segura v.

While it is true that a no-knock entry is less intrusive than, for example, a warrantless search, the individual interests implicated by an unannounced, forcible entry should not be unduly minimized.

Independent Source/Inevitable Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The State challenges the conclusion of the Court of Special Appeals that \u201c[t]o apply the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule in this instance would render the knock-and-announce provision of the Fourth Amendment meaningless.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>139 Md.App. at 94, 774 A.2d at 1192. In support of its position, it proffers two related reasons: \u201c[t]he search warrant in this case served as an independent source for seizure of the cocaine in Lee\u2019s residence, rendering the seizure causally disconnected from the entry violation, and the cocaine inevitably would have been discovered pursuant to that warrant.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief, at 6-7). In other words, the State relies on the \u201cindependent source\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and \u201cinevitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>discovery\u201d exceptions<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Having reviewed the prerequisites of the \u201cindependent source\u201d and \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d doctrines, the State concludes that \u201c[t]he inevitable discovery rule thus presents a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>factual causation question: Would the evidence have been found, absent the illegal conduct?\u201d Answering that question, it submits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">\u201cTurning to the facts of this case, the warrant to search Lee\u2019s residence was premised on probable cause to believe that Lee was involved in the distribution of cocaine and that drugs and related paraphernalia would be discovered in his home. The police had a valid warrant that would have allowed them to thoroughly search Lee\u2019s residence, and any containers therein, and that search would have taken place regardless of whether the police first knocked and announced themselves at the door. What difference would those few seconds have made to the search? None. There is no question that the officers were going to enter. There is no question that the officers were going to search. There was no evidence that the occupants of the residence were poised to destroy the contraband in those few seconds that would have made the difference between compliance and noncompliance with the knock and announce rule.... Indeed, \u2018[i]t is hard to understand how the discovery of evidence inside a house could be anything but \u201cinevitable\u201d once the police arrive with a warrant; an occupant would hardly be allowed to contend that, had the officers announced their presence and waited to enter, he would have had time to destroy the evidence.\u2019 <em>United States v.

It is not persuaded by those cases, characterizing them as proceeding \u201con the same misguided premise as the Court of Special Appeals!,] that to do so would render the knock and announce rule meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>What those cases ignore, the State maintains, is that application of either or both of the doctrines to knock and announce cases does not vitiate the knock and announce rule; rather, \u201cThe rule stands; only the remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>differs.\u201d <em>People v.

Vasquez, </em>461 Mich. 235, 602 N.W.2d 376, 379 (1999); <em>People v. Stevens, </em>460 Mich. 626, 597 N.W.2d 53, 56 (1999); <em>Richardson v.

There, the Supreme Court of Michigan, having determined that the police violated the knock and announce rule by their method of entry into the defendant\u2019s home to execute the validly issued search warrant-knocking and waiting only a few seconds before forcibly entering-and thus violated the Fourth amendment, addressed whether that violation required exclusion of the evidence seized. 597 N.W.2d at 55. Although acknowledging the pronouncements of the Supreme Court in <em>Wilson, </em>at 934, 115 S.Ct. at 1918, 131 L.Ed.2d at 982 (\u201c[I]n some circumstances, an officer\u2019s unannounced entry into a home [notwithstanding a valid warrant] might be unreasonable under the Fourth amendment.\u201d) and in <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>523 U.S. 65, 71, 118 S.Ct. 992, 996, 140 L.Ed.2d 191, 198 (1998) (\u201cThe general touchstone of reasonableness which governs Fourth Amendment analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>... governs the method of execution of the warrant.\u201d), <em>Stevens, </em>597 N.W.2d at 58, and that \u201cthe exclusionary rule is sometimes needed to deter police from violations of constitutional and statutory protections, even at a great cost to society,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 62, the Supreme Court of Michigan held that, in that case, \u201cthe evidence would have been discovered despite any police misconduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 62, and that \u201cthe inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule should be available to the prosecution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">As to the latter holding, the court reasoned, consistent with the <em>Nix </em>statement of the purpose of the exclusionary rule in the inevitable discovery context, <em>id. </em>at 61:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">\u201cGiven that the evidence would have been inevitably discovered, allowing the evidence in does not put the prosecution in any better position than it would be in had the police adhered to the knock-and-announce requirement. However, excluding the evidence puts the prosecution in a worse position than it would have been in had there been no police misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The former holding is premised on a violation of the knock and announce rule having no effect on the validity or the execution of the warrant. As to that, the court opined that the knock and announce requirement \u201cdoes not control the execution of a valid search warrant; rather, it only delays entry,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 63, one purpose of which \u201cis to allow the occupants a \u2018brief opportunity ... to order [their] personal affairs before the [officers] enter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States v. Kane, </em>637 F.2d 974, 977 (3rd Cir.1981). Adopting the rationale, stated in dicta in <em>United States v. [Dennis] Jones, </em>149 F.3d 715, 716-17 (7th Cir., 1998), i.e.,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">\u201cIt is hard to understand how the discovery of evidence inside a house could be anything but \u2018inevitable\u2019 once the police arrive with a warrant; an occupant would hardly be allowed to contend that, had the officers announced their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>presence and waited longer to enter, he would have had time to destroy the evidence,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzCq\"><em>id. </em>at 64, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">\u201cThe officers were armed with a valid search warrant. Defendant does not argue that the officers\u2019 search exceeded the scope of that warrant. It was not the means of entry that led to the discovery of the evidence, but, rather, it was the authority of the search warrant that enabled the police to search and seize the contested evidence. Therefore, the searching and seizing of the evidence was independent, of failure to comply with the \u2018knock and announce\u2019 statute. \u201cAs in <em>Jones, </em>the discovery of the evidence in the present case was inevitable, regardless of the illegalities on the police officers\u2019 entry into defendant\u2019s home. One of the purposes of the statute is to allow a defendant a brief opportunity to put his personal affairs in order before the police enter his home. <em>United States v. Kane, supra </em>at 977. It is not meant to allow the defendant the time to destroy the evidence. In the present case, the police did not exceed the scope of the search warrant. Therefore, they would have discovered the contested evidence, unless the defendant had been afforded the opportunity to destroy the evidence. The timing of the police officers\u2019 entry into the home in no way affected the inevitability of the discovery of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\"><em>Id. </em>In addition to <em>[Dennis] Jones, supra, </em>the court relied on <em>United States v. Stefonek, </em>179 F.3d 1030 (7th Cir.1999). With respect to the appropriate sanction for the knock and announce violation, the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">\u201cThere are both state and federal sanctions for such violations that serve as deterrents for police misconduct that are less severe than the exclusion of the evidence. Additionally, exclusion of the evidence will put the prosecution in a worse position than if the police misconduct had not occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAi\"><em>Id. </em>at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Critical to the State\u2019s argument, whether premised on inevitable discovery or independent source, is the presence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>valid warrant, lawfully obtained, which is separate and distinct from its manner of execution, as well as the search itself. Armed with such a warrant, the argument, like the argument that carried the day in <em>Stevens, </em>proceeds on the premise that \u201cwhere the police are in possession of a valid warrant, and yet are somehow deficient in the manner of announcing their entry as they execute the warrant, it is only their entry, not the search itself that suffers from a taint of unreasonableness. In essence, [the argument is] ... that, where the entry is unlawful or unreasonable, the remainder of the search is nonetheless lawful because it occurs pursuant to a ... lawfully obtained and valid warrant.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>597 N.W.2d at 69 (Cavanagh, J, dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Generally, evidence obtained as a result of a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The primary reason for excluding such evidence is to \u201ccurb improper police conduct, which it accomplishes by disallowing the use of the evidence illegally obtained.\u201d <em>Brown v.

On the other hand, although the State is not permitted to profit from its illegal activity, \u201cneither should it be placed in a worse position than it would otherwise have occupied,\u201d <em>Murray, </em>487 U.S. at 542, 108 S.Ct. at 2535, 101 L.Ed.2d at 483, when evidence, or knowledge of that evidence, is gained from an independent and lawful source, that evidence is admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 108 S.Ct. at 2533-34, 101 L.Ed.2d at 481. <em>See also Segura, </em>468 U.S. at 805, 104 S.Ct. at 3385, 82 L.Ed.2d at 609, in which the Court, quoting <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 487, 83 S.Ct. at 417, 9 L.Ed.2d at 455, in turn quoting <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>251 U.S. 385, 392, 40 S.Ct. 182, 183, 64 L.Ed. 319, 321 (1920), reiterated that \u201cthe exclusionary rule has no application [where] the Government learned of the evidence \u2018from an independent source.\u2019 \u201d Thus, if the State can show that the source of the evidence was \u201cwholly independent of any constitutional violation,\u201d <em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 443, 104 S.Ct. at 2508, 81 L.Ed.2d at 387, then that there was an' illegal search that took place at some point during a criminal investigation will not render the evidence in question inadmissible. That was the case in <em>Segura.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In <em>Segura, </em>having probable cause to believe that Segura and another were engaged in selling narcotics, the police arrested Segura. Taking him to his apartment, they knocked without announcing that they were police officers. When the door was opened, the police entered the apartment and conducted a limited security sweep for other persons, in the process of which drug paraphernalia was seen in plain view. The occupant of the apartment, Colon, was then arrested, but two of the police officers remained in the apartment awaiting the securing of a search warrant. The warrant was obtained 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>hours later; however, the information on the basis of which the warrant was issued was neither derived from, nor related to the initial police entry nor obtained during that entry, but, rather, \u201cconstituted an independent source for the discovery and seizure of the evidence ... challenged.\u201d 468 U.S. at 814, 104 S.Ct. at 3390, 82 L.Ed.2d at 615. Executing the warrant, the police seized both the paraphernalia they had seen earlier and cocaine discovered during the later search. <em>Id., </em>468 U.S. at 799-801, 104 S.Ct. at 3383, 82 L.Ed.2d at 605-06. Finding no exigent circumstances justifying the initial warrantless, unannounced entry, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York concluded that the entry was illegal. It thus granted Segura\u2019s motion to suppress all of the evidence seized, the paraphernalia seen on the initial warrant-less entry as well as the cocaine seized after the warrant was issued. <em>Id. </em>at 802, 104 S.Ct. at 3383-84, 82 L.Ed.2d at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The Second Circuit affirmed that ruling with respect to the paraphernalia seized prior to the issuance of the warrant, holding that it was properly suppressed, but reversed with respect to the cocaine seized under the warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 802-803, 104 S.Ct. at 3384, 82 L.Ed.2d at 607. The former ruling, not having been challenged by the Government, was not before the Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 802-03 n. 4, 104 S.Ct. at 3384 n. 4, 82 L.Ed.2d at 607 n. 4. With respect to the cocaine seized pursuant to the warrant, concluding that to do so would not weaken the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule because \u201cofficers who enter illegally will recognize that whatever evidence they discover as a direct result of the entry may be suppressed .. .,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 812, 104 S.Ct. at 3389, 82 L.Ed.2d at 613, the Court held that it was admissible. It reasoned that, as to that cocaine, \u201c[wjhether the initial entry was illegal or not is irrelevant to the admissibility of the challenged evidence because there was an independent source for the warrant under which that evidence was seized,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 813-14, 104 S.Ct. at 3390, 82 L.Ed.2d at 614, and that was because it \u201cwas discovered the day following the entry, during the search conducted under a valid warrant; it was the product of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>search, wholly unrelated to the prior entry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814, 104 S.Ct. at 3390, 82 L.Ed.2d at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"><em>Murray, supra, </em>is factually similar. There, without a warrant and there being no exigent circumstances, federal agents illegally entered a warehouse, observing, as a result, bales of marijuana in plain view. 487 U.S. at 535, 108 S.Ct. at 2532, 101 L.Ed.2d at 479. They left without disturbing the evidence. Keeping the warehouse under surveillance, but without including the observations made during the illegal entry in the affidavit for the warrant, the agents obtained a warrant for the search of the warehouse. <em>Id. </em>at 536, 108 S.Ct. at 2532, 101 L.Ed.2d at 479. Therefore, eight hours after the initial warrantless entry, the agents reentered the warehouse and seized the bales of marijuana they had previously observed. <em>Id. </em>The Circuit Court of Appeals, assuming the initial entry to have been illegal, affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of Mum-ay\u2019s motion to suppress the marijuana and thus the rejection of the claim that the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant was tainted by the prior illegal entry. <em>Id. </em>Noting that \u201c[s]o long as a later, lawful seizure is genuinely independent of an earlier, tainted one (which may well be difficult to establish where the seized goods are kept in the police\u2019s possession) there is no reason why the independent source doctrine should not apply,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 542, 108 S.Ct. at 2535, 101 L.Ed.2d at 483, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further fact finding. <em>Id. </em>at 543-44, 108 S.Ct. at 2536, 101 L.Ed.2d at 484. In that regard, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">\u201cThe ultimate question, therefore, is whether the search pursuant to the warrant was in fact a genuinely independent source of the information and tangible evidence at issue here.

It distinguished <em>Segura </em>and <em>Murray </em>as two search cases, in which the second search, conducted pursuant to a valid warrant, \u201cwas independent of the illegal initial search.\u201d The court emphasized that, in <em>Segura, </em>the Supreme Court did not alter the lower court\u2019s finding that the items seen during the initial illegal entry were inadmissible. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Segura, </em>468 U.S. at 804, 104 S.Ct. at 3385, 82 L.Ed.2d at 608. By contrast, it explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALt\">\u201cIn this case, there was but one entry, and it was illegal. The officers seized the evidence in question directly following that illegal entry. Knock-and-announce caselaw in this circuit and others makes very clear that such evidence is inadmissible as the direct fruit of that search. <em>See, e.g., [United States v.] Bates, </em>84 F.3d [790,] 795 [ (6th Cir.1996) ]. This is so even if that entry would have otherwise been legal because it was made pursuant to a valid search warrant. Indeed, the knock-and-announce rule presupposes that the entry is for a valid purpose \u2014 it merely prescribes the method by which that entry should be made in order best to protect the interests of the private resident. In other words, a knock-and-announce violation deems a search illegal due to the unlawful method in which it was executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>even if the search were legal in its purpose and authority (as demonstrated by a valid warrant). The admissible evidence from cases such as <em>Segura </em>and <em>[United States v.] Moreno </em>[, 758 F.2d 425 (9th Cir.1985)] all arose from searches which had both a valid warrant (purpose) as well as a legal entry (method).

That the information supporting the warrant was known before the illegal entry was made is irrelevant. The State cannot escape from the record here: that the otherwise valid search warrant was executed in violation of the fourth amendment. The violation is directly connected to the illegal entry. A contrary conclusion would render the \u2018knock and announce\u2019 requirement meaningless and allow the exception to swallow the rule. \u2018Given the longstanding common law endorsement of the practice of announcement\u2019, we conclude that independent source does not apply under these facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">257 Ill.Dec. 152, 753 N.E.2d at 352, quoting respectively <em>Murray, </em>487 U.S. at 542, 108 S.Ct. at 2535, 101 L.Ed.2d at 483 and <em>Wilson, </em>514 U.S. at 934, 115 S.Ct. at 1918, 131 L.Ed.2d at 982.

Under the dissent\u2019s reasoning, officers, in executing a valid search warrant, could break in doors of private homes without sanction.\u201d 986 F.2d at 1220. The court concluded that, since the warrant in that case, although legally obtained, was executed in violation of the knock and announce rule and the independent source doctrine requires that the search warrant and the evidence seized pursuant to it be totally unrelated to the illegal entry, the execution of the warrant was directly related to the illegal entry. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">We are persuaded by this reasoning and, so, hold that the independent source doctrine does not render evidence seized in violation of the knock and announce rule admissible.

In order to avoid the exclusionary rule, the government must establish that it <em>has not </em>benefited by the illegal acts of its agents; a showing that it <em>might not </em>have so benefited is insufficient.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 164, 423 A.2d at 557, quoting <em>Maguire, supra </em>at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In <em>Oken, </em>we applied the inevitable discovery doctrine. 327 Md. at 654-56, 612 A.2d at 270-71. There, the trial court, having found that they would inevitably have been discovered, admitted into evidence the pair of tennis shoes the defendant was wearing at the time of his arrest, over the defendant\u2019s objection that they were seized as a result of information obtained during an illegal search of a room he had occupied while staying at an inn in Maine. That finding was based on testimony by the manager of the inn where the search occurred as to certain predictable and customary cleaning procedures at the inn that would have uncovered the evidence in Oken\u2019s room absent the initial illegal entry by the police. <em>Id. </em>at 654-55, 612 A.2d at 270-71. We concluded \u201cthat the State presented ample evidence demonstrating that the items in [Oken\u2019s room] would have been inevitably discovered through lawful means, and therefore the motion judge\u2019s ruling was not clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655, 612 A.2d at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We also applied the doctrine of inevitable discovery in <em>Williams. </em>There, police officers illegally entered Williams\u2019 motel room while another officer was obtaining a warrant, seizing marijuana and cocaine and arresting Williams. 372 Md. at 395-96, 813 A.2d at 236-37. While we affirmed the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that, after excising the tainted information from the application for the warrant-the police had included their observations from the warrantless, illegal entry-there was probable cause for the search of the motel rooms, emphasizing the fact intensive nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>inevitable discovery inquiry and the need for proof rather than speculation, we concluded that the State had \u201cnot met its burden under the inevitable discovery doctrine.\u201d 372 Md. at 426-28, 813 A.2d at 255-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">As is the case with the State\u2019s independent source argument, to which it is identical, essential to the State\u2019s inevitable discovery argument is the fact that the State had obtained a search warrant for the search of the respondent\u2019s premises and that the existence of the warrant and the manner of its execution, and in particular, the manner of gaining entry, be viewed and considered as separate and distinct. The argument proceeds: because the police had a valid warrant that could have been executed without a violation of the knock and announce rule, the evidence seized pursuant to its execution in violation of that rule \u201cinevitably\u201d would have been discovered; because the evidence could have been seized by properly executing the warrant, that it was not executed properly can not prevent its admission into evidence. So viewed, the State\u2019s argument would follow naturally and logically. That, as we have seen, is the thrust of <em>Stevens, </em>the leading case espousing the argument that the State proffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">We are not persuaded. In fact, as we see it, there are at least two ways in which the application of the inevitable discovery rule to a knock and announce violation runs counter to established Supreme Court knock and announce jurisprudence. Having held that the manner of the police\u2019s entry into premises is a factor to be considered when assessing the reasonableness of a search and seizure and that an unannounced entry, under some circumstances, might be unreasonable, <em>Wilson, </em>514 U.S. at 934, 115 S.Ct. at 1918, 131 L.Ed.2d at 982, the <em>Wilson </em>court stated that \u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment\u2019s flexible requirement of reasonableness should not be read to mandate a rigid rule of announcement that ignores countervailing law enforcement interests,\u201d <em>id., </em>thus requiring a \u201ccase-by-case evaluation of the manner in which a search was executed.\u201d <em>Richards, </em>520 U.S. at 392, 117 S.Ct. at 1420, 137 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 623. Requiring a case by case evaluation of how a search was effected is the very antithesis of a <em>per se </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In <em>Richards, </em>the Court considered just such a <em>per </em>se rule, a Wisconsin rule, pursuant to which there was a blanket exception for felony drug cases. The Court rejected the <em>per se </em>rule, instead reaffirming the requirement of a case-by-case reasonableness inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201c[I]n each case, it is the duty of a court confronted with the question to determine whether the facts and circumstances of the particular entry justified dispensing with the knock- and-announce requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 394, 117 S.Ct. at 1421, 137 L.Ed.2d at 624. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At0\">\u201cIf a <em>per se </em>exception were allowed for each category of criminal investigation that included a considerable \u2014 albeit hypothetical \u2014 risk of danger to officers or destruction of evidence, the knock-and-announce element of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness requirement would be meaningless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">To apply the inevitable discovery rule, on the <em>Stevens </em>rationale, whenever there is a valid warrant, to render admissible, any evidence seized in execution of that warrant in violation of the knock and announce rule is, in effect, to create a blanket exception to that rule for all cases involving valid search warrants, <em>see Vasquez, </em>602 N.W.2d at 378 (\u201cIn light of our recent decision in <em>People v. Stevens, </em>460 Mich. 626, 597 N.W.2d 53 (1999) we need not decide whether the police violated the constitutional and statutory knock-and-announce-requirement under the circumstances of this case. Even if such a violation occurred, suppression of the evidence is not the appropriate remedy\u201d); <em>Langford, </em>314 F.3d at 894 (\u201cWhether the police complied with the rule in this case is in dispute, but the dispute need not be resolved because we hold that violation of the rule does not authorize exclusion of evidence seized pursuant to the ensuing search\u201d), precisely what <em>Richards </em>prohibits. This is exactly what the High Court has said we may not do. <em>See Shugart, </em>889 F.Supp. at 974; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>Mazepink, supra, </em>987 S.W.2d at 656-58; <em>Hoag, </em>83 Cal.App.4th 1198, 1227, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 556, 576 (2000) (Sims, Acting P.J., dissenting); <em>Stevens, </em>597 N.W.2d at 70-71 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting). As Justice Cavanagh stated in dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201cWhile [the Wisconsin] rule dealt with a blanket prospective preclusion of certain situations from a knock and announce requirement, and [the inevitable discovery rule] deals with a blanket preclusion from the application of the exclusionary rule, the actual effects of such rules are identical: the courts would be prevented from ever applying the exclusionary rule when faced with an unreasonable violation of the knock and announce principle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\"><em>Stevens, </em>597 N.W.2d at 70. \u201cThe rule stands; only the remedy differs,\u201d <em>Hoag, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at 1214, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d. at 567 (Morrison, J., concurring), is not a sufficient answer. It \u201cignores the reality that an unenforceable rule-one whose violation has no adverse consequences for the violator-is in effect no rule at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1233, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d at 581 (Sims, Acting P.J., dissenting.).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">By holding that the knock and announce principle is an element of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment and that \u201cthe method of an officer\u2019s entry into the dwelling\u201d is a factor to be considered when determining the reasonableness of a search and seizure, <em>Wilson, </em>514 U.S. at 934, 115 S.Ct. at 1918, 131 L.Ed.2d at 982, the Court quite clearly indicated that more than the validity of the warrant must be assessed, rather that the entry into the premises is itself is to be considered. This was reconfirmed by <em>Richards, </em>as we have seen, when it rejected the blanket rule exception to the knock and announce rule. 520 U.S. at 390 n. 1, 394, 117 S.Ct. at 1420 n. 1, 1421, 137 L.Ed.2d at 622 n. 1, 624. Applying the inevitable discovery rule, in total disregard of the knock and announce principle disregards this aspect of <em>Wilson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Cases in which the inevitable discovery argument has been presented, decided subsequently to <em>Stevens, </em>for the most part, have not adopted the <em>Stevens </em>rationale or reached the result that it did. To be sure, <em>United States v. Langford, </em>314 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>892 (7th Cir.2002); <em>United States v.

Lexis 24630 (2002) reached the result the <em>Stevens </em>court reached, but only <em>Langford </em>and <em>Stegall </em>referred to <em>Stevens </em>and purported to follow it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Stegall </em>was a case in which the accused sought issuance of a writ of habeas corpus upon, among other grounds, that the accused\u2019s counsel rendered ineffective assistance when he failed to file a motion to suppress evidence seized in the execution of a warrant in violation of the Michigan knock and announce statute. 2002 WL 31875529 at *3-4, 2002 U.S. Dist. Lexis 24630 at *9. In rejecting that argument, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">\u201c[EJven if the police violated the knock and announce statute, such evidence would have been admissible under the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Stevens, </em>pursuant to the inevitable discovery rule. Petitioner is therefore unable to establish that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress the evidence based upon a violation of Michigan\u2019s knock and announce statute, because he is unable to show that such a motion would have successfully led to the exclusion of this evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">2002 WL 31875529 at *4-5, <em>Id. </em>at *13. <em>Espinoza </em>was an appeal by the Government of an order suppressing evidence seized from the defendant\u2019s apartment during the execution of a search warrant in violation of the knock and announce rule. Stating that \u201c[t]he exceptions to the knock and announce requirement are not pertinent to our review in this case,\u201d 256 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>F.3d at 723, the court considered the propriety of applying the exclusionary rule to the violation in that case. Concluding that \u201c[t]he appropriateness of applying the exclusionary rule to a particular case is in large part the product of weighing and balancing [the] competing interests,\u201d of deterrence and social costs, <em>id. </em>at 724, and having weighed them and determined that the violation in that case did no harm to any of the interests that the Fourth Amendment protects, it held that exclusion of the evidence would be a disproportionate sanction. <em>Id. </em>at 725-29. <em>See United States v. Langford, </em>314 F.3d at 895 (\u201cThe fruits of an unlawful search are not excludable if it is clear that the police would have discovered those fruits had they obeyed the law. That is the \u2018inevitable discovery\u2019 rule ... without it the exclusionary remedy would over deter; and it is fully applicable here\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">On the other hand, <em>Dice, supra, United States v. Holmes, </em>183 F.Supp.2d 108 (D.Me.2002); <em>District of Columbia v. Mancouso, </em>778 A.2d 270 (D.C.App.2001); <em>Tate, supra; Taylor, supra </em>and <em>Price v. State, </em>93 S.W.3d 358, 2002 Tex.App. Lexis 8436 (2002), all reached the opposite result, after having directly considered and rejected an inevitable discovery argument. Moreover, although denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on the basis of the good faith exception, which was premised on a violation of the knock and announce rule, the court in <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>164 F.Supp.2d 119 (D.Mass.2001) rejected the Government\u2019s inevitable discovery argument. <em>Id. </em>at 123. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">\u201cThe inevitable discovery doctrine is inapposite, for two reasons. First, it requires that the legal means for the inevitable discovery be \u2018truly independent.\u2019 <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>787 F.2d 736, 744 (1st Cir.1986). Here, there was only one search, and no other independent means of discovery appeared on the horizon. Compare <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>18 F.3d 971, 978 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that inevitable discovery applied to search of uninsured, impounded car because subsequent inventory search of vehicle would have revealed contraband). Second, the doctrine requires that its application must not significantly weaken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Fourth Amendment protections. <em>See Silvestri, </em>787 F.2d at 744. Were \u2018inevitable discovery\u2019 to apply here, there would essentially be no exclusionary remedy in cases of improper no-knock entry.

This requires the government to proffer clear evidence \u2018of an independent, untainted investigation that inevitably would have uncovered the same evidence\u2019 as that discovered through the illegal search.... Here, the government has not done this. In fact, the record evinces that, there was only one investigation into Dice\u2019s activity, and that investigation culminated in the illegal entry we are now scrutinizing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">200 F.3d at 986-87. The argument in <em>Holmes </em>was that the inevitable discovery rule should apply to any search where the police have a valid warrant and the evidence would have been discovered even if the police had waited longer before entering the premises. 183 F.Supp.2d at 110. The court rejected that argument and, although there was a valid warrant in that case, noted that the government had not asserted an independent and legal means by which the evidence inevitably would have been discovered. <em>Id. </em>at 111. The court also commented on the effect of the government\u2019s argument: \u201cThe Government appears to suggest that no improper execution of a valid search warrant would necessitate suppression-this proposal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>would render unnecessary any analysis of the proper execution of search warrants.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">An argument very similar to that adopted by the Michigan Supreme Court was made in <em>Price:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">\u201cAccording to the State, the cocaine would have been acquired either way, whether the appellant had notice of the entry or not, as the warrant was its own independent source. Thus, as the State argues, the police would have lawfully entered the premises under the warrant whether or not the authorities had knocked and announced.

However, the very warrant the State relies on as an independent source was the warrant that was unlawfully executed.

To be sure, the court in <em>[Dennis] Jones </em>did comment that \u201c[i]t is hard to understand how the discovery of evidence inside a house could be anything but \u2018inevitable\u2019 once the police arrive with a warrant;\u201d 149 F.3d at 716-17, but as noted by the dissenting justice, who forcefully and eloquently pointed out the flaws in the majority decision, it was inapplicable to the <em>Stevens </em>case, 597 N.W.2d at 66 (Cavanagh, J. dissenting), just as it is inapplicable to the case <em>sub judice. </em>Having noted that the statement was dictum,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Justice Cavanagh explained its inapplicability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u201c[T]he question before the court in <em>Jones </em>was whether evidence that had been seized by other officers from a defendant as he exited a residence should somehow be suppressed on the, basis of a purported subsequent knock and announce violation that occurred <em>after </em>the seizure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>evidence. While the court felt the need to briefly discuss the state of knock and announce law in the course of its four paragraph opinion, the most important sentence followed the one quoted above. \u2018But because the entry at the front door played no role in the chain of events leading to Jones\u2019 seizure on the lawn, we, too, can leave the inevitable-discovery question for another day.\u2019 <em>[Jones, </em>149 F.3d at 717]. Thus, the Seventh Circuit did not, in <em>Jones, </em>apply the inevitable discovery test to a knock and announce violation. Rather, it reached the conclusion, fairly obvious from the factual recitation above, that there was simply no causal link between the entry and the <em>prior </em>seizure of evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 66-67 (footnote omitted). With respect to the context in which the statement was made, in addressing the argument that a defendant could not be heard to claim that he would have used the time the announcement gave to destroy the evidence, Justice Cavanagh pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">\u201cThe obvious correctness of that statement ... seems to have a tendency to lead both some courts and advocates (both the majority and the appellate prosecutor here apparently falling within that group) to ignore the fact that the exigent circumstances exception exists precisely to preclude the favoring of this sort of wrongdoing, and to fail to grasp the application of the prosecutor\u2019s concession of an absence of exigent circumstances to remove this entire case from any inquiry of this sort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 67 n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Similarly, <em>[Kip] Jones </em>is not an application of the inevitable discovery rule in the knock and announce context. As the Seventh Circuit itself acknowledged, \u201cJones does not contend that the officers violated 18 U.S.C. sec. 3109 or the fourth amendment ... by giving insufficient notice before using the battering ram.\u201d 214 F.3d at 837. Thus, the discussion of the inevitable discovery of the evidence despite the claim of illegal entry is pure dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">As indicated, there was a vigorous dissent to the <em>Stevens </em>majority opinion. It challenged the very premise of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>majority opinion\u2019s application of the inevitable discovery rule and questioned its adherence to Supreme Court precedents. Characterizing this opinion as \u201cabsolutely correct,\u201d and the <em>Stevens </em>Majority opinion as the \u201cAlice-in-Wonderland version of inevitable discovery,\u201d Professor LaFave has equated the <em>Stevens </em>dissent with the observation by the <em>Dice </em>court that \u201cto remove the exclusionary bar from this type of knock-and-announce violation whenever officers possess a valid warrant would in one swift move gut the constitution\u2019s regulation of how officer\u2019s execute such warrants.\u201d 5 Wayne R.

Denying reliance on the theory as a separate matter, it argues, instead, that, under the facts of this case, where the warrant constituted the independent source by virtue of which the drugs inevitably would have been and, indeed, were discovered, notwithstanding the illegal entry, the two doctrines are inextricably intertwined.

In that case, having arrested an individual, Berry, who was staying at a motor inn, the police decided to apply for a search warrant for Berry\u2019s room in the named motor inn. While the application was being prepared and pending issuance of the warrant, other officers went to the motel. They approached the subject, rooms and knocked on the door, responding, \u201cmaintenance,\u201d to the inquiry as to who was there. When the occupant looked through the window, but did not open the door and instead was heard to run from the door, the officers kicked in the door and entered, in the process smelling marijuana and seeing marijuana, in plain view. They subsequently arrested the defendant and, while searching him found cocaine on his person, in his pajamas. The police did not search further until they executed the warrant, which was subsequently issued. The application for that warrant included the information learned from the warrantless entry.
