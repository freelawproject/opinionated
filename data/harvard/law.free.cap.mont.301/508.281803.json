Roadarmel (\u201cRoadarmel\u201d), who had been injured in a workers\u2019 compensation accident in 1986, and the attorney who prosecuted his claim, Donald E. White (\u2018White\u201d). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, State of Montana (\u201cthe WCC\u201d), granted summary judgment to Royal under the subrogation statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985), finding Roadarmel and White (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d) personally liable for Royal\u2019s share of third-party proceeds received as a result of litigation against two third parties, the Exxon Corporation and the Great Western Chemical Company. Roadarmel and White appeal the WCC\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Royal. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b62 Appellants contend that the WCC erred in granting summary judgment to Royal. They raise two issues in that regard:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b63 I. Whether the WCC erred in concluding that Royal\u2019s subrogation action against Roadarmel is not barred by the two-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 27-2~211(l)(c), MCA, governing actions based upon a liability created by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b64 II. Whether the WCC erred in concluding that the action by Royal against the attorney White is not barred by the three-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 72-34-511(l)(a), MCA, governing actions based upon an alleged breach of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\u00b65 Roadarmel suffered an industrial injury stemming from chemical exposure in September of 1986 while working as a heavy equipment operator on a highway project in Butte, Montana. Roadarmel filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim against his employer, Acme Concrete, which was defended by its insurance carrier, Royal. White represented Roadarmel and the case was tried before the WCC, resulting in a judgment for Roadarmel. The judgment was upheld by this Court in <em>Roadarmel v. Acme Concrete Co. </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 163, 772 P.2d 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\u00b66 Roadarmel, represented by White, also filed a third-party action against the Exxon Corporation and the Great Western Chemical Company, alleging strict liability in tort for failure to warn of possible effects of the chemical agent which caused Roadarmel\u2019s injuries. Roadarmel, through White, provided notice to Royal, as required by the subrogation standard of \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985), that a third-party action was being commenced. Pursuant to the subrogation statute, Roadarmel requested that Royal pay a portion of the costs of the third-party action. Royal agreed to participate in the costs rather than waive 50% of its subrogation rights under \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985), and tendered a check for $5,000 towards the costs of the third-party action.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">\u00b67 On March 10,1992, at the conclusion of the jury trial in federal district court, White sent notice to Royal advising it of Roadarmel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>successful third-party action and of the fact that the third parties had filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit subsequently upheld the verdict. On February 18, 1994, White sent another letter to Royal advising it of the resolution of the third-party appeal. This letter attached copies of the check received from Great Western Chemical and the jury verdict forms; provided a break-down of the actual costs of the third-party action; and requested that Royal determine its subrogation interest in a portion of the third-party proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b68 Royal then independently computed the amount it contended it was owed, and by letters dated April 7 and October 3 of 1994, advised Roadarmel that it was going to file an action to determine its subrogation interest in the proceeds from the third-party action. White, acting on behalf of Roadarmel, did not respond to either of Royal\u2019s aforementioned letters. However, after receiving Roadarmel\u2019s February 18,1994 notice of the successful third-party action, a period of <em>3V% </em>years passed before Royal filed, on October 29,1997, a petition for hearing to determine its subrogation rights in the third-party proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b69 Through discovery in the subrogation action, Royal learned that White had disbursed the third-party proceeds to Roadarmel on February 18,1994, the same date that White had requested a computation of Royal\u2019s subrogation interest. White, upon disbursing the money, allegedly instructed Roadarmel to hold the funds pending a subrogation determination. Royal amended its petition, on November 17, 1997, to include a separate count against White for an alleged breach of the duty of trust owed Royal as a third-party beneficiary of the trust imposed on the third-party proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b610 The WCC decided this case on cross-motions for summary judgment. The court determined that a \u201csubrogation agreement\u201d had been formed in the exchange of letters between White and Royal\u2019s attorney, James G. Edmiston (Edmiston), and that the statute of limitations on the contract had not expired. Therefore, the WCC issued judgment in the amount of $63,864.79 jointly and severally against Roadarmel and White for breaching the subrogation contract and failing to honor Royal\u2019s \u201cfirst lien\u201d on the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u00b611 This Court\u2019s standard of review of a grant or denial of summary judgment by the WCC is the same as that used by the court in ruling upon the motion for summary judgment. <em>Heath v. Montana Mun. Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>Authority, </em>1998 MT 111, \u00b6 9, 288 Mont. 463, \u00b6 9, 959 P.2d 480, \u00b6 9 (citing <em>Heisler v. Hines Motor Co. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 270, 274, 937 P.2d 45, 47). That is, we review whether there is an absence of genuine is-, sues of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled tojudg-i ment as a matter of law. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 9. <em>l</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b612 Our review of the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law is plenary; we sim-' ply determine whether the court\u2019s legal conclusions are correct. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 9 <em>(citing Loss v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 80, 81, 936 P.2d 313, 314). Here, since the material facts are undis-t puted, only questions of law remain. Thus, we must determine whether the WCC correctly concluded, as a matter of law, that Royal\u2019s claims against Roadarmel and White are not barred by the relevant statutes of limitations. We hold that Royal\u2019s claims are time-barred and, therefore, we direct entry of summary judgment in favor of Roadarmel and White.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b613 Did the WCC err in concluding that Royal\u2019s subrogation action against Roadarmel is not barred by the two-year stat? ute of limitations of \u00a7 27-2-211(l)(c), MCA, governing actions; based upon a liability created by statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u00b614 Roadarmel and White contend that Royal\u2019s action to collect <em>s'r </em>portion of the third-party proceeds under the subrogation statute o, - the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA (1985), is time-barred by the two-year statute of limitations which governs ac-t tions based upon \u201ca liability created by statute,\u201d \u00a7 27-2-211(l)(c),,-MCA. The basis for the position of Appellants is that the subrogatiori, right of Royal constitutes a \u201cstatutory liability\u201d which is entirely de-: pendent upon \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985). There is no common law right-involved here, asserts Appellants, and without the statute there would be no liability as to the third party proceeds received by Roadarmel. Therefore, they argue that the two-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 27-2-211(l)(c), MCA, governs Royal\u2019s claim for reimbursement against Roadarmel. We agree with the position of Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"AGQ\">\u00b615 Section 27-2-211, MCA, provides in pertinent part that \u201c[wjithin 2 years is the period prescribed for the commencement of an action upon... a liability created by statute other than... a penalty or forfeiture; or . . statutory debt created by the payment of public assistance.\u201d Section \u20187-2-211(l)(c)(i)-(ii), MCA. It is not contended here that Royal\u2019s entitJ \u00a1ment to a portion of the third-party proceeds pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>lant to \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA (1985), is in the nature of a \u201cpenalty or jrfeiture\u201d or a \u201cstatutory debt created by the payment of public assis.ance.\u201d Thus, the question becomes whether Roadarmel\u2019s obligation to Royal amounts to a \u201cliability created by statute\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 27-2-211(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b616 To begin with, there is no doubt that the insurer\u2019s \u201cright of subrogation\u201d provided for in \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985), creates a statutory liability as to any recovery by the injured employee against a third party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1D\">If a [third-party] action is prosecuted [by the injured employee] as provided for in 39-71-412 [liability of third party other than employer or fellow employee] or 39-71-413 [liability of fellow employee for intentional and malicious acts or omissions] and except as otherwise provided in this section, the insurer is entitled to subrogation for all compensation and benefits paid or to be paid under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>The insurer\u2019s right of subrogation is a first lien on the claim, judgment, or recovery. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">lection 39-71-414(1), MCA (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">117 However, that does not end our inquiry. As Appellants correctly ;ontend, the phrase \u201cliability created by statute\u201d has a settled meanng in the law of Montana as well as other states. This Court has contraed the phrase to mean \u201c \u2018a liability which would not exist but for he statute ....\u2019 <em>\u201d Abell v. Bishop </em>(1930), 86 Mont. 478, 486, 284 P. 525, 528 (quoting 37 <em>C.J. Limitations of Actions </em>\u00a7 123). Put differently, the test is whether liability would exist absent the statute in question. <em>State ex rel. Fallon County v. District Court </em>(1972), 161 Mont. 79, 81, 505 P.2d 120, 121. Therefore, a liability created by statute is one which \u201cestablishes a new rule of private right unknown to the common law.\u2019\u2019 <em>Butler v. Peters </em>(1922), 62 Mont. 381, 384, 205 P. 247, 248. <em>See also </em>51 Am. Jur. 2d Limitations <em>of Actions </em>\u00a7 82 (1962) (\u201cClearly, an action is not based upon a liability created by statute if the right is one which would exist at common law in the absence of statute.\u201d). Other states have similarly defined the phrase \u201cliability created by statute.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Lincoln Bank and Trust v. Neustadt </em>(Okla. Ct. App. 1996), 917 P.2d 1005, 1008; <em>Wright v. Kansas Water Office </em>(Kan. 1994), 881 P.2d 567, 572; <em>Preferred Risk Mut. Ins. C</em>o. <em>v. Vargas </em>(Ariz. Ct. App. 1988), 754 P.2d 346, 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">\u00b618 Notably, the phrase \u201cliability created by statute\u201d does not encompass an action in which the element of agreement enters. <em>Abell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>86 Mont. at 986, 284 P. at 528. Indeed, \u201c[i]t is an obligation which the law creates in the absence of an agreement.\u201d <em>Oregon-Washington R. &amp; Nav. Co. v. Seattle Grain Co. </em>(Wash. 1919), 178 P. 648, 650. At this juncture, it becomes necessary to address Royal\u2019s contention, as accepted by the WCC, that the correspondence regarding the third-party action between the respective attorneys, White and Edmiston, created a \u201csubrogation agreement\u201d to which the statutes of limitations for contract actions apply. As the WCC reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">[T]he subrogation agreement between Royal and White (acting as [Roadarmel\u2019s] agent) is an enforceable contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">Thus, the applicable statute of limitations is the five or eight year period specified by section 27-2-202 for actions on contracts. Since the present.petition was brought within five years after [Roadarmel\u2019s] judgment against Great Western was paid, it is timely and Royal is entitled to enforce its subrogation interest. Since the amount is not in dispute, [Roadarmel] is liable to Royal in the sum of $63,864.79.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b619 Royal, while conceding that a workers\u2019 compensation insurer\u2019s subrogation right arises pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985), argues that a contract was indeed formed regarding its subrogation interest in the third-party proceeds recovered by Roadarmel. Thus, Royal asserts that since more than one statute of limitations applies in this case, this Court should favor application of the longer limitations period as a matter of public policy. Royal relies primarily on our discussion in <em>Thiel v. Taurus Drilling Ltd. 1980-11 </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 201, 710 P.2d 33, where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">Where there is a substantial question as to which of two or more statutes of limitations should apply, the general rule is that the doubt should be resolved in favor of the statute containing the longest limitations...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">\u201cThis [general rule] serves the legislative intent of protecting defendants from stale claims, yet provides an approach of liberality which affords a plaintiff party-litigant maximum free access to our court system....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-9\"><em>Thiel, </em>218 Mont. at 212-13, 710 P.2d at 40 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">\u00b620 Royal thus urges this Court to apply that general rule here, as we did in <em>Ritland v. Rowe </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 453, 861 P.2d 175, and <em>Kearney v. KXLF Communications, Inc. </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 407, 869 P.2d 772, so as to further the public policy recognized in <em>Thiel </em>of favoring \u201caccess to our courts and resolution of claims on their merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>rather than the arbitrary bar of the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Kearney, </em>263 Mont. at 413, 869 P.2d at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b621 The problem with Royal\u2019s position is that, in contrast to <em>Thiel, Ritland, </em>and <em>Kearney, </em>this is not a case where there is a substantial question as to which of two statutes of limitations should apply. As Appellants argue, no contract was formed concerning Royal\u2019s subrogation interest in the third-party proceeds because all of the correspondence allegedly giving rise to the \u201csubrogation agreement\u201d took place in the context of the mandatory and self-executing right of subrogation provided for in \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985), and, therefore, lacked the essential element of free and mutual consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b622 In Montana, the essential elements of a contract are: (1) identifiable parties capable of contracting; (2) their consent; (3) a lawful object; and (4) sufficient cause or consideration. Section 28-2-102, MCA. And, as we have said of the element of consent, \u201cit must be free, mutual, and communicated by each party to the other.\u201d <em>Interstate Production Credit Ass\u2019n v. Abbott </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 405, 408, 726 P.2d 824, 826. Appellants argue, and we agree, that to find, as did the WCC, that a contract was formed between the parties here, there must be as a beginning premise the freedom of both parties to negotiate and mutually consent to a \u201csubrogation agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b623 However, the workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statute, \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985), creates what Appellants properly characterize as a \u201ctight liability scheme\u201d in which the injured employee has no right or ability to bargain or contract away the rights of the insurer to be subrogated to third-party proceeds recovered by the employee. The statute provides for the following mandatory procedure with respect to third-party actions instituted by the injured employee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">(2) (a) If the injured employee intends to institute the third party action, he [or she] shall give the insurer reasonable notice of his [or her] intention to institute the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">(b) The injured employee may request that the insurer pay a proportionate share of the reasonable cost of the action, including attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">(c) The insurer may elect not to participate in the cost of the action. If this election is made, the insurer waives 50% of its subrogation rights granted by this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Section 39-71-414(2), MCA (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">\u00b624 As we have said of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>[Section] 39-71-414, MCA, provides for the insurer\u2019s role in the [third-party] action. It provides that the insurer is entitled to subrogation for compensation and benefits paid. If the claimant brings an action against the third party, claimant is to inform the insurer, who <em>may </em>decide to participate in the action. It also states that the insurer may bring an action itself if the claimant does not bring an action within a year of the date of the injury and that the insurer may enter its own settlement for subrogation. The statute provides for no more than these rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><em>Wildin v. CNA Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 354, 357, 846 P.2d 1022, 1024 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b625 Where, as here, the injured employee chooses to initiate a . third-party action, the employee must provide notice to the insurer of the action and may also request that the insurer share in the costs of the action. Section 39-71-414(2)(a)-(b), MCA (1985). That is precisely what happened here when White, on behalf of Roadarmel, provided the mandatory notice to Royal of the third-party action against Exxon and Great Western Chemical, and further requested that Royal agree to a \u201c$5,000 cost advancement\u201d for the action. Royal agreed to advance the $5,000, provided that \u201c[n]o other cost advancements w[ould] be required\u201d to \u201cfully\u201d protect its subrogation interest in the third-party action.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b626 While we agree with the WCC that Roadarmel \u201cwas not entitled to $5,000 up front money\u201d under the statutory subrogation scheme, we disagree with the WCC that he therefore \u201cbargained for\u201d the $5,000 which constituted \u201cconsideration for the agreement.\u201d The insurer retains the absolute right by statute to choose to participate in the reasonable costs of the third-party action, as did Royal, or to waive 50% of its subrogation rights under \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985). The injured employee has essentially no bargaining power, as Appellants argue, save the right to request that the insurer share in the reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees of the third-party action; but even then, the insurer alone determines whether or not to participate in the costs of said action.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\u00b627 That Royal agreed to advance the $5,000 does not answer the question of whether a valid contract was formed between the parties; for Royal retained the statutory right to decline Roadarmel\u2019s specific request for $5,000 up front as failing to constitute a \u201cproportionate share of the reasonable cost of the action....\u201d Section 39-71-414(2)(b), MCA (1985). We note that the costs of Roadarmel\u2019s protracted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>third-party action, including attorney\u2019s fees, amounted to nearly $30,000. In any event, an injured employee like Roadarmel who institutes a third-party action and properly follows the procedure specified by \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985), cannot be said to have freely negotiated for contractual liability in following the statutory requirements. <em>Cf. Butler, </em>62 Mont. 386, 205 P. at 249 (citation omitted) (\u201cA liability imposed by statute and not assumed by the voluntary agreement of the parties is not a contract, even if it is a liability on which the action of debt could have been maintained at common law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u00b628  The correspondence in this case only confirmed in writing that which was required by the statute, from the initial notice that the third-party action was being filed up to the final accounting of the successful appeal before the Ninth Circuit. Thus, we hold that the WCC erred in concluding that the correspondence between the parties, which took place entirely in the context of the mandatory statutory procedure provided for in \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985), gave rise to an enforceable contract. In the absence of a valid contract regarding Royal\u2019s statutory subrogation rights, this is not a case where more than one limitations period applies and \u201c \u2018the policy of repose is outweighed [in] the interests of justice ....\u2019 \u201d <em>Ritland, </em>260 Mont. at 458, 861 P.2d at 178 (quoting <em>Thiel, </em>218 Mont. at 212-13, 710 P.2d at 40).</p>\n<p id=\"AeY\">\u00b629 Our question now is whether an insurer\u2019s \u201cfirst lien\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA (1985), against any proceeds recovered in a third-party action by an injured employee constitutes a \u201cliability created by statute\u201d governed by the two-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 27-2-211(l)(c), MCA. We conclude that it does. We begin with the observation that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is a legislatively-created substitute for common law rights and remedies regarding workplace injuries. <em>See Raisler v. Burlington Northern R. Co. </em>(1985), 219 Mont. 254, 260, 717 P.2d 535, 538; <em>see also Shea v.

Missoula White Pine Sash Company </em>(1974), 164 Mont. 41, 518 P.2d 795, that \u201cany subrogation right the employer or its insurer possess is purely statutory\u201d and, therefore, is \u201cgoverned by the provisions of the Montana Workmen\u2019s Compensation <em>Act.\u201d Fisher, </em>164 Mont. at 44-45, 518 P.2d at 797. Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>Fisher, </em>this Court has properly characterized an insurer\u2019s right of subrogation under the Act as \u201cstatutorily given.\u201d <em>Butori v.

[it] gives rise to an obligation on the part of [the employer or insurer] to provide the worker with benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The employer or insurer in that case is called upon to make payments to the worker which really should be the burden and responsibility of the third-party tortfeasor. <em>It is a doctrine as old as equity that when a party is burdened by a debt or obligation that in natural justice, equity and good conscience should be paid by another, that party is subrogated to the rights of his payee to the extent of the payments made, as against the responsible party. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aol\"><em>Brandner v. Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1978), 179 Mont. 208, 213, 587 P.2d 933, 936-37, <em>overruled on other grounds by Francetich v. State Comp. Mut. Ins.

Anaconda Minerals Co. </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 472, 929 P.2d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b632 We acknowledge that, although the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act supplanted common law remedies regarding workplace injuries, rights of equitable subrogation would exist at common law in the absence of the statutory scheme. <em>See generally Skauge v. Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1977), 172 Mont. 521, 565 P.2d 628 (discussing common law equitable rights of subrogation). In <em>Hardware Mut. Casualty Co. v. Butler </em>(1944), 116 Mont. 73, 148 P.2d 563, this Court even went so far as to state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">Independent of any provision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the employer or the insurance carrier paying compensation would have the right to be subrogated to the claim of the injured work[er] as against a third party whose negligence was responsible for the injuries sustained by the work[er].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-7\"><em>Butler, </em>116 Mont. at 86, 148 P.2d at 568, <em>clarified as dictum by Fisher, </em>164 Mont. at 45, 518 P.2d at 797 (expressly disavowing the foregoing statement in <em>Butler </em>as \u201cdictum\u201d which \u201cshould be disregarded\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\u00b633  While we recognize that rights of equitable subrogation exist at common law, we nevertheless determine that the insurer\u2019s \u201cfirst lien\u201d against any third-party proceeds recovered by the injured em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ployee must be conceptually distinguished from the common law right of equitable subrogation. When drawing such a distinction, the insurer\u2019s lien created by \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA (1985), as against third-party proceeds recovered by the employee, constitutes a \u201cliability created by statute\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 27-2-211(l)(c), MCA, because it amounts to an unqualified right of <em>reimbursement </em>not found at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b634 The right of \u201csubrogation\u201d granted by \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985), must necessarily be read in reference to the Act as a whole:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">We must look at the subrogation rights provided by the Montana Act from the viewpoint that the employer has accepted liability without fault to the employee; that the employee\u2019s recovery against the employer is limited to the benefits under the Act; that the employer has given up its common law defenses if it does not come under the Act; and that the special provisions of the Act with respect to subrogation are designed to provide an incentive to the employee to seek reimbursement for his damages from a responsible party so that <em>the employer may be reimbursed in whole or in part out of any recovery made by the employee. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApRv\"><em>Cordier v. Stetson-Ross, Inc. </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 502, 515, 604 P.2d 86, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u00b635 It has been said that workers\u2019 compensation acts create statutory causes of action that are \u201cquite different from that of the common law.\u201d <em>Rideaux v. Torgrimson </em>(Cal. 1939), 86 P.2d 826, 827 (discussing provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of California). Thus, where a statutory workers\u2019 compensation scheme provides for a cause of action but fails to specify a particular statute of limitations, it generally has been held that \u201cthe limitation period applicable to liabilities created by statute applies to [the] action or proceeding ... .\u201d 54 C.J.S. <em>Limitations of Actions </em>\u00a7 73 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u00b636 However, the foregoing general rule pertaining to liabilities created by statute has no application when a workers\u2019 compensation insurer pursues a subrogation claim per <em>se. See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. v. Glassing </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 76, 887 P.2d 218. As we explained in <em>Glassing, </em>this is because the \u201cright of subrogation is purely derivative!;] the insurer succeeds only to the rights of the insured, and no new cause of action is created.\u201d <em>Glassing, </em>269 Mont. at 80, 887 P.2d at 220 (citation omitted). <em>See also Preferred Risk Mut. Ins. Co. v. Vargas </em>(Ariz. Ct. App. 1988), 754 P.2d 346, 348 (noting that subrogation does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>not constitute a claim for relief in and of itself, but rather, is equivalent to assignment of a preexisting claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b637  That is, \u201cthe concept of subrogation merely gives the insurer the <em>right to prosecute the cause of action </em>which the insured possessed against anyone legally responsible for the latter\u2019s harm....\u201d <em>Glassing, </em>269 Mont. at 80, 887 P.2d at 220-21 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Therefore, an insurer\u2019s claim by subrogation, being purely derivative, is subject to the same statute of limitations as though the cause of action were sued upon by the insured. <em>See Glassing, </em>269 Mont. at 82, 887 P.2d at 222 (holding that insurer\u2019s subrogation claim was barred by three-year statute of limitations applicable to negligence actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b638 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides for such a subrogation claim proper. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-414(3), MCA (1985) (providing that insurer may institute third-party action if employee fails to do so within one year of date of injury). Though the statute as a whole is loosely phrased in terms of \u201csubrogation,\u201d the insurer\u2019s right of subrogation <em>per se </em>provided for in subsection (3) must be distinguished from the insurer\u2019s \u201cfirst lien\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA (1985), which amounts to a statutory right of \u201creimbursement\u201d rather than a subrogation right in its classic sense. <em>See Cordier, </em>184 Mont. at 515, 604 P.2d at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b639 In that regard, we find instructive the Oklahoma Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>ACCOSIF v. American States Ins. Co. </em>(Okla. 2000), 1 P.3d 987. In <em>ACCOSIF, </em>after the insurer paid out workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the injured employee, the employee entered into a settlement with the third-party tortfeasor and its insurer. The workers\u2019 compensation insurer then filed claims against both the employee and the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer for reimbursement of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The insurer based its claims on Okla. Stat. 85 \u00a7 44 (1991), which, akin to \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985), provides that the employer or its insurer has a statutory entitlement to \u201creimbursement\u201d from any third-party proceeds recovered by the injured employee (less a proportionate share of the costs and fees of the action) for compensation that the insurer paid to the employee under Oklahoma\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Compare </em>Okla. Stat. 85 \u00a7 44(a) (1991), <em>with </em>\u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u00b640 The trial court in <em>ACCOSIF </em>dismissed the insurer\u2019s reimbursement action as a time-barred \u201csubrogation claim.\u201d On appeal, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed, holding that the action had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\u201cmistakenly characterized\u201d as one for subrogation when it was really a <em>\u201cstatute-basedpro tanto </em>recoupment demand.\u201d <em>ACCOSIF, </em>1 P.3d at 992-93. The court based its holding on the statutory scheme, noting that the terms of the Okla. State 85 \u00a7 44 (1991) \u201cfashion a key distinction between subrogation and the demand advanced in the present <em>case.\u201d ACCOSIF, 1 </em>P.3d at 992. While \u00a7 44(c) of the statute assigned to the workers\u2019 compensation insurer the paid employee\u2019s action against the third party, thus falling under the law\u2019s subrogation rubric, \u00a7 44(a) formed the basis of the insurer\u2019s claim for statutory recoupment or reimbursement from the third-party proceeds recovered by the employee. <em>See ACCOSIF, </em>1. P.3d at 990 n.2, 992 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u00b641 The court noted that \u201cstatutory recoupment is distinct from its common law namesake,\u201d which in modern legal usage has become known as the counterclaim. <em>ACCOSIF, </em>1 P.3d at 990 n.3. The Oklahoma Supreme Court held that since the plain language of \u00a7 44(a) rendered an injured employee who recovered against a third-party tortfeasor liable to the insurer for workers\u2019 compensation paid to the employee, this \u201cstatute-based\u201d liability fell under the limitations period for a liability created by statute other than a penalty or forfeiture. <em>ACCOSIF, 1 </em>P.3d at 993. <em>See also Nestle Food Co. v. American States Ins. Co., </em>(Okla. Ct. App. 8 P.3d 193) (applying ACCOSIF).</p>\n<p id=\"Ac7\">\u00b642  We reach the same result here. Section 39-71-414(1), MCA (1985), though phrased in terms of an \u201cinsurer\u2019s right of subrogation,\u201d amounts to a statutory right to reimbursement or recoupment as against proceeds recovered from a third-party tortfeasor. For purposes of the relevant statute of limitations, this statutory right of reimbursement must be distinguished from the insurer\u2019s right of subrogation proper as provided for in \u00a7 39-71-414(3), MCA (1985). Subrogation, in its common law sense, is the substitution of one person in place of the other, so that the person substituted succeeds to the rights of the other in relation to the debt or claim at issue. <em>See Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 526, 565 P.2d at 630. Subrogation, in the common law sense, is embodied in subsection (3), not subsection (1), of \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA (1985). We hold that a workers\u2019 compensation insurer\u2019s claim for statutory reimbursement brought pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA (1985), constitutes a \u201cliability created by statute\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 27-2-2 ll(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u00b643 Now we must determine when Royal\u2019s reimbursement claim accrued for purposes of determining whether it was timely filed. Under Montana law, a claim or cause of action accrues when all elements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the claim or cause exist or have occurred. Section 27-2-102(l)(a), MCA. We note that the <em>ACCOSIF </em>court determined that the moment the injured employee becomes entitled to proceeds from the third-party tortfeasor marks the time at which the insurer\u2019s right to reclaim its \u201cstatutorily prescribed compensation payout\u201d begins to run for purposes of the statute of limitations. <em>See ACCOSIF, </em>1 P.3d at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\u00b644  However, the parties in this case are in agreement that Roadarmel\u2019s February 18, 1994 notice to Royal of the successful completion of the third-party action triggered the start of the two-year limitations period of \u00a7 27-2-2 11(1)(c), MCA. To give Royal the benefit of the doubt, we assume without deciding that the statute of limitations began to run on February 18, 1994. From that date until the time Royal filed for determination of its statutory right to reimbursement, <em>3V2 </em>years elapsed. Thus, we hold that Royal\u2019s claim against Roadarmel based on a liability created by statute is time-barred under \u00a7 27-2-211(1)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\u00b645 Did the WCC err in concluding that the action by Royal against the attorney White is not barred by the three-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 72-34-511(l)(a), MCA, governing actions based upon an alleged breach of trust?</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">\u00b646 White contends that the three-year statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 72-34-511(l)(a), MCA, also bars any action Royal has against him based upon an alleged breach of trust. Before the WCC, Royal argued that White was personally liable for its subrogation interest since he was a \u201cconstructive trustee\u201d of the third-party funds recovered by Roadarmel. The WCC agreed with Royal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">Section 39-71-414, MCA, provided White with clear notice of the lien. His disbursement of amounts claimed by Royal \u2014 even while acknowledging Royal\u2019s interest in those amounts \u2014 is perplexing. His failure to acknowledge either of Edmiston\u2019s letters regarding the amount due Royal was discourteous and unprofessional.... Unless Royal\u2019s claim against him is barred by a statute of limitations, he is liable for the $63,864.79 due Royal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">\u00b647 While White\u2019s failure to respond may have been \u201cdiscourteous and unprofessional,\u201d Royal provides no reasonable explanation as to why it waited several years, after informing Roadarmel that it was going to bring an action for determination of its subrogation interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>to file its claim. We determine that the WCC erred, since Royal\u2019s claim against White is time-barred under the three-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 72-34-511(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b648 On appeal, Royal contends that if the three-year statute of limitations applies here, it did not begin running until White disclosed his breach of trust for the first time on March 13, 1998, when Royal learned through discovery that White had disbursed the third-party funds to Roadarmel in 1994. Royal relies on the language of the statute to bolster its claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">If a beneficiary has received an interim or final account in writing or other written report that adequately discloses the existence of a claim against the trustee for breach of trust, the claim is barred as to the beneficiary unless a proceeding to assert the claim is commenced within three years after receipt of the account or report. An <em>account or report adequately disclosed existence of the claim if it provides sufficient information so that the beneficiary knows of the claim or reasonably should have inquired into the existence of the claim. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Section 72-34-511(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">\u00b649 White responds that the letter of February 18, 1994, which set forth in writing the final account of the successful appeal of Roadarmel\u2019s third-party action, was the date on which the statute of limitations as to any alleged breach of trust began to run. Royal claims, however, that knowledge of the fact that a third-party recovery had been reached is not the same as knowledge that the claimant\u2019s attorney had violated the insurer\u2019s first lien by disbursing all of the settlement proceeds to his or her client.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">\u00b650  Ultimately, Royal\u2019s position is unavailing. As we determined under the first issue on appeal, Royal\u2019s claim against Roadarmel based on the \u201cfirst lien\u201d created by \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA (1985), is time-barred. Put differently, Royal\u2019s statutory lien was \u201cextinguished\u201d as a matter of law two years after it received the notice of February 18, 1994. <em>See ACCOSIF, </em>1 P.3d at 994. Royal concedes this point on appeal: \u201cthe insurer\u2019s first lien is only extinguished by the running of the statute of limitations on the principal obligation.\u201d Therefore, even assuming that Royal is correct in asserting that the three-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 72-34-511(l)(a), MCA, did not begin to run until 1998, by that point in time White could no longer be characterized as a trustee, constructive or otherwise, of the third-party proceeds. Alternatively, if we assume that the three-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>statute of limitations began to rim in 1994, Royal\u2019s action against White was untimely as it was filed <em>3V2 </em>years after Royal was put on notice of successful completion of Roadarmel\u2019s third-party action against Exxon and Great Western Chemical.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b651 Royal\u2019s reimbursement claim against Roadarmel is barred by the two-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 27-2-211(l)(c), MCA, and Royal\u2019s breach of trust claim against White is similarly barred by the three-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 72-34-511(1)(a), MCA. Where, as here, all of the facts bearing on the resolution of legal issues are before this Court, we have the authority to reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and direct it to enter summary judgment in favor of the other party. <em>See Swank v.

In resolving Issue I, the Court concludes that Royal\u2019s subrogation right is entirely dependent upon \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA, and thus the two-year statute of limitations applicable to statutory rights is controlling. I agree that \u00a7 39-71-414, MCA, is the source of Royal\u2019s subrogation rights. However, that statutory provision envisions that the parties may agree or contract on the terms of implementing the statutory liability. Section 39-7l-414(2)(b), MCA, provides that, \u201c[t]he injured employee may request that the insurer pay a proportionate share of the reasonable cost of the action, including attorney fees.\u201d I note that the statute does not say the injured employee can \u201cdemand\u201d a proportionate share; rather he may \u201crequest.\u201d It leaves the parties free to determine what constitutes a \u201cproportionate share;\u201d what are \u201creasonable costs\u201d and-to agree upon whether those reasonable costs will be paid up front or in the final accounting. Accordingly, the statute invites a hybrid contractual/statutory arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">\u00b654 As the WCC noted, on June 2,1989, Mr. White wrote to Royal\u2019s attorney as follows: \u201cWe would also <em>agree </em>to your client, Royal Insurance Company\u2019s participation in the action against Exxon and Great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Western Chemical with the $5,000 cost advancement.\u201d On June 6, 1989, Royal\u2019s attorney replied, writing in relevant part: \u201cThe insurer <em>accepts your offer </em>to fully participate in the third party action against Exxon and Great Western Chemical by paying a $5,000.00 cost advancement. No other cost advancements will be required of Royal Insurance in order to fully participate.\u201d Thus, by way of an offer and acceptance, the parties clearly \u201cagreed\u201d that $5,000 was a proportionate share of \u201creasonable costs.\u201d Furthermore, despite the fact that the statute does not require that such reasonable costs be paid up front, the parties agreed that Royal would \u201cadvance\u201d the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b655 Where the parties enter into an agreement settling a legal claim and the agreement is supported by consideration, that agreement constitutes a contract and is enforceable as such. <em>Heatherington v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 395, 849 P.2d 1039. The WCC correctly concluded that Royal and White, an attorney for Roadarmel, entered into an enforceable contract. Thus the applicable statute of limitations is the five- or eight-year period specified in \u00a7 27-2-202, MCA. Since the petition was filed within five years after Roadarmel\u2019s judgment against Great Western was paid, I would hold that it was timely and Royal is entitled to enforce its subrogation interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u00b656 I also dissent as to the resolution of Issue II: Did the WCC err in concluding that the action by Royal against the attorney White is not barred by the three-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 72-34-511(l)(a), MCA, governing actions based upon an alleged breach of trust?</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u00b657 Royal argues that the three-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 72-34-5 ll(l)(a), MCA, did not begin to run until White disclosed his breach of trust for the first time on March 13, 1998, when Royal learned through discovery that White had disbursed the third-party funds to Roadarmel in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u00b658 The Court, relying on its resolution of Issue I, concludes that Royal\u2019s claim against Roadarmel based on the \u201cfirst lien\u201d created by \u00a7 39-71-414(1), MCA, was extinguished as a matter of law two years after it received the notice of February 4,1994. Thus, after that point in time (February 4,1996), White could no longer be characterized as a trustee, constructive or otherwise, of the third-party proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">\u00b659 Since I disagree with the Court\u2019s application of the two-year statute of limitations in resolving the first issue, I also disagree with its conclusion as to Issue II. As indicated above, I would affirm the WCC in applying the longer five- to eight-year statute of limitations to this hybrid contractual/statutory obligation. Accordingly, I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>hold that White was still a trustee as of 1998 when the alleged 1994 breach of trust was first disclosed. Thus, Royal\u2019s petitions with regard to the breach of trust were timely filed under \u00a7 72-34-511(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u00b660 I would affirm the WCC on both Issues I and II.</p>\n<judges id=\"b558-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE GRAY join in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
