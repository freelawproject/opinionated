DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287. We review conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they are correct. <em>See Steer, Inc. v. Dept. of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-18\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b337-19\">\u00b67 In April, 1995 Helena Coach House Partnership (hereafter, the Partnership) entered an agreement to sell Philip Keating (Keating) the King\u2019s Carriage Inn, a motel in Helena. The agreement required that Keating invest $70,000 for \u201cbuilding improvements and/or reno<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>vations\u201d within one year of the closing and that Keating keep the property free of liens and encumbrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b68 Keating hired Gordon Burns (Gordon) to renovate the motel\u2019s swimming pool. As that work neared completion, Keating and Gordon orally agreed that Gordon would perform maintenance and repairs and be on call for the motel at all times. Keating gave Gordon a salary and a room at the motel. On December 1,1995 Gordon was terminated from his employment. Gordon performed no additional repairs or maintenance services for the motel after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b69 Keating also reached an oral agreement with Gordon\u2019s brother, P. Sean Burns (Sean), to perform heating and air conditioning maintenance and repair services at the motel. Sean\u2019s compensation included a salary and the use of a house located on the motel\u2019s property. Sean testified that he last performed maintenance services for Keating at some point in December, 1995. In January, 1996 Keating \u201cleft the Helena area, leasing the motel to Steve and Barbara Stolp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b610 On April 1,1996 Gordon and Sean filed construction liens for $48,539.19 and $7,403.30, respectively. In June of 1996 the Partnership notified Keating that he was in default of their agreement because he had allowed the aforementioned liens to encumber the property and because he had failed to pay property taxes. Keating failed to cure the default. The Partnership repossessed the motel and posted a cash construction lien bond in order to sell a portion of the motel property. In March, 1998 Gordon and Sean filed a complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the Partnership, seeking judgment against the bond pursuant to \u00a7 71-3-553, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b611 A trial to the bench was held in March, 1999. The District Court determined that Gordon\u2019s lien was not timely filed and that Sean had not met his burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he had a valid lien. The District Court ruled in favor of the Partnership. From that judgment and order Gordon and Sean appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">\u00b612 1. Whether the District Court erred in determining that Gordon and Sean Burns did not have valid construction liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">\u00b613 Section 71-3-535, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Attachment of lien \u2014 filing. (1) A person\u2019s lien does not attach and may not be enforced unless, <em>after entering into the contract under which the lien arises, </em>the person <em>has filed a lien not later than 90 days </em>after:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">(a) the person\u2019s final furnishing of services or materials .... Section 71-3-535, MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\n<em>A. Whether Gordon Burns\u2019 lien was timely filed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u00b614 The Burnses argue that the District Court\u2019s finding that Gordon Burns did not timely file his lien is clearly erroneous. The Burnses assert that Gordon Burns provided \u201cmaterials\u201d in the form of tools to the motel after December 31, 1995, thereby bringing him within the scope of \u00a7 71-3-535, MCA\u2019s requirement that a lien be filed not later than 90 days after the \u201cfinal furnishing of services or materials.\u201d Section 71-3-535, MCA. The Burnses also assert that the evidence they presented shifted the burden of persuasion to the Partnership and that the Partnership failed to present \u201ca shred of evidence to defeat the claims of any of the Appellants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u00b615 The Partnership responds that the District Court\u2019s finding that Gordon was terminated from his employment on December 1, 1995 and that he performed no additional repair and maintenance services thereafter is supported by Gordon\u2019s own testimony. Further, the Partnership argues that Gordon did not leave tools with the motel pursuant to his agreement with Keating.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\u00b616  We conclude that substantial credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Gordon failed to timely file his construction lien. Gordon testified that he last provided services to Keating on December 13,1995. On redirect, Gordon\u2019s counsel asked him \u201cwhy the December 31st date is stated in the notice of lien as the last day?\u201d Gordon responded that \u201c[t]hey [staff at the motel] were still using some of my tools up until that date. In fact, beyond that date.\u201d On cross-examination, however, Gordon conceded that his services had been terminated before December 31, 1995 and that he had no agreement with Keating to be paid for the use of his tools after his services were terminated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">Q. Was it [leaving tools at the motel] gratuitous on your part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\">Q. So what were you going to be paid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">A. I couldn\u2019t decide on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\">Q. Did you talk to Mr. Keating about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-15\">A. No, Mr. Keating had his hands full at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Q. Okay. Now, did you have a new agreement with him as to what he\u2019d pay you for your tools?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Gordon testified further that he told Stolp, but not Keating, that he was leaving tools on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b617 Thus, Gordon\u2019s own testimony established that he ceased providing services to the motel well before December 31,1995, a critical date for purposes of \u00a7 71-3-535, MCA\u2019s ninety-day requirement because Gordon\u2019s hen was filed on April 1,1996. Further, Gordon testified that he did not leave tools on the premises of the motel pursuant to his agreement with Keating. We therefore reject the Burnses\u2019 contention that the tools Gordon left at the motel were a \u201cfinal furnishing of services or materials\u201d pursuant to \u201cthe contract [with Keating] under which the lien arf\u00f3se].\u201d Section 71-3-535, MCA. We hold that the District Court did not err in finding that Gordon\u2019s construction lien was not timely filed and in concluding that he did not have a valid lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\n<em>B. Whether Sean Burns met his burden of proof that he filed a valid lien.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u00b618 The Burnses argue that the District Court\u2019s findings regarding Sean are not supported by substantial evidence. Noting that Sean\u2019s notice and claim of lien stated that his last furnishing of services or materials occurred on March 31,1996, the Burnses contend that Sean last performed services in March of 1996 \u201cat the behest of the motel lessee\u201d and that the filing of his lien on April 1, 1996 was therefore timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\u00b619 The Partnership responds that Sean \u201ccould not or would not testify as to when in Decembert,] 1995 he last performed services at the request of Keating.\u201d The Partnership argues that Sean only claimed a lien for work that he performed on behalf of Keating and that his lien claim does not extend to work that he performed for Stolp. Further, the Partnership argues that the District Court correctly concluded that although Sean \u201cmay have been able to file additional liens securing payment for [work that he did at the request of Stolp],\u201d he failed to file such liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\u00b620 We agree. Although Sean testified that the last servicing he performed for Keating occurred in December, 1995, he could not recall when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">Q. What day in December?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>A. Well, too many days. 31 of them. One of those days. Like I said, there\u2019s not a set date. You know, you go in on the 5th, you work 5th and 6th. Maybe go in on the 11th until you get them serviced. I serviced what was supposed to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-3\">Q. All I\u2019m saying, you don\u2019t know what day in December you performed the last services in that month?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">A. No sir, I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Further, Sean testified that Stolp first began to manage the motel in January, 1996 and that he and Stolp did not agree to continue his services:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">Q. Now, I take it, then, that when Steve Stolp took over, you and he sat down and agreed that you were to continue the service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">A. No. He said \u2014 his word was he would give me as much work as he possibly could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">Q. Oh, so he gave\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">A. He never said one way or the other. He actually \u2014 he never sent me anything saying my contract was terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Thus, Sean\u2019s testimony established that after December, 1995 the servicing he performed was at the behest of Stolp, not Keating.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">\u00b621 We conclude that Sean failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he performed work pursuant to his agreement with Keating on or after December 31, 1995, which again was the dispositive date for purposes of \u00a7 71-3-535, MCA\u2019s ninety-day filing requirement. Sean testified only that he worked \u201c[o]ne of those days [in December];\u201d he offered no testimony about the 31st of December that would make it more likely than not that he worked for Keating on that date. We note, moreover, that Sean could not tack the period of time when he worked for Stolp to the period when he worked for Keating in order to establish the validity of his lien. <em>See Frank J. Trunk &amp; Son, Inc. v. DeHaan </em>(1964), 143 Mont. 442, 446, 391 P.2d 353, 355 (rejecting argument that subcontractor could tack \u201ctime period of a subsequent contract entered into between the subcontractor and the owner to the time period of the original prime contract\u201d to establish that lien timely filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">\u00b622  The District Court correctly concluded that Sean failed to meet his burden that he filed his lien within ninety days of Sean Burns\u2019 \u201cfinal furnishing of services or materials\u201d pursuant to \u201cthe contract [with Keating] under which the lien ar[ose].\u201d Section 71-3-535, MCA. In light of this record, the Burnses\u2019 contention that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>they met and shifted their burden of persuasion to the Partnership concerning the validity of their liens is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b623 2. Whether Respondent waived the defense of timeliness by failing to assert it as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b624 We begin with the pertinent record. In paragraph 8 of their Complaint, the Burnses alleged that \u201c[pjlaintiffs filed notices of liens on the property commonly known as King\u2019s Carriage Inn which is more particularly described in the attached liens on April 1,1996 and this action commenced within the time prescribed by \u00a7 71-3-562, M.C.A.\u201d In their Answer, the Partnership responded that \u201c[defendant admits that Plaintiffs filed notices of liens and admits that this action was filed within two years of those filings, but denies that any of said filings constitute a valid lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b625 The Burnses contend that the Partnership waived the issue of the timeliness of their lien filings \u201cby failing to affirmatively plead the issue.\u201d Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brown v. Ehlert </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 140, 841 P.2d 510, the Burnses argue that the timeliness of a construction lien is an affirmative defense and an avoidance that the Partnership failed to plead affirmatively as required by Rule 8(c), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u00b626 The Partnership responds that there is no legal requirement that the timeliness of a lien be affirmatively pleaded and that timeliness is not an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c), M.R.Civ.P. Further, the Partnership argues that the Burnses had ample notice of the defense of timeliness and that timeliness was raised by both parties as an issue of fact and by the Partnership as a contention in the Pretrial Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">\u00b627 Rule 8(c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">Affirmative defenses. In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, <em>and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Rule 8(c), M.R.Civ.P. (emphasis added). Thus, under Rule 8(c), M.R.Civ.P., the issue is whether the timeliness of the Burnses\u2019 liens is an affirmative defense or avoidance that the Partnership had to plead affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>\u00b628 The Burnses concede that the untimeliness of a lien\u2019s filing is not mentioned in Rule 8(c), M.R.Civ.R\u2019s list of affirmative defenses. Citing our decision in <em>Ehlert, </em>the Burnses note that Rule 8(c), M.R.Civ.P.\u2019s list of affirmative defenses is not an exhaustive list. They are correct. However, their observation does not dispose of the question whether the timeliness of a lien\u2019s filing must be affirmatively pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\">\u00b629 We conclude that <em>Ehlert </em>does not support the Burnses\u2019 contention that the timeliness of a lien\u2019s filing must be affirmatively pleaded. In <em>Ehlert </em>we determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">The essence of affirmative defenses is to concede that while the plaintiff otherwise may have a good cause of action, the cause of action no longer exists because some statute or rule permits defendant to avoid liability for the acts alleged. Under these principles, exclusivity and co-employee immunity under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act clearly constitute affirmative defenses. They do not go to the merits of Brown\u2019s personal injury complaint; rather, they assert that the Act protects Ehlert from liability for the very acts alleged by Brown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><em>Ehlert, </em>255 Mont. at 146, 841 P.2d at 514. In raising the timeliness of the construction liens, the Partnership did not \u201cconcede that while the [Burnses] otherwise may have a good cause of action, the cause of action no longer exists because [\u00a7 71-3-535, MCA] permits [the Partnership] to avoid liability for the acts alleged.\u201d <em>Ehlert, </em>255 Mont. at 146, 841 P.2d at 514. Rather, the defense of timeliness went \u201cto the merits of [the Burnses\u2019] complaint,\u201d because timeliness is an element of the Burnses\u2019 claim under \u00a7 71-3-535, MCA. <em>Ehlert, </em>255 Mont. at 146, 841 P.2d at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b630 One commentator has addressed whether defenses omitted from federal Rule 8(c) must be affirmatively pleaded and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJn\">in determining what defenses other than those listed in Rule 8(c) must be pleaded affirmatively, resort often must be had to considerations of policy, fairness, and in some cases, probability.... \u201cFairness\u201d should probably be viewed as a shorthand expression reflecting the judgment that all or most of the relevant information on a particular element of a claim is within the control of one party or that one party has a unique nexus with the issue in question and therefore that party should bear the burden of affirmatively raising the matter.... Another highly relevant consideration is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>plaintiff will be taken by surprise by the assertion at trial of a defense not pleaded affirmatively by defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">5 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2nd \u00a7 1271 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b631 In the present case, the Partnership\u2019s pleading of timeliness did not implicate considerations of fairness or surprise for the Burnses. Whether the Burnses timely filed their liens concerned relevant information \u201cwithin the control of [the Burnses].\u201d 5 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2nd \u00a7 1271 (1990). Further, \u00a7 71-3-535, MCA\u2019s ninety-day filing requirement gave the Burnses notice that they had to establish the validity of their liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b632 In <em>Sterrett v. Milk River Credit </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 459, 764 P.2d 467, we distinguished affirmative defenses from negative defenses and concluded that Rule 8(b), M.R.Civ.P., \u201cis concerned with negative defenses \u2014 those that controvert the adversary\u2019s claim. Rule 8(c), on the other hand, is concerned with affirmative defenses \u2014 the pleading of matter that is not within the claimant\u2019s prima facie case.\u201d <em>Sterrett, </em>234 Mont. at 463-64, 764 P.2d at 469 (citation omitted). In the present case, the Partnership\u2019s specific denial that the Burnses\u2019 lien filings constituted valid liens was a negative defense that \u201cwarned [the Burnses] that they must prove [the validity of their liens] as part of [their] prima facie <em>case.\u201d Sterrett, </em>234 Mont. at 464, 764 P.2d at 470 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b633  The Partnership\u2019s Answer appropriately underscored the Burnses\u2019 burden of proof regarding the validity of their liens, a lien claimant\u2019s burden that we have previously recognized. <em>See Tri-County Plumbing v. Levee Restorations </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 403, 409, 720 P.2d 247, 251 (citation omitted) (emphasis added) (concluding that \u201cunder Montana law a mechanic\u2019s lien claimant does not have a right to a lien until he can prove or show his lien. <em>\u2018The burden is upon the plaintiff to establish his </em>lien\u2019...\u201d). We hold that the Partnership did not have to affirmatively plead the timeliness of the filing of the Burnses\u2019 liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">\u00b634 The Burnses also argue that the Partnership is collaterally estopped from contesting the validity of their liens. The Burnses assert in essence that the Partnership\u2019s default action against Keating \u201cnecessarily decided\u201d the validity of their liens. The Burnses\u2019 conclusory assertion is without merit; they have made no showing why the general rule \u201cthat a default judgment generally carries no collateral estoppel effect\u201d does not apply in the present case. <em>Lane v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>Farmers Union Ins., </em>1999 MT 252, \u00b6 36, 296 Mont. 267, \u00b6 36, 989 P.2d 309, \u00b6 36 (citations omitted). <em>See also In re Palmer </em>(9th Cir. 2000), 207 F.3d 566, 568 (citations omitted) (recognizing \u201cthat a default judgment is generally not entitled to collateral estoppel effect because there is no actual litigation of issues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b635 Finally, we note the Burnses\u2019 argument that the District Court abused its discretion by \u201cnot interpreting the construction lien statutes liberally in favor of the Appellants and applying principles of equity.\u201d As the procedural requirements of lien statutes are strictly enforced, the Burnses\u2019 argument necessarily assumes that the timeliness of a lien is not a procedural requirement. <em>Compare Swain v. Battershell, </em>1999 MT 101, \u00b6 26, 294 Mont. 282, \u00b6 26, 983 P.2d 873, \u00b6 26 (concluding \u201c[t]his Court has consistently held that the procedural requirements of construction lien statutes will be strictly construed\u201d). The Burnses are mistaken; \u00a7 71-3-535, MCA\u2019s ninety-day filing requirement is an express procedure that claimants must follow to establish valid liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b636  The Burnses failed to satisfy the <em>procedural </em>requirement that their liens be timely filed. Having failed to establish the validity of their liens, they cannot avail themselves of the remedial purpose of the construction lien statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b637 The judgment of the District Court is Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b345-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-11\">.
