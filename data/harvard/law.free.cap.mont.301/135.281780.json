On April <em>15, </em>1987, he was sentenced to death for each of the three counts of aggravated kidnaping which resulted in the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the victim. His conviction was appealed to this Court and affirmed in <em>State v. Dawson </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 345, 761 P.2d 352, <em>cert. denied, Dawson v. Montana </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 910, 109 S. Ct. 3200, 105 L.Ed.2d 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b62 On January 16,1991, Dawson filed a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA, in the District Court in which he was convicted. On March 25,1991, Dawson filed an amended petition for postconviction relief. In that petition, he claimed 30 separate grounds for relief. All but one claim, ineffective assistance of counsel, were dismissed by the District Court by summary judgment. On August 5,1993, following withdrawal of his appellate counsel, Jeff Renz, Dawson filed a second amended petition for postconviction relief which added a 31st ground for relief: ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Following an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied Dawson\u2019s second amended petition for postconviction relief on February 7,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b63 Dawson appeals from the District Court\u2019s orders which granted partial summary judgment of his amended petition for postconviction relief and denied his second amended petition for postconviction relief. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b64 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u00b65 1. Did the District Court err when it held that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel during the pretrial phase?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u00b66 2. Did the District Court err when it held that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial phase?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">\u00b67 3. Did the District Court err when it held that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase?</p>\n<p id=\"AVt\">\u00b68 4. Did the District Court err when it held that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel during the direct appeal phase?</p>\n<p id=\"Asr\">\u00b69 5. Did the District Court err when it denied Dawson\u2019s claims 1-29 by summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">\u00b610 6. Should this Court reconsider issues in a postconviction proceeding which were previously decided on direct appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">\u00b611 The Petitioner, David Dawson, raised the following claims as violations of his constitutional and statutory rights in his amended petition for postconviction relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-14\">1. The District Court failed to appoint a psychiatrist to assist the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>2. The District Court ordered that the mental health experts appointed in response to the defense request for a mental examination, report to the court and prosecutor as well as the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">3. The District Court limited the mental examination to competency and mental issues related to guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">4. The state employed psychiatrist and psychologist failed to warn Dawson that he could remain silent and that his statements and test results could be used against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">5. The state employed psychiatrist and psychologist failed to warn Dawson that the interview would exceed the scope of the court\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">6. The state employed psychiatrist and psychologist failed to warn Dawson that he had the right to have counsel present during the history taking and testing phases of the mental evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">7. The prosecutor used the testimony of the court-appointed psychologist at the guilt phase of the trial to establish the petitioner\u2019s mental state and lack of remorse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">8. The District Court relied on the mental health report and testimony of the state employed psychologist, Dr. Van Hassel, in finding the non-statutory aggravating factor of lack of remorse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">9. Section 46-14-401, MCA (1985), as applied to Dawson, is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\">10. The State failed to preserve mitigating or exculpatory evidence by waiting to draw Dawson\u2019s bodily fluids until 12 hours following his arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-12\">11. The state probation officer failed to advise Dawson that he did not have to submit to the pre-sentence interview, and that anything he said could be used against him during sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-13\">12. The pre-sentence report failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-111, and -112 (1985), MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-14\">13. The District Court failed to give weight to non-statutory mitigating circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-15\">14. The District Court failed to consider the mitigating circumstances as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-16\">15. The District Court failed to consider the mitigating circumstances as a whole when comparing the mitigating circumstances with the aggravating factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-17\">16. Section 46-18-305, MCA (1985), as applied to Dawson, is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>17. The District Court failed to consider other mitigating circumstances of which there was substantial evidence in the record of their existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">18. The District Court and the Supreme Court interpreted \u00a7 46-18-303, MCA (1985), the statute which enumerates the aggravating factors, too broadly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">19. The District Court imposed the Sentence of death as a result of passion and prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">20. The District Court failed to make independent findings of fact and conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">21. The District Court\u2019s findings establish that the District Court believed the crime to be so serious that it could never find that any evidence of mitigating circumstances would be sufficient to warrant leniency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">22. The District Court reacted emotionally to the testimony of Amy Rodstein in the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">23. The sentence of death by hanging is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">24. The District Court failed to provide Dawson with a jury trial on the issue of whether there were aggravating circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">25. The District Court erred when it concluded that Dawson was not subject to rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-12\">26. The District Court erred when it concluded that Dawson would be a danger to others in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-13\">27. The State failed to disclose evidence and used inaccurate testimony at the trial and sentencing hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-14\">28. The District Court erred when it precluded the testimony of relevant defense witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-15\">29. The prosecutor made improper comments during closing argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-16\">30. Dawson was denied effective assistance of counsel by his trial counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">\u00b612 On May 20,1991, the State filed a motion for partial summary judgment based on its contention that Dawson\u2019s claims 1-29 were procedurally barred, either by res judicata or by \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. The District Court granted the State\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on September 16,1992. On March 15,1993, Dawson\u2019s appellate counsel, Jeff Renz, requested and was granted permission to withdraw as Dawson\u2019s appellate counsel. Following Renz\u2019s withdrawal, Dawson requested and was granted leave to file a second amended petition for postconviction relief. Dawson filed his second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>amended petition on August 5,1993, which added the following claim to his previous 30 claims for relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">31. Dawson was denied effective assistance of counsel by his appellate counsel for failing to raise petitioner\u2019s claims 1 - 29, inclusive, as issues on petitioner\u2019s direct appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b613 On October 5,1992, Dawson filed a motion for reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment based on his contention that 9 of the 29 claims dismissed by partial summary judgment, required the presentation of evidence which was not part of the record of the first trial in this case and could not reasonably have been raised on direct appeal and, therefore, were not subject to the procedural bar of \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. On January 26,</p>\n<p id=\"AKM\">1993, the District Court denied Dawson\u2019s motion for reconsideration. \u00b614 On February 14 and 15,1994, the District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-201, MCA, to consider the claims set forth in Dawson\u2019s second amended petition for postconviction relief. Several witnesses testified at the hearing, however, the District Court refused to consider four affidavits submitted by Dawson in support of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b615 On February 8,1996, the District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order denying Dawson\u2019s second amended petition for postconviction relief. Dawson filed a notice of appeal with this Court on April 5,1996. On appeal, one of Dawson\u2019s contentions was that the District Court erred when it refused to consider the four affidavits he submitted in support of his petition for postconviction relief. On December 12, 1997, without deciding the merits of Dawson\u2019s appeal, we entered an order which required the District Court to accept and consider Dawson\u2019s four affidavits and any affidavits the State might file in response. Following consideration of the affidavits, we ordered the District Court to issue any additional findings it deemed necessary along with a memorandum stating the effect the additional evidence had on its prior decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b616 On March 8,1999, the District Court entered its additional findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order in response to our order. Following its consideration of the new evidence, the District Court again denied Dawson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u00b617 Specific facts which served as the basis for the Petitioner\u2019s conviction and his sentence to death will be discussed where appropriate to the issues we now consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Bone v. State </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 293, 302, 944 P.2d 734, 739-40. When reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous, we apply the following criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">(1) the Court will determine whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence; (2) if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, the Court will determine if the trial court has misapprehended the evidence; and (3) if the findings are supported by substantial evidence and that evidence has not been misapprehended, this Court may still find a finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, a review of the record leaves the court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\"><em>Bone, </em>284 Mont. at 302-03, 944 P.2d at 740 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b619 With respect to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, Dawson argues that the proper standard of review is a de novo review of the District Court\u2019s decision. Dawson asserts that because a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of law and fact, this Court must conduct a de novo review. However, there is no authority in Montana which supports Dawson\u2019s position. To the contrary, in <em>Bone, </em>we applied the standard of review previously set forth, to Bone\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Bone, </em>284 Mont. at 302-03, 944 P.2d at 740. Accordingly, we will apply the standard of review set forth in <em>Bone </em>to Dawson\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u00b620  A petitioner seeking to reverse a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel bears a heavy burden. <em>See Brown v. State </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 430, 434, 922 P.2d 1146, 1148. In considering ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings, we apply the two-pronged test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>See Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 10, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6 10, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b6 10. <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>two-part test requires that the defendant must show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>deprived the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. Pursuant to <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b621 In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court also stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Although we have discussed the performance component of an ineffectiveness claim prior to the prejudice component, there is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the inquiry in the same order or even to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.... The object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel\u2019s performance. If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u00b622 Did the District Court err when it held that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel during the pretrial phase?</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u00b623 Dawson asserts that his defense counsel, John Adams, Allen Beck, and Gary Wilcox, rendered ineffective assistance during the pretrial phase. First, Dawson asserts that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to object to the procedure and subsequent use of Dawson\u2019s psychiatric evaluation at Montana State Hospital. Second, Dawson contends that his counsel were ineffective for their failure to advise him of his rights during the psychiatric evaluation process or to otherwise protect those rights. Third, Dawson asserts that his counsel were ineffective for their failure to conduct an adequate pretrial investigation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">a. <em>Failure to object to the preparation and use of the Montana State Hospital psychiatric evaluation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">\u00b624 Dawson asserts that the District Court erred when it concluded that his counsel did not render ineffective assistance when they failed to object to the methods used to prepare and subsequently disseminate the Montana State Hospital psychiatric evaluation to the District Court and the State, as well as the defense. Dawson contends that his counsel failed to secure the confidential psychiatric eval\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tion and assistance to which he was entitled pursuant to <em>Ake v. Oklahoma </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 68, 105 S. Ct. 1087, 84 L.E.2d 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b625 In response, the State contends that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s actions were in accord with \u00a7\u00a7 46-14-201 to -213, MCA (1985), the relevant Montana statutory scheme in effect at the time of Dawson\u2019s counsel's request for the mental health evaluation, and at the time of Dawson\u2019s trial. Additionally, the State asserts that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s actions were in accord with the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision at that time in <em>State v. Smith </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 453, 705 P.2d 1110, which was based on the <em>Ake </em>decision, and upheld Montana\u2019s statutory scheme. The State argues that the 1990 interpretation <em>o\u00ed Ake </em>by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Smith v. McCormick </em>(9th Cir. 1990), 914 F.2d 1153, is not a valid basis for an ineffective assistance claim, because it would require this Court to judge the actions of Dawson\u2019s counsel on the basis of hindsight.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b626 In concluding that Dawson\u2019s counsel did not render ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to object to the psychiatric evaluation procedure, the District Court found that Dawson\u2019s counsel acted appropriately according to the status of the law at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b627 The relevant statutory scheme in April 1986, at the time Dawson\u2019s psychiatric evaluation was ordered, included the following relevant provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">46-14-202. Psychiatric examination of defendant. (1) If the defendant or his counsel files a written notice of his intent to rely on a mental disease or defect under 46-14-201 or raises the issue of his fitness to proceed, the court shall appoint at least one qualified psychiatrist or shall request the superintendent of the Montana state hospital to designate at least one qualified psychiatrist, which designation may be or include himself, to examine and report upon the mental condition of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">46-14-203. Report of the examination. (1) The report of the examination shall include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">(a) a description of the nature of the examination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">(b) a diagnosis of the mental condition of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-12\">(c) if the defendant suffers from a mental disease or defect, an opinion as to his capacity to understand the proceedings against him and to assist in his own defense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>(d) when directed by the court, an opinion as to the capacity of the defendant to have a particular state of mind which is an element of the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">(3) The report of the examination shall be filed in triplicate with the clerk of court, who shall deliver copies to the county attorney and to counsel for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">46-14-213. Psychiatric testimony upon trial. (1) Upon the trial, any psychiatrist who reported under 46-14-202 and 46-14-203 may be called as a witness by the prosecution or by the defense ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">(2) When a psychiatrist or other expert who has examined the defendant testifies concerning the defendant\u2019s mental condition, he may make a statement as to the nature of his examination, his diagnosis of the mental condition of the defendant at the time of the commission of the offense charged, and his opinion as to the ability of the defendant to have a particular state of mind which is an element of the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The procedure followed and the use of Dawson\u2019s psychiatric evaluation were consistent with the statutory procedure in effect at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u00b628 Nevertheless, Dawson argues that, regardless of Montana\u2019s statutory scheme, pursuant to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Afee, he was entitled to an evaluation by an independent psychiatrist who would \u201cassist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\u201d Ake, 470 U.S. at 83, 105 S. Ct. at 1096. Moreover, Dawson asserts that, pursuant to Afee, his counsel were ineffective for not objecting to the procedure because the evaluation he received was available for use by both the prosecution and the defense, and because it was done by a neutral psychiatrist, rather than one assigned to assist solely in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u00b629 In Afee, the United States Supreme Court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atm\">[W]hen a defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial, the State must, at a minimum , assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense. This is not to say, of course, that the indigent defendant has a constitutional right to choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>or to receive funds to hire his own. Our concern is that the indigent defendant have access to a competent psychiatrist for the purpose we have discussed, and as in the case of the provision of counsel we leave to the State the decision on how to implement this right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQc\"><em>Ake, </em>470 U.S. at 83, 105 S. Ct. at 1096. Additionally, the Supreme Court, <em>in Ake, </em>referred to the Montana statutory scheme in a footnote to the following sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\">Many States, as well as the Federal Government, currently make psychiatric assistance available to indigent defendants, and they have not found the financial burden so great as to preclude this assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><em>Ake, </em>470 U.S. at 79, 105 S. Ct. at 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b630 Finally, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Smith </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 453, 705 P.2d 1110, while distinguishing <em>Ake </em>on several grounds, concluded that Smith was afforded the rights set forth in <em>Ake, </em>through the appointment of a neutral psychiatrist. Although the Ninth Circuit Court subsequently concluded, in <em>Smith v. McCormick </em>(9th Cir. 1990), 914 F.2d 1153, that our holding in <em>State v. Smith </em>did not satisfy due process as contemplated <em>in Ake, </em>that opinion was not issued until 1990, four years after Dawson\u2019s evaluation and three years after his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u00b631 In <em>Strickland, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP5\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">\u00b632  We conclude that at the time of Dawson\u2019s evaluation it was reasonable for Dawson\u2019s counsel to believe that Montana\u2019s statutory scheme was consistent with the <em>Ake </em>decision. Additionally, because there was no language in <em>Ake </em>which addressed the dissemination or utilization of the psychiatric evaluation, Dawson\u2019s counsel had no reason to question Montana\u2019s statutory scheme in that regard. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson\u2019s counsel did not render ineffective assistance of counsel because they failed to object to the procedures for and use of Dawson\u2019s psychiatric evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">\u00b633 It is also important to note that Dawson did have access to a second mental health expert, Dr. John Watkins, who was chosen by Dawson. Dr. Watkins was an independent psychiatrist, who was ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>pointed prior to trial solely to assist the defense and none of the information developed through or by Dr. Watkins was furnished to the State or the District Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">b. <em>Failure to advise Dawson of his rights during the Montana State Hospital evaluation and to ensure that Dawson\u2019s rights were protected.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b634 Dawson argues that the District Court erred when it concluded that his counsel did not render ineffective assistance when they failed to advise him of his rights during the Montana State Hospital evaluation and to ensure that his rights were protected. First, Dawson asserts that his counsel should have informed him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Second, Dawson argues that his counsel should not have advised him to cooperate during his psychiatric evaluation. Third, Dawson argues that his counsel should have informed him of his right to counsel during his psychiatric evaluation. Fourth, Dawson asserts that his counsel should have objected to the testimony of Dr.Van Hassel in the State\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b635 The District Court concluded that these issues \u201cwere handled appropriately from the perspective of counsel at the time with the status of the law at the time.\u201d The District Court based its conclusion on the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">[Djefense counsel appropriately recognized that there might be mental health issues in the case and that an evaluation of their client should be completed to determine whether there was an existing mental disease or defect which would preclude the defendant from appropriately participating in his defense or having a sufficient state of mind to be determined guilty of the offense. The evaluation could have benefitted Dawson. The fact that the evaluation ultimately did not benefit him could not necessarily have been anticipated at the time of the examinations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u00b636 First, Dawson argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance because they failed to advise him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights during the psychiatric evaluation, including his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to remain silent during the evaluation, and that anything he said could be used against him during the sentencing phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\u00b637 Recently, in <em>Hans v. State </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 379, 942 P.2d 674, we addressed this same issue. In <em>Hans, </em>we concluded that, although pursuant to <em>State v. Smith </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 419, 427-28, 863 P.2d 1000, 1004-05, a defendant has no constitutional right to be informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>of his <em>Miranda </em>rights when, through his attorney he has requested a psychiatric exam, defense counsel has a duty to inform his client of the consequences of his participation in the evaluation. <em>Hans, </em>283 Mont. at 402-03, 942 P.2d at 688. In <em>Hans, </em>we concluded that our determination that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not necessary in <em>Smith, </em>was based on our assumption that, before requesting an evaluation, counsel will provide advice regarding the potential consequences of participating in an evaluation. <em>Hans, </em>283 Mont. at 403, 942 P.2d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b638  Because our review of the record reveals no evidence that Dawson\u2019s defense counsel informed him of the potential consequences of participating in the psychiatric evaluation, we must conclude that Dawson has satisfied the deficiency prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test for ineffective assistance counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b639 We must next address the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test which requires that counsel\u2019s deficiency prejudiced Dawson. Because all of the statements made by Dawson during his psychiatric evaluation concerning how the incident occurred were the subject of a successful motion in linfine, and protected by \u00a7 46-14-401, MCA (1985), and were therefore not inquired into at trial, we conclude that Dawson can show no prejudice during the trial phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b640 However, because Dawson\u2019s statements were admissible and available to be considered by the District Court during the sentencing phase, we must also inquire as to any possible prejudice at this phase. Our review of the record reveals that no additional testimony was offered by the State regarding Dawson\u2019s psychiatric evaluation. Thus, the court-ordered psychiatric report prepared by Dr. Van Hassel was the only additional evidence regarding Dawson\u2019s psychiatric evaluation which the District Court may have considered during sentencing. However, there was no indication that the District Court relied on the report during sentencing to determine any of its findings or conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b641  Additionally, our review of the report itself reveals no information which may have prejudiced Dawson at the sentencing proceeding. To the contrary, Dawson\u2019s version of the crimes was consistent with his defense theory that he was under the control of another person, and at no time did Dawson admit to causing the deaths of any of the Rodsteins. Accordingly, we conclude that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to advise him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights did not prejudice him at the sentencing phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u00b642 Second, Dawson asserts that his counsel were ineffective because they advised him to cooperate during his psychiatric evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b643 At the time of Dawson\u2019s psychiatric evaluation, Dawson had the benefit of the following statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">46-14-401. Admissibility of statements made during examination or treatment. A statement made for the purposes of psychiatric examination or treatment provided for in this chapter by a person subjected to such examination or treatment is not admissible in evidence against him in any criminal proceeding, except a sentencing hearing conducted under 46-14-311, on any issue other than that of his mental condition. It is admissible on the issue of his mental condition, whether or not it would otherwise be considered a privileged communication, unless it constitutes an admission of guilt of the crime charged. In a hearing held under 46-14-311, the court may hear and consider any such statement even if it constitutes an admission of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Section 46-14-401, MCA (1985). Additionally, Dawson\u2019s counsel made a successful motion in limine to assure that none of Dawson\u2019s statements were admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b644 Based on the statutory and procedural protections available to Dawson, with regard to any statements made during his psychiatric examination, we conclude that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s action of advising Dawson to cooperate during the psychiatric evaluation, does not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. Dawson\u2019s counsel believed, at the time, that the psychiatric evaluation would benefit him, and thus Dawson\u2019s cooperation in that process would be an advantage to him, and so advised him.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\u00b645 Third, Dawson contends that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to advise him that he could have counsel present during the psychiatric evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\u00b646 In <em>Smith v. Estelle </em>(5th Cir. 1979), 602 F.2d 694, 708, the court stated that \u201ca defendant has no constitutional right to have an attorney present during a psychiatric evaluation of his dangerousness,\u201d following <em>United States v. Cohen </em>(5th Cir. 1976), 530 F.2d 43, 48, in which the court held that there was no right to have an attorney present when the examination was to decide if the defendant was sane. \u00b647 In <em>State v. Armfield </em>(1984), 214 Mont. 229, 233, 693 P.2d 1226, 1229, we held that a defendant is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>[EJntitled to (1) the pretrial presence of counsel where the incident or encounter is a \u201ccritical stage\u201d in the prosecutorial proceedings, and (2) the assistance of counsel at any stage in the pretrial proceedings where the advice of counsel is essential to the protection of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akn\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b648 Notwithstanding the fact that there is no authority for Dawson\u2019s contention that he had a constitutional right to have counsel present during the evaluation, with the statutory protection afforded by \u00a7 46-14-401, MCA (1985), it was reasonable for Dawson\u2019s counsel to believe that it was not necessary that he have counsel present during the evaluation itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b649 Finally, Dawson argues that his counsel should have objected to the testimony of Dr. Van Hassel, the person who examined him, when he was called as a witness by the State. Dawson contends that he did not waive his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and, therefore, the State could only offer psychiatric evidence in rebuttal, not as a part of its direct evidence. Additionally, Dawson asserts that he had effectively withdrawn the defense of mental disease or defect and, therefore, Dr. Van Hassel could not be called to testify by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b650 The State points to the relevant statute at the time of Dawson\u2019s trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">46-14-213. Psychiatric testimony upon trial. (1) Upon the trial, any psychiatrist who reported under 46-14-202 and 46-14-203 <em>may be called as a witness by the prosecution </em>or by the defense ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Section 46-14-213, MCA (1985) (emphasis added). Clearly, the statute in effect at that time provided that the psychiatrist who performed the evaluation may be called as a witness for the State, and did not limit that provision to the State\u2019s rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\u00b651 As for Dawson\u2019s argument-that he had effectively withdrawn the defense of mental disease or defect, we note the following testimony from defense counsel Allen Beck at the evidentiary hearing to consider Dawson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">Q. [By the Court] But in a legal sense, if the facts were to change during the course of a trial, you still could have made use of that defense; is that correct:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">A. Yes, I intentionally preserved it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u00b652 The District Court found that: \u201c[u]nder the law at the time as appropriately understood by all parties the testimony of the mental health examiner was admissible to establish Dawson\u2019s state of mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZ3\">\u00b653 Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson\u2019s counsel, based on the law at that time, acted reasonably when they did not object to the testimony of Dr. Van Hassel.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b654 Additionally, Dawson argues that his counsel should have provided his psychiatric evaluator with information regarding Dawson\u2019s use of drugs and alcohol, and any other information which would have assisted the staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b655  However, our review of the Montana State Hospital report reveals that Dawson provided the hospital staff with information regarding his use of alcohol and drugs and other pertinent information. Therefore, Dawson is unable to establish any prejudice based on his counsel\u2019s failure to provide information to the hospital staff. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson\u2019s counsel did not render ineffective assistance because they failed to provide the hospital staff with information concerning Dawson.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">c. <em>Failure to properly investigate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\u00b656 Dawson contends that the District Court erred when it found that his counsel did not conduct an ineffective pretrial investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"ATZ\">\u00b657 First, Dawson asserts that his counsel should have obtained the complete records of his evaluation at Montana State Hospital, including the staff notes. Dawson argues that the District Court relied on his lack of remorse as a factor in imposing the death penalty and, therefore, he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to obtain staff notes which reflected his emotional state during his 48-day evaluation at Montana State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\u00b658 In response, the State contends that counsel\u2019s failure to obtain the staff notes did not prejudice Dawson because they indicate that Dawson showed some display of emotion only four times during the 48 days he was at Montana State Hospital. Moreover, the staff notes indicate that Dawson ate and slept well and that on one particular day he appeared to be in a good mood and was seen laughing with a visitor. Additionally, the State asserts that the District Court\u2019s finding at the sentencing phase regarding Dawson\u2019s apparent lack of remorse was based on the court\u2019s own evaluation of Dawson throughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the extensive court proceedings, and not a result, as Dawson contends, of Dr. Van Hassel\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b659 At trial, Dr. Van Hassel testified on direct examination by the State to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">A. [By Dr. Van Hassel] The only thing that appeared out of the ordinary whatsoever was his apparent lack of observable distress about his situation. Given the fact that he had been accused of some very serious crimes and was facing some very serious consequences. He did not appear to show any anxiety about that. He did not show any outward signs of depression about that. Nor did he show outward signs of anger about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Dawson argues that had his counsel obtained the staff notes reflect-, ing his emotional displays, his counsel could have contradicted Dr. Van Hassel\u2019s testimony that Dawson showed no emotional response, and as a result the District Court would not have found that he lacked remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b660 The District Court concluded that Dawson could show no prejudice as a result of his counsel\u2019s failure to obtain the notes and records, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">Although it may have been helpful to have those records they would have had no effect on the issues of guilt. Judge Barz in her findings relied on her observations during the trial and other appropriate evidence in reaching her conclusions concerning the death sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\u00b661 The sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact regarding Dawson\u2019s lack of remorse were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">The Court has had the opportunity to observe the Defendant during the entire trial and throughout all proceedings. His conduct in all proceedings has been appropriate. Scarcely a word had been spoken in the Court\u2019s presence. The complete lack of emotion and cool detachment in his demeanor has been noted throughout. As Dr. Van Hassel testified, lack of an emotional response can be a coping mechanism of denial, or a personality that shows no overt emotion normally or, finally, that the person truly is not concerned. Whatever the reason, the Defendant has demonstrated no remorse or genuine concern or respect for human life to the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">It is clear from the District Court\u2019s findings that it relied on its own observations of Dawson throughout the proceedings to conclude that he displayed an apparent lack of remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u00b662 Moreover, at the evidentiary hearing to consider Dawson\u2019s ineffective assistance claims, Dr. Van Hassel testified, regarding the staff notes, that: \u201cit was the consensus of the professionals involved in the evaluation that overall his displays of emotion were substantially less than what you might have expected for someone in his situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5k\">\u00b663  Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson could not establish prejudice as a result of his counsel\u2019s failure to obtain the complete records and staff notes of his evaluation at Montana State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b664 Second, Dawson contends that his counsel should have pursued the possibility that he suffered from epilepsy. Dawson asserts that his mental health evaluation recommended further EEG testing because of the possibility of epilepsy and, therefore, his counsel should have explored this possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b665 In response, the State asserts that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision not to further pursue an investigation that Dawson may have suffered from epilepsy was reasonable considering that Dawson had no history of serious head injuries, gave his attorneys no reason to believe he might be suffering from epilepsy or neurological problems of any kind, and the CT scan and second EEG performed on Dawson were normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b666 At the evidentiary hearing to consider Dawson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, Allen Beck, Dawson\u2019s trial counsel, testified that nothing in the defense\u2019s pretrial preparation, including medical information and information from Dawson himself, indicated that he suffered from epilepsy. Beck testified further, that he did not believe there was any basis to pursue the possibility that Dawson suffered from epilepsy as a defense at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u00b667 Dr. Gary Cooney, a neurologist who interpreted the two EEG tests performed on Dawson, also testified at the evidentiary hearing. Dr. Cooney testified that the abnormalities found in the initial EEG were not strongly suggestive of epilepsy, and that there were alternative explanations for the intermittent spike discharges, which did not necessarily indicate an abnormality. Dr. Cooney testified that following the initial EEG, a CT scan and a second EEG were ordered. The results of the CT scan and the second EEG were normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\u00b668  Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that there was no evidence presented that Dawson was epileptic and, therefore, Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision not to further pursue this factor was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u00b669 Third, Dawson asserts that his counsel failed to investigate the consequences of Dawson\u2019s drug ingestion. Dawson contends that the affidavit testimony of Dr. Watkins submitted at the evidentiary hearing to consider Dawson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief established that Dawson\u2019s mental capacity was impaired by his drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b670 In response, the State asserts that Dawson\u2019s counsel did pursue an investigation into the consequences of Dawson\u2019s drug use, and thereafter determined that it would not be an adequate defense under the circumstances of this case. The State contends that Dawson\u2019s counsel made a reasonable decision not to present evidence of Dawson\u2019s drug use and its consequences at trial and sentencing, after consulting with Dr. Watkins. The State points out that after receiving information regarding Dawson\u2019s reported drug use during the incident, and then conducting an extensive interview with Dawson, Dr. Watkins concluded that Dawson was merely in a \u201cmild dissociated state\u201d at the time of the incident as a result of his use of methamphetamines. Additionally, the State contends that the affidavit testimony of Dr. William Stratford, submitted by the State at the evidentiary hearing, sufficiently rebuts Dawson\u2019s claim that his mental capacity was diminished at the time of the offense as a result of his drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b671 The District Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">It is certainly doubtful that any of this kind of evidence would have had any effect on the determination of guilt made in the jury verdict. Defendant\u2019s attorneys thought that evidence of claimed drug or alcohol use on the part of Dawson would be an aggravating factor in sentencing before the sentencing judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u00b672 At the hearing to consider Dawson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, Allen Beck testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">Q. Did you make a decision not to call Dr. Watkins at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">Q. And what was the basis for your decision not to call Dr. Watkins at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">A. His diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">Q. And what was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">A. That he had a mild disassociated state which was, in Dr. Watkins\u2019 opinion, related to the use of methamphetamines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-14\">Q. And did you reach a decision that that would not be an adequate defense in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>A. Yes, I did. I think the combination-if I were to have used Dr. Watkins, it would have then been incumbent upon us, Your Honor, to turn over the tape-recorded-or the video interview. That\u2019s in my view a statement under Montana law, and there were enough inculpatory admissions that I think the combined effect of the weak nature of Dr. Watkins\u2019 testimony and the video far outweighed-the prejudice far outweighed the benefit from trying than the benefit from trying to use them in trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b673 The affidavit of Dr. Watkins, submitted by the defense, stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">The testing and interviewing done at Warm Springs supports my opinion that, if Mr. Dawson committed the murders, he was in a drug induced dissociative state and his normal personality was not in control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">... In the days before the crime, Mr. Dawson was injecting substantial amounts of methamphetamine and drinking alcohol. He had apparently had little sleep for days. The stress factors combined with the drugs and alcohol created conditions conducive to dissociation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b674 The rebuttal affidavit of Dr. Stratford, submitted by the State, stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">Dr. Watkins, in his affidavit, concluded that Mr. Dawson is neither psychotic nor a sociopath, and that he does not suffer from a multiple personality disorder. He did diagnose an atypical dissociative disorder. He also noted that amphetamines are a drug which can cause dissociative states.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">In my opinion, after watching the videotape [of Dr. Watkins\u2019 interview with Dawson], the evidence for a dissociative disorder is extremely slim. In my opinion, after watching the videotape, Dawson was led to the dissociative description by Dr. Watkins and thus the evidence for this diagnosis is so very slight as to be almost insignificant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">Dr. Watkins states in his affidavit that Dawson\u2019s behavior was irrational and confused at the time of the crimes. In fact, one of the striking elements is the deliberate, focused, conduct of Dawson during the 44-hour period between the time of the abductions to the time of Dawson\u2019s arrest. During that period of time, Dawson consistently demonstrated conduct which evidenced knowledge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>purpose, and planning. Examples of this conduct are that Dawson brought tape and a gun to the motel; he wiped a towel through Room 149, taking fingerprints off of anything he might have touched; he moved the Rodsteins\u2019 cars, taking a different route to the Husky Station each time he moved the cars, etc. In fact, at page 130 of the transcript of the interview, Dawson admits to Watkins that the crimes were \u201cdefinitely planned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">... In my opinion, the evidence in this case for atypical dissociative disorder is so slight as to be almost insignificant. Even if it was present, atypical dissociative disorder is not a mental disease or defect, but a neurosis which would not affect Dawson\u2019s capacity to act with knowledge or purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b675 In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court stated the following with regard to a counsel\u2019s duty to investigate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">[Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S at 690-91, 104 S. Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\u00b676 Our review of the record reveals that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision to not further investigate or pursue Dawson\u2019s drug use was a reasonable one under the circumstances. Dawson\u2019s counsel realized that at trial Dr. Watkins\u2019 testimony that Dawson suffered from a mild dissociative state as a result of methamphetamine use would not have any real effect on the verdict arrived at by the jury, because it was not evidence of a mental disease or defect, it did not affect his ability to act with knowledge or purpose and there was evidence that Dawson acted with the required mental state. Additionally, Dawson\u2019s counsel was aware that in order to call Dr. Watkins as an expert -witness, they would be required to provide the State with a potentially damaging four-hour interview of Dawson by Dr. Watkins in which Dawson made several inculpatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u00b677 With regard to Dr. Watkins\u2019 possible testimony at sentencing to establish Dawson\u2019s drug use as a mitigating factor, we conclude that it was reasonable for Dawson\u2019s counsel to conclude that the potential harm from that testimony outweighed the possible benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b678 Our review of the trial transcript reveals a considerable amount of testimony which established Dawson\u2019s planning and purposeful behavior before and during the crimes: he checked in using a false name and address; parked his car behind the motel, away from his room; he had material to gag and bind the Rodsteins already laid out on his bed when he brought them into his room; he wiped everything he might have touched in the Rodsteins\u2019 room with a towel to ehminate his fingerprints; he hung the \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign on his door; he called the motel maid service and requested that they not clean his room; he moved the Rodsteins\u2019 cars from the motel parking lot to a nearby gas station, using a different route each time; when he noticed the police looking at the Rodsteins\u2019 cars, knowing that his fingerprints were on the cars, he came out of his motel room and told the officers that someone had been fooling around with the cars and he had tried to fix them; he also told the officers that his real name was not the name he was registered under, knowing that his motel registration and car registration were under different names.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b679 Dawson\u2019s counsel reasonably believed that arguing to the sentencing judge that Dawson\u2019s drug use affected his mental capacity, in the face of the overwhelming evidence that Dawson\u2019s capacity was not impaired, would not be beneficial to Dawson.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b680  Therefore, we conclude that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision not to further pursue or investigate Dawson\u2019s drug use, was a reasonable decision under the circumstances. Dawson\u2019s counsel made a reasonable investigation into the consequences of Dawson\u2019s drug use and as a result of that investigation, made a reasonable strategic decision to not focus on Dawson\u2019s drug use at trial, or as a mitigating factor at sentencing. We conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson\u2019s counsel did not render ineffective assistance because they failed to further investigate the consequences of Dawson\u2019s drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u00b681  Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found and concluded that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance at the pretrial phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b682 Did the District Court err when it found that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial phase?</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b683 Dawson asserts that his trial counsel, Allen Beck and Gary Wilcox, rendered ineffective assistance during the trial phase. First, Dawson contends that his counsel were ineffective because they agreed to the procedure used to present Amy Rodstein\u2019s testimony. Second, Dawson asserts that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to corroborate the defense theory by examination of Amy. Third, Dawson contends that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to give an opening statement. Fourth, Dawson asserts that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to object to guilt phase errors, including improper questions and comments by the State. Fifth, Dawson contends that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to obtain experts to testify at trial. Sixth, Dawson asserts that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to give a closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">a. <em>The procedure used to present Amy Rodstein\u2019s testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b684 Dawson argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance when they agreed to have Amy Rodstein\u2019s guardian ad litem, Damon Gannett, question Amy at trial. Both sides reserved the right to submit additional questions to Amy through her guardian ad litem following her initial testimony. Dawson asserts that this procedure conceded Amy\u2019s credibility and the impact of her testimony. Dawson also contends that the procedure permitted leading questions concerning Dawson\u2019s involvement, and deprived Dawson of his opportunity to challenge or confront Amy\u2019s testimony in any meaningful way. \u00b685 In response, the State contends that the procedure was the result of sound strategy adopted by Dawson\u2019s defense counsel and was not unreasonable under the circumstances. Moreover, Dawson agreed to the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\u00b686 The District Court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">The procedure was a part of the strategy adopted by trial counsel and was not unreasonable under the circumstances. Ms. Rodstein was 16 years old at the time of trial and 15 years old at the time of the incident. She was the sole survivor. Much of her testimony was favorable to the defense. She did not hear or observe any strangling of her other family members while with Dawson. She was understandably a fragile witness. Beck apparently felt it was important to have her testimony. An agreement to handle her testimony as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>was handled was something within his permissible strategy at time of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b687 At the evidentiary hearing to consider Dawson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, Allen Beck explained why the defense agreed to the procedure for Amy\u2019s trial testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">I had formed the opinion early on in the case from having Amy Rodstein\u2019s statements evaluated by a child psychologist that she was very definitely traumatized by the incident and may not be able to withstand the rigors of going through a normal examination-cross-examination in our adversarial system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">It was clear to me through the course of interviewing her in Damon\u2019s office-Damon did the entire interview-that she would be able to perhaps get through a direct examination, but I doubted seriously that she would be able to get through a cross-examination, which would thus effectively not enable us to cross-examine her. Therefore, I suggested the procedure whereby Damon.Gannett be the person who questioned her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b688 Defense counsel\u2019s decision to use a special procedure to present the testimony of Amy Rodstein was a reasonable strategy under the circumstances. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision to allow Amy\u2019s guardian ad litem to question her at trial did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\n<em>b.Failure to present the defense theory through Amy Rodstein\u2019s testimony.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b689 Dawson argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance because they did not ask about Amy\u2019s statement to the police that she saw a man who acted as a look out, and that Dawson signaled to this man. Dawson asserts that this was a failure to present critical evidence by which he was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">\u00b690 In response, the State contends that Dawson overstates the nature and significance of Amy\u2019s observations. The State points out that in her police statement, Amy merely stated that she saw a man standing in the parking lot, looking at the main office, that she did not think that she could identify him because it was too dark, he was too far away, and he did not look directly at them; that, later on, Dawson said that \u201cthere was a guy outside that was his watch-out for him\u201d; and that Amy said she did not know for sure if Dawson was referring to the man she saw in the parking lot as being the watch-out.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u00b691 At the evidentiary hearing to consider Dawson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, defense counsel Allen Beck testified to the following as his reason for not questioning Amy regarding the alleged watch-out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">Q. Do you recall whether you had a reason for not asking Damon Gannett to question her regarding those-regarding that observation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">A. Well... it was my observation of Amy Rodstein at that time that she had reached her limit. I didn\u2019t think that she was capable of proceeding, and I just simply wanted her off the stand, rather than prolonging anything further.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b692 The District Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">A failure to cross examine her about other particular issues when her testimony ended abruptly at the emotional moment referred to in the findings was also appropriate. She had already testified to certain conduct and observations of Dawson related to other individuals in telephone calls and travelling [sic] to homes supportive of the defense theory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b693 The record reveals that at the conclusion of Amy\u2019s testimony, she was asked what she was thinking prior to a police detective opening the door, and she answered: \u201cI was thinking: Why is this happening to me and my family: Am I going to live to see tomorrow? Is my Mom and Dad and my Brother going to be with me?\u201d At that point, Mr. Gannett asked for a break, which the court granted. Both the State and Dawson\u2019s counsel then proceeded to chambers where they made a record which reflected the various emotional responses to the end of Amy\u2019s testimony. Apparently, Amy, several members of the jury, and other persons in the court room were either crying, or having some emotional reaction to her testimony. It was at this point that Dawson\u2019s counsel decided not to subject Amy to further examination.</p>\n<p id=\"Al_\">\u00b694 We conclude that under the circumstances, Dawson\u2019s counsel's decision to not subject Amy to further questioning, was reasonable. Amy had previously testified regarding certain conduct and observations of Dawson related to other individuals which supported the defense theory that Dawson acted under the duress or control of another. While Amy\u2019s further testimony may or may not have added to that theory, it was reasonable for Dawson\u2019s counsel to believe that having Amy on the stand, in the emotional state she was in, and further working the jurors\u2019 emotions, would have been more damaging to the defense than helpful. Therefore, we conclude that the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Court did not err when it found that Dawson\u2019s counsel were not ineffective when they chose not to examine Amy further.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">c. <em>Failure to make an opening statement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b695 Dawson contends that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to give an opening statement at trial. Dawson asserts that his counsel could have given an opening statement, without Dawson\u2019s assistance in his defense, based on the defense theory that Dawson acted under duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b696 The State responds that the defense properly reserved its opening statement, and hoped that after watching the State present its case-in-chief, that Dawson would see the wisdom of assisting in his defense and provide his counsel with full information regarding what happened, which would have allowed Dawson\u2019s counsel to give an effective opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b697 The District Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">The failure to make an opening statement was within appropriate trial strategy on the part of Beck. Beck thought connective evidence would be provided by Dawson. That evidence was never provided to allow a statement of what Beck intended to prove as a substantive defense. There was little Beck could say in the way of opening statement. Beck had little evidence available to rebut the State\u2019s evidence. Such failure is not prejudicial to Dawson because of the overwhelming evidence of his guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">\u00b698 At the evidentiary hearing to consider Dawson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, Allen Beck testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">A. When I asked David [Dawson] repeatedly prior to trial to describe to me in more detail what happened, he refused to do so, and he would either directly or obliquely refer to the fear of his own safety, that of his daughter\u2019s and that of his family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">In that context we then went into a trial, and I have had numerous experiences where people in Mr. Dawson\u2019s position, having seen the State\u2019s case as it goes in, would often be affected by that and be willing to assist in their defense more clearly and even be willing to testify. Therefore, we weren\u2019t in a position to give an opening statement because I was still in the hopes that David Dawson would see the wisdom in assisting in his defense by providing us the fall information of what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Q. [By the court] And would that be true then for a reserved opening statement, as well as an opening statement at the beginning of trial before prosecution evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">A. Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b699  The decision whether to make an opening statement and when to make it is ordinarily a matter of trial tactics and strategy which will not form the basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Ramirez </em>(9th Cir. 1985), 777 F. 2d 454, 458. In <em>United States v. Nersesian </em>(2d Cir. 1987), 824 F.2d 1294, 1321, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">Counsel\u2019s choice of strategy was certainly reasonable under the circumstances. By waiving opening argument the defense did not commit itself to a particular position and was thus free to develop any defense that might materialize as the prosecution presented its case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u00b6100  Therefore, we conclude that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision to waive an opening statement was reasonable trial strategy under the circumstances. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson\u2019s counsel did not render ineffective assistance because they failed to give an opening statement,</p>\n<p id=\"AEV\">d. <em>Failure to object at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">\u00b6101 Dawson contends that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance because, at trial, they did not object to improper direct examination questions by the State, improper comments during the State\u2019s closing argument, and improper testimony by Dr. Van Hassel regarding Dawson\u2019s mental state. First, Dawson asserts that his counsel failed to object when during the State\u2019s examination of a detective, the questions amounted to prosecutorial comment on Dawson\u2019s post-arrest silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">\u00b6102 As the State correctly points out, Dawson\u2019s counsel did in fact object when the detective was directly asked about post-arrest silence, and that objection was sustained by the District Court. Further, we addressed this issue in Dawson\u2019s direct appeal, stating: \u201c[s]ince no answer was given, we conclude that this question about the defendant\u2019s silence was harmless.\u201d <em>Dawson, </em>233 Mont. at 357, 761 P.2d at 359. Accordingly, Dawson\u2019s assertion is without merit. Other questions and answers to which Dawson now refers were related to actual statements made by Dawson following his arrest. We conclude that it was not ineffective when counsel did not object to that line of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u00b6103 Second, Dawson contends that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to object to the State\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ckilling pen\u201d four times during its closing argument. Dawson asserts that his counsel\u2019s failure to object precluded him from raising this issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b6104 In response, the State contends that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision not to object was a reasonable one considering that the facts clearly supported the State\u2019s description of the area. The State asserts that there was ample evidence that Dawson killed the Rodsteins and then stored their three bodies in the small sink area outside the bathroom. The State further contends that it would not have been a wise defense tactic to object and thereby allow the State to defend the term \u201ckilling pen\u201d and focus the jury\u2019s attention on the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b6105 \u201cBecause many lawyers refrain from objecting during opening statement and closing argument, absent egregious misstatements, the failure to object during closing argument and opening statement is within the \u2018wide range\u2019 of permissible professional legal conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Necochea </em>(9th Cir. 1993), 986 F.2d 1273, 1281 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b6106 Because we conclude that the term \u201ckilling pen\u201d was not an egregious misstatement, we further conclude that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision not to object to the use of the phrase during closing argument was reasonable. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson\u2019s counsel did not render ineffective assistance when they failed to object during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b6107 Finally, Dawson argues that his counsel were ineffective because they did not object to Dr. Van Hassel\u2019s testimony that Dawson was capable of acting with purpose and knowledge, the required mental state. Dawson contends that his counsel should have objected on the basis that the testimony was a product of a psychiatric evaluation conducted in violation of Dawson\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u00b6108 As we previously discussed, an objection to Dr. Van Hassel\u2019s testimony on the basis that the testimony was a product of a psychiatric evaluation conducted in violation of Dawson\u2019s constitutional rights, would not have been successful because the evaluation complied with the Montana statutory scheme at the time of the evaluation and at trial. Accordingly, we conclude that Dawson\u2019s counsel were not ineffective because they did not object to the testimony,</p>\n<p id=\"AB6\">e. <em>Failure to obtain experts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u00b6 109 Dawson argues that his counsel were ineffective because they did not offer expert testimony on the issues of Dawson\u2019s drug ingestion and Dawson\u2019s head injuries and EEG tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b6110 As previously discussed, Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision not to call Dr. Watkins on the issue of Dawson\u2019s drug ingestion did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. Likewise, Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision to not further explore or present expert testimony on the issue of Dawson\u2019s two minor head injuries and Dawson\u2019s EEG tests, as discussed previously, did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision to not present expert testimony on these issues did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">f. <em>Failure to give a closing argument.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b6111 Dawson contends that his counsel were ineffective because they did not give a closing argument at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b6112 At the evidentiary hearing to consider Dawson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, Allen Beck testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">Q. Why was no closing argument presented by the defense at the trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">A. Those are the opinions that I recall. The opening argument by Mr. Paxinos was basically an outline of the evidence. It wasn\u2019t inflammatory. There really wasn\u2019t much to rebut. Secondly, as I indicated before, I noticed Harold Hanser\u2019s position, attitude. Having tried cases with him before, I was pretty sure that he was going to come in and tie everything together in a relatively emotive fashion. And part of that related to sexual paraphernalia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">David, through the course of our investigation, seemed to me to be sensitive about the sexual paraphernalia and the intimations that the State was obviously going to make about it. So during the course of Mr. Paxinos\u2019 closing, I passed a note to-by David, who was sitting next to me-to Gary and said that I\u2019d never failed to make a closing argument before, but perhaps this was a case we should consider it. The notes went back and forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-11\">At the close of the opening part of the State\u2019s argument and before my argument, I asked for a recess. It was granted. We went into a caucus. The defense team and David Dawson discussed the pros and cons of making a closing argument. David was in favor of not making a closing argument and we did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Q. Did you have a strong closing argument to give at the time that you made this decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">A. At that stage of the trial, no. There were a few fragmentary facts that we would collect... but basically it would have been an argument which would have discussed what was in the instructions. There\u2019s the presumption of innocence, burden of proof and beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b6113 The District Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">The strategy reasons outlined by Beck for not making a closing argument were reasonable trial strategy. Such strategy was successful in that the more experienced county attorney was precluded from making an argument which would tie all elements together and possibly include references to sexual paraphernalia that were not made in the opening argument by the less experienced deputy county attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b6114 \u201cThough closing argument is often an invaluable tool as it serves to sharpen and clarify the issues for resolution by the trier of fact in \u00e1 criminal case, an attorney\u2019s decision to waive closing argument does not <em>per se </em>constitute ineffective assistance.\u201d <em>State v. Lee </em>(Ariz. 1984), 689 P.2d 153, 160 (internal citation omitted). We agree with the Supreme Court of Arizona\u2019s reasoning as set forth in <em>Lee:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq5\">We will not inquire into the advisability of waiver of closing argument as a ground for ineffective assistance where waiver was a reasoned election of a trial strategy. However, where trial counsel\u2019s decision to waive closing argument is unreasonable in that it is below the threshold of what minimally competent defense counsel would do under a given set of circumstances, counsel\u2019s conduct will not escape judicial scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-8\"><em>State v. Lee, </em>689 P.2d at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">\u00b6115  We conclude that under the circumstances, Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision to not give a closing argument was a reasonable trial strategy and did not fall below the standard of what a minimally competent defense attorney would have done in the same circumstances. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it concluded that Dawson\u2019s counsel were not ineffective when they decided not to give a closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">\u00b6116 Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b6117 Did the District Court err when it found that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase?</p>\n<p id=\"AhC\">\u00b6118 Dawson asserts that the District Court erred when it found that his counsel did not render ineffective assistance at the sentencing phase. First, Dawson contends that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to present crucial mitigating evidence to the sentencing court. Second, Dawson asserts that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to conduct an adequate investigation at the sentencing phase. Finally, Dawson contends that his counsel were ineffective because they failed to move the sentencing court for reconsideration of its conclusion that Dawson posed a substantial and continuing threat and had no chance for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b6119 \u201cThe right to effective assistance of counsel applies with equal force at the penalty phase of a bifurcated capital trial.... In this context, prejudice means a reasonable' probability that but for counsel\u2019s errors, a different sentence would have been imposed.\u201d <em>Clabourne v. Lewis </em>(9th Cir. 1995), 64 F.3d 1373, 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">a. <em>Failure to offer mitigating evidence to the sentencing court. </em>\u00b6120 Dawson argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance because they failed to offer crucial mitigating evidence to the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u00b6121 First, Dawson asserts that his counsel failed to offer Amy\u2019s statement to the police regarding the man she saw in the parking lot. Dawson contends that his counsel should have offered Amy\u2019s statements because it would have bolstered the defense theory that Dawson acted under the duress or coercion of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">\u00b6122 As previously discussed, Amy\u2019s statement to the police was vague. Further, defense counsel had no information that the man in the parking lot was connected in any way with this incident. Additionally, prior to the sentencing hearing, Dawson\u2019s counsel specifically asked Dawson to provide them with information regarding the involvement of others and Dawson replied that he had nothing to tell them. Moreover, apparently, neither the jury, nor the sentencing court accepted the defense theory that Dawson was acting under the control of another. Therefore, Dawson has not shown that the failure to offer this evidence prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">\u00b6123 Second, Dawson contends that his counsel failed to present evidence regarding Dawson\u2019s use of drugs at the time of the incident. Dawson asserts that evidence of his drug use was already before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>court and thus a decision by his counsel not to discuss the issue at sentencing could not reasonably have been based on a wish to keep information away from the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b6124 In response, the State agrees that evidence of Dawson\u2019s drug use was before the court and asserts that the sentencing judge did consider the evidence of Dawson\u2019s drug use as a possible mitigator, but ultimately determined that it was not. The State points to the sentencing court\u2019s finding in which Judge Barz stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">The defendant reported to the pre-sentence investigator that at the time of the current offenses he used crystal methamphetamine. He couldn\u2019t remember the exact amount, but that it was more than just a little bit, but not an abnormal amount. <em>There is absolutely no evidence showing that the Defendant\u2019s mental capacity was impaired.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b6125 At the evidentiary hearing to consider Dawson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, Allen Beck testified to his reasoning for not arguing drug use as a mitigating factor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">Q. Did you consider calling Dr. Watkins as a witness at the mitigation hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">Q. And did you make a decision not to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-11\">A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-12\">Q. And what was your reason for that decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-13\">A. To put it simply, in looking at any judge, and I think particularly Judge Barz, Your Honor, to say that I engaged in this conduct because I took drugs is not a matter in mitigation. It\u2019s a matter in aggravation. It\u2019s that these deaths occurred because I was high on drugs seems to me and under the facts in this case to be highly inflammatory and prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">Beck felt that, based on the facts in this case, including a record replete with actions by Dawson which evidenced that his mental capacity was not impaired at the time of the incident, to argue outright that Dawson engaged in this conduct because he used drugs was inflammatory and would not benefit Dawson. Beck\u2019s decision was a reasonable defense strategy under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">\u00b6126  Therefore, we conclude that Dawson\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision not to present or argue evidence of Dawson\u2019s drug use as a mitigating factor did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u00b6127 Finally, Dawson asserts that his counsel failed to present evidence of Dawson\u2019s good conduct in jail while awaiting trial. Dawson contends that his counsel failed to recognize this as a mitigating factor and that this evidence would have contradicted the sentencing court\u2019s conclusion that Dawson posed a risk to society and could not be rehabilitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b6128 In response, the State asserts that evidence of Dawson\u2019s good behavior in jail was presented at the guilt phase and, therefore, considered at the sentencing phase. The State also points out the following testimony of Denise Hust, a correctional officer in the Yellowstone County Detention Facility, elicited at trial by Dawson\u2019s counsel on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">Q. [By Gary Wilcox] Now, you have had an opportunity to observe him quite a bit in the months that he was in the jail; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">Q. It is safe to testify that he has been, in the words in your statement, a model prisoner; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">Q. You have had no problems with as far as violent outbursts; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">Q. And he has not gotten into any violent disputes with any other individuals in the jail facility; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">Q. And he is one of the better behaved prisoners that you have up there; is that also not correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-14\">A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">\u00b6129 Section 46-18-302, MCA (1985), provides that in the sentencing hearing in a case where the death penalty may be imposed, \u201c[e]vidence admitted at the trial relating to such aggravating or mitigating circumstances shall be considered without reintroducing it at the sentencing proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-16\">\u00b6130  Accordingly, we conclude that Dawson\u2019s argument that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance because they failed to present evidence of his good behavior in jail, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-18\">b. <em>Failure to conduct an adequate investigation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-19\">\u00b6131 Dawson argues that he received ineffective assistance because his counsel failed to conduct an adequate investigation during the sentencing phase. First, Dawson contends that his counsel over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>looked demonstrations of remorse found in the Montana State Hospital staffs notes. Dawson asserts that this information would have served to rebut the finding by the sentencing court that Dawson felt no remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b6 132 As previously discussed, the sentencing court\u2019s finding regarding Dawson\u2019s lack of remorse was based on the court\u2019s own observations throughout the lengthy proceedings against Dawson. Therefore, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Dawson was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to discover the Montana State Hospital staff notes regarding Dawson\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b6133 Second, Dawson asserts that his counsel failed to investigate Dawson\u2019s medical and school records. Dawson contends that the medical records would have established that he suffered a number of injuries, including head injuries. Dawson further asserts that these injuries were discussed in the Montana State Hospital evaluation report, and thus his counsel had notice of where the injuries and the hospitalizations occurred. With regard to his school records, Dawson contends that they would have established that he was seen by a psychiatrist while he was in school in California. Dawson asserts that his medical and school records would have reflected mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"ApD\">\u00b6134 The State responds that, with regard to Dawson\u2019s medical records, he has failed to indicate how any additional information would be a mitigating factor in this case. Both the presentence report and the Montana State Hospital evaluation report contained information regarding Dawson\u2019s previous medical history. The presentence report contained information regarding an apartment fire in which Dawson was burned, and a knee injury and subsequent surgery on his knee. The Montana State Hospital report contained information regarding two minor head injuries, neither of which resulted in unconsciousness, and Dawson reported no lasting effects and no history of any seizures. Additionally, as previously discussed, Dawson\u2019s CT scan and second EEG were normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b6135 With regard to Dawson\u2019s school records, the State asserts that the Montana State Hospital report states that Dawson had seen a psychiatrist twice while in school. Dawson reported that the reason was frequent absence from classes. Dawson additionally denied any history of psychiatric hospitalizations or services.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b6136 In Strickland, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cwhen a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>tigations would be fruitless or even harmful, counsel\u2019s failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S. Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b6137  We conclude that it was reasonable for Dawson\u2019s counsel not to pursue further investigation into Dawson\u2019s medical and school records. Dawson did not give his counsel any reason to believe that such an investigation would be beneficial. Nor is there any evidence that such an investigation would be beneficial. Accordingly, we conclude that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance because his counsel failed to investigate his medical or school records.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b6138 Finally, Dawson asserts that his counsel should have investigated and interviewed his family and boyhood friends, to develop, or at a minimum , determine the existence of mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u00b6139 In response, the State contends that Dawson has failed to allege the names of family and boyhood friends whom he thinks his counsel should have interviewed, what information would have been provided, and the significance of that information to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\u00b6140 The District Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">No showing is made concerning what would have been learned in such interviews. It is unreasonable to expect counsel to interview everyone involved in the life of a convicted defendant even when the conviction is of deliberate homicide in a potential death case. No prejudice has been shown. The presentence investigation showed no previous criminal record on the part of Dawson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">\u00b6141  Our review of the record reveals that Dawson\u2019s counsel did contact and interview Dawson\u2019s mother and sister, and presented letters from each of them to the court at sentencing. Additionally, the presentence report included letters from Dawson\u2019s former spouses. Accordingly, we conclude that Dawson\u2019s counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to further investigate Dawson\u2019s family and boyhood friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">c. <em>Failure to move for a reconsideration.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">\u00b6142 Dawson argues that he received ineffective assistance because his counsel failed to move the sentencing court for a reconsideration of its conclusion that Dawson posed a substantial and continuing threat and that his chances for rehabilitation were nonexistent. Dawson contends that the sentencing court\u2019s conclusions were based on erroneous information and lack any factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">\u00b6143 In <em>State v. Dawson, </em>233 Mont. at 363, 761 P.2d at 363, this Court upheld Dawson\u2019s death sentence pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-310, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>MCA, which provides for automatic review of a death sentence. In that case, we determined that the evidence supported the sentencing court\u2019s finding of those aggravating factors, and concluded that the court\u2019s sentence of death was appropriate under the circumstances. <em>Dawson, </em>233 Mont. at 363, 761 P.2d at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b6144  Therefore, Dawson can show no prejudice from his counsel\u2019s failure to move for reconsideration of the sentencing court\u2019s conclusions. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance as a result of his counsel\u2019s failure to move for a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u00b6145 Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\u00b6146 Did the District Court err when it found that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel during the direct appeal phase?</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\u00b6 147 We review claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel according to the standard set forth in <em>Strickland. See Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 10, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6 10, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b610. The petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s advice fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the petitioner would have prevailed on appeal. <em>See Miller v. Keeney </em>(9th Cir. 1989), 882 F.2d 1428, 1434.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">\u00b6148 Dawson argues that his appellate counsel, Jeff Renz, rendered ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to raise all possible issues on direct appeal. Dawson contends that, because he was facing a sentence of death, Renz had a duty to raise every possible issue, not just those that Renz deemed to have merit. Dawson asserts that Renz had no tactical or strategic reason for failing to raise many of the issues and that those claims not raised by Renz on direct appeal were subsequently dismissed by partial summary judgment during, postconviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">\u00b6149 The State responds that appellate counsel does not have a duty to raise every possible issue. The State asserts that, historically, effective advocates have winnowed out weaker arguments and have focused on a few central issues. The State points out that Renz reviewed the entire record, discussed the case with trial counsel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Dawson, did legal research, and then narrowed the issues to those he felt were most important and meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b6150 The District Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">Any appellate counsel worth his salt realizes that to make an effective argument one must argue his strongest points and not get bogged down into minutia as current counsel would apparently contend Renz should have done on the appeal of this case. Renz was highly qualified to handle the appeal. Renz did a thorough preparation for the appeal process by his review of the record, interviews with trial counsel, discussions with qualified attorneys in the field and the solicitation of reviews of his briefs prior to filing. Many of the current claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel can only be classified as second guessing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b6 151 First, Dawson contends that his appellate counsel should have raised several claims based upon the <em>Ake </em>decision and its subsequent extension in <em>Smith v. McCormick. </em>However, as previously discussed, there was no case law at the time of Dawson\u2019s psychiatric evaluation, at the time of Dawson\u2019s trial, or at the time of the direct appeal in 1988, which would have led Dawson\u2019s appellate counsel to believe that the psychiatric evaluation issues were mishandled in any way by the trial court. The extension of <em>Ake </em>by <em>Smith v. McCormick </em>was not decided until September 1990, and at the time of the direct appeal <em>State v. Smith, </em>which upheld Montana\u2019s psychiatric evaluation process in light of <em>Ake, </em>was controlling authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b6152 Second, Dawson asserts that the limitations in the psychiatric examination, including the fact that the evaluation precluded the mental health professionals from considering evidence of a mitigating character, denied him his constitutional rights and, therefore, his appellate counsel should have raised this issue on appeal. However, as previously discussed, Dawson was appointed his own psychiatric expert, Dr. Watkins, who did consider evidence of mitigating factors. For this reason, Dawson is unable to show any prejudice as a result of his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b6153 Third, Dawson contends that his appellate counsel should have raised the issue that the sentencing court failed to consider all mitigating evidence. However, Dawson has not shown what mitigating evidence the sentencing court failed to consider. Our review of the record reveals that the sentencing court, as set forth in its sentencing order, considered all of the mitigating evidence offered, and then weighed the mitigating factors against the aggravating factors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Moreover, we addressed a similar issue in our independent review of Dawson\u2019s death sentence on direct appeal pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-310, MCA, and determined that the evidence supported the sentencing court\u2019s findings on mitigating and aggravating circumstances. <em>See State v. Dawson, </em>233 Mont. at 362, 761 P.2d at 362. Therefore, Dawson\u2019s appellate counsel\u2019s decision not to raise this issue on direct appeal was reasonable and Dawson can show no prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s failure to raise this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b6154 Fourth, Dawson asserts that his appellate counsel should have raised the issue on direct appeal that Dawson\u2019s due process rights were infringed upon by the trial court\u2019s emotional response to Amy Rodstein\u2019s testimony. Dawson\u2019s appellate counsel did raise this issue on direct appeal as a violation of Dawson\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury. On direct appeal we concluded that \u201cthe transcript does not convey any potential prejudice by the court.\u201d <em>State v. Dawson, </em>233 Mont. at 355, 761 P.2d at 358. Dawson can show no prejudice as a result of his counsel\u2019s failure to raise this version of the issue on direct appeal, because arguing a due process violation instead of an impartial jury violation would have made no difference. The outcome was based on the conclusion that the trial court\u2019s reaction did not prejudice Dawson.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b6155 Finally, Dawson contends that his appellate counsel should have argued on direct appeal that the \u201cinflammatory comments of the prosecutor during closing argument\u201d were improper and prejudicial. As previously discussed, Dawson\u2019s trial counsel made a reasonable strategic choice not to object to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the \u201ckilling pen.\u201d As a result, Dawson\u2019s appellate counsel was precluded from raising this issue because trial counsel did not object at trial. Moreover, as concluded by the District Court \u201csuch references would not have been grounds for a mistrial,\u201d and thus, Dawson can show no prejudice from failure to raise this issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b6156  Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Dawson did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel at the direct appeal phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\u00b6157 In conclusion, we agree with the sentiments of the District Court regarding Dawson\u2019s ineffective assistance claims at the pretrial, trial, sentencing, and direct appeal phases of the proceedings against him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">[T]he Court finds that Dawson was afforded a trial with reliable results. There was no breakdown in the adversary process in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>case. Evidence of Dawson\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. If minor errors were made in the trial process they did not prejudice the finding of guilt or the imposition of the death penalty____Claimed criticism today of the conduct of counsel at trial and appeal is certainly utilizing the \u201cdistorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct\u201d and does not \u201cevaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time\u201d as prohibited by Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b6158 Moreover, in response to the attorney affidavits submitted by Dawson, we point out the following passage from <em>Strickland: </em>\u201c[t]here are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any case. Even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same <em>-way.\u201d Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u00b6159 Did the District Court err when it denied Dawson\u2019s claims 1-29 by summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u00b6160 We review district court orders granting summary judgment, as we do district court conclusions of law, to determine if they are correct. <em>See Vernon Kills on Top v. State </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 384, 390, 928 P.2d 182, 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u00b6161 Section 46-21-105, MCA, provides the following, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">(2) When a petitioner has been afforded the opportunity for a direct appeal of the petitioner\u2019s conviction, grounds for relief that were or could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised, considered, or decided in a proceeding brought under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">(3) For purposes of this section, \u201cgrounds for relief\u201d includes all legal and factual issues that were or could have been raised in support of the petitioner\u2019s claim for relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">\u00b6162 <em>In Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 13, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6 13, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b6 13, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-13\">The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>also may pose a procedural bar to postconviction relief. Under that doctrine, claims which were raised on direct appeal are barred from being raised again in a petition for postconviction relief. Furthermore, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>is similar in effect to \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA (1995), in that it bars postconviction claims which \u201ccould have been raised on direct appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b6163 Dawson argues that three of his claims for relief in his second amended petition for postconviction relief could not have been raised on direct appeal because they required evidence not found in the record and, therefore, they should not have been dismissed by summary judgment. Dawson cites to <em>State v. Bromgard </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 20, 23, 901 P.2d 611, 613, where we stated that we will not consider, on appeal, facts that are not found in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b6164 In its response to Dawson\u2019s motion for reconsideration of nine claims, which Dawson argued required facts on appeal that were not in the record, the District Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">[T]he issues raised in these claims could have been raised on direct appeal. Also, if a defendant fails to preserve an issue for direct appeal by making an appropriate objection at the trial stage it will be barred by Section 46-21-105(2) M.C.A. <em>State v. Gorder, </em>243 Mont. 333, 334-35, 792 P.2d 370, 371 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\u00b6 165 First, Dawson asserts that the following claim, his 10th Claim for Relief, should not have been dismissed because it would have required evidence not found in the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">The State denied Petitioner the ability to obtain evidence in mitigation of guilt or punishment by failing to draw Petitioner\u2019s bodily fluids until 12 hours after his arrest, sufficient time for evidence of his ingestion of drugs and/or alcohol during the time of the offense to be lost....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\u00b6166 On appeal, Dawson fails to set forth any reason why this claim would have required evidence not found in the record. However, in his brief in opposition to the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Dawson argued that: \u201cclaim 10 requires examination of the extent and reasons for delay in taking Petitioner\u2019s blood sample following arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">\u00b6167 Our review of the trial transcript reveals that this claim would not have required evidence other than that found in the record on appeal. Officer Gary Hatfield testified regarding his receipt of a search warrant to obtain blood and urine samples from Dawson on Sunday, April 20. Officer Hatfield testified that he was required to wait approximately two hours at the hospital, while the hospital\u2019s legal staff checked on the search warrant, before the hospital was able to obtain the blood and urine samples. Moreover, there was no objection at the trial level and thus, Dawson failed to preserve this issue for direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u00b6168 Second, Dawson asserts that the following claim, his 20th Claim for Relief, should not have been dismissed because it would have required additional evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\">The trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions were drawn, whether directly or indirectly, from the findings in <em>State v. Ronald Smith, </em>and were not based upon the precise facts in the case before the court. The matters of aggravation and mitigation were merely enumerated, and not considered, by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b6169 In response, the State points out that Dawson failed to argue to the District Court that this claim could not be raised on appeal because it required additional evidence. Dawson\u2019s brief in opposition to the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment states that: \u201cClaims 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 19, 22, 23, 27 all require evidence outside the record or trial proceedings.\u201d Additionally, in Dawson\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s award of partial summary judgment, Dawson did not argue that his 20th claim for relief required evidence outside the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b6170 \u201cIt is axiomatic that a party may not change the theory on appeal from that advanced in the district court.\u201d <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 454, 458, 877 P.2d 1013, 1016. Accordingly, because Dawson did not argue this theory to the District Court, we will not address this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b6171 Finally, Dawson asserts that the following claim, his 27th Claim for Relief, should not have been dismissed because it would have required evidence outside the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">The state failed to disclose to the defense the results of the testing done on Petitioner\u2019s blood, drawn the day of his arrest, showing that Petitioner had ingested marijuana and methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">The state failed to disclose to the defense the complete records from Petitioner\u2019s pre-trial mental evaluation at Warm Springs hospital which records contained the two EEG reports, both of which were abnormal, contradicted the testimony heavily relied upon by the state that Petitioner failed to exhibit concern for the charges against him....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">\u00b6172 As we noted previously, defense counsel either had this information or the lack of information was not prejudicial to Dawson.</p>\n<p id=\"ALP\">\u00b6173  Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court properly applied the procedural bar of \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, to Dawson\u2019s claims for relief, 10 and 20, and that there was no prejudice from applying the procedural bar to claim 27. Therefore, we further conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>that the District Court properly dismissed Dawson\u2019s claims 1-29 in his petition for postconviction relief by summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">ISSUE 6</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b6174 Should this Court, in a postconviction proceeding, reconsider issues it has already decided on direct appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b6175 Dawson asserts that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Vernon Kills on Top v. State </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 384, 928 P.2d 182, directly supports the reconsideration of claim 18, consideration of aggravating circumstances; claim 22, trial court\u2019s reaction denied due process; and claim 24, denial of a jury trial on aggravating circumstances, all of which the District Court dismissed by partial summary judgment after it concluded that these issues had been raised on direct appeal and were barred by res judicata. Dawson contends that our decision in <em>Vernon Kills on Top, </em>requires that the District Court consider whether the \u201cends of justice\u201d would be served by reconsideration of these claims in a petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b6176 In <em>Vernon Kills on Top, </em>we set forth the criteria for the application of the doctrine of res judicata to the relitigation of issues already determined on direct appeal, stating that we will apply the procedural bar if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">(1) the same ground presented in the subsequent application was determined adversely to the applicant on the prior application, (2) the prior determination was on the merits, and (3) the ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits of the subsequent application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-9\"><em>Vernon Kills on Top, </em>279 Mont. at 399, 928 P.2d at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">\u00b6177 In <em>Vernon Kills on Top, </em>we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-11\">In this case, we conclude that, with the exception of those claims which challenge the imposition of the death sentence based on disproportionality pursuant to the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and Article II, Section 22, of the Montana Constitution, the ends of justice are not served by reaching the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claims a second time.... To the contrary, the \u201cends of justice\u201d do compel reconsideration of the petitioner\u2019s death sentence in light of this State\u2019s constitutional prohibition against the infliction of cruel or unusual punishments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8g\"><em>Vernon Kills on Top, </em>279 Mont. at 399-400, 928 P.2d at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">\u00b6178 Additionally, Dawson contends that because we applied the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of review to uphold the trial court\u2019s findings on Dawson\u2019s direct appeal, a standard of review which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Dawson argues we subsequently repudiated in <em>Vernon Kills on Top, </em>we should reconsider his claims regarding evidence to support torture and lying in wait under the clearly erroneous standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b6179  In this case, Dawson has presented no evidence that the \u201cends of justice\u201d would be served by reconsidering these claims, nor do we conclude that the \u201cends of justice\u201d compel us to reconsider any of Dawson\u2019s claims. Accordingly, we conclude they are barred by principles of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b6180 In conclusion, we affirm the decision of the District Court denying Dawson\u2019s second Amended Petition for Postconviction Relief.</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON, HUNT, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
