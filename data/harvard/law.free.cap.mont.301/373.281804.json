We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">\u00b62 Benefis raises the following issues for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">1. Does Montana\u2019s Administrative Procedures Act (MAPA) preclude the Department of Health and Human Services from raising new reasons to deny Medicaid eligibility before the District Court when the Department failed to raise those issues that were previously known at the administrative level?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-13\">2. Does the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>preclude the Department of Health and Human Services from raising a new basis of denial before the District Court when the Department failed to raise those issues that were previously known at the administrative level?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-14\">3. Whether the Department of Health and Human Services may claim that excess resources should have been spent down during a period when the Department claimed the applicant was ineligible for another independent reason and was constructively prevented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>from spending down the resources because such a spend-down would not remove the independent basis for denying Medicaid eligibility?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b63 This appeal is a product of a fairly lengthy and complex administrative hearings process which resulted, ultimately, in the denial of Marble\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid nursing home benefits. Marble, who suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and has resided at Appellant\u2019s Benefis Skilled Nursing Center since June of 1993, filed an application for benefits in December of 1996. This application followed the death of her husband that year, and was submitted by her son, Don, who serves as her guardian. The application was merely intended to continue Marble\u2019s eligibility, a determination that the Department of Public Health and Human Services (hereinafter Department), had already made in 1994, but then terminated in July of 1996 following Marble\u2019s receipt of insurance proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b64 Marble\u2019s eligibility application was denied by the Department in January of 1997, due to \u201cexcess resources,\u201d which included a bank account with a balance of a little over $3,000, and approximately $31,000 in life insurance proceeds she had received. This determination usually requires that the person first expend such excess resources \u2014 i.e., \u201cspend-down\u201d the assets \u2014 on medical care before eligibility is reinstated. In some instances, however, this can be accomplished within a month, and eligibility is then reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b65 The Department also informed Marble that she may be ineligible due to her late husband\u2019s transfer of the family home to their children, which was deemed a \u201ctransfer of resources,\u201d because her husband did not receive \u201cadequate compensation for this property.\u201d The key difference between this latter determination and the former is that the ineligibility due to such a transfer continues for a specified period of time, based on the value of the transfer. This period cannot be shortened by any action on the part of the person deemed ineligible. The record here indicates that the penalty period would have extended until July of 1999. For this reason, this latter determination became the focal issue in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u00b66 Marble challenged her denial of eligibility based on the \u201ctransfer of resources\u201d determination, requesting a hearing before a Fair Hearing officer, which took place on Jeme 4, 1997. Likewise, Benefis became involved, seeking Medicaid payments for Marble\u2019s nursing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>home care expenses dating back to 1996. Marble and the Department both filed briefs following the tele-conference hearing. Again, the focal argument pertained to the \u201ctransfer of resources\u201d issue. The Department\u2019s denial based on \u201cexcess resources\u201d was referenced only in the factual portions of the briefs and was not addressed in either party\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b67 On September 12,1997, the presiding officer of the Fair Hearing determined that the house transfer in question did not disqualify Marble from receiving benefits. Specifically, the hearing officer determined that \u201cthe property Claimant\u2019s spouse transferred to the children was transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify Claimant for medicaid.\u201d The officer ordered that \u201cCascade County shall not find Claimant ineligible for Medicaid for <em>purposes of the transfer of property\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Although addressing the issue of \u201cexcess resources,\u201d in its findings, the officer did not issue a final determination on whether the bank account and insurance proceeds rendered Marble ineligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b68 On September 26,1997, the Department appealed the officer\u2019s decision regarding the \u201ctransfer of resources\u201d to the Board of Public Assistance, which reversed the decision, concluding that the house transfer rendered Marble ineligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b69 In January of 1998, Marble then turned to the District Court for a judicial review, and filed a brief in support of her petition in April of that year. The petition and supporting brief, although mentioning the \u201cexcess resources\u201d basis for the Department\u2019s original denial, exclusively addressed and argued that the \u201ctransfer of resources\u201d decision by the Board should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b610 In the mean time, the Department informed the court that it had reversed its determination regarding Marble\u2019s Medicaid eligibility based on the \u201ctransfer of resources,\u201d and subsequently did not file a response brief. In a May 22, 1998 letter to the presiding District Court judge, the Department explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">[T]he Department has determined that the transfer of the Marble family home by her husband, James Marble, to their children without compensation in July 1996 does not constitute a disqualifying transfer of assets which renders Mrs. Marble ineligible for Medicaid nursing home care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The Department also informed the court that, based on the foregoing, it would draft a settlement agreement for Marble\u2019s signature. At this point, the penalty for the transfer would have expired in little more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>than a year anyway. It is unclear, however, whether the Department\u2019s \u201csettlement\u201d would have fully reinstated Marble\u2019s eligibility, including retroactive payments for her nursing home care.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b6 11 The dispute failed to quietly disappear. Apparently, the Department refused Marble\u2019s overtures that a settlement should include attorney\u2019s fees, and thus no settlement was executed. Further, based on the Department\u2019s concession on appeal, Benefis requested that the Department pay it retroactive Medicaid benefits on Marble\u2019s behalf. In response, the Department asserted that although the transfer of the family home issue had been resolved, the other basis for denial \u2014 excess resources \u2014 remained viable, and therefore denied Benefis\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b612 This dispute led to both Marble and Benefis filing motions in the fall of 1998 with the District Court, requesting attorney\u2019s fees, and an order to declare Marble eligible for Medicaid and compel payment of Medicaid benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b613 At a hearing on October 14,1998, which primarily focussed on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, counsel for the Department explained that Marble remained ineligible for Medicaid benefits based on the unresolved issue of excess resources, which had not been administratively adjudicated. Appellants asserted at the hearing that this issue could not be raised for the first time on appeal to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A6_\">\u00b614 The District Court, in an Order issued October 25,1998, ruled in favor of the Department to the extent that the \u201cexcess resources\u201d issue would have to be \u201cdragged back through the entire administrative process.\u201d Thus, the court denied Benefis\u2019s motion to declare Marble eligible for Medicaid and compel payment of Medicare benefits. The court stated that \u201cit appears that the present issue standing in the way of said payments is whether or not certain insurance payments available to the Petitioner have been first applied.\u201d The court also denied both Marble\u2019s and Benefis\u2019s motions for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"AJc\">\u00b615 The Appellants filed motions for post-judgment relief, asserting that the Department had failed to raise the \u201cexcess resources\u201d issue prior to the appeal, and therefore could not now deny her eligibility. These motions were deemed denied. Benefis appealed the final Order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u00b616 A district court reviews an administrative decision in a contested case to determine whether the substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the agency exceeded its authority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>abused its discretion, made clearly erroneous findings of fact, or interpreted the law incorrectly. <em>See Hearing Aid Inst. v. Rasmussen </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 367, 371-72, 852 P.2d 628, 631; see <em>also </em>\u00a7 2-4-704(2), MCA. We employ the same standards when reviewing a district court order affirming or reversing an administrative decision. <em>See Langager v. Crazy Creek Prod., </em>Inc., 1998 MT 44, \u00b6 13, 287 Mont. 445, \u00b6 13, 954 P.2d 1169, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b617 For discussion, we consolidate and restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AhCj\">\n<em>Did the District Court err by denying Benefis\u2019s motion to declare Marble eligible for Medicaid and compel payment of Medicaid nursing home benefits?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b618 Benefis argues that the District Court erred by not declaring that Marble is eligible for Medicaid. Benefis contends that Marble\u2019s eligibility was tacitly approved by the Department once it conceded that the \u201ctransfer of resources\u201d issue was moot, and informed the District Court that it would settle and not defend on appeal. Thus, the Department should rightfully compensate Marble \u2014 and therefore her creditor, Benefis \u2014 for the entire period that the Department wrongfully deemed her ineligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b619 Further, Benefis argues that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>\u2014 along with several other related legal theories \u2014 should bar the Department from denying eligibility at this date based on \u201cexcess resources,\u201d because the Department had an ample opportunity to assert this right at the first hearing, and chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u00b620 The Department contends that the only issue litigated in this matter was the \u201ctransfer of resources\u201d issue, and therefore its continued denial of eligibility based on \u201cexcess resources\u201d remains valid to this day. The Department argues that it was not its responsibility to raise and pursue the issue of \u201cexcess resources,\u201d and it presumed from the start that both Marble and Benefis had conceded the issue by not addressing it themselves. Accordingly, the Department argues that if <em>res judicata </em>applies, it should be applied in its favor, because Marble and Benefis were the parties who initiated the original Fair Hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"AzY\">\u00b621 In response, Benefis suggests that the Department simply changed its mind after already agreeing to settle, which implies that Marble\u2019s eligibility would have been reinstated but for this change of heart. Therefore, the District Court erred by refusing to consider Benefis\u2019s motion \u2014 and force the Department to abide by its agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ment to settle as well as its concession that Marble was eligible throughout this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b622  Contrary to Benefis\u2019s contentions, however, we conclude that the District Court did not expressly rule one way or the other on the issue of whether the Department has a continuing right to deny Medicaid eligibility to Marble under the \u201cexcess resource\u201d theory. The court simply did not reach any such conclusion. That this lingering issue was discussed at the hearing and presented in expository background information, does not mean that the issue was \u201cframed\u201d by the Department and presented for the court\u2019s determination. As indicated by the District Court, the issue of \u201cexcess resources\u201d was not properly before the court, and presumably is one that must first run the gamut of the administrative review process. We agree, and hold that this determination was correct. The District Court therefore properly refrained from expressly ruling on Marble\u2019s Medicaid eligibility and whether the Department must pay nursing home care benefits accrued since Marble\u2019s December 1996 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b623 Thus, from a practical standpoint, there are simply no findings or conclusions for this Court to review. The District Court\u2019s denial of the parties\u2019 motions for attorney\u2019s fees was not appealed. The issue of the house transfer was deemed moot by the court, and likewise was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u00b624 As for the administrative proceedings subject to the District Court\u2019s review, Benefis argues that the Department (and not Marble or Benefis) conceded the \u201cexcess resources\u201d issue pursuant to its last notice given to Marble in May of 1997. This assertion misconstrues the content of the final notice. Although offering express details concerning the issue of the house transfer, the notice nevertheless provided that the \u201creason [sic] for denying this application remain as stated in this 1-31-97 notice.\u201d The January notice, in turn, explained that Marble\u2019s eligibility had been denied due to excess resources and, possibly, the transfer of the family home, which was confirmed in a later notice. Therefore, that Marble and Benefis, both of whom initiated the Fair Hearing, were somehow misled by the Department as to what issues or further action they could or should pursue regarding Marble\u2019s eligibility must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\u00b625 Next, contrary to the Department\u2019s argument, the officer for the Fair Hearing review did not reach any sort of a conclusion based on any of the findings pertaining to the \u201cexcess resources.\u201d (The Department repeatedly contends that the officer \u201cfound\u201d that Marble <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>was denied eligibility due to excess resources, when in fact the officer\u2019s Fair Hearing Decision merely recited this information as presented by the parties). Therefore, there was no adverse decision that Marble or Benefis missed the opportunity to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b626 Following the Fair Hearing officer\u2019s decision, neither party took action to pursue the omission of the \u201cexcess resources\u201d issue. Rather, the Department appealed the adverse \u201ctransfer of resources\u201d decision. Consequently, on appeal the Board of Public Assistance did not review the issue of \u201cexcess resources,\u201d which was essentially a non-issue at that stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b627 In turn, the only issue presented for review to the District Court, pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, was the Board\u2019s reversal of the Fair Hearing officer\u2019s determination that the house transfer did not render Marble ineligible. This issue was deemed moot, following the Department\u2019s letter of concession to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b628  Thus, the issue of \u201cexcess resources\u201d was never properly raised, argued, or adjudicated pursuant to the administrative process, and therefore was never ripe for judicial review, pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-702(l)(a), MCA (providing that a person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review). <em>See generally Gilpin v. State </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 37, 39, 812 P.2d 1265, 1266-67 (affirming district court\u2019s dismissal based on lack of jurisdiction because the appellant had failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available to them, pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"A0l\">\u00b629  We hold, therefore, that the denial of Marble\u2019s Medicaid eligibility based on \u201cexcess resources\u201d must first be challenged at the administrative level. Although all parties had an opportunity to do so \u2014 resulting in the current thorough exchange of finger-pointing- \u2014 and testimony before the District Court indicates that the \u201cexcess resources\u201d in question may have, in fact, been \u201cspent-down,\u201d the fact remains that this issue was never squarely presented to the Fair Hearing officer, who in turn never adjudicated this particular denial. In essence, Benefis and Marble have not exhausted \u201call administrative remedies,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, and therefore there was no \u201cfinal decision\u201d upon which the District Court could assume jurisdiction. <em>See Gilpin, </em>249 Mont. at 39, 812 P.2d at 1266-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u00b630 Based on the foregoing, we affirm the decision of the District Court that dismissed Benefis\u2019s motion to declare Marble eligible for Medicaid and compel payment of Medicaid benefits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-4\">JUSTICES HUNT, REGNIER, GRAY and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
