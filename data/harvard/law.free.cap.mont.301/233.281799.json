We have long recognized that \u201ca natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d <em>In Re R.B., Jr. </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 99, 103, 703 P.2d 846, 848. Consequently, \u201cprior to terminating an individual\u2019s parental rights, the district court must adequately address each applicable statutory requirement.\u201d <em>In Re E.W., </em>1998 MT 135, \u00b6 12, 289 Mont. 190, \u00b6 12, 959 P.2d 951, \u00b6 12 (citation omitted). Further, the party seeking termination of an individual\u2019s parental rights has the \u201cburden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory criteria for termination have been <em>met.\u201dIn the Matter </em>of J.N., 1999 MT 64, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 524, \u00b6 12, 977 P.2d 317, \u00b6 12 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">\u00b66 C.A. was born in December, 1992 to Ali\u00e1is and Darold Brey (Brey). In March, 1998 the Department of Public Health and Human Services (the Department) received a report that drugs were being sold from Ali\u00e1is\u2019 home in the presence of a young girl. The following month, the Department received a report that Ali\u00e1is was allowing Matt Fuller (Fuller), a known child molester, to be \u201caround\u201d C.A. The Department made numerous unsuccessful attempts to contact Ali\u00e1is. Police found C.A. and she was placed in emergency foster care. A so<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>cial worker met with Ali\u00e1is and observed that she seemed strung-out and that she tried to light the wrong end of a cigarette in her mouth. Ali\u00e1is also had red marks on her arms that appeared to be track marks. The social worker asked Ali\u00e1is to submit a sample for urinalysis; Ali\u00e1is failed to provide a sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b67 C. A. was observed with Fuller in April, 1998. They were seen entering a bar late at night. C.A. had wet her pants and she was crying. When C.A. tried to hug Ali\u00e1is, Ali\u00e1is pushed her away. In April, 1998 the Department filed a petition for Temporary Investigative Authority and Emergency Protective Services. The District Court entered an order for protective services and granted the Department temporary custody of C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b68 Roxanne Roller (Roller), a social worker with the Department, was assigned to the case in May, 1998. Roller reviewed Ali\u00e1is\u2019 treatment plan with Ali\u00e1is and told her that she had to comply with the plan within one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b69 In July, 1998 Ali\u00e1is provided a urinalysis that tested \u201cpositive for amphetamine, marijuana, and cocaine.\u201d However, Ali\u00e1is \u201cfailed to provide any other HAS pursuant to her contracts with Alternatives, Inc.\u201d Those contracts were dated May 12,1998 to September 30,1998 and October 21,1998 to December 31,1998. Ali\u00e1is made no progress on her treatment plan between July 29,1998 and October 7,1998; she was incarcerated during that period for traffic offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b610 In October, 1998 a temporary custody hearing was held. Ali\u00e1is did not object to the Department\u2019s request for temporary custody. C.A. was adjudicated a Youth in Need of Care.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b611 After her release from jail on October 8,1998 Ali\u00e1is made no progress on her treatment plan. In December, 1998 Ali\u00e1is was taken into custody after receiving a twelve-year sentence on three felony charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">\u00b612 Ali\u00e1is\u2019 presentence investigation (PSI) revealed that Ali\u00e1is \u201cwas involved in a lengthy criminal spree involving check forgery, deceptive practices, and deceptive practices (common scheme).\u201d C.A. was in Ali\u00e1is\u2019 care during the crime spree.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">\u00b613 In February, 1999 the Department filed a petition for Permanent Legal Custody, Termination of Parental Rights, and Right to Consent to Adoption. The District Court heard the case in April and May of 1999. At the hearing, Ali\u00e1is testified that she never took C.A. to a dentist. She \u201cacknowledged that when [C.A.] was in her care, she was not an adequate parent in that she drank around [C.A.], did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>pay attention to her, and allowed inappropriate people to be around her.\u201d Ali\u00e1is admitted that she had left C.A. alone with Fuller \u201c[m]aybe for a few minutes at a time,\u201d but claimed she did not know \u201chis thing until after all this happened.\u201d Giving \u201cprimary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional needs of the child,\u201d the District Court terminated the parent-child relationship between C.A. and her parents, Ali\u00e1is, Brey, and \u201cany other unknown father.\u201d The District Court awarded permanent custody of C.A. to the Department with authority to consent to adoption. From that judgment and order Ali\u00e1is appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b614 Whether the District Court erred in terminating Ali\u00e1is\u2019 parental rights with regard to C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b6 15 Ali\u00e1is argues that the District Court erroneously found that the jail is not \u201ca child friendly environment and it is not an appropriate place to conduct a visit between a parent and a child.\u201d Ali\u00e1is appears to assert that the District Court improperly based its finding solely on the testimony of one social worker. Ali\u00e1is also contends that the District Court erroneously made the \u201cimplication\u201d from that finding that her requests for visits were inappropriate and that this implication \u201cinappropriately colored\u201d its determination that Ali\u00e1is could not become an adequate parent within a reasonable period of time. Ali\u00e1is asserts that the District Court\u2019s findings are an \u201calmost de facto determination that mothers incarcerated in our State prison facilities cannot satisfactorily rehabilitate themselves to resume the parenting role.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b616 The State responds that substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s findings that the jail is not a child-friendly environment and that it is not an appropriate place for parent-child visits. The State asserts that no evidence contradicted the social worker\u2019s assessment of the jail and that the testimony of one witness is sufficient to establish a fact, citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Southern, </em>1999 MT 94, \u00b6 80, 294 Mont. 225, \u00b6 80, 980 P.2d 3, \u00b6 80. Finally, the State argues that the District Court did not terminate Ali\u00e1is\u2019 parental rights because she requested visits with C.A. and that \u201c[t]he majority of [Ali\u00e1is\u2019] failures and shortcomings, which are reflected throughout the lower court\u2019s order, occurred prior to her incarceration and are unrelated to an inability to visit with her daughter while in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u00b617  We conclude that Ali\u00e1is\u2019 arguments are without merit. Substantial credible evidence supported the District Court\u2019s determination that the jail was not a child-friendly place. Roller testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\">It is the Department\u2019s position that the jail is an inappropriate environment for a child to be exposed to. It\u2019s not a child-friendly place there. It takes a great deal of extra work on the jailors to be \u2014 to do visits out in a room rather than to talk on the phone through the glass. The jail is resistant to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">As the State notes, the testimony of one witness is sufficient to establish a fact. <em>See Southern </em>(citations omitted), \u00b6 80. Further, Ali\u00e1is has failed to identify anything in the record that contradicts Roller\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b618  More importantly, we reject Ali\u00e1is\u2019 underlying premise that the District Court critically relied on this finding in terminating Ali\u00e1is\u2019 parental rights. Nothing in the District Court\u2019s order suggests that but for its findings that the jail was not child-friendly and that Ali\u00e1is requested visits with C.A. while she was incarcerated, the District Court would not have terminated her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b6 19 Our review of the District Court\u2019s order establishes that Ali\u00e1is\u2019 incarceration was not a controlling consideration. The District Court determined that Ali\u00e1is was not a fit parent, finding for example that even if Ali\u00e1is had been ignorant of Fuller\u2019s past, \u201cit was still inappropriate for [Ali\u00e1is] to leave [C.A.] alone with a man she admits she knew so little about.\u201d The District Court found that Ali\u00e1is had failed to accomplish any of the goals in her court-approved treatment plans. The District Court found further that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">The concerns at this time continue to be the same as they were at the inception of this matter, with the added concern that [Ali\u00e1is] is now in prison for an unknown period of time.... Although [Ali\u00e1is] now claims that she is beginning some of the tasks on her treatment plan, the fact remains that there was a period of time when [Ali\u00e1is] was not incarcerated, and during that time, she did nothing to work on her treatment plan.... [T]he testimony and evidence still raises [sic] very significant concerns that [Ali\u00e1is] would be unable to maintain any progress while free in the community, that she continues to be unable to take responsibility for her child\u2019s safety and well-being, that she continues to make questionable decisions, and that she continues to be dishonest.... There is no showing that it is in the child\u2019s best interests that [Ali\u00e1is\u2019] parental rights be retained at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The District Court looked appropriately to \u201cthe entire history of the case\u201d and the best interests of C.A. in determining whether to terminate Ali\u00e1is\u2019 parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b620 Ali\u00e1is also argues that the District Court\u2019s negative conclusion regarding the likelihood of Ali\u00e1is becoming a fit parent within a reasonable time was unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence. Ali\u00e1is argues that the State had a burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the Montana Women\u2019s Prison\u2019s programs would not rehabilitate her as a parent within a reasonable time. The State responds that clear and convincing evidence supported the District Court\u2019s determination that Ali\u00e1is was not likely to become a fit parent within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b621  We agree. We note, moreover, that Ali\u00e1is has misstated the State\u2019s burden of proof. The State\u2019s burden was not to prove that prison programs would not rehabilitate Ali\u00e1is but rather to show by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthe statutory criteria for termination have been met.\u201d <em>Matter of J.N., </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b622 The District Court concluded that \u201c[t]ermination is proper herein pursuant to the following provisions of the Montana Code Annotated (1997): \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(a); \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(b); \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(c); \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(e)(i) and \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(e)(ii); \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f); \u00a7 41-3-609(2)(d); \u00a7 41-3-609(2)(e); and \u00a7 41-3-609(2)(g).\u201d Section 41-3-609, MCA (1997), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">Criteria for termination. (1) The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding that any of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">(a) the parents have relinquished the child pursuant to 42-2-402 and 42-2-412;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">(b) the child has been abandoned by the parents as set forth in 41-3-102;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">(e) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-12\">(i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-13\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-14\">(f) the parent has substantially failed to successfully complete or meet the goals of a treatment plan approved by the court and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>child has been in an out-of-home placement for a cumulative total period of 1 year or longer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Section 41-3-609, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b623  Ali\u00e1is has not disputed the District Court\u2019s conclusions regarding the application of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA (1997), to her case. Having failed to dispute both the District Court\u2019s specific legal conclusions and the sufficiency of the evidence that supported them, we conclude that her claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b624 The judgment and order of the District Court are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
