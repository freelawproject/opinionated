(TANI), appeals a May 12,1999 Order and Memorandum issued by the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, which denied its motion to amend the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law issued by the court on April 8, 1999. TANI\u2019s motion sought attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to a release agreement between the parties, as well as under Montana\u2019s reciprocal fees statute, after judgment was entered in its favor for $3,673.53</p>\n<p id=\"A3m\">\u00b62 We reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing for the determination of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u00b63 TANI raises the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in dismissing TANI\u2019s motion to amend the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that would have allowed recovery of attorney\u2019s fees?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">\u00b64 This appeal focuses exclusively on whether one party may recover its attorney\u2019s fees from the opposing party based on an indemnification provision found within an underlying contract. Thus, the factual background of this fairly complex matter is accordingly reduced to the essential facts necessary for this Court\u2019s review, and is largely adopted from the undisputed findings of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">\u00b65 Four persons, H. James Marlow, Dave Hughes, Keith Kerbaugh, and Jerry Magnuson, conceived of a business plan in November of 1996 to purchase, place, own, and operate automated teller machines (ATMs). Various business entities were created pursuant to this plan. A partnership known as DKW was formed. The partnership consisted of Data Capture Systems, Inc., a corporation owned by Marlow; Kadoka Investments, Inc., a corporation owned by Kerbaugh and Hughes; and Wellington Technologies, Inc., a corporation owned by Magnuson. The latter (hereinafter Wellington), is the Defendant and Respondent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u00b66 The foregoing partnership created the corporate entity TransAction Network, Inc. (hereinafter TANI), to implement the business concept of purchasing, owning, placing, and operating ATMs nationwide. TANI is the Plaintiff and Appellant here, seeking more than $40,000 in attorney\u2019s fees from Wellington.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b67 Needless to say, within less than a year the entire deal went sour. At a July 1997 board of directors meeting, it was decided that Marlow would manage TANI. The other three persons, Kerbaugh, Hughes, and Magnuson, determined that they wanted out of the business based upon considerable difficulties that prevented the four men from \u201cgetting along and running an efficient business,\u201d according to the District Court\u2019s findings. The four, on behalf of themselves and their respective business entities, all signed a \u201cGENERAL RELEASE AND AGREEMENT FOR RELINQUISHMENT OF STOCK\u201d agreement on July 30,1997. The release, essentially, allowed the departing three parties to exchange their respective shares of TANI stock for cash from TANI.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b68 The release provided that TANI would hold \u201cHKM\u201d (Hughes, Kerbaugh, and Magnuson) \u201charmless from all causes of action relating to the incorporation of TANI,\u201d and that upon payment of consideration called for under the agreement, the parties would \u201cmutually release each other from all other claims, demands and causes of action that they had, have or may have against each other ... based upon stock issued in Transaction Network, Inc., and any contractual relationships between HKM, Releasees and TANI.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b69 Of particular relevance here, the release also contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">11. <em>Indemnification. </em>Each party hereto shall indemnify and hold the other parties harmless from and against all liability, claim, loss, damage or expense, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred or required to be paid by such other parties by reason of any breach or failure of observance or performance of any representation, warranty or covenant or other provision of this agreement by such party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u00b610 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in May of 1998, TANI brought suit against Wellington and its president and owner, Magnuson, under a number of tort theories, including breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, actual and constructive fraud, and negligent misrepresentation. TANI sought general damages of approximately $110,000, and also punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u00b611 In response, Wellington contended that pursuant to the general release such claims were barred, and filed a counterclaim that the legal action commenced by TANI breached the release agreement. In addition to the breach of contract claim, Wellington alternatively claimed that due to either mistake or fraud, the release agreement should be rescinded. Wellington further contended that under either theory, it was entitled to recover its attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the indemnification provision. Its amended answer and counterclaim alleging the foregoing was filed on November 6,1998. Both parties moved for summary judgment in early 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">\u00b612 In a March 4,1999 Order and Memorandum, the court denied Wellington\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and concluded that the release did not bar TANI\u2019s tort claims due to apparent ambiguities in the release agreement. Thus, the court determined that TANI could not be \u201csubj ect to a counter-claim for a breach of the Release when the Court has concluded, as a matter of law, the Release does not bar the filing of this tort action.\u201d The court also concluded that neither fraud nor mistake had been appropriately pled, and therefore were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b613 Following a non-jury trial on March 17,1999, the court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. On all of TANI\u2019s various tort claims, the court awarded only $3,673.53 for constructive fraud. The court further concluded that it had \u201cruled that all claims based upon the parties\u2019 \u2018contractual relationship\u2019 with each other are barred.\u201d The court also concluded that without the causes of action for fraud or mistake, Wellington had no basis to rescind, and was not entitled to any of the requested relief under that particular equitable remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b614 In April of 1999 an exchange of briefing ensued, as both parties moved to amend the court\u2019s findings and conclusions. Each party requested attorney\u2019s fees as a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d pursuant to the indemnification clause found in the release agreement. Both motions were grounded in the assertion that Wellington\u2019s counterclaim for breach in the midst of TANTs tort claims activated the indemnification clause. TANI submitted its claim for attorney\u2019s fees that it had incurred from October 13, 1998 (the date Wellington filed its counterclaim for breach) through April of1999, for a total sum of $42,990. This claim did not provide any break down as to hours spent on any particular portion of the litigation. Similarly, Wellington sought more than $20,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u00b615 The District Court, in a May 12,1999 Order and Memorandum, denied the parties\u2019 motions, concluding that there was \u201cno prevailing party because both parties have gained a victory but also suffered a loss.\u201d The court reasoned that the \u201centire case disposition must be considered ...\u201d The court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">Since the majority of plaintiff counsel's time (and the majority of trial time) was spent on the tort claim, it is neither fair nor equitable to award the amount of attorney fees. Likewise, counsel has not presented any evidence (verified or otherwise) as to the percentage of the $45,000 spent [attorney's fees plus costs] defending the counterclaim. Thus, the Court is unable to make any calculation in that regard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b6 16 TANI appeals this final order of the District Court, claiming it is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as the prevailing party. TANI further requests that it be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs generated on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u00b617 Normally, this Court reviews the findings of a trial court sitting without a jury to determine if the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P. However, the issue here on appeal \u2014 whether the court erred by not allowing TANI to recover its attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 is strictly a question of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law pertaining to the recovery of attorney's fees to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>See Doig v. Cascaddan </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 105, 112, 935 P.2d 268, 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in dismissing TANI\u2019s motion to amend the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that would have allowed recovery of attorney\u2019s fees?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">\u00b618 The District Court, in its May 12,1999 Order and Memorandum, denied both parties\u2019 motions to amend the court\u2019s April 8,1999 findings and conclusions. It is apparent from the court\u2019s order that on the whole the litigation was a great waste of time and money in that each party sought recovery in excess of six figures in damages, and in the end TANI was awarded approximately $3,700. It is not surprising, therefore, that the court, in determining that the \u201centire case disposition must be considered,\u201d concluded that neither party, ultimately, prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">\u00b619 In general, we agree with the court\u2019s assessment, but the legal question posed here requires further scrutiny. This Court has often stated that if an agreement between parties provides for attorney\u2019s fees, a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>court is bound by its terms. <em>See Doig v. Cascaddan </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 105, 112, 935 P.2d 268, 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">\u00b620 The District Court, in denying both parties\u2019 requests for attorney\u2019s fees, concluded that each party \u201cgained a victory but also suffered a loss.\u201d The court stated that \u201c[t]he entire case disposition must be considered ...\u201d Primarily, the court relied on ample authority in Montana case law suggesting that a party who receives a money judgment in the end is not necessarily the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in determining attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Marriage of Herbert </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 69, 72, 840 P.2d 584, 586. On this legal point, as applied here, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b621 In accordance with <em>Herbert, </em>this Court recently stated that in determining which party prevailed under a \u201cprevailing party\u201d provision in a contract \u201c[n]o one factor should be considered... [t]he party that is awarded a money judgment in a lawsuit is not necessarily the successful or prevailing <em>party.\u201d Doig, </em>282 Mont. at 112-13, 935 P.2d at 272. Even so, TANI\u2019s claim to attorney\u2019s fees in this instance is not only determined by a provision in a contract, but by statute as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b622 The longstanding rule in Montana, often referred to as the American Rule, is that absent statutory or contractual authority, attorney\u2019s fees will not be awarded to the prevailing party in a lawsuit. <em>See Erker v. Kester, </em>1999 MT 231, \u00b6 43, 296 Mont. 123, \u00b6 43, 988 P.2d 1221, \u00b6 43. The contract that TANI allegedly breached, in fact, did not expressly provide that the \u201cprevailing party\u201d or \u201csuccessful party\u201d shall recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees; rather, it provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">11. <em>Indemnification. </em>Each party hereto shall indemnify and hold the other parties harmless from and against all liability, claim, loss, damage or expense, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred or required to be paid by such other parties by reason of any breach or failure of observance or performance of any representation, warranty or covenant or other provision of this agreement by such party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b623 Paradoxically, the foregoing provision is found within a release agreement, one purpose of which was to require that the parties mutually release each other from \u201call other claims, demands and causes of action that they had, have or <em>may have </em>against each other... based upon stock issued in Transaction Network, Inc., and <em>any contractual relationships ... </em>\u201d (Emphasis added). Logically, the mutual release agreement would encompass a future contract claim for breach of the release agreement itself, thereby producing a nullity. Thus, although the District Court permitted TANI to proceed with its tort claims, Wellington\u2019s attempt to enforce the agreement by bringing an action for breach was barred pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>release agreement itself \u2014 an ironic legal twist in light of the fact that Wellington claimed TANI\u2019s law suit should be barred for the very same reason. The District Court made this conclusion in its April 8,1999 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law: \u201cThis comb has ruled that <em>all claims </em>based upon the parties\u2019 \u2018contractual relationship\u2019 with each other are barred.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b624 Nevertheless, Wellington\u2019s breach of contract claim survived long enough to proceed to summary judgment, and each party incurred attorney\u2019s fees in pursuing and defending this particular claim in the midst of TANI\u2019s tort claims. We agree with the District Court\u2019s assessment that as a non-breaching party, Wellington would have been entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the indemnification provision if it had prevailed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the plain language of the provision does not require that in the event <em>any </em>litigation arose the <em>prevailing party </em>would be entitled to indemnification for its attorney\u2019s fees. Rather, indemnification was expressly afforded to the non-breaching party only in the event of \u201cany breach\u201d by another party.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b625 As the alleged breaching party, TANI was consequently compelled to rely on a statutory right that supplements such contract provisions. On appeal, TANI argues that by successfully defending against Wellington\u2019s breach of contract claim, it is entitled to reciprocal attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA. We agree. The relevant language of this statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">Whenever, by virtue of the provisions of any contract... one party to such contract... has an express right to recover attorney fees from any other party to the contract... in the event the party having that right shall bring an action upon the contract... then in any action on such contract... all parties to the contract... shall be deemed to have the same right to recover attorney fees and the prevailing party in any such action, whether by virtue of the express contractual right or by virtue of this section, shall be entitled to recover his reasonable attorney fees from the losing party or parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Accordingly, TANI contends that contrary to the District Court\u2019s conclusion it was the prevailing party, and thus should be entitled to reciprocal attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u00b626 This Court\u2019s interpretation of the foregoing statute both favors and limits TANI\u2019s right to recovery in this instance. First, we agree with TANI that its successful defense against Wellington\u2019s counterclaim invokes the reciprocal right under \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA. In <em>Garrison v. Averill </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 508, 938 P.2d 702, for example, we concluded that \u201cthe same right to recover attorney fees\u201d included a successful defense of an action. <em>Garrison, </em>282 Mont. at 521, 938 P.2d at 709-10. We stated that \u201c[i]n the event of a successful defense of the types of actions specified in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the buy-sell agreement, \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA, would vest the defendant with the same rights to attorney fees as are expressly provided to a successful plaintiff in the agreement.\u201d <em>Garrison, </em>282 Mont. at 521, 938 P.2d at 709-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\">\u00b627 Similar to the indemnification provision here, the referenced paragraphs within the <em>Garrison </em>agreement provided that in the event one party defaulted on a buy-sell agreement, \u201cthe non-defaulting party may recover damages and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded by the court in any action for a specific performance or otherwise\u201d and \u201cthe non-defaulting party shall have the right to an action for specific performance and shall be entitled to recover damages, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be awarded by the court.\u201d <em>Garrison, </em>282 Mont. at 520-21, 938 P.2d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b628 We therefore agree with TANI that its successful defense against \u201cthe types of actions\u201d specified in the indemnity clause (i.e., \u201cany breach\u201d), should entitle it to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA, in defending against Wellington\u2019s claims under our decision in <em>Garrison. </em>That TANI was successful in this defense was clearly stated by the District Court, in its May 12,1999 Order: \u201con the other hand, [Wellington] lost their counterclaim... [and TANI] received a small victory by... prevailing on the counterclaim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b629 Nevertheless, under \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA, and <em>Garrison, </em>TANI\u2019s right to recovery must be the \u201csame right to recover attorney fees\u201d as Wellington\u2019s. We concluded in <em>Garrison </em>that because the party that brought suit did not allege default or breach of any term of the agreement, the party claiming reciprocal fees under \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA, in defending what in fact were fraud and failure of consideration claims, could not recover attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Garrison, </em>282 Mont. at 521, 938 P.2d at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b630 As acknowledged by TANI, this Court has frequently declared that, pursuant to \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA, \u201ccontractual rights to attorney fees are reciprocal when the party from whom one is requesting fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>has an <em>express right </em>to attorney fees.\u201d <em>Bell v. Richards </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 215, 218, 741 P.2d 788, <em>790 (citing Lasar v. Bechtel Power Corp. </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 491, 494, 727 P.2d 526, 528) (emphasis added). <em>See Rauch v. Michel </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 1, 6-7, 716 P.2d 617, 620 (awarding reciprocal attorney\u2019s fees for contract \u201cportion\u201d of the action that also included action for \u201cinterference with peaceable occupation of home and property\u201d after sprinkler system was wrongfully repossessed). <em>See also Town Pump Inc. v. Diteman </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 98, 105, 622 P.2d 212, 216-17 (reciprocal right under \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA, cannot exist without express right held by losing party).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b631 Thus, under \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA, a \u201cprevailing party\u201d analysis may be required, but the claiming party\u2019s right to recovery is nevertheless limited by the reciprocal contract provision itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b632 Here, under the indemnification clause, the only action that could have given rise to the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees was \u201cany breach\u201d of the release agreement. Accordingly, the only action upon which a reciprocal recovery may be based, under \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA, is a successful defense of an action for breach. Accordingly, TANI\u2019s contention that fees for defending Wellington\u2019s action for rescission, which was not finally resolved until the District Court issued is Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law following trial, must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b633 Further, in contrast to the \u201cportion of action\u201d award in <em>Rauch, </em>much of the authority TANI relies on involves much broader \u201cprevailing party\u201d provisions, offering greater express rights to recovery. For example in <em>Bell, </em>the attorney\u2019s fee provision provided that \u201c[i]n the event that either party may institute legal action for the enforcement of <em>any </em>right, obligation, provision or covenant of this Agreement, the <em>prevailing party </em>shall be entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee in addition to costs of suit.\u201d <em>Bell, </em>228 Mont. at 217, 741 P.2d at 789 (emphasis added). Similarly, in <em>Wise v. Sebena </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 32-34, 808 P.2d 494-496, the attorney\u2019s fees provision in a buy-sell agreement provided in the event of litigation <em>concerning the contract, </em>the <em>successful party </em>was entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u00b634  We therefore disagree with TANI that it should recover all of its fees incurred from October 13, 1998 to the present. In its own words, TANI argued to the District Court that the \u201cprinciple which eludes Defendants\u2019 grasp ... is that Plaintiff is <em>not </em>claiming attorney\u2019s fees for prevailing on it\u2019s tort claims; rather Plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees because Defendants\u2019 counterclaim for breach of the Release contract failed.\u201d It should therefore not elude TANI\u2019s grasp that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>under the clear language of the statute, it is vested with only \u201cthe same rights to attorney fees as are expressly provided to a successful plaintiff in the agreement.\u201d <em>Garrison, </em>282 Mont. at 521, 938 P.2d at 709-10. Thus, under \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA, TANI has the statutory right to recover only those fees incurred in defending against Wellington\u2019s breach of contract counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\">\u00b635  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred by concluding that, in regards to awarding attorney\u2019s fees, \u201cthere was no prevailing party in this case.\u201d We hold that TANI prevailed in the underlying breach of contract claim brought by Wellington, and therefore is legally entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for its successful defense of that claim pursuant to the parties\u2019 contract\u2019s indemnification provision and \u00a7 28-3-704, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b636 The District Court specifically concluded that TANI did not present \u201cany evidence (verified or otherwise) as to the percentage of the $45,000 spent defending the counterclaim.\u201d Having concluded that as a matter of law TANI is entitled to reciprocal attorney\u2019s fees, it may therefore provide the court with such evidence upon remand. The District Court, however, ultimately has the discretion to determine what constitutes a reasonable amount for such an award. <em>See Gandy v. Eschler </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 355, 361, 862 P.2d 1116, 1120. \u00b637 In addition, TANI requested its attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred on appeal. TANI directs our attention to the rule that an \u201caward of attorney\u2019s fees is proper on appeal where the fees are based on a contract.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>248 Mont. at 40, 808 P.2d at 499 (citation omitted); <em>Chamberlin v. Puckett Const. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 198, 210, 921 P.2d 1237, 1244 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b638 The rule in <em>Wise </em>and <em>Chamberlin, </em>however, is shorthand for a more-complete rule found in <em>Diehl &amp; Associates v. Houtchens </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 48, 53, 588 P.2d 1014, 1017. In that case we awarded fees on appeal based on a contract that \u201cobviously contemplated that attorney fees on appeal as well as at trial were to be charged.\u201d <em>Diehl, </em>180 Mont. at 53, 808 P.2d at 1017. The provision in <em>Diehl </em>provided: \u201cIn case of suit or action on this contract, I (referring to Houtchens) agree to pay such additional sum as the court, <em>both trial and appellate, </em>may adjudge reasonable as plaintiff\u2019s attorneys <em>fees.\u201d Diehl, </em>180 Mont. at 51, 808 P.2d at 1016 (emphasis added). Under the same reciprocal fee statute at issue here, we ultimately determined that Houtchens was the prevailing party, and therefore was entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees including those incurred upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u00b639  We conclude that the contract provision in question here contemplated such an award. It expressly provided that \u201call liability, claim, loss, damage or expense\u201d paid by one party by reason of \u201cany breach\u201d would be subject to indemnification, including \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that TANI may recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b640 This case is reversed and remanded to the District Court for determination of attorney\u2019s fees including those accrued by TANI on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\">. Recently, in <em>Norwood v.
