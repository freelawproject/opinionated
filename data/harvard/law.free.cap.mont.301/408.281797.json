Did the District Court err when it denied Reesman\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized as the result of an illegal search?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-16\">2. Did the District Court err when it denied Reesman\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges because the State destroyed evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-18\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b442-19\">\u00b64 During the search of a trailer home located in Big Sky, Montana, in which Gallatin County Sheriff\u2019s officers believed marijuana was growing in a bedroom closet, more than 100 \u201chits\u201d of LSD were found in another bedroom where the Appellant Reesman lived. The search was conducted pursuant to a search warrant allegedly validated by the statements of a confidential informant and corroborated by information received from an \u201canonymous citizen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-20\">\u00b65 Reesman\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence gathered in his bedroom as well as his testimony to the officers was heard by the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Court on July 24,1998. The following factual scenario was set forth in the warrant application and testified to at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b66 On November 28, 1995, a confidential informant provided Gallatin County Detective Don Hanson (Hanson) with first-hand information concerning a variety of illegal drug-related activity at a trailer home located in Big Sky, Montana. Hanson was assigned at the time to the Missouri River Drug Task Force. The warrant application did not indicate whether the informant had provided law enforcement officers with accurate information regarding criminal activity in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b67 The informant stated that a person named Brent Hoge, or \u201cBeau Dylan Hogge\u201d answered the door, and escorted her to his bedroom located at the north end of the trailer. There, he allegedly revealed marijuana growing in a closet, as well as recently harvested \u201cbuds.\u201d According to the informant, he also showed her spore-like growth in a styrofoam cup, which he claimed were mushrooms that produce the illegal hallucinogen, psilocybin. These described events allegedly took place, according to the informant, on the weekend of October 28,1995. The informant did not give information that any other person was conducting illegal activity of any type in the trailer, and she did not mention Reesman by name, or indicate that he was living in the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b68 Hanson also testified that an \u201canonymous citizen,\u201d who had provided reliable information in the past, told him that the marijuana growing operation had existed at that location for approximately one year. This information was included in the application. The application omitted, however, further detail as to whether this informant\u2019s information came from personal observation, or under what context law enforcement personnel had received the prior rehable information.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u00b69 According to testimony, neither Hanson nor any other law enforcement officer took further steps to corroborate the information supplied by the informant and anonymous citizen other than, apparently, confirming that a trailer as described by the informants was located at the given address. Hanson testified that he attempted to learn more about other residents at the trailer through telephone records, power records, and vehicles at the residence. Despite these efforts, he was unable to ascertain who owned the trailer, and no information concerning any such records was included in his application for the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\u00b610 Nevertheless, Hanson applied for and obtained a search warrant for the entire trailer two days later on November 30, 1995. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>that same day, at approximately 11:40 a.m., the search warrant was executed by Hanson and other officers. Four persons were found in the trailer, including Reesman, as officers commenced gathering evidence pursuant to the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b6 11 Hanson advised Reesman of his constitutional rights pursuant to <em>Miranda, </em>and interviewed him in his bedroom. During this interview two other officers searched Reesman\u2019s bedroom. Reesman signed a written \u201cwaiver of rights\u201d form at that time, which gave the officers permission to conduct the search. The waiver form expressly included the entire residence. Reesman would contend that in signing the waiver, he believed he was only consenting to a search of his vehicle. Hanson\u2019s report, in fact, stated that he obtained only Reesman\u2019s consent to search the vehicle. Reesman testified that he did not understand the consent form at the time, and would not have consented to the search of his bedroom if he had been given the option. Although the waiver was sought, Hanson maintained that the original warrant validly provided that officers could search the entire trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b612 The initial search of Reesman\u2019s bedroom produced 13 hits of LSD. Reesman then told the officers where more could be found in his room. The officers found an additional 110 hits of LSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\u00b613 On May 22, 1998, Reesman moved to suppress the evidence found in his bedroom, as well as his statements made to officers at the time, claiming that the search warrant issued for the entire trailer lacked probable cause, and that it was overbroad. At that time, Reesman pled not guilty to one count of criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to sell, a felony, and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u00b614 Following the July 24,1998 hearing, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order. The court followed the well-established Montana rule that the determination of whether there was sufficient probable cause for a court to issue a search warrant must follow the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test. \u00b615 The court determined that corroboration of the confidential informant\u2019s first-hand, detailed information by an anonymous tip weighed heavily in favor of the informant\u2019s reliability, and therefore concluded that there was a substantial basis upon which the issuing court found probable cause for the search warrant. The court stated, in its conclusions of law, that \u201c[t]he application for the search warrant provided sufficient probable cause that criminal activity was occurring at the residence named in the caption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u00b616 The court also determined that Reesman\u2019s consent was, ultimately, Immaterial in that the original search warrant covered the entire residence, including Reesman\u2019s bedroom. Even so, the court concluded that \u201cthe consent was sought to only search the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Abe\">\u00b6 17 Reesman ultimately pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to one count of criminal possession of dangerous drugs, which is a felony offense. He received a suspended sentence of three years. Reesman appealed the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion to suppress evidence, as well as a denial of a motion to dismiss based on destruction of evidence. This matter was heard at oral argument on May 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b6 18 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous. <em>See State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 6, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 6, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b6 6 (citing <em>State v. Siegal </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 250, 257, 934 P.2d 176, 180). Further, the standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>See State v. Hubbel </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 200, 207, 951 P.2d 971, 975 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b619 Finally, this Court\u2019s function as a reviewing court is to ultimately ensure that the magistrate or the lower court had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d to determine that probable cause existed. <em>State v. Crowder </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 169, 173, 810 P.2d 299, 302. It is critical in our review, however, that a magistrate\u2019s determination that probable cause exists be paid great deference and every reasonable inference possible be drawn to support that determination. <em>State v. Rinehart </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 204, 211, 864 P.2d 1219, 1223 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">\u00b620 Reesman claims that, from a number of legal angles, the search warrant issued in this instance must be viewed as \u201cfatally\u201d defective, and that due to the destruction of evidence, the District Court erred by not dismissing this case. We conclude that the issue of whether the information supplied by the informants was sufficient to establish probable cause is dispositive, and we therefore narrow our review without reaching the other issues raised by Reesman.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">\u00b621 Furthermore, the State concedes that, in light of the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions, Reesman did not validly consent to a search of his bedroom and thus the signed waiver was ineffective. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Therefore, if information provided in the application for the search warrant did not provide a substantial basis for a probable cause determination, the District Court\u2019s denial of Reesman\u2019s motion to suppress evidence must be reversed. Accordingly, we address the following issue, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\n<em>Did the District Court err by concluding that the application for a search warrant, which provided a confidential in-, formant\u2019s information supplied to law enforcement officers as well as corroboration by an anonymous citizen, created a substantial basis upon which a magistrate could determine probable cause?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b622 The District Court concluded that \u201c[t]he application for the search warrant provided sufficient probable cause that criminal activity was occurring at the residence named in the caption.\u201d Reesman points to the fact that the information provided by the confidential informant found in the application was corroborated only by an \u201canonymous citizen,\u201d and not by further independent police investigation. The reliability of the \u201canonymous\u201d citizen, in turn, was not corroborated by any further independent investigation. Thus, he contends, the warrant application clearly failed to establish probable cause pursuant to Montana\u2019s case law grounded in the <em>Gates </em>totality of the circumstances test.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b623 Although conceding that law enforcement personnel did not personally take action to independently corroborate the two informants\u2019 information, the State argues that the confidential informant had personal knowledge of the marijuana growing operation in Hogge\u2019s bedroom, and her information was independently corroborated by a citizen informant who had given reliable information in the past and who reported that the marijuana growing operation seen by the confidential informant had been in effect for nearly a year. The State contends that, taken as a whole, the combination of this information is sufficient standing alone to establish probable cause for the search warrant under the totality of the circumstances test.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u00b624  The core question here, therefore, is the sufficiency of the application for a search warrant. An application for a search warrant must state facts sufficient to show probable cause for the issuance of the warrant. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-5-221, MCA; <em>State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 21, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 21, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b6 21. To address the issue of proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ble cause for issuance of a warrant, this Court follows the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test set forth in <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527. <em>See State v. Crowder </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 169, 173, 810 P.2d 299, 302. Under this test, to determine whether a search warrant should be issued, the judge evaluates the facts asserted within the four corners of the application and makes a practical, common-sense decision as to whether there is a fair probability that incriminating items will be found in the place to which entry is sought. <em>See State v. Worrall, </em>1999 MT 55, \u00b6 28, 293 Mont. 439, \u00b6 28, 976 P.2d 968, \u00b6 28 (citing State <em>v. Sundberg </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 115, 119, 765 P.2d 736, 739).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b625 As a reviewing court, we too must look solely to the information given to the impartial magistrate and to the four corners of the search warrant application. <em>See Crowder, </em>248 Mont. at 173, 810 P.2d at 302 (citing <em>Sundberg, </em>235 Mont. at 121, 765 P.2d at 740). We have often stated, however, that in so doing we must refuse to review a search warrant application sentence by sentence; rather, we must examine the entire affidavit to determine whether the issuing magistrate had a substantial basis to conclude that probable cause existed. <em>State v. Hulbert </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 317, 323, 877 P.2d 25, 29 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"ANF\">\u00b626 By no means is the issue raised here novel. Yet, as evidenced by the parties\u2019 briefs as well as their oral arguments before this Court, our case law as a whole creates an appearance of convolution. The cases cited by both parties reveal a broad spectrum of factual scenarios where information is provided by \u201canonymous\u201d informants who have personally witnessed criminal activity and \u201cconfidential\u201d informants who have not, but are nevertheless deemed \u201creliable\u201d\u2014 or vice versa. Often \u201cconcerned citizens\u201d offer information regarding what they have seen or heard regarding actual criminal activity, or merely what they regard as suspicious activity. At the receiving end of such information are law enforcement officers who may choose to follow up on these tips and interviews, utilizing a variety of investigatory tools. Eventually, the \u201ctotality\u2019 of the gathered information may be drafted into an application for a search warrant, and, at some point, a threshold is crossed: the independent magistrate, based on the information contained within the four corners of the application determines that, yes, probable cause exists and a citizen\u2019s person or property may be searched by law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b627 Upon closer review, however, a synthesis of our case law chalks a fairly uniform equation for determining whether an informant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>statements, without further law enforcement corroboration or investigation, are sufficient to establish probable cause. True, we must observe the underlying principle of the <em>Gates </em>test, that this \u201ctotality of the circumstances approach\u201d by design resists \u201cany rigid demand that <em>specific tests </em>be satisfied by every informant\u2019s tip.\u201d <em>State v. Kelly </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 417, 439, 668 P.2d 1032, 1044 (quoting from <em>Illinois v. </em>Gates) (emphasis added). Nevertheless, based on 17 years of precedent laid down by this Court since we adopted the <em>Gates </em>test in <em>Kelly </em>and <em>State v. O\u2019Neill </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 386, 679 P.2d 760, certain indelible threshold rules have emerged. In turn, these rules may be merged into a fairly coherent step-by-step analysis for determining whether an informant\u2019s information is sufficient to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\n<em>A. The anonymous informant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b628  First, a threshold question may be asked: is the informant anonymous? This means that law enforcement officers have no idea who is providing the information. A phoned-in Crimestoppers \u201ctip\u201d is one frequent, common example. If the answer is yes, then independent corroboration of the informant\u2019s information is required. This Court has routinely stated that \u201c[c]orroboration of an informant\u2019s information through other sources is necessary when the information is hearsay or the informant is anonymous.\u201d State <em>v. Rinehart </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 204, 211-12, 864 P.2d 1219, 1223-24 (concluding that an \u201canonymous Crimestoppers\u2019 tip, by itself, is not adequate to support probable cause without further investigation to verify or corroborate the information contained in the tip,\u201d and citing <em>State v. Valley </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 489, 493, 830 P.2d 1255, 1257).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\n<em>B. Personal observation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">\u00b629  If the informant is not anonymous, we may then proceed to a second threshold question: is the informant\u2019s information based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>his or her personal observation of the described criminal activity? In other words, is the basis of the information hearsay? <em>See Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 212, 864 P.2d at 1224 (stating that an \u201cinformant\u2019s personal observation of criminal activity does not constitute hearsay evidence\u201d); <em>State v. Kaluza </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 404, 411, 901 P.2d 107, 111 (concluding that informants\u2019 information in warrant application contained no reference to personal observation or personal knowledge, and was therefore of \u201cno value\u201d). <em>See also State v. Wilson </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 317, 319, 837 P.2d 1346, 1347 (concluding that \u201cbare assertion\u201d of personal observation of marijuana growing in defendant\u2019s house failed to sufficiently describe the interior of the house and the location of the marijuana growing operation).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b630 If the answer is no, then again independent corroboration is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\n<em>C. Reliability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b631 If the information of actual criminal activity was gleaned from the personal observations of a non-anonymous person, then we may proceed to a final threshold question: is the informant a reliable source of such information? This question, in turn, breaks down into three clearly identifiable scenarios within our search and seizure jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\n<em>1. The confidential informant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u00b632  If an informant is identified in a law enforcement officer\u2019s application for a search warrant as a \u201cconfidential informant,\u201d he or she must have provided reliable and accurate information to officers in the past in order for the information to serve as a basis for determining probable cause without further corroboration. This Court has held that a \u201csworn statement [by a law officer] that an informant has been reliable and provided accurate information on other occasions is sufficient to establish that the informant is reliable.\u201d <em>Kaluza, </em>272 Mont. at 410, 901 P.2d at 111 (citations omitted). <em>See also Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 212, 864 P.2d at 1223-24 (concluding that a search warrant application provided a substantial basis to conclude probable cause existed to issue the search warrant based on officer\u2019s statement that informant was reliable in the past); <em>State v. Walston </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 218, 223, 768 P.2d 1387, 1390 (determining that \u201cinformation of a criminal activity known from observation by a previously reliable informant... is sufficient to establish the probability of criminal activity without outside investigation and verification of the reported information\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\n<em>2. The admission against interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b633  Alternatively, if the informant makes an unequivocal admission against interest, this Court has likewise held that further corroboration is unnecessary. <em>See State v. Adams </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 25, 37, 943 P.2d 955, 962 (concluding that admissions against interest regarding participation in setting up a marijuana growing operation, \u201cwithout any further corroboration,\u201d provided the district court with a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause supported the search warrant). <em>See also State v. Sundberg </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 115, 121, 765 P.2d 736, 740 (quoting from <em>United States v. Harris </em>(1971), 403 U.S. 573, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723, that \u201c[ajdmissions of crime, like admissions against proprietary interests, carry their own indicia of credibility \u2014 sufficient at least to support a finding of probable cause to search\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\n<em>3. The concerned citizen.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b634  Finally, if the informant was motivated by \u201cgood citizenship\u201d and the information provided demonstrates a sufficient degree of the nature of the circumstances under which the incriminating information became known, then the informant\u2019s disclosures are deemed a reliable basis for determining probable cause. This Court has stated that a citizen informant is presumed reliable and such reliability \u201cis generally shown by the very nature of the circumstances under which the incriminating information became known.\u201d <em>State v. Valley </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 489, 493, 830 P.2d 1255, 1258 (citing <em>State v. Niehaus </em>(Iowa 1990), 452 N.W.2d 184, 189). <em>See also State v. Worrall, </em>1999 MT 55, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 293 Mont. 439, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 976 P.2d 968, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21 (concluding that child witness was reliable in providing information of discovering marijuana growing on defendant\u2019s property while snake hunting); <em>State v. Oleson, </em>1998 MT 130, \u00b6 14, 289 Mont. 139, \u00b6 14, 959 P.2d 503, \u00b6 14 (stating that information motivated by good citizenship is accepted as reliable for purposes of determining probable cause to issue a search warrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\u00b635 If the ultimate answer under the foregoing examinations of reliability is no \u2014 that the informant is <em>not </em>a reliable source of such information \u2014 then once again independent police corroboration is required. If the answer to the question of reliability is yes, then based on the informant\u2019s information alone, without corroboration, an application for a search warrant may supply the magistrate with a substantial basis for finding probable cause and, consequently, issuing the search warrant. <em>See </em>Walston, 236 Mont. at 223, 768 P.2d at 1390.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u00b636 Naturally, the foregoing analysis does not bar a defendant from challenging the warrant on other grounds, such as staleness or the inclusion of incorrect or misleading information in the application for a warrant. Likewise, a defendant may challenge whether the law enforcement officer\u2019s independent corroboration or investigation was sufficient within the context of a court\u2019s totality of the circumstances analysis. Such corollary grounds, however, are not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b637 In this instance, the confidential informant was not \u201canonymous,\u201d in that she met face-to-face with Detective Hanson, and was subjected to his questioning. Next, her observations, no doubt, were based on personal observations. She stated that she visited the trailer home in question, met with Hogge, and viewed first-hand the marijuana growing in a bedroom closet, describing the trailer home and its interior with sufficient particularity. Thus, the first two threshold steps are clearly satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b638 At step three, however, the application for a search warrant did not indicate that as a \u201cconfidential informant,\u201d the person was known by law enforcement personnel to have been reliable and a source of accurate information in the past, prior to her meeting with Detective Hanson on November 28, 1995. How she became classified by Gallatin County Sheriff\u2019s officers as \u201cConfidential Informant (Cl) 95-1128\u201d remains a mystery (disregarding, as we must, suppression hearing testimony that provides information beyond the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the application originally viewed by the issuing magistrate in this instance). Next, the application did not indicate that the statements were an admission against interest by a co-conspirator or a customer of illegal drugs. Finally, the application simply does not indicate first, that the person was acting as a \u201cconcerned citizen,\u201d and second, and more importantly, under what circumstances the informant went to and entered the trailer that day and subsequently was shown the incriminating information she later shared with Detective Hanson. Was she there to clean the carpet? Collect rent? Purchase a gram or two of the fresh harvest? Was she acting under law enforcement direction? Why did Hogge so willingly show her his illegal operation? We do not know, and, accordingly, neither did the reviewing magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b639  We hold, therefore, that without further, independent corroboration or investigation, the confidential informant\u2019s information found within the search warrant application here must fail as supply<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ing the magistrate with the substantial basis necessary for the determination that probable cause existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\n<em>D. Independent corroboration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b640 The State nevertheless argues that independent corroboration or investigation of the confidential informant\u2019s information <em>was </em>supplied to the magistrate in Detective Hanson\u2019s application by an \u201canonymous citizen, who has provided reliable information in the past.\u201d At oral argument, the State asserted that under our decisions in <em>Rydberg, </em>(1989) 239 Mont. 70, 778 P.2d 902, <em>Oleson, </em>and <em>Deskins, </em>(1990) 245 Mont. 158. 799 P.2d 1070, this Court has a sufficient basis to validate the probable cause showing here. The State further contends that there is \u201cnothing in the [Deskins] opinion which suggests that a tip from a citizen informant whose reliability is known to officers cannot serve to corroborate information from a confidential informant unless there is independent corroboration of the citizen\u2019s tip as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b641 Indeed, we stated in <em>Deskins </em>that \u201c[p]ersonal observation of criminal activity by an informant <em>whose reliability can be established </em>provides probable cause.\u201d <em>State v. Deskins </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 158, 163, 799 P.2d 1070, 1073 (emphasis added). Contrary to the State\u2019s argument, however, the corroborating information in <em>Deskins </em>was not supplied by another, uncorroborated source of information, but from the independent investigation of a detective. In that case, an anonymous informant supplied investigators with detailed first-hand information of a marijuana growing operation. In turn, officers independently verified that Deskins resided at the home identified by the caller, and proceeded to gather evidence of power consumption records, a synopsis of which was contained in the warrant application. <em>See Deskins, </em>245 Mont. at 162, 799 P.2d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b642 The same factual scenario is present in <em>Rydberg </em>and <em>Oleson. </em>In both instances, officers took independent action to further corroborate information supplied by the informants. <em>See State v. Rydberg </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 70, 73, 778 P.2d 902, 904 (criminal background checks); <em>Oleson, </em>\u00b6 10 (vehicle registration and criminal scene investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b643 As a underlying general rule, further independent corroboration or investigation by law enforcement personnel is the panacea for most warrant applications where information is supplied by an informant. In <em>State v. Walston, </em>we identified this key element expressed in <em>Gates, </em>where the United States Supreme Court determined that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>anonymous letter combined with other police findings established probable cause. We recognized the <em>Gates </em>Court\u2019s observation that the subsequent investigation conducted by law enforcement personnel verified the facts stated by the informant, which in turn justified the issuing magistrate\u2019s conclusion that a probability of criminal activity existed. <em>See Walston, </em>236 Mont. at 222, 768 P.2d at 1389-90. <em>See also Deskins, </em>245 Mont. at 159-60, 799 P.2d at 1071 (anonymous tip corroborated by extensive police investigation); <em>Crowder, </em>248 Mont. at 174, 810 P.2d at 302 (concluding that although information in warrant application combined with officer\u2019s investigation was \u201cless complete than would be desirable,\u201d it nevertheless served as a sufficient basis for probability that contraband would be found at residence).</p>\n<p id=\"Azrn\">\u00b644 In this sense, \u201ccorroboration\u201d or \u201cfurther investigation\u201d as used throughout the foregoing case law \u2014 contrary to the State\u2019s argument here \u2014 infers independent <em>police </em>work of some kind. <em>See Crowder, </em>248 Mont. at 173, 810 P.2d at 302 (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 241-42, 103 S.Ct. at 2334, 76 L.Ed.2d at 550, and stating that \u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court emphasized the \u2018value of corroboration of details of an informant\u2019s tip by independent <em>police </em>work\u2019 establishing a \u2018substantial basis for crediting the hearsay\u201d \u201d) (emphasis added). <em>See also Valley, </em>252 Mont. at 493, 830 P.2d at 1257 (stating that \u201ccommon sense\u201d dictates further law enforcement investigation to verify or corroborate the tips received from informants).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b645 In fact, our case law offers numerous successful examples of such corroboration or further investigation that established the sufficiency of an informant\u2019s information. For example, in <em>Deskins </em>the officers through various sources including an investigative subpoena verified home ownership, a business licence, vehicle registration, and utility records indicating increased power consumption after receiving \u00e1n anonymous tip of a marijuana growing operation. <em>Deskins, </em>245 Mont. at 159-60, 799 P.2d at 1071. Officers have also included in their warrant applications rental information which they have independently verified. <em>See Adams, </em>284 Mont. at 30, 943 P.2d at 958. Numerous cases discuss warrant applications that describe a variety of investigatory drive-bys and visits to a residence to confirm addresses, house descriptions, and other information supplied by informants. <em>See, e.g., State v. Holstine </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 310, 312-13, 860 P.2d 110, 111-12 (officer observes covered window and smells growing marijuana from outside of trailer home); <em>State v. Hook </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 2, 3, 839 P.2d 1274, 1275 (officer confirms address and drives by house to confirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>description of exterior); <em>Kuneff, </em>\u00b6 7 (officers admitted into home and observe paraphernalia). Similarly, in some instances, officers have investigated the scene of an alleged crime, and gathered evidence that verifies the informant\u2019s information. <em>See Oleson, </em>\u00b6 10. Another routine piece of information indicating police corroboration is criminal background checks. <em>See, e.g., State v. Mosley </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 109, 114, 860 P.2d 69, 72; <em>Rydberg, </em>239 Mont. at 73, 778 P.2d at 904. Characteristically, none of these acts of independent law enforcement corroboration or investigation require further corroboration by an officer. <em>But see Kaluza, </em>272 Mont. at 411, 901 P.2d at 111 (determining that power usage information gathered by police that lacked \u201cdetailed comparisons\u201d with average and previous resident\u2019s usage was insufficient); <em>Wilson, </em>254 Mont. at 319, 837 P.2d at 1347 (information about power usage in search warrant application was conclusory). Further, although under our decision in <em>Rinehart </em>a Crimestoppers tip may provide <em>some </em>corroboration and indicate the veracity of other information provided, an anonymous source as well as hearsay information nevertheless requires further corroboration. <em>See Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 212, 864 P.2d at 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b646  The State concedes that the statements of the confidential informant in the search warrant application here \u201cneeded to be independently corroborated.\u201d The State then attempts to supplant actual law enforcement officers\u2019 corroboration with information from an anonymous citizen who, uncannily, \u201cprovided reliable information in the past.\u201d Notwithstanding this obvious contradiction, we hold that a source of information that requires further corroboration under the analysis set forth here cannot serve as a source of independent corroboration or investigation that transforms another informant\u2019s information into a basis for establishing probable case. As our case law makes clear, an anonymous source <em>always </em>requires corroboration. <em>See Worrall, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u00b647 Finally, the reference to the \u201canonymous citizen\u201d in the application provides no indicia of reliability of a citizen informant in terms of personal observation, or the circumstances under which the person made his or her personal observations. Thus, even ignoring the \u201canonymous\u201d status of the citizen informant, the inclusion of this piece of information offers no corroboration value to the warrant application as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b648  Accordingly, we conclude that the application for a search warrant did not provide a substantial basis for the conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>probable cause existed for the search of the Big Sky trailer home in which Reesman resided. We hold, therefore, that the District Court erred in denying Reesman\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained during the execution of the search warrant. Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b455-4\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\">. We note that this rule as it appears in more recent case law includes the term \u201conly\u201d meaning that <em>only </em>when an informant is anonymous or provides hearsay must further corroboration be supplied by law enforcement officers. <em>See State v. Worrall, </em>1999 MT 55, \u00b6 22, 293 Mont. 439, \u00b6 22, 976 P.2d 968, \u00b6 22 (citing <em>State v. Adams </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 25, 37, 943 P.2d 955, 962, which cites to <em>State v. Rinehart </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 204, 212, 864 P.2d 1219, 1224). As the following discussion indicates, the inclusion of this term misconstrues the rule as it originally appeared in <em>Rinehart. </em>We observe, therefore, that under <em>Worrall, Adams, </em>and <em>Rinehart, </em>further corroboration is <em>always </em>required when an informant is anonymous or provides mere hearsay, and yet further corroboration may be required in other instances as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"Av4\">JUSTICE REGNIER</author>\n<p id=\"AVQ\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b649 I concur that the search warrant application in this case was insufficient in that it did not provide a substantial basis for the conclusion that probable cause existed to search the trailer home in which Reesman resided. However, I disagree with the Court\u2019s reasoning. In my view the Court\u2019s conclusion that corroboration must be accomplished through \u201cpolice investigation\u201d is too restrictive. I would conclude that the confidential informant\u2019s report was not sufficiently corroborated by the tip from the anonymous citizen because the circumstances provided by Detective Hanson concerning who provided the tip and how the tip was acquired were too conclusory for a magistrate to independently review.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">1. Confidential Informant\u2019s Report</p>\n<p id=\"AJ5\">\u00b650 I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the information provided by the confidential informant was insufficient, standing alone, to justify the issuance of a search warrant. In analyzing the sufficiency of a search warrant application, we have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">To address the issue of probable cause for issuance of a warrant, this Court has adopted the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test set forth in <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76-L.Ed.2d 527. The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before [the magistrate], including the \u201cveracity\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. [T]he duty of the reviewing court is to ensure the magistrate had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for ... concluding] that probable cause existed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\"><em>State v. Wilson </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 317, 318-19, 837 P.2d 1346, 1347 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">\u00b651 The first source of Detective Hanson\u2019s information was referred to as \u201cConfidential Informant 95-1128.\u201d Detective Hanson stated that he conducted an interview with this confidential informant who advised Detective Hanson that the confidential informant had visited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the trailer home in which Reesman resided and had observed marijuana plants growing in a bedroom closet, drying marijuana \u201cbuds,\u201d and Styrofoam cups containing \u201cpsilocybin mushrooms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b652 Detective Hanson provided sufficient information in the search warrant application for the reviewing judge to determine that the confidential informant\u2019s report, if honest, was likely to be true because the informant\u2019s knowledge was based on the informant\u2019s personal observations of criminal activity. <em>See State v. Rinehart </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 204, 213, 864 P.2d 1219, 1224. If an informant\u2019s report purports to be based on personal observation of criminal activity, further analysis centers not on the accuracy of the report, but on the honesty or veracity of the informant. <em>See Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 213, 864 P.2d at 1224 (holding that a previously reliable informant\u2019s report of criminal activity which was based on personal observation was sufficient to establish probable cause to issue a search warrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b653 Under the \u201cveracity\u201d test, facts must be brought to the judicial official\u2019s attention so that the judge can independently determine the inherent credibility of the informant, <em>see, e.g., State v. Kaluza </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 404, 410, 901 P.2d 107, 111 (stating that an officer\u2019s sworn statement that an informant has been reliable and provided accurate information on other occasions is sufficient to establish veracity); or facts must be brought to the judicial official\u2019s attention so that the judge can independently determine the reliability of the informant\u2019s information on this particular occasion, <em>see State v. Adams </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 25, 36, 943 P.2d 955, 961 (observing that \u201c[ajdmissions of crime, like admissions against proprietary interests, carry their own indicia of credibility\u201d); <em>State v. Worrall, </em>1999 MT 55, \u00b6 20, 293 Mont. 439, \u00b6 20, 976 P.2d 968, \u00b6 20 (stating that \u201cinformation provided to the police that is motivated by good citizenship is a reliable basis for determining probable cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b654 Detective Hanson provided absolutely no information regarding the confidential informant\u2019s veracity. Detective Hanson did not indicate that the confidential informant was inherently credible because the informant had a proven track record of providing reliable information in the past. Alternatively, Detective Hanson did not indicate that although the confidential informant did not have a proven track record of providing reliable information, the confidential informant\u2019s report was likely to be particularly reliable on this occasion because, for instance, it was an admission against the informant\u2019s in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>terest, or circumstances indicated that the report was motivated by good citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b655 Accordingly, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the confidential informant\u2019s report, standing alone, did not provide a sufficient basis for the issuance of a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">2. Corroboration by \u201cAnonymous Citizen\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">a. Court\u2019s approach: \u201cindependent police work\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u00b656 As the Court correctly frames it, the issue then becomes whether the confidential informant\u2019s report was independently corroborated such that, despite its inadequacy, it could still form part of the basis for the issuance of a search warrant. The only corroboration of the confidential informant\u2019s report was contained in the following statement: \u201cAn anonymous citizen, who has provided reliable information in the past, stated that the marijuana grow has been in existence for approximately one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\u00b657 The Court concludes that this corroboration is deficient for two reasons. First, the corroboration was insufficient because it did not provide an independent basis for a determination of probable cause. <em>See </em>Court\u2019s opinion at \u00b6 46 (stating that \u201cwe hold that a source of information that requires further corroboration ... cannot serve as a source of independent corroboration\u201d). Second, the corroboration was insufficient because it was not the result of \u201cpolice investigation.\u201d Court\u2019s opinion at \u00b6\u00b6 41-45. Pursuant to the Court\u2019s opinion, the <em>only </em>corroboration that can serve to cure the inadequacies of an informant\u2019s report is corroboration through \u201cindependent investigation\u201d by law enforcement personnel. <em>See </em>Court\u2019s opinion at \u00b6 43. In effect, the Court\u2019s conclusion means that an application for a warrant that contains information from an informant can only be sufficient under two factual scenarios: either (1) the informant\u2019s report provides a sufficient basis for a determination of probable cause and therefore does not require any further corroboration; or (2) an informant\u2019s report is insufficient but is \u201ccorroborated\u201d by \u201cpolice investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">\u00b658 In my view, corroboration by \u201cpolice investigation\u201d is certainly a reliable method of corroboration, however, corroboration could be accomplished by other means as well. More importantly, however, I fear this requirement diverts the judicial officer\u2019s attention from the more important question which, on the facts of the instant case, is whether Detective Hanson presented sufficient information for the judge to accredit the confidential informant\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>\u00b659 Significantly, as with all bright line tests, the majority\u2019s line is not as bright as it first appears. It is not clear what independent police corroboration is. For example, had Detective Hanson simply alleged <em>\u201cI called an anonymous citizen </em>...\u201d would the addition of those three words turn the corroboration in this case into \u201cpolice work\u201d sufficient to justify the issuance of a warrant? If so, why? What purpose does this distinction serve in the probable cause analysis? Although I agree with the majority that in most circumstances it will take independent police work to corroborate an informant\u2019s report that does not provide a sufficient basis for a determination of probable cause on its own, I believe that resolving these disputes based on simple factual characterization concerning how the corroborative information was acquired distracts law enforcement, judges, and reviewing courts from the purpose behind the warrant requirement,</p>\n<p id=\"Amc\">b. Analysis of concurrence</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b660 The corroboration of the confidential informant\u2019s report was that \u201c[a]n anonymous citizen, who has provided reliable information in the past, stated that the marijuana grow has been in existence for approximately one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b661 Detective Hanson characterized the source of this knowledge as an \u201canonymous citizen.\u201d The use of the term \u201canonymous\u201d implies that the source was unknown to Detective Hanson. The use of the word \u201ccitizen\u201d implies that the source was motivated by good citizenship. <em>See Worrall, </em>\u00b6 20 (observing that \u201cinformation provided to the police that is motivated by good citizenship is a reliable basis for determining probable cause\u201d). However, the phrase \u201cwho has provided reliable information in the past\u201d belies both of the aforementioned assumptions. From this phrase, it becomes clear that Detective Hanson was alleging that he knew the source\u2019s identity because the source had provided him with information in the past, but was keeping the source\u2019s identity confidential. Furthermore, it is evident that the source was not simply a \u201ccitizen,\u201d but rather was a person who had ongoing access to information about unlawful activities. Detective Hanson did not provide any circumstances regarding how he acquired the information from the \u201canonymous citizen\u201d nor did he provide any circumstances which might indicate how the \u201canonymous citizen\u201d learned of the \u201cmarijuana grow\u201d operation. Lastly, the only relevant information Detective Hanson provided concerning the \u201canonymous citizen\u201d was Detective Hanson\u2019s characterization of the \u201canonymous citizen\u2019s\u201d reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u00b662 I would conclude that this corroboration is insufficient to cure the inadequacy of the confidential informant\u2019s report because it is simply too conclusory. A judge would have to take too many leaps of faith in order to conclude that the \u201canonymous citizen\u2019s\u201d report was corroborative of the confidential informant\u2019s report. The search warrant in the present case does not detail any of the underlying circumstances of the \u201canonymous citizen\u2019s\u201d report and provides only the slightest reason for crediting this report (Detective Hanson\u2019s characterization of the \u201canonymous citizen\u2019s\u201d previous reliability). I agree with the Court that the addition of this purely conclusory report adds absolutely nothing to the search warrant. However, this is not because it was, or was not, acquired by independent police work, but rather because there is no reason to believe that it in fact corroborated the confidential informant\u2019s report. The precise problem is that this \u201ccorroboration\u201d is nothing more than a collection of bare assertions. As we previously stated in <em>Wilson, </em>\u201cDetail was not provided to support the conclusions drawn within the application. Conclusory statements will not provide substantial basis to conclude that probable cause existed to issue a search warrant.\u201d 254 Mont. at 319-20, 837 P.2d at 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b663 I recognize that reviewing courts should refrain from being hypertechnical when reviewing the legality of a search warrant. We have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">An affidavit supporting a search warrant is to be interpreted by the magistrate and examined by the reviewing court in a common sense, realistic fashion and without a grudging or negative attitude that will tend to discourage police officers from seeking warrants. Reviewing courts should avoid hypertechnical interpretations of warrant applications and, in doubtful or marginal cases, resolve the issue with the preference for warrants in mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN7\"><em>Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 210-11, 864 P.2d at 1223 (citing <em>State v. O\u2019Neill </em>(1984) 208 Mont. 386, 679 P.2d 760).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b664 The source of this oft-repeated language is <em>United States v. Ventresca </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 102, 85 S. Ct. 741, 13 L. Ed. 2d 684. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>208 Mont. at 393, 679 P.2d at 764. Interestingly, the next paragraph in <em>Ventresca, </em>which we have neglected to repeat, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">This is not to say that probable cause can be made out by affidavits which are purely conclusory, stating only the affiant\u2019s or an informer\u2019s belief that probable cause exists without detailing any of the \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d upon which that belief is based. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Recital of some of the underlying circumstances in the affidavit is essential if the magistrate is to perform [the magistrate] detached function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police. However, where these circumstances are detailed, where reason for crediting the source of the information is given, and when a magistrate has found probable cause, the courts should not invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit in a hyper technical, rather than a common sense, manner. Although in a particular case it may not be easy to determine when an affidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. at 108, 85 S. Ct. at 746 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b665 The Supreme Court\u2019s exhortation to resolve questionable cases in favor of upholding warrants is much more subtle and sophisticated than we have previously implied. I would interpret the forgoing to mean that when an affidavit is not purely conclusory, but rather details the underlying circumstances and supplies some reason for crediting the source of the information, a reviewing court should resolve a doubtful case with a preference for upholding the warrant. In the instant case, the confidential informant\u2019s report was insufficient because the search warrant application provided no evidence of the confidential informant\u2019s veracity. Additionally, the \u201canonymous citizen\u2019s\u201d report was not corroborative because it was merely a collection of bare assertions and thus could not supply an independent reason for crediting the confidential informant\u2019s report. However, this is not to imply, as the Court does, that information not acquired through \u201cindependent police investigation\u201d can never corroborate an insufficient informant\u2019s report unless it provides a sufficient basis on its own to support probable cause. <em>See </em>Court\u2019s Op. at \u00b6 46. It is conceivable that had Detective Hanson provided some of the underlying circumstances surrounding the \u201canonymous citizen\u2019s\u201d report, there may have been a substantial basis for the judge reviewing the application to conclude that there was a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in the trailer home.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b666 In short, for the benefit of law enforcement, I recommend the following advice: A sufficient warrant application should always detail both how the officer acquired the information giving rise to probable cause, and, if the officer is relying on an informant, how the informant acquired his or her knowledge and circumstances which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>indicate that the informant\u2019s report is worth crediting. For instance, as noted by the majority, Detective Hanson could have indicated how the confidential informant happened to be in the trailer home and this may have provided the judge with grounds for crediting the veracity of the confidential informant\u2019s report. <em>See </em>2 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 3.3(f) at 172, (3d ed. 1996) (\u201c[AJnother situation in which the corroboration will suffice to show veracity is that in which the informant has not been working independently, but rather has cooperated closely with the police.\u201d). Regarding the \u201canonymous citizen\u2019s\u201d report, Detective Hanson could have described the circumstances surrounding how he received the report from the \u201canonymous citizen,\u201d how he knew the \u201canonymous citizen,\u201d why he believed the \u201canonymous citizen\u201d was credible, and how the \u201canonymous citizen\u201d acquired his or her knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b667 For the foregoing reasons, I concur that the warrant application was insufficient. To conclude otherwise would be to render the constitutional search warrant requirement a mere formality. The corroboration of the confidential informant\u2019s report by the tip from the \u201canonymous citizen\u201d was simply too conclusory to allow a judge to independently determine the existence of probable cause to justify the issuance of a warrant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b461-5\">JUSTICE GRAY joins in the foregoing concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b461-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Abs\">responds to the concurring and dissenting opinions, joined by JUSTICE LEAPHART.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b668 Implicit in the concurring and dissenting opinions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are two notions: first, that the majority opinion has broken new ground or in some measure strayed from the principles set forth in <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>and subsequent Montana decisions; and, second that, in doing so, the majority has imposed an additional burden on law enforcement by creating yet another technical \u201choop\u201d for police officers to jump through in their efforts to ferret out crime and apprehend the guilty through the use of informants. Both conclusions are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\u00b669 Nevertheless, given the hostile knee-jerk reaction that typically attends the issuance of court opinions that are perceived \u2014 whether wrongly or rightly \u2014 as either making life more difficult for the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>or enforcing (much less enlarging) the constitutional rights of persons accused of crimes, a response to the concurring opinion is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b670 Although agreeing with the majority opinion that the search warrant application in this instance was insufficient, the concurring opinion suggests that the corroboration of information supplied by an unreliable source may be accomplished by means other than further police investigation. No authority is cited for this novel proposition. This, of course, begs the question, \u201cWhat other means are envisioned?\u201d The concurrence never says.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b671 As indicated in the majority opinion, further police investigation of an otherwise -unreliable source of information is the heart and soul of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>which this Court has followed since 1984. The U.S. Supreme Court stated that \u201c[o]ur decisions applying the totality of the circumstances analysis outlined above have consistently recognized the value of corroboration of details of an informant\u2019s tip by <em>independent police work\u201d Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 241, 103 S.Ct. at 2334 (emphasis added). The Court then discussed the \u201cclassic case on the value of <em>corroborative efforts of police officials.\u201d Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 242-43, 103 S.Ct. at 2334 (discussing <em>Draper v. United States </em>(1959), 358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327) (emphasis added). The Court also provided a detailed summary of detective Mader\u2019s corroborating efforts after receiving the anonymous letter that sparked the investigation of the Gates\u2019 drug selling operation: he sought driver\u2019s license information, he confirmed the Gates\u2019 address, he conferred with another police officer and confirmed airline flight information, and he contacted Drug Enforcement Administration agents and arranged for a surveillance operation that gathered further corroborating information.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b672 It was the recognition of these independent sources of information uncovered by further police efforts that led to the Court\u2019s reversal of the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s decision, which had determined that Mader\u2019s search warrant application was defective due to the lack of reliability of the original informant\u2019s anonymous letter. Thus, an informant\u2019s letter that the Court recognized \u201cstanding alone... would not provide the basis for a magistrate\u2019s determination that there was probable cause to believe contraband would be found in the Gates\u2019 car and home\u201d had been \u201ccorroborated in major part by Mader\u2019s efforts.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 227, 243, 103 S.Ct. at 2326, 2335. The Court further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The Supreme Court of Illinois reasoned that <em>Draper </em>involved an informant who had given reliable information on previous occasions, while the honesty and reliability of the anonymous informant in this case were unknown to the Bloomingdale police. While this distinction might be an apt one at the time the police department received the anonymous letter, it became far less significant after Mader\u2019s <em>independent investigative work </em>occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 243-44, 103 S.Ct. at 2335 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b673 Thus, under <em>Gates, </em>once officers receive information of illegal activities from sources that do not establish probable cause \u201cstanding alone,\u201d such information may nevertheless serve as a basis for establishing probable cause if the officers subsequently corroborate the information through independent investigation. As made plain in the majority opinion, there is no prescribed limit as to what independent resources \u2014 including the use of other informants \u2014 an officer might use for this corroboration. <em>See </em>majority opinion, at \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b674 Rather, the majority opinion carefully maps Montana case law, dividing information supplied by informants into two distinct categories: that which may stand alone for a probable cause determination, and that which requires further police investigation. In this instance, the information supplied by both the confidential informant and the anonymous citizen, standing alone, clearly falls into the latter category, and therefore each required further \u201ccorroboration through <em>other sources of information.\u201d Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 244, 103 S.Ct. at 2335 (emphasis added). Further, it is patently unclear from the warrant application at issue whether the information supplied by the \u201canonymous citizen\u201d was, in fact, gathered for the purpose of corroborating the confidential informant\u2019s information. Thus, this tip may have in fact been received prior to the confidential informant\u2019s November 1995 meeting with Detective Hanson, which, if true, emphasizes the lack of further investigation by officers in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b675 It is unclear, therefore, why the concurrence chooses to belabor under what circumstances the information supplied by one unreliable source could, conceivably, corroborate another unreliable source without \u201cfurther police investigation,\u201d and yet still establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">\u00b676 The underlying fallibility of the concurrence\u2019s reasoning on this point is revealed by the lengths to which it would be necessary for Detective Hanson to cure the defects of the \u201canonymous citizen,\u201d as a corroborating source of information. According to the concurring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>opinion, it is conceivable that had Detective Hanson provided some of the underlying circumstances surrounding the anonymous citizen\u2019s report, \u201cthere may have been a substantial basis for the judge reviewing the application to conclude that there was a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in the trailer home.\u201d According to the concurrence, Detective Hanson should have (1) described the circumstances surrounding how he received the report from the anonymous citizen, (2) how he knew the anonymous citizen, (3) why he believed the anonymous citizen was credible, and (4) how the anonymous citizen acquired his or her knowledge. <em>See </em>concurring opinion, at \u00b6 66. Consequently, the inclusion of this information could have corroborated the information supplied by the confidential informant, and led to a proper probable cause determination \u2014 again, without further investigation by officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b677 Accordingly, Detective Hanson could have attested in the warrant application (1) that he received a crime-stopper tip by phone; (2) that the person chose to identify him or herself, and that, in turn, he knew the person; (3) that the person had provided reliable and accurate information in the past; and (4) that the person had personally observed the grow operation during the course of the past year. The concurrence finds this process \u2014 which does not appear to involve \u201cfurther investigation\" \u2014 satisfactory to corroborate the confidential informant\u2019s information. And there is a good reason why. This is precisely the process outlined in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b678 First, the person is not anonymous. Second, the source personally observed the illegal activity. And third, the informant has provided reliable and accurate information in the past. If this had been the factual circumstances, as the concurring opinion suggests, the issue of \u201cindependent investigation\u201d would be irrelevant, because none would be required. Alternatively, at the risk of rehashing that which has already been made clear, under Montana case law if the person remained anonymous, further corroboration would have been required; if the source had not personally observed the illegal activity, further corroboration would have been required; and finally if the informant had not provided reliable and accurate information in the past, or was not a \u201cconcerned citizen,\u201d further corroboration would have been required.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b679 Thus, it remains unclear how the information provided by either the confidential informant or the anonymous citizen in this instance could have been cured for the purpose of establishing probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>cause by anything short of further police investigation, using other sources of information.</p>\n<judges id=\"b465-4\">JUSTICE LEAPHART joins in the' foregoing response to the concurring and dissenting opinions.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-9\">.

Certainly corroboration can be obtained in many ways other than \u201cindependent police investigation.\u201d For that reason, I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u00b681 The well-reasoned discussion concerning other aspects of the inadequacies of the warrant application in Justice Regnier\u2019s concurring opinion I believe to be correct, and, therefore, I join in that part of the concurring opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
