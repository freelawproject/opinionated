Seright, </em>1998 MT 198, \u00b6 45, 290 Mont. 309, \u00b6 45, 964 P.2d 749, \u00b6 45. The sufficiency of evidence to corroborate the testimony of an accomplice is a question of law. <em>See State v. Ungaretti </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 314, 317-18, 779 P.2d 923, 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">\u00b66 On the evening of June 22,1998 Fey, his mother, Mary Christaens (Christaens), a co-worker of Fey, Brian Russell (Russell), and a friend, Aaron Omsberg (Omsberg), watched professional wrestling on a television in Fey\u2019s trailer. They drank beer. Desirae Moss and her sister, Jolie Moss, came to Fey\u2019s trailer that evening. Later, everyone went in Christaens\u2019 car for a drive. They brought beer and whiskey with them. Fey drove. Fey lost control of the car on a gravel road. The car rolled repeatedly. Jolie and Desirae Moss and Christaens were thrown out of the car. Jolie Moss died at the scene of the accident. Desirae Moss and Christaens were both seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">\u00b67 After the accident, Fey climbed out of the car and determined that Jolie Moss was dead. He checked on the other car passengers and left the accident scene to get help. Fey testified at his trial that before he left the accident scene to get help, he grabbed three beers that he found outside the wrecked car, as he \u201cwas thirsty.\u201d Fey went to a house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>and summoned emergency assistance. He returned to the accident scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b68 Russell testified that before Fey left the accident scene, Fey told him to get rid of the alcohol. Russell testified that he gathered up the beer and a whiskey bottle and left them in a field.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b69 Police conducted an horizontal gaze nystagmus test of Fey; Fey scored a six out of a possible six points, indicating that his blood alcohol content exceeded 0.10. Police officers smelled alcohol but found no alcoholic beverages or containers in Christaens\u2019 car. Fey was taken by ambulance to a hospital. Fey agreed to give a blood sample but claimed that he drank three beers after the crash. His blood alcohol content was determined to be 0.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b610 Police interviewed Fey several days after the accident. Fey asserted that the car struck something on the road, that a defect in the steering column of the car led him to overcorrect, and that he lost control of the car. At trial, Fey testified that he did not think that \u201calcohol was the major part of the accident. I believe it was just bad luck, wrong time to be on the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u00b611 The day after the crash, Toole County Coroner Dan Whitted (Whitted) drove to the scene of the accident. Whitted looked north from the road and saw something shine in a field. He went to investigate and discovered a Bud Light beer box, cans of Bud Light beer, some of them full and some of them empty, and a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey. Whitted reported his discovery to police. Montana Highway Patrol Officer Jim Vollrath then went to the scene of the accident. About one to two hundred feet from the crash site, Vollrath found Bud Light beer cans thrown in a shotgun pattern in the field, a Bud Light beer box, and a quarter-full bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey.</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">\u00b6 12 Fey testified that he returned to the accident scene several days after the crash. He testified further that he \u201csaw something out there [in the field north of the accident site] and it looked interesting\u201d and that he went about one hundred yards into the field to investigate the object. Fey denied, however, that he was looking for \u201cstashed\u201d beer and he denied knowing that Russell had spoken with police the previous day. Fey testified that he did not remember telling Russell to dispose of the beer; he stated that he did not believe he had such a conversation with Russell because he \u201cwas more concerned about the injuries there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u00b613 In January, 1999 the State filed an amended information, charging Fey with Count one, negligent homicide, a felony; Counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>two through four, negligent vehicular assault (committed upon Desirae Moss, Mary Christaens, and Aaron Omsberg, respectively), a felony; Count five, conspiracy to obstruct justice, a felony; Count six, driving under the influence of alcohol, a misdemeanor; and Count seven, unlawful transactions with children, also a misdemeanor. In February, 1999 Fey was tried by jury. While instructing the jury, the District Court gave jury instruction number 29:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\">Testimony has been presented that the witness BRIAN RUSSELL may be an accomplice in this case. In this respect, you are to be guided by the following rules of law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">1. An accomplice is someone who knowingly and voluntarily, with common intent with the principal offender, unites in the commission of a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">2. It is a question of fact for the jury to determine from the evidence and from the law as given you by me whether or not in this particular case the witness BRIAN RUSSELL was or was not an accomplice within the meaning of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">3. The testimony of an accomplice ought to be viewed with distrust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">4. A conviction cannot be had on the testimony of an accomplice unless it is corroborated by other evidence which in itself, and without the aid of the testimony of the accomplice, tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense, and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\u00b614 The jury found Fey guilty on all counts. In February, 1999 Fey moved the District Court to enter a Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict and Brief and to find Fey not guilty of the charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice. The District Court denied Fey\u2019s motion. The District Court sentenced Fey to ten years prison on Count one, with four years suspended, and to five years prison on each of Counts two through four, with three years suspended for each count and the sentences to run concurrently and consecutive to Count one. The District Court also sentenced Fey to a suspended sentence of ten years prison on Count five; to sixty days jail on Count six; and to a suspended sentence of six months jail on Count seven. From the District Court\u2019s Order, Fey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b615 Whether the District Court erred in concluding that there was sufficient corroborating evidence in support of testimony that Appellant conspired to obstruct justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b6 16 Fey does not argue that even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Russell\u2019s testimony had sufficient corroboration, there was insufficient evidence to establish the elements of the crime of conspiracy to obstruct justice. We therefore focus on the issue whether there was sufficient corroborating evidence in support of Russell\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b617 Fey argues that Russell\u2019s testimony about his removal of alcohol from Christaens\u2019 car requires corroboration pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA. Fey argues further that at trial, the State offered insufficient evidence to corroborate Russell\u2019s testimony. Fey argues that even when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, his return to the scene of the accident and his \u201clooking around in a plowed field, adjacent to a field of growing grain in which the alcohol had been hidden ... is nothing more than suspicious, even assuming that Fey was informed by Russell that he, Russell, had told law enforcement where the alcohol was hidden and that he, Russell, had incriminated Fey.\u201d Further, Fey argues that \u201c[c]onsidering all of the potential evidence against him already, it is improbable that Fey would have concluded that anything could or would be gained by returning to the scene of the accident in an attempt to locate and dispose of the \u2018stashed\u2019 beer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b618 The State responds that when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to corroborate the testimony of Russell. The State contends that trial testimony established most importantly that Fey returned to the scene of the crash the day <em>after </em>Russell was interviewed by police. The State asserts that a \u201creasonable inference was that Fey had become aware that Russell talked to law enforcement the day before, and he went to the scene to collect the booze and dispose of it permanently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\u00b619 Section 46-16-213, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">Testimony of person legally accountable. A person may not be found guilty of an offense on the testimony of one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense, as defined in 45-2-301, unless the testimony is corroborated by other evidence that in itself and without the aid of the testimony of the one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u00b620 We have previously addressed the guidelines for testing the sufficiency of corroborating evidence. In <em>State v. Kemp </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 383, 597 P.2d 96, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">To be sufficient, corroborating evidence must show more than that a crime was in fact committed or the circumstances of its commission. It must raise more than a suspicion of the defendant\u2019s involvement in, or opportunity to commit, the crime charged. But corroborative evidence need not be sufficient, by itself, to support a defendant\u2019s conviction or even to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case against him. Corroborating evidence may be circumstantial, and can come from the defendant or his witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><em>Kemp, </em>182 Mont. at 387, 597 P.2d at 99 (citations omitted). In <em>State v. Kaczmarek </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 456, 460, 795 P.2d 439, 442 (emphasis added) (citation omitted), we further determined that \u201ccorroborating evidence is not insufficient merely because it is circumstantial, disputed, <em>or possibly consistent with innocent conduct; it is the jury\u2019s duty to resolve such factual </em>questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b621  In the present case, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that there was sufficient corroborating evidence for Russell\u2019s testimony that he removed alcohol from the wrecked car on the instruction of Fey. A jury could reasonably infer from Fey\u2019s having walked into a field to investigate an object \u201cwhich caught his eye as it reflected light from the sun,\u201d that Fey was looking for the alcohol containers that Russell had removed from the car the night of the crash. Fey argues that he did not know that Russell had spoken with police the day before he visited the field; however, the jury was free to determine his credibility on that matter. <em>See, e.g., State v. Clay, </em>1998 MT 244, \u00b6 32, 291 Mont. 147, \u00b6 32, 967 P.2d 370, \u00b6 32 (citation omitted) (concluding \u201c \u2018[i]t is within the province of the finder of fact to weigh the evidence presented and determine the credibility of witnesses\u2019 \u201d). This evidence clearly \u201ctend[ed] to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.\u201d Section 46-16-213, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b622  We hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that there was sufficient corroborating evidence in support of Russell\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b65-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES REGNIER, GRAY and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
