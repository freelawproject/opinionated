Metzger. After extensive discovery, the Plaintiffs moved for discovery sanctions. The District Court granted the motion and sanctioned the Defendants by imposing liability. The Defendants then moved the District Court to reconsider its imposition of sanctions. Following a hearing, the District Court refused to reconsider its order. The Defendants appeal from the District Court\u2019s imposition of sanctions. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\u00b62 While the Appellants raise a number of issues on review, we find the following issue dispositive:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it sanctioned Montana Refining Company and Navajo Refining Company pursuant to Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P, by imposing liability as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">\u00b64 On April 6, 1994, Jill Metzger\u2019s body was found lying next to a Hydotreater Unit (HTU)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in a petroleum refining plant located in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Great Falls, Montana. The Plaintiffs alleged that Metzger died from inhalation of hydrogen sulfide gas after it escaped from the HTU.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b65 On December 8,1994, the Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the parties that designed and constructed the HTU. On February 13, 1997, with leave of the District Court, the Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint, in which they added, among others, Navajo Refining Company, Inc. and Montana Refining Company (MRC) as Defendants. The Plaintiffs alleged that Navajo Refining had control over the planning, construction, and operations of the HTU as well as the supervision and training of personnel operating the HTU. The Plaintiffs alleged that MRC intentionally exposed Metzger to a high degree of danger and death by allowing her to operate the HTU, and that such conduct was not covered by the exclusive remedy provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b66 Following extensive discovery, the Plaintiffs settled their claims with the parties who designed and constructed the HTU. MRC, Navajo Refining, and Navajo Northern, however, remained parties to the suit. Following the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel discovery and for sanctions, on September 15,1998, the District Court imposed liability on MRC and Navajo Refining as a sanction for discovery abuse. The District Court\u2019s decision was based on the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">Defendants misrepresented that the corporations were totally separate and there was no \u201cdiscoverable control\u201d over documents or management between the partnership corporations and parent corporations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">Defendants falsely represented in briefs and at hearing, that all documents pertaining to the accident investigation had been provided. They knowingly withheld and concealed significant information regarding the existence of the first investigation as well as reports and notes about it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">Defendants falsely represented in discovery responses, that Navajo Refining Co. Inc. supplied no specifications in the design or construction of the HTU plant, or that any of its employees met or consulted with MRC, Jacobs/Wolder Engineering as to the design and construction of the HTU; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">Defendants falsely represented that the Laurent investigation documents had been prepared for the purposes of litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">MRC and Navajo Refining moved the District Court to reconsider its imposition of discovery sanctions. Following a hearing conducted on November 9, 1998, the District Court denied MRC and Navajo Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>fining\u2019s motion to reconsider. MRC, Navajo Refining, and Navajo Northern, then partially settled with the Plaintiffs. The parties, however, stipulated that full settlement was contingent on the outcome of an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\n<em>Ownership and Management of MRC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b67 To understand this case, it is important to understand the ownership and management structure of the petroleum refinery plant located in Great Falls, Montana. The plant is owned by MRC, which is a general partnership. The partners are Navajo Northern, Inc., and Black Eagle, Inc., which are both owned by Navajo Refining Company, Inc. Navajo Refining has its headquarters in Artesia, New Mexico, and is wholly owned by Holly, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b68 Navajo Northern paid the salaries of MRC\u2019s managerial employees, and Black Eagle paid the wages of MRC laborers, including Metzger. Other than being partners in MRC and paying MRC\u2019s employees, Navajo Northern and Black Eagle had no other business and no physical existence; they had no desks, no office, and no headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b69 Christopher Celia was the vice-president, general counsel, and secretary of Holly. Celia was also the secretary of each of Holly\u2019s subsidiaries, which included Navajo Refining. Celia testified that he was responsible for all legal matters involving Holly and its 16 subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u00b610 John Knorr was the general manager of MRC, the president of Navajo Northern, and a vice-president of Navajo Refining. Knorr testified that he had the authority to transact business on MRC\u2019s behalf and to hire and fire MRC workers. He also testified that he participated in monthly meetings at MRC in Gre\u00e1t Falls during the construction phase of the HTU. Knorr testified that the reason he attended those meetings was to \u201csee where we were versus our budget and where they were versus their time schedule.\u201d Knorr also testified that the meetings were attended by Lamar Norsworthy, Carl Knapp, and Jack Reid. Norsworthy is the chairman of Holly\u2019s board, and is also Holly\u2019s CEO and Navajo Refining\u2019s CEO. Knapp is an employee of Holly. Reid is the vice-president of Navajo Northern.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">\u00b611 According to Knorr\u2019s testimony, Navajo Northern was designated as the managing partner in MRC. Knorr testified that Navajo Northern delegated its duty to manage MRC to Navajo Refining. Navajo Northern also assigned its right to receive a management fee of $40,000 per month from MRC to Navajo Refining. Knorr testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>part of the management fee that Navajo Refining received was used to pay his salary; and, although Knorr was the president of Navajo Northern and the general manager of MRC, he receives no salary from either. He testified that Navajo Refining paid 100 percent of his salary. According to Knorr\u2019s testimony, Reid also had authority to manage MRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b6 12 Leland Griffin was MRC\u2019s manager at the refinery plant located in Great Falls, Montana. His supervisor was Knorr. Richard Gallagher was MRC\u2019s attorney in Great Falls at the time of Metzger\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\n<em>Investigation of Metzger\u2019s Death</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b613 Griffin testified that on the day of the accident, he called together an investigation team, which included himself, the refinery\u2019s safety director, and the refinery\u2019s process superintendent. Griffin testified that their initial findings indicated that Metzger had died from inhalation of hydrogen sulfide. Griffin testified that he called Gallagher, and that they discussed the investigation and the possibility of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b614 Griffin also testified that on the day of the accident, he called Reid in New Mexico and reported the accident. Reid then contacted Knorr. Knorr testified that he and Reid discussed the accident and decided to send Duke Younger, John Laurent, and Don Prout, all employees of Navajo Refining, from New Mexico to Great Falls to conduct an investigation into the cause of Metzger\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u00b6 15 On the day following the accident, Younger and Laurent arrived in Great Falls, where they met with Griffin and Gallagher. Griffin testified that Laurent took over the investigation. Griffin said that he did not recall any of the investigators taking notes, but stated that they used a tape recorder. He testified, \u201cWhen I initially convened the investigation, we kept a tape-recording of interviews with the people that initially responded. Whether there was any handwritten notes, I don\u2019t recall.\u201d Laurent testified that \u201c[djuring the incident investigation, we gathered some notes; we did some interviews, I remember. Some were penciled and then some were transcribed.\u201d Laurent testified that after he finished his investigation, he concluded that Metzger had committed suicide by inhaling hydrogen sulfide. He also testified that he did not conduct the investigation for the purpose of litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">A. We weren\u2019t doing an investigation for a lawsuit; we weren\u2019t doing an OSHA investigation to try to get money for the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>government. We were interested in determining what killed Jill Metzger-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">Q. Okay. Your to-do list that you gave to Joe, was that for purposes of the investigation and not anything to do with a lawsuit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b616 After Laurent returned from Great Falls to New Mexico, he turned the investigation over to Joseph Ysusi, an employee of Navajo Refining. Ysusi testified that the material Laurent gave to him was <em>\u201ca </em>typewritten report in draft form with some written notes on the report, itself.\u201d Ysusi testified that he reviewed Laurent\u2019s report, the audio tapes, and spoke with both Younger and Laurent. Ysusi testified that after he read Laurent\u2019s report, he felt that Laurent\u2019s investigation was not adequate, and that another investigation was necessary. Ysusi stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">From my personal experience and my training that I\u2019ve had when I worked for the Department of Energy, we were trained to do detailed investigations based on the severity of the incident. And when I reviewed the initial draft investigation report, I just did not feel that it was adequately conducted. i</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acp\">Although Ysusi made no inquiry of the physical findings of Metzger\u2019s body, Ysusi concluded that the cause of Metzger\u2019s death was uncertain. He testified that it was possible that Metzger died from overexposure to hydrogen sulfide, but that he could not validate such a possibility unless he was 100 percent certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u00b617 After the Plaintiffs filed their complaint, they began extensive discovery. The facts specifically relating to discovery will be discussed as appropriate below.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">\u00b618 When we consider whether a district court imposed proper sanctions for discovery abuse, we determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Sullivan v. Sisters of Charity of Providence of Montana </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 71, 77, 885 P.2d 488, 492. We defer to the trial court because it is in the best position to know whether the party in question has disregarded the other\u2019s rights, and is in the best position to determine which sanction is most appropriate. <em>Sullivan, </em>268 Mont. at 77, 885 P.2d at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b619 The purpose of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure is to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\u201d Rule 1, M.R.Civ.P. When litigants and their attorneys abuse the rules they are subject to sanctions. <em>See Sullivan, </em>268 Mont. at 77, 885 P.2d at 492. The district courts should punish those who engage in dilatory discovery actions rather than patiently encourage their cooperation. <em>Morris v. Big Sky Thoroughbred Farms, Inc., </em>1998 MT 229, \u00b6 13, 291 Mont. 32, \u00b6 13, 965 P.2d 890, \u00b6 13 <em>(citing Owen v. F. A. Buttrey Co. </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 274, 278, 627 P.2d 1233, 1235). \u201cWhen litigants use willful delay, evasive response, and disregard court directions as part and parcel of their trial strategy, they must suffer the consequences.\u201d <em>Owen, </em>192 Mont. at 280, 627 P.2d at 1236. If one party does not properly respond to discovery and the other party suffers prejudice, a district court has the authority to impose default judgment as a sanction. <em>Sullivan, </em>268 Mont. at 77, 885 P.2d at 492. In <em>First Bank (N.A.)-Billings v. Heidema </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 373, 376, 711 P.2d 1384, 1386, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">Where it is determined that counsel or a party has acted willfully or in bad faith in failing to comply with rules of discovery or with court orders enforcing the rules or in flagrant disregard of those rules or order, it is within the discretion of the trial court to dismiss the action or to render judgment by default against the party responsible for the default.... Litigants who are willful in halting the discovery process act in opposition to the authority of the court and cause impermissible prejudice to their opponents. It is even more important to note, in this era of crowded dockets, that they also deprive other litigants of an opportunity to use the courts as a serious dispute-settlement mechanism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">(Citing <em>G-K Properties v. Redevelopment Agency, of San Jose </em>(9th Cir.1978), 577 F.2d 645, 647.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">\u00b620 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it sanctioned MRC and Navajo Refining pursuant to Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P., by imposing liability as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">\u00b621 Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">Every pleading, motion, or other paper of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The signature ... constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of the signer\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law..., and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Signing a document pursuant to Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P., essentially certifies that: (1) the attorney made a reasonable inquiry into the facts surrounding the document; (2) the attorney made a reasonable inquiry into the law supporting the document to insure that it is warranted by existing law or a good-faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and (3) the attorney did not interpose the document for any improper purpose, such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay or a needless increase in the cost of litigation. <em>See Hodges v. Cannon </em>(Ark. Ct. App. 1999), 5 S.W.3d 89, 99. In exercising its discretion pursuant to Rule 11, the trial court must avoid the wisdom of hindsight in determining whether a pleading was valid when signed, and any doubt must be resolved in favor of the signer. <em>In re the Adoption of R.D.T. </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 33, 36, 778 P.2d 416, 418 <em>(citing Eastway Constr. Corp. v. New York </em>(2d Cir. 1985), 762 F.2d 243, 254). In <em>Eastway Construction Corp., </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">In framing this standard [for awarding Rule 11 sanctions] we do not intend to stifle the enthusiasm or chill the creativity that is the very lifeblood of the law. Vital changes have been wrought by those members of the bar who have dared to challenge the received wisdom, and a rule that penalized such innovation and industry would run counter to our notions of the common law itself.... But where it is patently clear that a claim has absolutely no chance of success under the existing precedent, and where no reasonable argument can be advance to extend, modify or reverse the law as it stands Rule 11 has been violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">762 <em>F.2d </em>at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\n<em>Misrepresentations Regarding Ownership and Control</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b622 On March 3,1997, Navajo Refining and MRC moved to dismiss several counts of the Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint. In its brief, Navajo Refining contended that the Plaintiffs failed to state a claim for negligence because Navajo Refining owed no duty to Metzger. In its reply brief, Navajo Refining asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">It is clear from Mr. Johnson\u2019s testimony that the only services provided by Navajo to MRC consist of occasioned safety consultation and training pursuant to a consulting agreement with MRC, and some accounting services. There is simply no evidence that Navajo had anything to do with HTU at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">This statement misrepresented the relationship between MRC and Navajo Refining. As will be discussed below, many of Navajo Refining\u2019s employees attended meetings regarding the design and construction of the HTU. Further, as a result of the assignment of Navajo Northern\u2019s management contract, MRC paid Navajo Refining $40,000 per month to manage the Great Falls, Montana, refinery. Navajo Refining\u2019s vice-president, John Knorr, was the general manager of MRC. While Knorr had several different titles in various companies, Knorr was paid exclusively by Navajo Refining, and part of his job was management of MRC. Knorr testified that he had the authority to overrule Griffin\u2019s decisions; that he had the authority to transact business for MRC; and that he had the authority to hire and fire MRC\u2019s workers. These facts contradict the Defendants\u2019 assertion that \u201cthere is simply no evidence that Navajo had anything to do with HTU at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\n<em>Standards and Specifications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u00b623 During discovery the Plaintiffs tried to discover MRC\u2019s and Navajo Refining\u2019s involvement in the design and construction of the HTU. The Plaintiffs sought design and construction documents. They also sought to discover Navajo Refining\u2019s employees\u2019 involvement in the design and construction of the HTU. However, Navajo Refining responded that it had no design and construction documents in its control, and that no Navajo Refining specifications had been used in the construction of the HTU. MRC also responded that it did not have any of Navajo Refining\u2019s design and construction documents. Navajo Refining claimed that none of its employees participated in the design or construction of the HTU.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\u00b624 On April 28,1997, Navajo Refining responded to the Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 1: Please produce any standards, specifications, drawings, or plans sent by Navajo to MRC for the design or construction of the HTU unit located in Great Falls, Montana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">RESPONSE: Navajo will not produce documents as requested in Request No. 1 for the reasons that there are no such documents in their possession, custody, or control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">INTERROGATORY NO. 4: Did Navajo provide any \u201cstandards\u201d or specifications to Wolder or Jacobs for the design, construction, inspection, or testing of the HTU unit in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">RESPONSE: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">At the hearing held on November 9,1998, John Knorr, who signed the discovery responses on behalf of Navajo Refining, along with Gallagher, explained the responses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">Q. So they supplied them to whom, MRC - Navajo gave [the standards] to MRC?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">A. In 1984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">Q. Then in turn, did MRC, to your understanding, provide them to Jacobs Engineering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\">A. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve been modified or not since Navajo gave them to them in 1984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-13\">Q. My question is, did Navajo standards and specs go to Jacobs Engineering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-14\">A. My answer is, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve been modified or not since Navajo gave them to Montana [MRC] eight years before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-15\">Q. Even if they were modified, did the modified set go to Jacobs Engineering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-16\">A. <em>Montana [MRC] supplied their general standards to Jacobs for construction of the unit.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-17\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-18\">\u00b625 On April 28,1997, MRC provided the following response to the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for production.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-19\">REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 2: Please provide a copy of the specifications and standards received by MRC from Navajo which pertain to the design or construction of the HTU unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>RESPONSE: MRC will not produce documents as requested in Request No. 2 for the reason that there are no such documents in their possession, custody, or control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b626 At the hearing held on November 9,1998, Griffin, who signed MRC\u2019s discovery responses, along with Gallagher, explained the responses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">Q. All right, sir. Now we know, don\u2019t we, because we subpoenaed the records of Jacobs Engineering, that in fact you do have Navajo specs, Navajo standards relating to this project?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">A. If you want to define do they display anything specific to the HTU, which is what your question just asked, no, they did not. They provided standard specifications with the Navajo logo on it, and it talks about the general specifications for the project, they supplied them to Montana Refining Company many years prior to this project. And they are general construction standards used throughout the industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">A. And they are not specific to this unit or any other unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">Q. But they were sent to Jacobs Engineering for the building of this project, weren\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">Q. Okay. Well, if we got those standards from Jacobs Engineering-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-12\">A. Then I would assume so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-13\">Q. Thank you. Mr. Griffin, again, I asked you when you\u2019re answering those discovery requests why aren\u2019t you telling us that, yes, we do give Navajo standards and specifications, but really, Mr. Beck, they\u2019re general construction standards, they\u2019re not Navajo specific to this project. Why didn\u2019t you inform us that that was done in your answer to the discovery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-14\">A. I have to say on advice of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">\u00b627 In his affidavit of October 5, 1998, Gallagher admitted that many of Navajo\u2019s \u201cstandard specifications\u201d were in the possession of MRC at the time of Metzger\u2019s death, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-16\">I learned that The Pritchard Corporation had done the process design and that Wolder Engineers &amp; Constructors had done the construction. I inquired about the involvement of Navajo Refining Company in the design and construction of the HTU and I was advised that it had no involvement. Mr. Griffin showed me a set of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u201cstandard specifications\u201d that he maintained in his office, many of which bore the logo of Navajo Refining Company. Mr. Griffin advised me that he understood that those \u201cstandards specifications\u201d had been given to Montana Refining Company when an interest in the Montana Refining Company was acquired by Holly Corporation in 1984 and that the \u201cstandard specifications\u201d were in the refinery when he took over the position of refinery manager in 1989. ... I reiterated my prior advice that a complete investigation of the incident be undertaken due to concern that because of the \u201cstandard specifications\u201d Navajo Refining Company may have exposure to a third party claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b628 At the hearing held on November 9,1998, Griffin testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">Q. All right. What about the standard specifications for design and construction of this unit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">A. Well, Mr. Gallagher had asked, because it was a new unit, kind of the structure, you know, of who was involved in the building of it because of the potential of third-party lawsuits. And I explained to him that Pritchard Corporation did the process design, and Wolder/Jacobs did the mechanical design and construction. <em>That some general construction standards that have Navajo Refining\u2019s logo on them were used in the construction. </em>Kind of gave him a general rundown of who was involved in it, in the building of that unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u00b629 In addition to the construction standards, the Plaintiffs also sought to discover what involvement Navajo\u2019s employees had in the construction and design of the HTU. On April 28,1997, MRC gave the following responses to the Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">INTERROGATORY NO. 4: Please list the names of all Navajo employees that met or consulted with MRC, Jacobs Engineering, or Wolder Engineering employees concerning the design, construction, and testing of the HTU unit and describe the position and job duties of each Navajo employee listed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">ANSWER: None.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">\u00b630 At his deposition held on December 3,1997, Knorr gave the following testimony regarding his involvement in the design and construction of the HTU:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\">Q. I\u2019d like to talk some more about the construction of the HTU plant. Were you personally involved in the relationship between Montana Refining Company and Jacobs and Wolder Engineering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">Q. For instance, did you attend monthly progress meetings on the construction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">Q. Okay. And-And what did you- what was the general purpose of the meetings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">A. The general purpose of the meetings was to see where we were versus our budget and where they were verses their time schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u00b631 On June 24,1998, at his deposition, James Case, a chemical process engineer, who assisted in the design of the HTU, testified that he discussed design options with officers of Navajo Refining. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">Q. Okay. So do I understand you to say that this is a telephone conference between yourself and certain management at Montana refinery and Navajo regarding design options at the hydrotreating unit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-11\">Q. Okay. And was Mr. Knorr and Mr. Reed involved in that conference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-12\">A. According-I don\u2019t recall that directly, but according to what I wrote at the time Jack Reed, who was president of Navajo Refining, and John Knorr, who was president of Montana Refining, as well was Leland Griffin, and Dana Leach from Montana Refining, were involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-13\">Q. Okay. In the second page there\u2019s an indication a Mr. Jack Reed making some-no, let\u2019s see-it\u2019s the second paragraph, first page, right here, he appears to be asking for some design criteria; can you just tell me what he\u2019s basically inquiring about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-14\">A. Yes. He\u2019s asking if an existing cat feed reformer with a high recycle ratio could be used to process, change it from a reformer operation to a cat feed diesel hydrotreating operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-15\">A. He was asking us to look to see if it might be possible for a unit of this nature to be adapted to use for the requirement at Montana Refining.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>\u00b632 At the hearing held on November 9,1998, Knorr testified as follows concerning Navajo\u2019s responses to the Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">Q. Now, you attended meetings up here in Montana relative to the progress of the construction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">Q. Sir, why did-or let me ask you not a why, but there was a discovery request that asked for a list of names of Navajo employees that met with, consulted with MRC, Jacobs Engineering or Wolder people concerning the design, construction, testing of the HTU unit, and describe the position and job titles of each such Navajo employee listed. Are you aware of what the discovery says as to the people that were involved with anything to the building of that plant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">Q. So, sir, when we were told and everybody else in the lawsuit was told that there was no Montana Refining employee that had ever been involved with this new unit, that was not true, was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">A. You said Montana Refining. I\u2019m not sure what you meant to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">Q. I\u2019m sorry, let me start over. It is not true, is it, sir, that Navajo employees did not ever consult up here relative to the construction, design or testing of the HTU unit that was being built?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">A. They did not in their status as Navajo Refining employees. They did as representatives of Navajo Northern, Inc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">\u00b633 Knorr further testified that he and Jack Reid traveled to Great Falls to discuss the construction project, and that another employee of Navajo Refining, Tom Astin, provided general safety training to MRC\u2019s employees, including Metzger.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">\u00b634 Pursuant to Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P, Gallagher was obligated to make a reasonable inquiry before signing the Defendants\u2019 discovery response, including whether MRC had \u201cconstruction standards\u201d it received from Navajo Refining and whether Navajo Refining\u2019s employees were involved in the design and construction of the HTU.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">\u00b635 Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P., further prohibits an attorney from interposing a document \u201cfor any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.\u201d The Appellants contend that the discovery responses signed by Gallagher were proper. They contend that they did not produce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>construction standards because the standards were \u201cgeneral\u201d and not \u201cspecific\u201d to the HTU located at the refinery in Great Falls and because MRC acquired the standards in 1984 and the HTU was not constructed until 1993. The Appellants characterize the meetings attended by Navajo Refining\u2019s employees as \u201cbudget meetings.\u201d They assert that \u201c[attending budget meetings is not \u2018participation\u2019 in the design or construction of a highly technical mechanical unit.\u201d The District Court, however, disagreed. After the hearing held on November 9, 1998, at which Celia, Griffin, and Knorr testified, the District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">Defendants falsely represented in discovery responses thatNavajo Refining Company, Inc., supplied no specifications on the design or construction of the HTU plant, or that any of the employers met or consulted with MRC, Jacob/Wolder Engineering, as to the design and construction of the HTU.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The District Court found that the Defendants had interposed their discovery responses for an improper purpose. It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">[T]he Defendants, in violation of Discovery Rules, have not properly and forthrightly disclosed material facts relevant to this matter, thereby impeding the orderly administration of justice. Rule 11 was violated time and again when facts represented to the Court and Counsel... were not true, were misleading, and not grounded upon reasonable inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The District Court was in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the Defendants\u2019 witnesses and, by weighing the evidence to determine the Defendants\u2019 involvement in the design and construction of the HTU. <em>See Sullivan, </em>268 Mont. at 77, 885 P.2d at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u00b636 The Appellants further contend, in reliance on <em>In re the Adoption of R.D.T. </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 33, 36, 778 P.2d 416, 418, that the District Court\u2019s use of deposition testimony solicited subsequent to the Appellant\u2019s discovery responses invoked the wisdom of hindsight and that doing so results in a Kafkaesque nightmare. The Appellants, however, have misconstrued our holding in <em>Adoption of R.D.T. </em>and Franz Kafka.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">\u00b637 In <em>In re the Adoption of R.D.T., </em>we held that the \u201ccourt must strive to avoid the wisdom of hindsight in determining whether a pleading was valid when signed....\u201d 239 Mont. at 36, 778 P.2d at 418. We did not establish a shield to protect litigants and their attorneys who engage in discovery abuse from evidence of their transgression just because such evidence was discovered after the document in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>question was signed. In this case, the discovery abuse occurred at the time Gallagher signed the Defendants\u2019 discovery responses and reply brief. The subsequent testimony was simply evidence that the Defendants violated Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P., when the documents were signed, not knowledge gained via the wisdom of hindsight.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b638 In Franz Kafka\u2019s short story <em>The Trial, </em>the main character K. was arrested for a crime. <em>See </em>Franz Kafka, <em>The Trial </em>(Willa &amp; Edwin Muirtran., Schocken Books 1984) (1914). K. did not know of what crime he was accused. K.\u2019s struggle, at least in part, was a result of the fact that he could not discover the necessary information to defend his case. During K.\u2019s first interrogation, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">Emboldened by the mere sound of his own cool words in that strange assembly, K. simply snatched the notebook from the Examining Magistrate and held it up with the tips of his fingers, as if it might soil his hands, by one of the middle pages so that the closely written, blotted, yellow-edged leaves hung down on either side. \u201cThese are the Examining Magistrate\u2019s records,\u201d he said, letting it fall on the table again. \u201cYou can continue reading it at your ease, Herr Examining Magistrate, I really don\u2019t fear this ledger of yours <em>though it is a closed book to me </em>...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Franz Kafka, <em>The Trial </em>41 (1914) (emphasis added). K\u2019s attempt to defend himself is, as the Appellants describe it, a \u201cnightmare\u201d because K. is prohibited from accessing information about his case. This is precisely the nightmare discovery rules were developed to alleviate. The purpose of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure is to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\u201d If anyone in this case is guilty of creating a \u201cKafkaesque\u201d nightmare, it was the Defendants, who refused to comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure and refused to disclose information necessary for the proper preparation of the Plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b639  As we held in <em>First Bank (N.A.)-Billings, </em>\u201c[w]here it is determined that counsel or a party has acted willfully or in bad faith in failing to comply with rules of discovery ..., it is within the discretion of the trial court to dismiss the action or to render judgment by default ...\u201d 219 Mont. at 376, 711 P.2d at 1386. Further, the plain language of Rule 11, M.R.Civ.P, provides that a district court \u201cupon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction ...\u201d In this case, the District Court found the Defendants \u201crepeatedly and willfully con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>cealed and misrepresented facts\u201d in the course of discovery. The District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">The [Defendants\u2019] conduct is inexcusable and they must now suffer the consequences. ... Incomplete, evasive, or willful abuse of the discovery process calls for the imposition of sanctions under Montana law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it sanctioned MRC and Navajo Refining pursuant to Rule 11, M.R.Civ.R, by imposing liability as a matter of law. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-13\">. James Case, a chemical process engineer, who assisted in the design of the HTU defined it as follows: \u201cA hydrotreating unit is a unit which under temperature and pressure takes a hydrocarbon stream that contains excessive sulfur levels and heats it up and adds hydrogen with it and passes it in a down flow mode through beds of catalyst, and a reaction is promoted by this catalyst which turns some of those sulfur compounds into hydrogen sulfide.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
