We find that practically the same language as used herein to show probable cause was approved by this court in the cases of Weaver v. State, 139 Tex. Cr. R. 134, 138 S. W. (2d) 1081; Bickerstaff v. State, 139 Tex. Cr. R. 69, 139 S. W. (2d) 110; Peters v. State, 142 Tex. Cr. R. 146, 151 S. W. (2d) 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-19\">It appears by a proper bill of exceptions that the State was allowed to introduce before the jury, and read to them, the affidavit for search warrant, as well as the warrant itself, all over appellant\u2019s objections. We think the trial court committed error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>in allowing these two documents to be read in evidence before the jury. See Rockholt v. State, 126 S. W. (2d) 488; Seay v. State, 134 Tex. Cr. R. 252, 115 S. W. (2d) 419; Hall v. State, 125 S. W. (2d) 292, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\">On account of the above error the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
