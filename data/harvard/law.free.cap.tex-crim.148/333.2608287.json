The many controverted facts in the case relate to these difficulties. It appears that the State was not in position to deny the story of the killing, as told by the appellant himself. While he presented a case of self-defense the circumstances were such as to amply warrant the jury in finding him guilty and returning the verdict which they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">There are no bills of exception in the record and no complaint made in any way against the proceedings. The only question for our consideration is the sufficiency of the evidence which we must conclude against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b358-9\">GRAVES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Appellant complains in his motion because we failed in our original opinion to write on the overruling of his motion for a new trial, which motion was based on what it called newly discovered evidence, which evidence he claims was not made \"known to him until after this cause had been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">We find no motion for a new trial in the transcript, but we do find certain testimony in the statement of facts, taken at a time when it could be inferred that a hearing was had relative to such new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">It seems that after the deceased\u2019s body was brought to the undertaker\u2019s the clothing worn by the deceased at the time of his death came into the possession of the sheriff, and at the time of the trial these clothes were in the possession of the district attorney, and doubtless accessible to appellant\u2019s attorneys. There were many ways that these clothes could become material, but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>seems that appellant\u2019s attorneys did not examine such clothes, nor make any inquiry relative to same until about thirty minutes after the retirement of the jury, at which time they were informed that there were about thirteen 22 calibre unfired cartridges found in the deceased\u2019s pockets. The record does not show any effort upon appellant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 part to avail themselves of such belated information, but does show that whenever they made inquiry relative thereto they were furnished the information. We fail to see any great materiality to such circumstance, and do not think such would have been likely to have changed the result of the trial. The testimony did show that appellant claimed that the deceased had fired one shot at him from a 22 calibre single shot rifle, and that such rifle had one exploded shell in the gun after -deceased was shot by appellant, but the record did also'show that a dead squirrel was found by deceased\u2019s body. Just how the fact that deceased had other unexploded shells in his pockets could add to or detract from appellant\u2019s self-defense testimony we are unable to see.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">It was not claimed herein that the deceased attempted to shoot and was unable to do so on account of lack of ammunition, but appellant, the only eyewitness to the killing, claimed that deceased shot at him once, and that deceased whirled and appellant shot him in the back; that he then again loaded his shot gun and deceased \u201cwas wiggling and I shot him again, and then I stood there for a few minutes and then I left.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The motion will be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
