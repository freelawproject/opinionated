The State.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b529-5\">No. 23174.</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AXG\">Delivered June 27, 1945.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-13\">The opinion states the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-14\"><em>C. O. McMillcm, </em>of Stephenville, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-15\"><em>Sam Cleveland, </em>District Attorney, of Stephenville, and <em>Ernest S. Goens, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, of Austin, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b529-16\">DAVIDSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">This is a case of passing a forged check; the punishment, two years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-18\">The check was described in the indictment, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMT\">\u201cStephenville, Texas, Oct. 1 1944 No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-19\">THE STEPHENVILLE STATE BANK - 88-357</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-20\">Pay to John Hill or order $30 355\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-21\">30 and 00/100 100 Dollars</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-22\">John C. Boucher\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-23\">It is insisted that such check is susceptible of the construction that the two sums of money set forth therein were in conflict, i. e., \u201c30 and 00/100\u201d and \u201c100 Dollars\u201d, and that innuendo averments were necessary to explain which sum was intended. A motion to quash the indictment because of the absence of such innuendo averments were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"A9n\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>If the check called for two different sums, it was uncertain and innuendo averments were necessary. Lamb v. State, 67 Tex. Cr. R. 474, 148 S. W. 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">So the question before us is whether the check as described in the indictment is certain and definite as to the sum payable. If not, appellant\u2019s contention is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We are constrained to agree with the appellant\u2019s contention that the check, as set forth in the indictment, was such as to call for innuendo averments to make intelligible the amount stated therein. See McBride v. State, 48 Tex. Cr. R. 213, 88 S. W. 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The State insists that the check,' itself, will sustain the construction that the check was for $30 and 00/100, only. The evidence may not be looked to to supply defects in an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
