The witness Irene Medrana testified to facts showing that the house was a bawdy house, that is, a place where prostitutes resorted for the purpose of plying their vocation; that she operated the same as the employee of, and under the direction of, the appellant; and that appellant prescribed the amounts charged and to be charged by the prostitutes, a fixed part of which was paid to him. Anita Luna, a prostitute inmate of the house, corroborated the accomplice witness Medrana as to appellant\u2019s connection with, and operation of, the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">The sole question presented for review is whether the witness Lima was an accomplice witness as a matter of law or as a fact issue. Special requested charges, as well as exceptions to the court\u2019s charge, were presented and reserved, raising the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">There was no testimony showing or tending to show that the witness Luna had anything to do with, or was in any manner connected with, the operation or keeping of the house. She appears only to have been an inmate of the same. She was, therefore, not an accomplice because no prosecution would lie against her for keeping the bawdy house. Such is the test to be applied to determine whether or not an inmate of the house is or is not an accomplice, in cases of this character, Stone v. State, 47 Tex. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Cr. R. 575, 85 S. W. 808; Clark v. State, 86 Tex. Cr. R. 585, 218 S. W. 366; Ponder v. State, 110 Tex. Cr.
