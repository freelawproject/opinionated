His contention is that the facts also raised the issue of accidental shooting, which should have been submitted to the jury notwithstanding the fact that no exception or objection was reserved to the court\u2019s charge or special requested charge seeking to have that issue submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-19\">Under the express provision of Arts. 658 and 659, C. C. P. objection to the charge must be presented before it is read to the <em>jury. We are </em>precluded from considering his contention. See Hanvy v. State, 144 Tex. Cr. R. 357, 162 S. W. (2d) 721. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>over, we note that appellant, by his own testimony, claimed that he shot in self-defense.
