Plaintiff, the personal representative of Trooper Fields\u2019 estate, appeals as of right from the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of defendant. MCR 2.116(C)(8). We affirm. This case is being decided without oral argument pursuant to MCR 7.214(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Defendant struck and killed Trooper Fields as he was standing on the shoulder of 1-94, near the driver\u2019s door of a vehicle that he had stopped for a traffic violation. Defendant subsequently pleaded no contest to a charge of negligent homicide, MCL 750.324; MSA 28.556. In this wrongful death action, plaintiff alleged that defendant was negligent in the operation of her motor vehicle and that this negligence caused the decedent\u2019s death. Defendant moved for summary disposition, asserting that plaintiff\u2019s action was barred by the fireman\u2019s rule. The circuit court agreed and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the fireman\u2019s rule precludes plaintiff\u2019s cause of action against defendant for her negligence in causing the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>lYooper Fields. The fireman\u2019s rule bars public safety officials such as fire fighters and police officers from suing private parties for injuries sustained in the course of the public safety officer\u2019s employment. <em>Miller v Inglis, </em>223 Mich App 159, 162-163; 567 NW2d 253 (1997). The fundamental rationale behind the rule is that fire fighters and police officers are hired, specially trained, and paid to confront dangerous situations, and they enter their professions with the certtiin knowledge that their personal safety is at risk while on duty. <em>Kreski v Modern Wholesale Electric Supply Co, </em>429 Mich 347, 371-372; 415 NW2d 178 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The <em>Kreski </em>Court recognized that the fireman\u2019s rule is not a bright-line rule, but instead is subject to \u201cfine tuning ... to best balance the underlying rationales with the interest of allowing recovery when those rationales are not implicated.\u201d 429 Mich 371. <em>Gibbons v Caraway, </em>455 Mich 314; 565 NW2d 663 (1997), represents the Court\u2019s most recent \u201cfine tuning\u201d of the rule. In <em>Gibbons, </em>the plaintiff police officer was directing traffic at the scene of an automobile accident when he was struck by a vehicle that swerved for an undetermined reason. The officer\u2019s suit against the driver, Caraway, alleged that Caraway operated the vehicle in a wanton, reckless, careless, negligent, or grossly negligent manner. In four separate opinions, a majority of the Court concluded that the fireman\u2019s rule should not be applied. In an opinion joined by Chief Justice Mallett and Justice Kelly, Justice Cavanagh concluded that when a police officer responds to an accident scene and is subsequently injured by a third party\u2019s \u201cwanton, reckless, careless, negligent, or grossly negligent\u201d conduct, the fireman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>rule may not serve as a bar to a tort action by the officer against the third party. 455 Mich 326. Because there was a factual dispute concerning the reason why Caraway swerved, Justice Cavanagh declined to apply the fireman\u2019s rule. Justice Boyle, joined by Justice Brickley, concurred, but stated that \u201cthe fireman\u2019s rule does not bar a claim for damages for injuries caused by the subsequent wrongdoing of a third party uninvolved with the original act, where the wrongdoing resulted from wanton, reckless, or grossly negligent behavior.\u201d 455 Mich 329-330. Justice Boyle\u2019s opinion specifically stated, that \u201c[i]n regard to carelessness or ordinary negligence, however, the fireman\u2019s rule bars the claim.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 330. Justice Weaver concurred in the result, but for the reason that application of the fireman\u2019s rule should be limited to premises liability cases. 455 Mich 334. Finally, Justice Riley stated that the fireman\u2019s rule should apply to bar the officer\u2019s tort action because his injury stemmed directly from his police function. 455 Mich 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Reading Justice Cavanagh\u2019s plurality opinion together with Justice Boyle\u2019s concurrence, it is apparent that a majority of our Supreme Court agrees that the fireman\u2019s rule may not apply, and a tort action may be maintained, when a police officer has responded to a call or an offense and is injured as a result of the subsequent wanton, reckless, or grossly negligent conduct of an independent third party unconnected to the situation that brought the officer to the scene. A majority does <em>not </em>agree that where, as in this case, the plaintiff police officer\u2019s representative alleged only carelessness or ordinary negligence on the part of a third party unconnected to the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to which the officer was responding, the bar of the fireman\u2019s rule can be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In this case, plaintiff has never alleged that Trooper Fields\u2019 death was the result of defendant\u2019s wanton, reckless, or grossly negligent operation of her vehicle. Further, the crime of which defendant was convicted in, connection with Trooper Fields\u2019 death \u2014 negligent homicide \u2014 involves only ordinary negligence. <em>People v Clark, </em>171 Mich App 656, 659; 431 NW2d 88 (1988). Under these circumstances, the limited exception to the fireman\u2019s rule recognized by a majority of the justices in <em>Gibbons, supra, </em>does not apply. The trial court therefore properly concluded that plaintiff\u2019s complaint did not state a claim that avoids the fireman\u2019s rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
