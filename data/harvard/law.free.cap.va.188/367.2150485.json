L. Crutchfield and Joseph Hubbard, was convicted on September 10, 1946, in the Hustings Court of the City of Richmond on two charges of armed robbery and sentenced to a total of twenty-five years imprisonment. He has filed a petition in this court for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>and in response to a rule issued by the court upon the Superintendent of the Penitentiary to show cause why the writ should not issue, the respondent has filed his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">\u201cThe petition and exhibits attached thereto show that the petitioner, age 20, Crutchfield, age 18, and Hubbard, age 19, were each indicted on two indictments charging them respectively with armed robbery of (1) T. C. Saunders and (2) Wesley Walden. These indictments were returned on September 3, 1946. The mother of the petitioner employed an attorney to represent the petitioner. It is alleged that this attorney was subsequently employed by the other two defendants, Crutchfield and Hubbard, to represent them also. The three defendants entered pleas of \u2018Not Guilty\u2019, trial by jury was waived, and at their trial on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>September 10, 1946, before the court without a jury they were found guilty and each defendant was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment on the first charge and ten years imprisonment on the second charge. The petition states that all three defendants testified, and that the petitioner testified that \u2018he had no part in the robberies\u2019, but that he was convicted upon the perjury of Hubbard and Crutch-field.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u201cThe petitioner seeks his release on <em>habeas corpus </em>from these convictions on the grounds that his attorney was incompetent, inexperienced, rushed headlong into the trial without preparation or conference with the petitioner, and that by representing the other two defendants he represented interests conflicting with those of the petitioner. It is alleged that the petitioner\u2019s trial was \u2018shocking\u2019 and a \u2018sham\u2019, and that the court should have intervened on behalf of the petitioner. * * * the petitioner # # # has filed an amendment to his petition alleging his ignorance of court proceedings and his illiteracy, thus purporting to excuse himself from calling to the attention of the court the alleged conflicting interests being represented by his counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The only allegation of the petition with respect to the incompetency of his counsel is that said counsel \u201cpossessed none of the cardinal requisites above held to be essential by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461. The petitioner alleges that these essential requisites are that said counsel shall be \u201ccompetent and able\u201d and \u201cexperienced in the conducting of a criminal case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The petition, however, does not allege any facts which would support the opinion or conclusion therein expressed that the attorney did not possess these requisites. It does not undertake to set forth the length of time petitioner\u2019s counsel had been engaged in the practice of the law, or the number of criminal cases he had been engaged in the trial of, or any other fact which would justify a finding that he was not competent. It is elementary that a petition of this nature must allege facts and that mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>conclusions or opinions of the pleader will not suffice to make out a case. 39 C. J. S. 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">But in any event the trial court was not called upon to inquire into the ability of counsel chosen and employed by the petitioner. In fact, such action on the part of the court, so far as the record shows, would have been an unwarranted interference with petitioner\u2019s right to be represented- by counsel of his own choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The petitioner asserts, in effect, that he has not been afforded capable and adequate representation by competent counsel, and that this amounts to a denial of due process of law. This is a Federal question and the views of the Supreme Court of the United States with respect thereto are controlling. There has been no express decision by that court of the question in a prosecution where the accused selected his own counsel, but the denial of a writ of <em>certiorari </em>(324 U. S. 874, 65 S. Ct. 1013, 89 L. Ed. 1427) in the case of <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(CCA 5th Circuit), 145 F. (2d) 101, is significant. In that case, although the District Court found that Andrews\u2019 counsel, on account of then existing physical condition and emotional upset, \u201cwas not able to afford the defendant any very capable representation,\u201d it, nevertheless, concluded that this did not amount to a denial of due process. That court was unable to find that such representation amounted to a nullity, but held that, Andrews\u2019 counsel having been chosen by him and permitted to represent him, the constitutional mandate was satisfied. In affirming the denial of a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u201cWe approve. In the absence of proof of such mental incapacity as flows from an unsound mind, on the part of defendant or his chosen counsel, in such circumstances, this Court cannot say that due process of law was denied defendant, or that the State Court lost jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\u201cThe State Court has no right under the Constitution, to deny a defendant the right to counsel of his own choosing. Such Court could not be put in error for proceeding to try a defendant when he was represented by such counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>which is to say that that Court should not be put in error for doing that which it had no right to refuse to do, # * *\u00bb (145 F (2d) 102).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Petitioner further claims that his counsel proceeded with the trial of his case without consulting with him, and that this constituted denial of due process. Such action, however, would, at most, merely indicate that his counsel did not exercise a high degree of professional diligence. If, by refraining from consulting with his client, counsel in a felony case could render the trial a nullity, the effect would be to impose upon the trial court the duty to inquire into and investigate the extent of the preparation of counsel chosen by defendants in the trial of every such case. No duty rests upon the court to explore this matter. No doubt there are acts of omission and commission by counsel in the conduct of many trials, both civil and criminal, which operate to the detriment of the client, but that is a risk which every litigant must take. There is nothing in the petition in this case which shows that the petitioner\u2019s case was conducted by his counsel in such a manner as to render the trial a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The petitioner also alleges that his counsel, after being retained, accepted employment from the two co-defendants, Crutchfield and Hubbard. It is further averred that petitioner testified that he had no part in the robberies, whereas Crutchfield and Hubbard testified at the trial that petitioner initiated the robberies, and, at the point of a gun, compelled them to assist him in the perpetration of the crimes. The charge is that this representation of the co-defendants constituted such misconduct on the part of his attorney as to deprive petitioner of effective representation at his trial, since his interests were in conflict with those of the co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The petition, however, alleges no specific fact to show that he suffered any prejudice as a result of such representation. It appears from the record and exhibits that, in the indictment for the robbery of Wesley Walden, seven witnesses were sworn and sent by the court to the grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>jury to give evidence. Among these was the victim of the robbery. And it likewise appears that eight witnesses, including the victim, were sent to the grand jury in considering the indictment of T. C. Saunders. Thus the grand jury found sufficient evidence to indict the petitioner without the testimony of the co-defendants. Presumably these same witnesses were used at the trial of the case, although the record contains no information as to what transpired at that time other than the order of the court finding the three defendants guilty and fixing their punishment. It is quite obvious that the court did not place any credence in the testimony of petitioner\u2019s co-defendants that he forced them to participate in the crimes, because the same punishment was meted out to each of the three. Petitioner\u2019s exhibit with his record shows that after he was sentenced he admitted in a statement to an investigating officer of the State Department, of Corrections that he and his two co-defendants were drinking together when the robbery was initiated. He claimed to the officer that he \u201chad no part of the two robberies.\u201d But another one of petitioner\u2019s exhibits contains statements made to the officer by his co-defendants to the effect that the three were still together until \u201csome other boys came along and told us the law was looking for three boys wearing white shirts. About fifteen minutes later we were arrested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">This trial which resulted in petitioner\u2019s conviction was had before the able and experienced judge of the Hustings Court without a jury, and we do not think it can be presumed or inferred that he was misled as to the merits of the petitioner\u2019s case by any misconduct on the part of his counsel. If said counsel showed any partiality toward any one of the three defendants, it is just as likely that he favored the petitioner over the other two. In any event, the petition discloses no facts from which it can be said that petitioner was prejudiced by the plural representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Petitioner relies strongly upon <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U. S. 60, 62 S. Ct. 457, 86 L. Ed. 680. In that case the record of the trial of Glasser and two co-defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>in which they were found guilty of conspiracy was reviewed, not in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding, but by <em>certiorari. </em>Glasser had employed counsel to defend him, but the trial court appointed and directed Glasser\u2019s counsel to represent also a co-defendant, Kretske, although Glasser\u2019s counsel pointed out to the court that evidence would be offered by the prosecution which would be admissible as to Kretske but would not be admissible as to Glasser. The Supreme Court held that Glasser was entitled to the effective assistance of counsel of his own choosing, without such counsel being required to represent a co-defendant which resulted in the impairment of his ability to properly represent Glasser. It was further held that the record affirmatively showed that Glasser was materially prejudiced thereby.. The action of the District Court was held erroneous and Glasser\u2019s conviction was reversed. The court, however, refused to reverse the judgment of conviction of Kretske for the reason that the record did not show that Kretske was prejudiced by reason of the fact that he was represented by the same counsel as Glasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">We hold, therefore, that the mere fact that counsel employed and chosen by petitioner also was retained by and represented co-defendants with conflicting interests does not compel a conclusion that the petitioner was prejudiced thereby, and certainly not to such an extent as to oust the jurisdiction of the trial court and render the proceeding therein a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The petition alleges that the petitioner was convicted upon the perjured testimony of the other co-defendants Crutchfield and Hubbard. The petitioner, however, testified at the trial. The trial judge passed upon the credibility of these three witnesses. The necessary effect of the perjury allegation is that the trial court believed the testimony of the co-defendants and rejected that of the petitioner. No after-discovered evidence is claimed to be available to show that the co-defendants testified falsely. Furthermore, there was the testimony of the victims of the robberies. Merely raising an issue of the credibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>petitioner and the opposing witnesses does not justify issuance of a writ of <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">But even if the conviction could be said to have been founded on the false testimony of the co-defendants, this alone is insufficient to render void the judgment of conviction. Such a result could follow only if it appeared that the State prosecuting officers knowingly resorted to perjured testimony to bring about petitioner\u2019s conviction. <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Holohan, </em>294 U. S. 103, 55 S. Ct. 340, 79 L. Ed. 791, 98 A. L. R. 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The judgment complained of is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
