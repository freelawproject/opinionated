We affirm in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals that held that MCL 211.34d(1)(b)(viii) is unconstitutional because it is inconsistent with the meaning of \u201cadditions\u201d as used in Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 3 and that public-service improve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ments consisting of public infrastructure located on utility easements or land that ultimately becomes public do not constitute \u201cadditions\u201d to property within the meaning of that constitutional provision. However, we vacate in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals that incorrectly defined the term \u201cambiguous\u201d and mistakenly concluded that taxing property on the basis of value added from available public services and also taxing utility lines as personal property of the utility companies results in \u201cdouble taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Plaintiffs Toll Northville Ltd and Biltmore Wineman LLC are engaged in developing real property. During the tax years 2001 and 2002, plaintiffs invested millions of dollars to install infrastructure consisting of physical improvements, such as a primary access road, streetlights, sewer service, water service, electrical service, natural gas service, telephone service, and sidewalks for condominium and single-family residential lots located in Northville Township. This infrastructure development is required before a final plat for a subdivision can be approved. Relying on MCL 211.34d(1)(b)(viii), defendant Northville Township increased plaintiffs\u2019 property-tax assessments for the tax years 2001 and 2002 on the basis of the enhanced value resulting from the public-service improvements that were made to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Plaintiffs challenged their assessments before the Michigan Tax Tribunal, claiming that the assessment increases violated Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 3. The Michigan Tax Tribunal stayed its proceedings so that this declaratory action regarding the constitutionality of the statute could proceed in circuit court. The circuit court held that MCL 211.34d(1)(b)(viii) is unconstitutional be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>cause it taxes improvements of real property beyond the meaning of \u201cadditions\u201d when Proposal A was passed. The circuit court determined that plaintiffs could not be taxed on the basis of the public-service improvements because the improvements were not attached to the separate lots and were either dedicated to the municipality or given to public utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"AVL\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, concluding that the term \u201cadditions\u201d as used in Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 3 refers to improvements that become part of the real property as structures or fixtures, but not to public-service improvements. <em>Toll Northville, Ltd v Northville Twp, </em>272 Mich App 352; 726 NW2d 57 (2006). The Court of Appeals concluded that, although at the time of the installation of the public-service improvements, plaintiffs, as developers, owned the parcel of land \u201con which the public service improvements are installed,\u201d plaintiffs did not owe property tax on the improvements because title to these improvements would ultimately vest in the municipality or a utility company. <em>Id. </em>at 375.

STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A7q\">A trial court\u2019s ruling in a declaratory action is reviewed de novo. <em>Theatre Control Corp v Detroit, </em>365 Mich 432, 436; 113 NW2d 783 (1962). Matters of constitutional and statutory interpretation and questions concerning the constitutionality of a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>provision are also reviewed de novo. <em>Goldstone v Bloomfield Twp Pub Library, </em>479 Mich 554, 558; 737 NW2d 476 (2007); <em>Phillips v Mirac, Inc, </em>470 Mich 415, 422; 685 NW2d 174 (2004); <em>Halloran v Bhan, </em>470 Mich 572, 576; 683 NW2d 129 (2004). When interpreting constitutional provisions, our primary objective \u201c \u2018is to realize the intent of the people by whom and for whom the constitution was ratified.\u2019 \u201d <em>Studier v Michigan Pub School Employees\u2019 Retirement Bd, </em>472 Mich 642, 652; 698 NW2d 350 (2005), quoting <em>Wayne Co v Hathcock, </em>471 Mich 445, 468; 684 NW2d 765 (2004). In realizing this intent, we apply the plain meaning of terms used in the constitution unless technical legal terms were employed. <em>Phillips, supra </em>at 422.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">\u201c[I]f a constitutional phrase is a technical legal term or a phrase of art in the law, the phrase will be given the meaning that those sophisticated in the law understood at the time of enactment unless it is clear from the constitutional language that some other meaning was intended.\u201d <em>[WPW Acquisition Co v City of Troy, </em>466 Mich 117, 123; 643 NW2d 564 (2002), quoting <em>Michigan Coalition of State Employee Unions v Civil Service Comm, </em>465 Mich 212, 223; 634 NW2d 692 (2001).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Statutes are presumed constitutional unless the unconstitutionality is clearly apparent. <em>McDougall v Schanz, </em>461 Mich 15, 24; 597 NW2d 148 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">This appeal addresses legislation enacted after Michigan voters adopted Proposal A in 1994, which amended article 9, \u00a7 3 of the Michigan Constitution. As amended by Proposal A, Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 3 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">The legislature shall provide for the uniform general ad valorem taxation of real and tangible personal property not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>exempt by law except for taxes levied for school operating purposes. The legislature shall provide for the determination of true cash value of such property; the proportion of true cash value at which such property shall be uniformly assessed, which shall not, after January 1, 1966, exceed 50 percent; and for a system of equalization of assessments. <em>For taxes levied in 1995 and each year thereafter, the legislature shall provide that the taxable value of each parcel of property adjusted for additions and losses, shall not increase each year by more than the increase in the immediately preceding year in the general price level, as defined in section 33 of this article, or 5 percent, whichever is less until ownership of the parcel of property is transferred. </em>When ownership of the parcel of property is transferred as defined by law, the parcel shall be assessed at the applicable proportion of current true cash value. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The purpose of Proposal A was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">to generally limit increases in property taxes on a parcel of property, as long as it remains owned by the same party, by capping the amount that the \u201ctaxable value\u201d of the property may increase each year, even if the \u201ctrue cash value,\u201d that is, the actual market value, of the property rises at a greater rate. However, a qualification is made to allow adjustments for \u201cadditions.\u201d <em>[WPW Acquisition Co, supra </em>at 121-122.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Thus, as amended, the constitution caps general property tax increases during the course of a property owner\u2019s ownership, but permits additional taxation based on increases in value arising from \u201cadditions\u201d in the year they are added to the land.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">When Proposal A was adopted ... , the General Property Tax Act defined \u201cadditions\u201d to mean \u201call increases in value caused by new construction or a physical addition of equipment or furnishings, and the value of property that was exempt from taxes or not included on the assessment unit\u2019s immediately preceding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>year\u2019s assessment role.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 122, quoting the text of MCL 211.34d(1)(a) in effect at the time of Proposal A\u2019s adoption.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">After Proposal A was adopted, the Legislature enacted several amendments of MCL 211.34d. As it now stands, MCL 211.34d provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">(1) As used in this section or section 27a, or section 3 or 31 of article IX of the state constitution of 1963:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">(a) For taxes levied before 1995, \u201cadditions\u201d means all increases in value caused by new construction or a physical addition of equipment or furnishings, and the value of property that was exempt from taxes or not included on the assessment unit\u2019s immediately preceding year\u2019s assessment roll.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">(b) For taxes levied after 1994, \u201cadditions\u201d means, except as provided in subdivision (c), all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\"><em>(viii) </em>Public services. As used in this subparagraph, \u201cpublic services\u201d means water service, sewer service, a primary access road, natural gas service, electrical service, telephone service, sidewalks, or street lighting. For purposes of determining the taxable value of real property under section 27a, the value of public services is the amount of increase in true cash value of the property attributable to the available public services multiplied by 0.50 and shall be added in the calendar year following the calendar year when those public services are initially available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The issue is the constitutionality of MCL 211.34d(l)(b)(ciii), which, as written, defines \u201cpublic services\u201d as \u201cadditions\u201d and, therefore, would allow for the taxation of the value added from the installation of public-service improvements, which are \u201cwater service, sewer service, a primary access road, natural gas service, electrical service, telephone service, sidewalks, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>street lighting.\u201d We agree with the analysis and the decision of the Court of Appeals, which declared MCL 211.34d(1)(b)(viii) unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the mere installation of public-service improvements on public property or on utility easements does not constitute a taxable \u201caddition\u201d \u2014 as that term was understood when the public adopted Proposal A \u2014 in this instance, involving infrastructure improvements made to land destined to become a residential subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the definition of \u201cadditions\u201d provided by the enabling legislation for the Headlee Amendment is not pertinent to this case. The Headlee Amendment, adopted in 1978, limited local property taxation by controlling changes in the tax base, i.e., it generally placed an inflation-rate cap on the increase of taxes by the local taxing authorities with regard to all property combined within a unit of local government and without regard to any specific parcel of property, but it excluded the value of new construction and improvements. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 31. The enabling legislation for the Headlee Amendment defined \u201c[n]ew construction and improvements\u201d as \u201cadditions less losses.\u201d MCL 211.34d(1)(e), as added by 1978 PA 532. \u201cAdditions\u201d was defined as \u201call increases in value caused by new construction, improvements caused by new construction or a physical addition of equipment or furnishings . .. .\u201d MCL 211.34d(1)(a), as added by 1978 PA 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">However, this does not reflect the meaning the term \u201cadditions\u201d had when Proposal A was later adopted in 1994. In 1993, the Legislature enacted 1993 PA 145, which amended the definition of \u201cadditions\u201d to include \u201call increases in value caused by new construction or a physical addition of equipment or furnishings,\u201d thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>discarding any reference to \u201cimprovements caused by new construction.\u201d MCL 211.34d(l)(a), as amended by 1993 PA 145. Thus, for purposes of resolving the instant case, this later definition superseded the 1978 definition. The Court of Appeals properly recognized that the 1993 definition reflected the meaning of the term \u201cadditions\u201d as understood by those sophisticated in the law at the time Proposal A was adopted and correctly based its analysis on this later definition.</p>\n<p id=\"AqB\">Moreover, because the objectives of the Headlee Amendment and Proposal A are different, the definition of \u201cadditions\u201d under the Headlee Amendment is of limited relevance in determining the meaning of \u201cadditions\u201d under Proposal A. The Headlee Amendment generally placed an inflation-rate cap on tax increases for all property located within a local government unit, without regard to any specific parcel, while Proposal A placed an inflation-rate cap on tax increases for specific parcels. Thus, in the context of the Headlee Amendment, public-service improvements necessarily are physically located on the property to be taxed. By contrast, in the context of Proposal A, public-service improvements are not physically located on the residential property to be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"ATR\">Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals that MCL 211.34d(l)(b)(ciii) is unconstitutional because it is inconsistent with the meaning of the term \u201cadditions\u201d as used in Proposal A and that public-service improvements do not constitute \u201cadditions\u201d to property within the meaning of Proposal A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Because public-service improvements located on public easements or land that ultimately becomes public do not constitute \u201cadditions,\u201d as that term was understood when Proposal A was enacted, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals that MCL 211.34d(1)(b)(ciii) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Affirmed in part and vacated in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-6\">Taylor, C.J., and Kelly, Corrigan, Young, and MARKMAN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AX55\"> We directed the parties to address \u201cthe constitutionality of MCL 211.34d(l)(b)(viii) and whether \u2018public service\u2019 improvements (such as water service, sewer service, utility service) are \u2018additions\u2019 to the property within the meaning of Proposal A, Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 3, which allows for increased taxation of the property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A3Y\"> However, we vacate two parts of the Court of Appeals judgment that we believe are in error. First, we believe that the Court significantly erred when it defined \u201cambiguous.\u201d <em>Toll Northville, supra </em>at 368. A term is ambiguous \u201cwhen it is <em>equally </em>susceptible to more than a single meaning,\u201d <em>Lansing Mayor v Pub Service Comm,, </em>470 Mich 154, 166; 680 NW2d 840 (2004), not when reasonable minds can disagree regarding its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>meaning. Second, we believe that the Court mistakenly concluded that taxing property on the basis of the value added by the availability of public services and also taxing utility lines as personal property of the utility companies results in \u201cdouble taxation.\u201d <em>Toll Northville, supra </em>at 371-372. To the contrary, the value of physical lines, i.e., wires, pipes, etc., as tangible personal property is distinguishable from the market value added by the availability of utility services. The distinction is important because value added from access to services is taxable to the extent that such services increase market value. Although installation of a public utility line may not be taxed as an addition in a case such as this, the value of such services will be incorporated into the value of each individual home at the time it is built or sold.

I agree with this Court\u2019s conclusion that MCL 211.34d(1)(b)(viii) is unconstitutional and that public-service improvements are not \u201cadditions\u201d to the property within the meaning of that term in Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 3, as amended by Proposal A. I write to address this Court\u2019s comments on the method for determining ambiguity.
