We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">Within a few hours of fighting a fire on July 28,1983, in the course of his employment as a firefighter for the City of Manchester, the defendant, Robert Doucet, experienced blurred vision, numbness of his hands and one of his arms, headaches, dizziness and fatigue. Three days later, he suffered a stroke. Mr. Doucet filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, which the City of Manchester denied on January 1, 1984, as not causally related to the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Mr. Doucet appealed to the New Hampshire Department of Labor, and a hearing was held on March 1,1984. The department found that Mr. Doucet\u2019s stroke had arisen out of and in the course of his employment as a firefighter for the plaintiff City of Manchester. Mr. Doucet was awarded temporary total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">On June 20,1984, the City of Manchester appealed the decision of the department of labor to the superior court and requested a trial <em>de novo </em>on the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s stroke was causally related to his employment. The superior court affirmed the department of labor\u2019s decision in favor of Mr. Doucet.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">On March 8, 1989, Mr. Doucet filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to RSA 281:37-a, which provides that \u201c[i]n any dispute over the amount of [workers\u2019 compensation] benefits payable under this chapter which is appealed to the superior or supreme courts, the employee, if he prevails, shall be entitled to reasonable counsel fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>as approved by the Court....\u201d Mr. Doucet requested an attorney\u2019s fee award equal to one-third of the total benefits paid to date plus an amount equal to one-third of weekly future benefits. The request was based on a contingency fee agreement Mr. Doucet executed with his attorney on July 16, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">A hearing was held in the superior court on June 14,1989, to determine an appropriate attorney\u2019s fee. Mr. Doucet\u2019s attorney testified that: he was experienced in the area of workers\u2019 compensation; he was entirely successful before both the labor department and the superior court; the degree of difficulty of the case was enhanced because Mr. Doucet had limited recall and ability to testify due to his stroke; extensive benefits had already been received by Mr. Doucet and would continue weekly into the future; and it was customary in the area to charge fees on a contingent basis. Mr. Doucet\u2019s counsel put into evidence the contingency fee agreement as support for his position that the fees requested were reasonable. Because the case was accepted on a contingency fee basis, counsel did not keep time records and, therefore, none were produced at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The superior court denied the motion for attorney\u2019s fees on June 20,1989. The court concluded that \u201c[cjounsel\u2019s contingent fees as set out in defendant\u2019s motion are deemed to be unreasonable. [Defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s] testimony that he keeps no time records, but bills by way of his \u2018best estimate \u2014 on my ability to reconstruct\u2019 presented the Court with no meaningful basis on which to determine what, if any, reasonable fees could be awarded in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that whether a request for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to RSA 281:37-a is reasonable is determined by a number of factors which the superior court failed to address. The City of Manchester, however, argues that Mr. Doucet failed to provide the court with a basis upon which to calculate a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee award, because his attorney did not keep time records of the legal services he provided. The City contends that the superior court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorney\u2019s fees, because the principal evidence presented by Mr. Doucet in support of his request for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, the contingency fee agreement, was wholly inadequate. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">This court will not disturb the trial court\u2019s determination of a reasonable fee unless it is lacking in evidentiary support or is tainted by error of law. <em>Cheshire Toyota/Volvo, Inc. v. O\u2019Sullivan, </em>132 N.H. 168, 171, 562 A.2d 788, 790 (1989); <em>Burnham v. Downing, </em>125 N.H. 293, 296, 480 A.2d 128, 130 (1984). For the reasons which follow, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>hold that the superior court erred in denying Mr. Doucet\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees, and we reverse and remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\">It is clear from the language of RSA 281:37-a that Mr. Doucet is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. He prevailed before both the labor department and the superior court after hearings on the merits. RSA 281:37-a states that \u201cthe employee, if he prevails, <em>shall </em>be entitled to reasonable counsel fees.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Pursuant to general rules of statutory construction, the word \u201cshall\u201d is a command, which requires mandatory enforcement. <em>In re Robyn W., </em>124 N.H. 377, 379, 469 A.2d 1351, 1352 (1983); <em>New Hampshire-Vermont Health Service v. Commissioner of Insurance, </em>122 N.H. 268, 272, 444 A.2d 508, 510 (1982). The superior court erred as a matter of law, therefore, in denying Mr. Doucet any attorney\u2019s fees as provided for by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">The criteria for determining an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to RSA 281:37-a are set forth in <em>Couture v. Mammoth Groceries, Inc., </em>117 N.H. 294, 371 A.2d 1184 (1977). \u201cRelevant factors in the determination of reasonable fees include the amount involved, the nature, novelty, and difficulty of the litigation, the attorney\u2019s standing and the skill employed, the time devoted, the customary fees in the area, the extent to which the attorney prevailed, and the benefit thereby bestowed on his clients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296, 371 A.2d at 1186; <em>see also </em>Disciplinary Rule 2-106(b) of the Code OF Professional Responsibility (presently Rule 1.5(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct); <em>Corson v. Brown Products, Inc., </em>120 N.H. 665, 667, 421 A.2d 1005, 1007 (1980); <em>Seppala &amp; Aho Construction Company v. Elton, </em>119 N.H. 634, 636, 406 A.2d 460, 462 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"> This court has established that contingent fee agreements in workers\u2019 compensation cases are not <em>per se </em>unreasonable. <em>Couture, supra </em>at 296, 371 A.2d at 1186. While a contingent fee arrangement is not to be \u201crubber stamped,\u201d it is one of a number of factors for a court to consider in determining a reasonable fee. <em>Cheshire Toyota/Volvo, </em>132 N.H. at 171, 562 A.2d at 790. The City of Manchester argues that the proper method for determining a reasonable fee in workers\u2019 compensation cases is to multiply the number of hours reasonably spent on litigation by a reasonable hourly rate. This argument, apparently accepted by the trial court, ignores case precedent cited above. In these cases the <em>Couture </em>elements must all be considered, and the federal cases plaintiff relies on are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Mr. Doucet\u2019s attorney presented some evidence on each of the <em>Couture </em>elements at the attorney\u2019s fee hearing on June 14, 1989. Although contemporaneous time records could not be provided because none were kept, that alone does not as a matter of law reduce allowable attorney\u2019s fees to zero. Testimony at the hearing indicated that a \u201cfair amount of time\u201d had been spent by the attorney preparing Mr. Doucet\u2019s expert witness and taking his deposition, that \u201cseveral hours\u201d were spent preparing to cross-examine the defendant\u2019s expert witness, that Mr. Doucet\u2019s attorney was up \u201creasonably late\u201d the night before the trial, that two hearings were held in the matter, and that the medical issue involved in the case was complex. Although the attorney stated that he could reconstruct the time spent with more specificity, such information was never presented to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Despite the absence of time records, there was sufficient evidence before the trial judge upon which to calculate a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee under RSA 281:37-a. While he was not obligated to award attorney\u2019s fees in the amount provided by the contingent fee agreement, we hold that the trial judge erred as a matter of law in concluding that no attorney\u2019s fees were proven under the criteria set forth in <em>Couture,, </em>and remand for a hearing and reconsideration of the issue of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b712-7\">HORTON, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
