Daigle, appeals the Master\u2019s <em>(Bean, </em>J. (Ret.)) recommendation to deny his motion for sanctions against the defendant, the City of Portsmouth (the City), which was approved by the Superior Court <em>(McHugh, </em>J.). For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">This action began in June 1983, when Daigle filed a writ against the City alleging that one of its police officers had attacked and beaten him in August 1981. Daigle later commenced an action against Portsmouth Police Officer Al Pace personally, naming him as the attacker. The trial of <em>Daigle v. City of Portsmouth, </em>Rockingham Superior Court No. C-814-83, was held in 1984 and resulted in an award of $500,000 to Daigle. The award was specifically premised on the jury\u2019s finding that Pace had committed the assault. The 1985 jury trial of <em>Daigle v. Pace, </em>Rockingham Superior Court No. C-969-84, however, resulted in a verdict for Pace, based on a finding that he had not assaulted Daigle. These inconsistent verdicts were discussed, and Daigle\u2019s collateral estoppel claim was dismissed, in <em>Daigle v. City of Portsmouth, </em>129 N.H. 561, 569-75, 534 A.2d 689, 693-96 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The case before us arises out of Daigle\u2019s motion for sanctions, based on his claim that the City and its attorneys, Paul Cox, Stephen Gaige, and Robert Sullivan, violated discovery requests by intentionally, wantonly, and oppressively withholding four documents, and information relating to those documents, during the discovery stage of the 1984 <em>Daigle v. City of Portsmouth </em>trial. These documents, the \u201cHersey\u201d note, and the \u201cMoore,\u201d \u201cSargent,\u201d and \u201cLightizer\u201d statements, are described in <em>Daigle v. City of Portsmouth, </em>131 N.H. 319, 321-25, 553 A.2d 291, 292-95 (1988). After Daigle\u2019s consolidated sanction motion against the City was denied by the Superior Court <em>(Nadeau, </em>J.) in December 1987, he appealed to this court, arguing that the City should be sanctioned for its alleged intentional withholding of discoverable facts. Based on the allegations Daigle presented to us then, we stated, \u201cThe facts <em>as they are now developed </em>display a flagrant disregard of discovery requests and orders by the City.\u201d <em>Daigle v. City of Portsmouth, </em>131 N.H. at 329, 553 A.2d at 297 (emphasis added). Because on appeal we lack the fact-finding ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>of a trial court needed to determine whether sanctions are appropriate, we remanded the case for a full evidentiary hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">After six days of trial, the master denied Daigle\u2019s request for sanctions, finding that \u201c[t]he plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence of a <em>knowing concealment of new facts </em>or actual knowledge of prior false answers.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The master found that the City\u2019s attorneys turned over the four documents to the trial court immediately after learning of their existence, and therefore did not knowingly conceal them. The master similarly found that Mortimer, director of the internal police investigation of Daigle\u2019s alleged beating, did not knowingly conceal new facts. While Mortimer knew the documents existed before they were turned over to the trial court by the City\u2019s attorneys, the master found that the documents contain rumors, speculations, and hearsay statements concerning Pace\u2019s possible involvement in Daigle\u2019s assault, and not facts. As such, the master ruled that Mortimer had no duty to produce them for Daigle\u2019s review: \u201cThe city was not required to disclose unsubstantiated rumor.\u201d It is from these findings that Daigle now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\"> We cannot overturn the master\u2019s findings in this case unless Daigle persuades us that no reasonable person could have made the same findings on the basis of the evidence before the master. <em>See Bourdon\u2019s Case, </em>132 N.H. 365, 370, 565 A.2d 1052, 1055 (1989). \u201cThis review standard requires that any \u2018conflicts as might be found in the testimony, questions about the credibility of witnesses, and the weight to be given to testimony are for the [master] to resolve.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Since Daigle has failed to meet this burden, we affirm the master\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Daigle\u2019s motion for sanctions is based on a claim that the City failed to properly amend answers to discovery requests and thus knowingly concealed discoverable facts. <em>See </em>SUPER. Ct. R. 35(e)(2). The master ruled that it was Daigle\u2019s burden at trial to prove a knowing concealment by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d and Daigle did not object to the imposition of this burden of proof. The master found that Daigle \u201cfailed to produce <em>any </em>evidence of a knowing concealment\u201d (emphasis added), and therefore denied his motion. Upon a thorough examination of the record, we hold that a reasonable person could have made the same finding on the basis of the evidence before the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The City\u2019s attorneys each testified that they had no knowledge of the documents\u2019 existence until shortly before turning them over to the trial court. The master found their testimony credible, and noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ing in the record persuades us that this finding was unreasonable. Because the attorneys had no knowledge of the documents, they could not have knowingly concealed them in violation of Rule 35(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Mortimer knew of the documents\u2019 existence long before they were turned over to the trial court. However, Mortimer believed, and the master below found, that the documents contain only rumor, speculation, and hearsay, not facts. The record below supports the master\u2019s finding. Although the documents implicate Pace in Daigle\u2019s beating, the master made his finding after considering evidence of Pace\u2019s reputation for bragging, the dislike some officers felt for him, and Mortimer\u2019s exhaustive, but fruitless follow-up of these investigative leads.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Violation of Rule 35(e)(2) requires both actual knowledge of new information and actual knowledge that it is inconsistent with a response previously made. <em>See </em>8 C. Wright <em>&amp; </em>A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2049, at 323 (1970) (discussing F.R.C.P. 26(e)(2), federal counterpart to Rule 35(e)(2)); <em>see also Bunch v. United States, </em>680 F.2d 1271, 1282 (9th Cir. 1982); <em>Petroleum Ins. Agency v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>106 F.R.D. 59, 68 (D. Mass. 1985). As Daigle\u2019s counsel stated at trial, \u201cRumors are not factual information.\u201d Because the four documents Mortimer \u201cwithheld\u201d contain no factual information, Mortimer could not have knowingly concealed new information, nor could he have knowingly concealed information that was inconsistent with a response previously made.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The master\u2019s finding that the City did not knowingly conceal facts is reasonable, and Daigle\u2019s claim therefore fails. The master properly denied Daigle\u2019s motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b529-9\">Thayer and Horton, JJ., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
