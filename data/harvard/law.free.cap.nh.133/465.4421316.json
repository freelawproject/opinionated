The State argues that the trial court erred in ruling that Autoware is exempt under the motor vehicle dealer exception in the definition of \u201cjunk yard\u201d found in RSA 236:91, IV (Supp. 1989). For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">The individual defendants, Harry A. Ware and Daniel B. Ware, operate a garage adjacent to Route 4 in Canaan under the corporate name Autoware, Inc. Their garage has been registered as a motor vehicle dealer for many years. <em>See </em>RSA 261:104; RSA 259:18, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">The State filed a petition for an injunction on November 18,1986, in which it alleged that the defendants were storing junk in violation of RSA 236:93 (Supp. 1989) and RSA 236:96 (Supp. 1989), legislation relative to junk yards along federally funded highways. The defendants filed an answer on January 29,1987, in which they argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that they were a motor vehicle dealer entitled to the exemption created by RSA 236:91, IV (Supp. 1989). Following a hearing on October 12, 1988, the superior court ruled that Autoware qualified for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the exception found in RSA 236:91, IV (Supp. 1989) and denied the State\u2019s petition. The State filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied, claiming that the court had misinterpreted RSA chapter 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">It is the law in New Hampshire that a person may not operate, establish or maintain a junk yard adjacent to the interstate, federal aid primary and turnpike systems until he or she has obtained a license and certificate of approval. RSA 236:93 (Supp. 1989); <em>see </em>RSA 236:90. It is undisputed that Autoware is situated along the federal aid primary system and is governed by RSA 236:90-110. This subdivision defines \u201cjunk yard\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">\u201can establishment or place of business which is maintained, operated, or used for storing, keeping, buying or selling junk, or for the maintenance or operation of an automobile graveyard, and includes garbage dumps and sanitary fills. <em>The word does not include any motor vehicle dealers registered with the director of motor vehicles under RSA 261:104 and controlled under RSA 236:126.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">RSA 236:91, IV (Supp. 1989) (emphasis added). The issue in this case is whether Autoware meets the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle dealer\u201d in this paragraph and is thus exempt from the junk yard requirements of RSA 236:90-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">According to the statute, if Autoware is registered as a dealer under RSA 261:104 <em>and </em>is controlled under RSA 236:126, it is so exempt. Although the State questions whether the defendants are properly registered under RSA 261:104 and RSA 259:18, that issue was not presented to the trial court, and we will not consider it here. <em>Daboul v. Town of Hampton, </em>124 N.H. 307, 309, 471 A.2d 1148, 1149 (1983). Therefore, the only question to be decided is whether Auto-ware is \u201ccontrolled under RSA 236:126.\u201d This statute is located in the subdivision of laws applicable to junk yards located along roads other than federal aid primary highways and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">\u201cBoth new and used car dealers are hereby required to remove from their premises registered with the director of motor vehicles as their principal place of business any motor vehicle which is of the type referred to in RSA 236:112, I, under the definition of junk yard, within at least 160 days from the date of its original entrance thereon. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">RSA 236:126. The ultimate question we must decide is whether RSA 236:126, in referring to \u201cnew and used car dealers,\u201d limits the operation of \u00a7 126 to car dealers meeting the definition in RSA 236:112, <em>V, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>or whether \u00a7 126 applies also to ear dealers, like Autoware, who may not fall within that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">While the subdivision of laws applicable to junk yards located along non-federally funded highways includes a definition of \u201cused motor vehicle dealer,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 236:112, V(b), the subdivision applicable to junk yards located along federally funded highways does not. However, in the title under which Autoware was registered as a motor vehicle dealer, RSA 259:18, II defines the term \u201cdealer.\u201d Thus, we must first determine whether the two definitions are materially different. RSA 259:18, II defines \u201cdealer\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\u201cevery person principally engaged in the business of buying, selling, or exchanging motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers or tractors, on commission or otherwise, and who maintains in operating condition and in operation and at which location the dealer does a major portion of his business, a place of business capable of housing indoors, in one building, in an area of at least 1,200 square feet, 5 average-sized automobiles, <em>which space may be used for other related purposes devoted to the motor vehicle, trailer, or semi-trailer business </em>and who offers mechanical service, in which the repair of motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers or tractors is subordinate or incidental to the business of buying, selling, and exchanging the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">(Emphasis added.) RSA 236:112, V(b) defines \u201cused motor vehicle dealer\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">\u201cevery person or firm principally engaged in the business of buying, selling and exchanging secondhand motor vehicles or tractors, who maintains in operating condition and in operation and at which the dealer does the major portion of his business a place of business capable of housing indoors in one building, in an area of at least 1200 square feet, 5 average sized motor vehicles, <em>devoted to the used motor vehicles, or tractor business, </em>and gives mechanical service on the same and at which the repair of used motor vehicles, or tractors is subordinate or incidental to the business of buying, selling and exchanging the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">(Emphasis added.) The definition in RSA 259:18, II differs from that found in RSA 236:112, V(b) in that the former allows the 1200-square-foot space to be used for purposes <em>related to </em>the buying, selling, and exchanging of motor vehicles, whereas the latter requires the space to be used almost exclusively for these specific purposes. The trial court found that the definition in \u00a7 112, V(b) was more re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>strictive, and that Autoware would not qualify for the exclusion set forth in RSA 236:91, TV (Supp. 1989) if that definition applied. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The final question, therefore, is whether the RSA 236:112, V(b) definition applies and only dealers meeting that definition are \u201ccontrolled under RSA 236:126.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Although RSA 236:90-110 do not define a dealer or used car dealer, the trial court ruled that the \u00a7 112, V(b) definition did not apply and apparently applied the definition found in RSA 259:18 to find Auto-ware a dealer controlled under RSA 236:126. Since the defendants are registered as a used car dealer, the State Department of Safety must have determined that Autoware fit the definition of \u201cdealer\u201d found in RSA 259:18. <em>See </em>RSA 261:104; RSA 259:18. The court rejected the State\u2019s contention that the definitions of new and used \u201cmotor vehicle dealer\u201d found in RSA 236:112, V apply to the motor vehicle dealers referred to in RSA 236:91, IV (Supp. 1989). It explained that although \u00a7 112 states that for the purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 111-129, which is the subdivision regulating junk yards located along non-federally funded highways, the definitions of \u00a7 91, II, III and IV are to be included, nowhere in \u00a7 91 is it stated that any definitions found in \u00a7 112 are to be included for the purpose of the former subdivision. The trial court likewise rejected the State\u2019s argument that \u201cthe only dealers controlled under RSA 236:126 are those who meet the definition in RSA 236:112 V.\u201d Instead, the court ruled that the two junk yard law subdivisions were not intended to mirror each other, and that for purposes of \u00a7 91, IV the meaning of \u201cused car dealer,\u201d as found in \u00a7 126, is not controlled by the definition of \u201cused motor vehicle dealer\u201d set forth in \u00a7 112, V(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">RSA 236:126, quoted above, refers to RSA 236:112, I, when describing the type of motor vehicle that used car dealers are required to remove from their premises within 160 days. Section 112 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">\n<em>\u201cFor the purposes of this subdivision:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\"><em>I. In addition to the definitions in RSA 236:91, II, III and IV </em>\u2018junk yard\u2019 means any business and any place of storage or deposit, . . . which has stored or deposited 2 or more unregistered motor vehicles which are no longer intended or in condition for legal use on the public highways, or used parts of motor vehicles or old iron, metal, glass, paper, cordage, or other waste or discarded or secondhand material which has been a part, or intended to be a part, of any motor vehicle, the sum of which parts or material shall be equal in bulk to 2 or more motor vehicles. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>RSA 236:112,1 (emphasis added). As noted by the trial court, \u00a7 112 incorporates into the definition of \u201cjunk yard,\u201d for purposes of the subdivision comprising \u00a7\u00a7 111-129, the definitions found in \u00a7 91, II, III and IV whereas \u00a7 91 does not incorporate the definition found in \u00a7 112. The State argues, nevertheless, that the definition found in \u00a7 112, V(b) controls the meaning of \u201cused car dealer\u201d in \u00a7 126 and \u201cmotor vehicle dealer\u201d in \u00a7 91, IV. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In order to understand and apply \u00a7 126, it is necessary to know what is meant by \u201cnew and used car dealers.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 236:126. Although that section clearly applies to junk yards along federally funded highways by virtue of RSA 236:91, IV (Supp. 1989), the location of \u00a7 126 in the second subdivision, and the fact that the definitions to be used for purposes of that subdivision are set forth in \u00a7 112, convince us that the definitions of new and used motor vehicle dealers in \u00a7 112, V govern the meaning of \u201cnew and used car dealers\u201d in \u00a7 126, whether \u00a7 126 is applied to junk yards adjacent to non-federally funded highways or to junk yards along federally funded highways by virtue of RSA 236:91, IV (Supp. 1989). <em>Cf. </em>RSA 259:18 (statute defines \u201cdealer\u201d but does not define \u201cnew car dealer\u201d or \u201cused car dealer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in finding that a used motor vehicle dealer need not satisfy the definition set forth in RSA 236:112, V(b) in order to be controlled under RSA 236:126 and thus to qualify for the motor vehicle dealer\u2019s exception under RSA 236:91, IV (Supp. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-8\">HORTON, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
