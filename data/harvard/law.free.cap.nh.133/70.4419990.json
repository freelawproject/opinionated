On August 25, 1989, the Superior Court <em>(Pappagianis, </em>J.) held that defendant is not obligated to provide Wade with coverage. This appeal followed and, for the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-18\">During the summer of 1986, Camp Allen, Inc. employed Judith Gagnon, the decedent, as a camp counselor and Sally Wade as the camp \u201cWaterfront Coordinator.\u201d On July 7, 1986, Wade was on duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>as the pool lifeguard, and Gagnon was participating in a \u201cone-hour staff free swim.\u201d While Wade was momentarily away from the pool, Gagnon suffered an epileptic seizure and nearly drowned. As a result of the accident, Gagnon lapsed into a coma and eventually died.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">On July 9,1986, Camp Allen filed an \u201cEmployer\u2019s First Report of Injury\u201d with the State Department of Labor. Later, by letter of November 7, 1986, the attorney for George Gagnon, the guardian of Judith Gagnon, wrote the adjustors that \u201cthe claim for compensation benefits is withdrawn, without prejudice.\u201d Plaintiff then brought a tort action against Wade, Camp Allen, and Camp Allen director Wayne Vaughn. Also on November 7,1986, plaintiff commenced this declaratory judgment action against New Hampshire Insurance Company, seeking coverage for Wade under the liability insurance policies defendant sold to Camp Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The two insurance policies at issue here are a general liability policy (including its broad form extension endorsement) and a commercial liability umbrella policy. The parties agree that coverage under the umbrella policy is directly tied to coverage under the general liability policy, and our discussion will therefore be limited to-the general liability policy. The parties also agree that Wade is entitled to coverage under the general liability policy only if she qualifies as an \u201cexecutive officer,\u201d or if Gagnon\u2019s injury did not \u201carise out of or in the course of her employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The pertinent provisions of the insurance policy are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">\u201cII. <em>PERSONS INSURED</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">Each of the following is an <em>insured </em>under this insurance to the extent set forth below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">(c) if the <em>named insured </em>is designated in the declarations as other than an individual, partnership or joint venture, the organization so designated and any executive officer, director or stockholder thereof while acting within the scope of his duties as such;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">\u201cX. <em>ADDITIONAL PERSONS INSURED</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APR\">As respects <em>bodily injury, property damage </em>and <em>advertising injury </em>and personal injury coverages, under the provision \u201cPersons Insured\u201d, the following are added as <em>insureds'.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>(2) Employee \u2014 Any employee (other than executive officers) of the <em>named insured </em>while acting within the scope of his duties as such, but the insurance afforded to such employee does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">(a) to <em>bodily injury </em>or <em>personal injury </em>to another employee of the <em>named insured </em>arising out of or in the course of his employment;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">(Emphasis in the original policy.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Camp Allen also purchased a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy from defendant. In order to receive coverage under this policy for employee injury claims, \u201c[t]he bodily injury must arise out of and in the course of the injured employee\u2019s employment____\u201d The phrase \u201carising out of and in the course of . . . employment\u201d is also the language used in RSA 281-A:2, XI (Supp. 1989) to define those injuries compensable by workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The trial court held that \u201cNew Hampshire Insurance Company is not obligated to provide Sally Wade with coverage\u201d because she was not a Camp Allen executive officer and because Gagnon\u2019s injury arose out of <em>and </em>in the course of her employment with Camp Allen. Plaintiff appeals, arguing: (1) Wade was an \u201cexecutive officer\u201d at Camp Allen; (2) Gagnon\u2019s injury did not \u201carise out of\u201d or \u201cin the course of\u201d her employment at Camp Allen; (3) workers\u2019 compensation cases should not dictate our treatment of the phrase \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d; and (4) the testimony of Anne Crane, a workers\u2019 compensation expert, should not have been admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">I. <em>Executive Officer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">\u201c[C]ontract interpretation,\u201d such as interpretation of the term \u201cexecutive officer\u201d in an insurance policy, \u201cis ultimately an issue for this court....\u201d <em>Smith v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>130 N.H. 117, 125, 536 A.2d 164, 168 (1987) (citation omitted). We hold that the trial court correctly determined, as a matter of law, that Wade was not an executive officer of Camp Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">This court has previously interpreted the phrase \u201cexecutive officer\u201d as it appears in a commercial liability policy. Both <em>Smith supra </em>and <em>Young v. N.H. Indem. Co., Inc., </em>120 N.H. 882, 424 A.2d 205 (1980) involved insurance provisions identical to Section II, Persons Insured, of defendant\u2019s insurance policy, quoted above. In <em>Smith, </em>a plant manager\u2019s insurance coverage under the \u201cexecutive officer\u201d provision was called into question. \u201cHe had authority to contract for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the purchase of supplies and certain equipment; he was authorized to hire, fire and supervise the plant\u2019s fifty employees; and he had overall responsibility for the safety, maintenance and operation of the Manchester plant.\u201d <em>Smith v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 119, 536 A.2d at 165. We held that the plant manager was eligible for insurance coverage as an executive officer. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 125, 536 A.2d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><em>Young </em>also involved a plant manager\u2019s eligibility for insurance coverage as an \u201cexecutive officer.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201cYoung\u2019s managerial duties place upon him the responsibility to supervise directly three foremen and forty employees. As safety officer, Young is head of the safety committee and is responsible for compliance with regulations of the United States Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Young also was involved in the purchase and construction of other plants. On his own signature, he has bound the corporation to contracts with machinery contractors and other tradesmen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\"><em>Young v. N.H. Indem. Co., Inc., supra </em>at 883, 424 A.2d at 206. Similar to the result in <em>Smith, </em>we held that Young was an executive officer for purposes of the insurance policy. <em>Young, supra </em>at 884, 424 A.2d at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Wade\u2019s role as Waterfront Coordinator contrasts sharply with those of the two plant managers described above. Although she was responsible for the safety of the employees and campers using the camp pool, she had no authority to bind Camp Allen to contracts, to purchase supplies, or to hire and fire employees. She supervised no one, and she had no dealings with State or federal safety agencies. Her duties were limited to lifeguarding, administering basic swimming tests to employees, and compiling a list of pool safety rules from the previous summer\u2019s rules. Wade was not an executive officer under the <em>Smith </em>and <em>Young </em>decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Plaintiff argues that the term \u201cexecutive officer\u201d is ambiguous and that it therefore should be construed in favor of coverage for Wade. It is true this court has held that the term \u201cexecutive officer\u201d is ambiguous. <em>Young v. N.H. Indem. Co., Inc., </em>120 N.H. at 884, 424 A.2d at 206. We have also adopted the rule that in \u201ccases where policy language is ambiguous or when separate clauses lend themselves to conflicting interpretations,.. . ambiguous language is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>strued against the insurer.\u201d <em>Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>120 N.H. 764, 770, 423 A.2d 980, 984 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">These rules of construction, however, do not help plaintiff\u2019s case. \u201cAmbiguity\u201d is \u201cthe condition of admitting of two or more meanings, of being understood in more than one way . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 66 (Unabridged 1961). In order to take advantage of our rules of construction, plaintiff must show that Wade can be classified as an \u201cexecutive officer\u201d under any one of the possible meanings of the term. For example, if \u201cexecutive officer\u201d is ambiguous because the term can fairly be understood to mean \u201cone who holds a position of administrative <em>or </em>managerial responsibility in a business or other organization,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 794 (Unabridged 1961) (emphasis added), Wade is entitled to coverage if plaintiff can show that her position as Waterfront Coordinator was one of <em>either </em>administrative <em>or </em>managerial responsibility. Plaintiff has failed to show that Wade was an executive officer under <em>any </em>possible definition of the term. We therefore hold that Wade is not entitled to coverage as an executive officer. <em>See City of Manchester v. General Reinsurance Corp., </em>127 N.H. 806, 809, 508 A.2d 1063, 1065 (1986) (\u201cWe will not force language to create an ambiguity in order to resolve it against the insurer, when it is clear from contextual analysis that no coverage was intended.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">II. <em>Arising out of or in the Course of Employment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The question whether an employee\u2019s injury arose out of or in the course of her employment is one of fact. <em>See Murphy v. Town of Atkinson, </em>128 N.H. 641, 646, 517 A.2d 1170, 1173 (1986). Therefore, the trial court\u2019s findings on this issue are entitled to stand unless plaintiff demonstrates that they lack support in the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In Murphy, we set forth this court\u2019s test for determining whether an employee\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of employment. To meet this standard, one must prove</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">\u201c(1) that the injury arose out of employment by demonstrating that it resulted from a risk created by the employment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">(2) that the injury arose in the course of employment by demonstrating that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">(A) it occurred within the boundaries of time and space created by the terms of employment, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">(B) it occurred in the performance of an activity related to employment, which may include a personal activity if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>reasonably expected and not forbidden or an activity of mutual benefit to employer and employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><em>Murphy v. Town of Atkinson, supra </em>at 645-46, 517 A.2d at 1172-73 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The trial court had sufficient evidence before it to find that Gag-non\u2019s injury arose both out of <em>and </em>in the course of her employment at Camp Allen. First, the injury resulted from a risk created by her employment and therefore arose out of her employment. The camp pool in which Gagnon nearly drowned was available to camp employees during their \u201cone-hour staff free swim.\u201d Gagnon would not have been in the pool at the time of her seizure had it not been for her employment at Camp Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Second, Gagnon\u2019s injury occurred within the boundaries of time and space created by the terms of employment. The pool was located on camp property and the \u201cone-hour staff free swim\u201d was scheduled during the course of the employees\u2019 work days. The injury also occurred in the performance of an activity related to employment, since it was a personal activity reasonably expected and not forbidden. Gagnon\u2019s employment as a camp counselor was a 24-hour per day job. Except during scheduled days off from work, staff persons were always \u201con call.\u201d The staff swim period was provided to the employees as a short break from work. Although the counselors were allowed to leave camp premises during the one-hour break, they were expected to be at their employer\u2019s disposal if they remained on the grounds. Thus, Gagnon\u2019s injury arose in the course of her employment. The trial court\u2019s findings were supported by the evidence and we will not disturb them.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">III. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law in the Context of Insurance Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Plaintiff disputes the use of the <em>Murphy </em>analysis, <em>supra, </em>to determine whether Gagnon\u2019s injury arose out of or in the course of her employment. <em>Murphy </em>involved a workers\u2019 compensation claim, and not the interpretation of an insurance policy. <em>Murphy v. Town of Atkinson, </em>128 N.H. 641, 517 A.2d 1170. It is our policy to favor workers\u2019 compensation claimants, <em>see Ranger v. N.H. Youth Dev. Center, </em>117 N.H. 648, 652, 377 A.2d 132, 137 (1977), <em>and </em>insurance claimants, <em>Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>120 N.H. at 770, 423 A.2d at 984-85, although their interests may differ regarding whether an injury was work-related. Plaintiff therefore argues that our construction of the phrase \u201carising out of or in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>employment\u201d should be tailored to suit the particular class of injured worker; <em>i.e., </em>those seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits, or those seeking insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">By law, an injured employee must forego a civil action against an employer if that employee\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of employment. RSA 281-A:8 (Supp. 1989). Therefore, an employee seeking employer liability insurance benefits, such as Gagnon, through her estate, attempts to prove that the injury did not arise out of and in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">On the other hand, an employee wishing to obtain workers\u2019 compensation benefits attempts to prove that the injury <em>did </em>arise out of and in the course of employment. The <em>Murphy </em>analysis, because it is drawn from workers\u2019 compensation cases, favors a finding that an employee\u2019s injury <em>did </em>arise out of and in the course of employment. For that reason, plaintiff argues that a different analysis should be used to construe an identical phrase in a general liability insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">We find defendant\u2019s argument in favor of using the <em>Murphy </em>analysis in general liability insurance cases persuasive. As defendant points out, the clause in its general liability policy excluding coverage for injuries arising out of or in the course of employment is a workers\u2019 compensation exclusion clause. \u201cThe objective of this exclusionary clause is to avoid duplication of coverage with respect to the subject matters covered by [defendant\u2019s] standard \u2018Work[ers\u2019] Compensation and Employer\u2019s Liability Policy.\u2019\u201d <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co. v. Poirier, </em>120 N.H. 422, 427, 415 A.2d 882, 885 (1980) (citations omitted); <em>see also </em>2 R. Long, The Law of Liability Insurance \u00a7 10.11, at 10-80 (1989) (purpose of exclusion is to avoid duplication of coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">In most general liability policies, the workers\u2019 compensation exclusion clause parallels the language of the workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. Both typically use the phrase \u201carising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d Since the workers\u2019 compensation exclusion clause serves to avoid duplicative coverage, the phrase must be interpreted identically in the two insurance policies. Thus, if an employee is ineligible for coverage under the general liability policy because the injury arose out of and in the course of employment, that employee should automatically be eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and the employer should obtain coverage under its workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>In this case, there is not a perfect dovetail between the workers\u2019 compensation exclusion clause in the general liability policy and the workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. The exclusion clause in the general liability policy reads \u201carising out of <em>or </em>in the course of . . . employment,\u201d whereas the workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy reads \u201carise out of <em>and </em>in the course of . . . employment.\u201d Thus it is possible for an employee\u2019s injury to fall between the two insurance policies, if the injury is found, for example, to have arisen out of, but not in the course of employment. Here, however, Gagnon\u2019s injury was found by the trial court to have arisen out of <em>and </em>in the course of her employment. Thus it makes no difference to plaintiff\u2019s ease whether the workers\u2019 compensation exclusion clause in the general liability policy uses the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d or the conjunctive \u201cand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">IV. <em>Anne Crane\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Last, plaintiff argues that Anne Crane, former Deputy Commissioner of Labor and former director of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division of the State Department of Labor, who was called as a witness by the defendant, should not have been allowed to testify concerning Gagnon\u2019s possible eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. By asserting that Crane\u2019s testimony lacked relevance, plaintiff makes the same argument made above; that is, that a workers\u2019 compensation analysis should not be used to determine whether Gagnon\u2019s injury arose out of or in the course of employment for purposes of the general liability insurance policy. Since this argument fails, as outlined above, plaintiff\u2019s argument as to the relevance of Crane\u2019s testimony fails also.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The plaintiff also objects to the use of hypothetical questions by the defendant to elicit Crane\u2019s expert opinion as to whether Gag-non would be entitled to benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation statute. Such expert opinion is admissible, within the sound discretion of the trial court, where the evidence has some \u201ctendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 401; <em>see Peters v. McNally, </em>123 N.H. 438, 440, 462 A.2d 119, 121 (1983) (trial judge has wide discretion in the admission and exclusion of opinion testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
