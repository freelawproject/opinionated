On appeal, he argues that the Trial Court\u2019s <em>{Pappagianis, </em>J.) charge to the jury on reasonable doubt deviated significantly from the model instruction delineated in <em>State v. Wentworth, </em>118 N.H. 832, 838-39, 395 A.2d 858, 862-63 (1978), and therefore should automatically require reversal of the convictions and a new trial. In the alternative, he argues that the instruction as given was fatally flawed in two respects: first, that it failed to impress upon the jurors that they were required to employ the reasonable doubt standard as defined for them and, second, that the abbreviated version of the <em>Wentworth </em>charge did not provide the jurors with sufficient opportunity to absorb, consider, and understand the concept of reasonable doubt. In addition to these claims regarding the alleged inadequacies of the reasonable doubt instruction, Mr. Letendre also contends that the trial court committed reversible error in allowing the State \u201cto cross-examine the defendant about the veracity of other witnesses.\u201d We find these arguments to be meritless and accordingly uphold the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">We begin by noting that we have encouraged, indeed exhorted, the superior court to employ the reasonable doubt jury instruction set forth in the <em>Wentworth </em>case. This court is convinced that \u201cuse of the model instruction set forth in <em>Wentworth </em>will provide a balanced definition of reasonable doubt, will reduce needless litigation, and most importantly will insure the application of a uniform standard for juries weighing the evidence presented in trial courts throughout the State . . . .\u201d <em>State v. Aubert, </em>120 N.H. 634, 638, 421 A.2d 124, 127 (1980). However, despite our repeated pleas to refrain from altering the <em>Wentworth </em>charge, we have been called upon to determine the sufficiency of the reasonable doubt instruction in numerous instances where a trial judge has neglected to heed our warning and has chosen to stray from the mandated instruction. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>State v. Zysk, 123 N.H. 481, 488, 465 A.2d 480, 484 (1983) (judges asked numerous times not to change <em>Wentworth </em>charge; opportunity taken, <em>\u201conce again,\u201d </em>to remind trial judges not to add to language of <em>Wentworth </em>because it only leads to needless litigation) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original); <em>State v. Langdon, </em>121 N.H. 1065, 1068, 438 A.2d 299, 300 (1981) (strongly reemphasized previous position that trial judges should refrain from altering <em>Wentworth </em>charge); <em>State v. Aubert, </em>120 N.H. at 636, 638, 421 A.2d at 126, 127 (efforts to further define concept of reasonable doubt have been repeatedly criticized; trial judges requested not to add to the model charge); <em>State v. Wentworth, </em>118 N.H. at 839, 395 A.2d at 863 (trial judges cautioned to avoid attempts at further defining reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Pointing out this apparent reluctance on the part of some trial judges to deliver the instruction <em>verbatim, </em>it is the defendant\u2019s position that \u201cwithout a firm rule, trial judges will not listen to the pleas of [this] Court.\u201d Arguing that \u201c[a]fter a decade of cautioning and requesting, only mandating <em>Wentworth </em>will insure compliance,\u201d he would have us establish a <em>per se </em>rule \u201cthat any substantial modification of the <em>Wentworth </em>instruction will in the future require a new trial.\u201d Although it certainly has not escaped our notice that, had the trial court simply given the model charge, there would be no question concerning the sufficiency of the instruction, we hold that the remedy for such noncompliance is not automatic reversal. Without a showing that the defendant has somehow been prejudiced by the instruction as given, he is not entitled to a new trial. <em>State v. Bundy, </em>130 N.H. 382, 383, 539 A.2d 713, 713 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In this case, the trial judge instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">\u201cThe State has the burden of presenting evidence that is sufficient to convince you that the statements in the accusation are true beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">Under the United States and the New Hampshire constitutions, a person accused of having committed a crime is assumed to be innocent. The person accused does not have any burden to prove that he is or she is innocent. The State has the burden to prove that he or she is guilty. A person accused of having committed a crime enters the courtroom as an innocent person and you must consider him or her to be innocent unless the State convinces you beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>doubt that he or she is guilty of every element of the crime with which he or she is charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">A reasonable doubt is what the words ordinarily mean, a doubt based upon reason. It is not a doubt that can be explained away easily. After you have considered all the evidence and the law, if you reasonably doubt that the State has proved any one or more of the elements of a crime charged, you must find the accused person not guilty. If you have no reasonable doubt that the State has proved all the elements of a crime charged, you should find him or her guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Mr. Letendre argues that this modified instruction, which omitted the <em>Wentworth </em>language, \u201cThe test you must use is this,\u201d was inadequate in that it failed to impress upon the jurors their obligation to use the reasonable doubt standard as defined for them by the trial judge. We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\"> It is axiomatic that \u201ca single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\u201d <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-47 (1973); <em>see State v. Bundy, </em>130 N.H. at 383, 539 A.2d at 713; <em>State v. Brown, </em>128 N.H. 606, 615, 517 A.2d 831, 837 (1986). In this case, although it is true that the trial court omitted the specific language of <em>Went-worth </em>instructing the jurors to use the reasonable doubt standard as defined for them, the charge as a whole adequately informed the jurors of their duty to follow, the law as the judge explained it. More specifically, at the beginning of his charge, the trial judge informed the jurors that they were to decide the facts and reach a verdict based on \u201cthe law as I shall explain it.\u201d The judge reiterated this admonition later on in the charge when he explained that \u201c[i]f a lawyer says anything about the law that differs from <em>the law as I shall explain it, </em>you will disregard what the lawyer says and you will consider <em>the law as I explain it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The judge again impressed upon the jurors their responsibility in this regard when he told them they \u201cmust decide the case on the evidence and the rational inferences to be drawn from the evidence and on <em>the law as I am explaining it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Given the fact that the trial judge, in at least three separate instances, directed the jurors to follow the law as explained to them, the omission of this language from the reasonable doubt portion of the charge did not prejudice the defendant and does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The defendant\u2019s final argument concerning the reasonable doubt instruction is that its brevity prevented the jurors from having the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>opportunity to mull over and absorb the definition. He claims that \u201c[s]uch an important concept deserves more\u201d than two short sentences. Although he cites no case in support of his position, Mr. Letendre contends that the <em>Wentworth </em>instruction is designedly repetitive, that \u201c[i]ts deliberate measured pace allows the jurors the opportunity to think about the parameters of the concept as they listen to the words,\u201d and that <em>\u201cWentworth </em>requires an expansive, not truncated, explanation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The purpose of the trial court\u2019s instructions \u2018\u201cis to state and explain to the jury, in clear and intelligible language, the rules of law applicable to the case.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Saucier, </em>128 N.H. 291, 299, 512 A.2d 1120, 1126 (1986) (quoting <em>Fletcher v. Kunze, </em>125 N.H. 277, 279, 480 A.2d 141, 142 (1984)); <em>State v. Skaff, </em>94 N.H. 402, 407, 54 A.2d 155, 159 (1947). As long as the charge given, in the context of the instructions as a whole, fairly covers the issues and law of the case, reversal is unwarranted. <em>State v. Dennehy, </em>127 N.H. 425, 430, 503 A.2d 769, 772 (1985) (citations omitted); <em>State v. Bird, </em>122 N.H. 10, 15, 440 A.2d 441, 443 (1982). We hold that in this case the charge as a whole conveyed the correct concept of reasonable doubt to the jury. Accordingly, the alleged brevity of the instruction is not a basis for disturbing the conviction. We also note that in this instance the trial judge gave each juror a typed copy of his instructions. They were able to read along with the judge and had ample opportunity to reread, digest, and reflect upon the meaning of the concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We now turn our attention to the defendant\u2019s final argument on appeal, that the trial court erred in allowing the State to question him about the truthfulness of other witnesses. The defendant, who chose to take the stand in his own defense, claims that a series of questions asked of him during cross-examination was misleading and improper. He argues that the questions as posed forced him to comment on the veracity of other witnesses\u2019 testimony, and compelled him to admit \u201cthat the complainant had no reason to lie and in effect that she was telling the truth.\u201d The defendant claims that his answers to this line of questioning were devastating to his case and warrant reversal. The State, on the other hand, argues that although effective, the questions were not improper or misleading. In the alternative, it is the State\u2019s position that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The following questions, pertaining to any possible motive to lie on the part of the victim, were asked of the defendant at trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>\u201cQ. Have you ever seen [the victim] before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">A. No, I have not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">Q. You don\u2019t know her at all, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">A. No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">Q. So then I assume that, that\u2019s \u2014 that it\u2019s fair to say you had (sic) never had any disagreements with her, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">Q. And she would have no reason to come in here and lie about you, would she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">[Defense Counsel]: I object to that. Asking him to speculate on motives of another witness. That\u2019s up to the jury, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-13\">A. Could you repeat the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-14\">Q. She would have no reason to come in here and sit in front of this jury and lie about you, would she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-15\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-16\">Q. And you recall my, my direct examination of [the victim], don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-17\">A. I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-18\">Q. And I asked her to look at you during the course of that direct examination, didn\u2019t I?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-19\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-20\">Q. And did she do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-21\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-22\">Q. She looked you right in the eye, didn\u2019t she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-23\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-24\">Q. And the lady who you say you\u2019ve never known before and have had no disagreements with pointed you out and identified you as being the person who was in her bedroom that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-25\">A. Whenever someone is sitting in the defendant\u2019s chair, the person on the stand automatically says, yuh, that was him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-26\">In addition, a similar set of questions was asked of the defendant regarding any reasons the cab driver might have had to lie on the witness stand.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>\u201cQ. You, did you recognize [the cab driver] when he came in here to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">Q. You had (sic) never seen him before, have you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">A. I didn\u2019t recognize him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">Q. You\u2019ve never had any disagreements with him then, I assume?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">Q. And he would then have no reason to come in and tell lies concerning you, would he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object again; same basis. He\u2019s asking my client to speculate on another witness\u2019s motives. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">THE COURT: All right. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-13\">A. Continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-14\">Q. Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-15\">A. Could you repeat the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-16\">Q. He wouldn\u2019t have any motivation then since you didn\u2019t know him and never had any disagreements with him to come in here and point the finger at you and, and lie about you, would he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-17\">A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-18\">Upon review of the preceding allegedly offending series of questions, we find that the defendant\u2019s position lacks merit. The questions asked did not compel Mr. Letendre to comment on the veracity of these two witnesses. He was not asked whether the victim and the cab driver were telling the truth. He was simply asked whether he knew if either of the two witnesses had any reason or motivation to lie to the jury. Such questioning has been approved by this court in the past. See <em>State v. Bruce, </em>132 N.H. 465, 468, 566 A.2d 1144, 1146 (1989) (objection to question, \u201cDo you know of any reason why your daughter would lie about . . . you?,\u201d was properly overruled).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-19\">Because we hold that the questions as posed to the defendant did not require him to comment on the veracity of other witnesses, we do not at this time reach a decision as to the propriety of such questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-20\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b589-21\">Horton, J., did not sit; Batchelder, J., concurred specially; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b590-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>BATCHELDER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFku\">concurring specially: While I agree with the majority\u2019s holding, I would go one step further and formally recognize that which is all too clear: the <em>Wentworth </em>instruction should merely be viewed as one example of an instruction that apprises the jury of the concepts of reasonable doubt in a fair and even-handed manner. To the extent that the <em>Wentworth </em>instruction presents such an example, it is my view that the trial court should be free to deviate from its language so long as it does so in a comprehensive and coherent fashion capturing the essential concepts of fairness and the presumption of innocence. It follows that to the extent <em>Wentworth </em>is viewed as requiring slavish adherence to its content and rote delivery, it should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
