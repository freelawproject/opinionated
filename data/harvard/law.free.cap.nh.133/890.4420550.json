RSA 629:3; RSA 630:l-a. In this appeal, the defendant asserts that the trial court erred in allowing testimony regarding statements made by his wife and co-conspirator, Tina Gibney. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">At approximately 3 p.m. on March 2, 1989, Dennis Brown (the intended victim of the conspiracy) was left by a friend at his mother\u2019s house in Rochester. Brown resided there, along with his mother and his niece, the daughter of his sister, Tina Gibney. Tina Gibney lived elsewhere with her husband, the defendant, Vincent Gibney.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">It had previously been arranged that Tina Gibney would meet Brown at their mother\u2019s house and then drive him to Dover for an appointment with his lawyer. On Brown\u2019s arrival, however, Tina Gibney informed him that the defendant would instead drive him to Dover. Before Brown and the defendant left, Brown\u2019s friend observed Tina Gibney giving the defendant some money.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">En route, the defendant told Brown, a confirmed alcoholic, that he had some money, and suggested that they have a few drinks while in Dover. When they arrived in Dover, Brown went to his appointment, but his attorney was not immediately available. Brown then went to a bar, where the defendant was waiting for him, and had a beer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>Brown and the defendant then went to the American Legion where the defendant purchased Brown two rum and cokes before Brown returned to see his attorney. After Brown\u2019s appointment, the defendant continued to buy him drinks at various drinking establishments. Significantly, the defendant suggested that Brown have a tequila chaser with each drink. Brown testified that the defendant knew from previous experience that tequila had a particularly potent effect on him. On this occasion, the combined effects of the tequila and other alcohol caused Brown, over time, to become so intoxicated that he testified that he \u201cflat-out blanked out.\u201d Brown had no further recollection of the evening until after the defendant\u2019s arrest several hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Meanwhile, Tina Gibney tried to enlist the aid of Michael Pettibone, a friend of the defendant, to secure an \u201ceight-ball\u201d of cocaine. She made it clear that the cocaine was to be used to kill Brown. She explained to Pettibone that this was necessary to protect her daughter and mother from violence threatened by Brown. She told Pettibone that the defendant was out getting Brown drunk so that \u201cit will be easier.\u201d Pettibone agreed to find the cocaine, but never actually attempted to do so. After several trips made on the pretext of looking for cocaine, Pettibone told her that he had been unable to purchase any, and returned the money she had given him. She asked him to call her later. At this point, Pettibone went to the police. He twice called Tina Gibney from the Rochester Police Station, and eventually agreed to join her, the defendant, and Brown at the Rochester Moose Club.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The police equipped Pettibone with a transmitter. An unofficial transcript of the tape recording of the resulting transmissions was made by the State. This transcript was provided to the jury, in addition to the tapes themselves, and we quote from it in recounting the subsequent events.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Pettibone joined the defendant, Tina Gibney, and Brown at the Moose Club at approximately 9:00 p.m. At this point, Brown was highly intoxicated, the defendant was \u201cfine,\u201d and Tina Gibney was drinking only soda. Pettibone broached the subject of the conspiracy with the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-8\">\u201cMICHAEL PETTIBONE: Well, Tina said there was a problem with Dennis, then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADR\">Yup. VINCENT GIBNEY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>MICHAEL PETTIBONE: You guys might need some help this evening and she wanted the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">At trial Pettibone testified that when he started this conversation with the defendant, the defendant \u201cseemed to know. He wasn\u2019t surprised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Pettibone then had a conversation with Tina Gibney. The essence of this conversation was that the intended victim, Brown, had expressed a desire to fight with the defendant because Tina Gibney\u2019s daughter wanted to live with her mother and the defendant, rather than continue her present living arrangement with Tina Gibney\u2019s mother and Brown. The discussion soon turned to deadly use of force:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-8\">\u201cTINA GIBNEY: Well, if he wants to fight with Vince, we take him somewhere and they fight and .... (inaudible) .... get hit with a rock or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-10\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: Yeah, that\u2019s awful permanent. You know, that\u2019s permanent. If Vince hits him and he falls and hits his head on a rock . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">Later in the same conversation Tina Gibney and Pettibone agreed that the best place for the \u201cfight\u201d to occur would be at the Rochester Fairgrounds (the fairgrounds). They then began to discuss who was to drive to the scene and in what vehicles. Finally, the following exchange left little doubt that Tina Gibney and Pettibone were not discussing a mere fight at the fairgrounds.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-13\">\u201cTINA GIBNEY: You can go and talk to Vince.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-14\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: It\u2019s a little scary talking about killing people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-16\">TINA GIBNEY: He\u2019s [Brown] gonna kill my daughter, he told me he was tonight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-18\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: ... And then just a fight and then he falls down and if he doesn\u2019t hit his head, what are we going to do? Drop a rock on him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>TINA GIBNEY: Maybe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-5\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-6\">TINA GIBNEY: I\u2019m sure we can do both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-7\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: Permanent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Pettibone then went to the defendant and discussed the logistics of the plan with him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-9\">\u201cVINCENT GIBNEY: Watch him [apparently Brown], he\u2019s hammered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-11\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: She\u2019s [Tina Gibney] going to drive my car to the fairgrounds. You\u2019re going to take your truck to the fairgrounds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">Pettibone and the defendant continued to discuss the plans as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-15\">\u201cMICHAEL PETTIBONE: So all\u2019s you\u2019re going to do is beat the f\u2014 out of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-17\">VINCENT GIBNEY: If that\u2019s what happens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-18\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-19\">VINCENT GIBNEY: I don\u2019t want to, but if that should happen. Tina told me one thing and she told me another thing she\u2019s always f\u2014 ing something . . . (unintelligible) ... wrong place and the wrong time .... (unintelligible) .... if I had a f \u2014 ing eight ball of cocaine I\u2019d shoot him up ... (unintelligible).... nobody would know nothing . . . (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-21\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: Yeah. That\u2019s awful permanent, too. See, I went out looking. That\u2019s what she asked me for was an eight-ball and she gave me money for it. Couldn\u2019t find nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-23\">VINCENT GIBNEY: Hut would probably have some, but he would\u2019t [sic] sell it to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>MICHAEL PETTIBONE: No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-5\">VINCENT GIBNEY: He had none?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-6\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: No. He\u2019s out of that. Yeah, he don\u2019t do that no more. I know one place, know one place . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-8\">VINCENT GIBNEY: Is that John?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-9\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-10\">VINCENT GIBNEY: He said Hut did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-12\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: No. No. I mean, people are trying to bust him. That\u2019s a crock of sh \u2014 . That\u2019s a crock of sh \u2014 . No, everything is very hot in Rochester. I went around and looked. Thought I had an opening, seen some sh- there was nothing, garbage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-14\">VINCENT GIBNEY: Tina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-15\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: Still think you ought to go do it at the fairgrounds. She\u2019s got to drive the car. She\u2019s got to drive my wagon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">Subsequently, Pettibone left Tina Gibney and the defendant alone for a brief period. Shortly after rejoining them, the defendant told Pettibone: \u201cFinish your drink, we gotta get going. We\u2019ll take you home and I\u2019ll do what I gotta do.\u201d Pettibone responded that he was going with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">Pettibone, Brown, Tina Gibney, and the defendant left the Moose Club for the fairgrounds in two vehicles. The defendant and Brown were in a truck driven by the defendant. Brown was by this point only barely conscious. Tina Gibney remarked while Brown was being put into the truck that \u201c[h]e\u2019s too f \u2014 ing drunk to fight.\u201d Pettibone was in a car being driven by Tina Gibney. The police continued to monitor their conversation, which went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-19\">\u201cMICHAEL PETTIBONE: Yeah. In and out. It doesn\u2019t look, I mean, I didn\u2019t think Vince really understood what was going on. He didn\u2019t act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>like he really thought this was a killing situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-4\">TINA GIBNEY: Oh, he knew that, but see what he wanted to do was get the f \u2014 ing coke and shoot him up. Now he\u2019s nervous ... (unintelligible) ... maybe ... (unintelligible) . . . smash his head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIt\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: : Yeah. The thing is, everything\u2019s permanent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad92\">TINA GIBNEY: I know ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACL\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: : Yeah, and you start it, you don\u2019t back down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWT\">TINA GIBNEY: I\u2019m not going to go watch. I can\u2019t stay, okay? I can\u2019t f \u2014 ing sit there and watch, (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8f\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE I wish I\u2019d a got \u2014 been able to get some coke and a needle. I couldn\u2019t a done the needle; I wouldn\u2019t a know how to do a needle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYJ\">TINA GIBNEY: Vince does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A48\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE Is he all right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZti\">TINA GIBNEY: (Unintelligible) .... fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoj\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbiG\">TINA GIBNEY: Vince starts .... fight. I don\u2019t care about who does it. I want it done so he\u2019s never going to wake up again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afe\">MICHAEL PETTIBONE: That\u2019s permanent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqpm\">Finally, Tina Gibney stated her goal in no uncertain terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-g\">\u201cTINA GIBNEY: I want him dead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-24\">Upon reaching the fairgrounds, the four were apprehended by the Rochester police.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-25\">The defendant was indicted for conspiracy to commit first degree murder. A person is guilty of conspiracy under RSA 629:3,1, if, \u201cwith a purpose that a crime defined by statute be committed, he agrees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>with one or more persons to commit or cause the commission of such crime, and an overt act is committed by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d Two overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were alleged in the indictment: first, that Tina Gibney gave Pettibone $250 to obtain cocaine \u201cto be injected into Dennis Brown by the Gibneys after the Gibneys rendered Dennis Brown unable to resist the injection by getting him intoxicated\u201d; and second, that the defendant brought Brown to the Moose Club \u201cto get him intoxicated.\u201d At trial, the prosecution offered testimony regarding statements made by Tina Gibney; the defendant objected to this testimony as being hearsay and as not being admissible as the statement of a co-conspirator. Ruling that there was sufficient independent evidence of the defendant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy, the court found the testimony to be admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) of the New Hampshire Rules of Evidence, which provides that a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and is \u201ca statement by a co-conspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The defendant asserts that for testimony to be admissible under the co-conspirator \u201cexception\u201d to the hearsay rule, the State must show, using evidence independent of the hearsay sought to be admitted, that the defendant was a member of the conspiracy at the time of the co-conspirator\u2019s statement. The defendant argues that in this case there is insufficient independent evidence to show that he was part of the conspiracy. Accordingly, the defendant maintains that the testimony regarding the statements of Tina Gibney was inadmissible hearsay. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">The defendant correctly states the test that this court employed in determining the applicability of the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule prior to the 1985 adoption of the New Hampshire Rules of Evidence. In <em>State v. Gilbert, </em>121 N.H. 305, 429 A.2d 323 (1981), we held that \u201cout-of-court statements by co-conspirators are admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule \u2018when [the statements are] made during the pendency of the criminal enterprise and in furtherance of the criminal object, as long as the existence of the conspiracy is sufficiently proved by independent evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311, 429 A.2d at 328 (quoting <em>State v. Colby, </em>116 N.H. 790, 793-94, 368 A.2d 587, 590 (1976)). The proof required is that of a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>State v. Colby, supra </em>at 794, 368 A.2d at 591. \u201cIndependent evidence\u201d is any evidence which is otherwise admissible. <em>See United States v. Cambindo Valencia, </em>609 F.2d 603, 635 n.24 (2d Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>The State urges us to adopt the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Rule 801(d)(2)(E) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. In <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171 (1987), the Court held that trial courts \u201cmay examine the hearsay statements sought to be admitted\u201d in determining whether there is sufficient evidence of a conspiracy under Rule 801(d)(2)(E). <em>Id. </em>at 181. Applying the federal interpretation in this case would have permitted the trial court to consider all of Tina Gibney\u2019s otherwise inadmissible hearsay statements in deciding whether there was a conspiracy and whether, therefore, those same statements were admissible into evidence. However, because we hold the conspiracy to have been sufficiently proved by the independent evidence produced by the State, we decline to consider whether Rule 801(d)(2)(E) of the New Hampshire Rules of Evidence is inconsistent with <em>Gilbert </em>and whether the rule should be interpreted as the State suggests in accordance with <em>Bourjaily.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">A substantial amount of independent circumstantial evidence implicated the defendant in a conspiracy to kill Brown by injection of a lethal dose of cocaine. Most damaging is the defendant\u2019s statement to Pettibone that: \u201cIf I had a f \u2014 ing eight-ball of cocaine, I\u2019d shoot him [Brown] up . . . nobody would know nothing.\u201d The defendant concedes in his brief that this \u201cstatement evidences a desire to kill Dennis Brown.\u201d The defendant correctly asserts that \u201cbeing desirous of committing a crime is not a crime.\u201d Nevertheless, we find that it is reasonable to infer that this statement, taken in context with the other evidence produced by the State as set forth below, relates back to a <em>prior agreement </em>between the defendant and his wife to kill Dennis Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The defendant\u2019s stated desire to \u201cshoot him up\u201d should be viewed against the following background of independent evidence. First, Pettibone testified that Tina Gibney had asked him to procure cocaine and the instrumentalities (the \u201cworks\u201d) for injection, and that she had given him money to that end. Tina Gibney\u2019s request is independent evidence because it is, by definition, not hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. N.H. R. Ev. 801(c). Because requests and commands do not assert facts, they cannot be hearsay. <em>See United States v. Gibson, </em>675 F.2d 825, 834 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 972 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Second, Tina Gibney supplied the defendant with money. The defendant immediately told Brown, a known alcoholic, that he would purchase drinks for Brown in Dover. The defendant suggested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Brown drink tequila, which he knew had a particularly potent effect on Brown. There was additional testimony from Pettibone\u2019s girl friend that Tina did not like her husband to go out drinking with Brown, and Brown testified that the defendant had seldom previously purchased him drinks. Third, the defendant, who remained sober while the intended victim \u201cblanked out,\u201d later brought Brown to the Moose Club, where the gathered conspirators would have him under their control.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Fourth, after the defendant expressed his regret that he did not have the \u201ceight-ball of cocaine ... to shoot him [Brown] up,\u201d Pettibone informed the defendant that Tina Gibney had given him (Pettibone) money to procure cocaine, but that he had failed to find any. The defendant gave no indication that this was a surprising revelation. Instead, he questioned Pettibone as to other possible sources of cocaine and whether a possible supplier would sell to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Fifth, the defendant\u2019s expression of a willingness to engage in a fight with Brown was little more than a charade, given that the transcript indicates that Brown was virtually unable to walk or talk. Sixth, the defendant then drove the almost completely helpless Brown to the fairgrounds. Seventh, the defendant expressed to Pettibone that \u201cI\u2019ll do what I gotta do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Some of these events refer to a method of killing other than that charged in the indictment, as the original plan was frustrated by circumstances beyond the control of the conspirators. However, they constitute relevant circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s original agreement with his wife to kill Brown. <em>See State v. Gruber, </em>132 N.H. 83, 93, 562 A.2d 156, 162 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Given the independent evidence described above, and the reasonable inferences therefrom, we find that the State met its burden of making a <em>prima facie </em>case that the defendant and his wife conspired to take the life of Dennis Brown. Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not err in admitting testimony regarding Tina Gibney\u2019s statements because those statements are non-hearsay under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) of the New Hampshire Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b927-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
