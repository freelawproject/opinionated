We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In May, 1981, the defendant, Clayton Elliott, was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and in July of the same year was convicted of operating after suspension of his license, RSA 263:64 (Supp. 1989). When, in 1985, he was charged with operating under the influence, subsequent offense, he informed his lawyer of the first 1981 conviction, but not of the second. His lawyer advised him that driving under the influence was a predicate offense for motor vehicle habitual offender status, and that a third such conviction would render him liable accordingly. When the lawyer later learned of the second 1981 conviction, for operating after revocation, he called it to the defendant\u2019s attention, but failed to advise him that this conviction could also be used to declare him an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The defendant was convicted in a district court on the 1985 charge and appealed to the superior court for trial <em>de novo. </em>Prior to trial, he agreed with the prosecutor, with advice of counsel, to plead guilty to the reduced charge of driving under the influence, first offense. His counsel failed to advise him that this plea would constitute a third predicate conviction, sufficient to subject him to an habitual offender order, RSA 259:39 (Supp. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Following the defendant\u2019s plea and conviction, he was declared to be an habitual offender, was ordered not to drive, and was subsequently charged with operating a motor vehicle in violation of the order. He then moved to withdraw the guilty plea on which his third, 1985, conviction rested, as \u201cnot knowing or intelligent in that he was not fully aware of the consequences of said plea with regard to being declared an Habitual Offender.\u201d The motion was denied. The defendant concedes that even a favorable ruling on his motion could have no effect on the prosecution for violating the habitual offender order, <em>see State v. Grondin, </em>132 N.H. 194, 201, 563 A.2d 435, 439 (1989) (charge of violating habitual offender order not subject to defense by collateral attack on order itself), but he maintains he is entitled to withdraw the 1985 plea for all other purposes. The State does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>generally dispute a defendant\u2019s eligibility to seek leave to withdraw a plea to a charge of a predicate offense, <em>see Grondin, supra </em>at 201, 563 A.2d at 439, but argues that the failure of defense counsel to advise of the plea\u2019s consequences under the habitual offender act, and the defendant\u2019s failure to understand them, do not render the plea subject to withdrawal as unintelligent or involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The defendant\u2019s reference to the standard of voluntary and intelligent guilty plea is an obvious allusion to <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238 (1969), the most notable of the federal cases holding that the fourteenth amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process obligates the trial judge to ascertain on a record basis that the defendant appreciates the circumstances and consequences of such a plea, <em>id. </em>at 242, 245. Accordingly, we understand the defendant\u2019s present claim to be grounded on the fourteenth amendment, and we have no occasion to decide any issue under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\"><em>Boykin, </em>of course, concentrated on the need for judicial inquiry into the defendant\u2019s understanding that a guilty plea waives the privilege against compelled self-incrimination and the rights of confrontation and trial by jury. Although the opinion did not purport to limit the relevant \u201cconsequences\u201d that a defendant must understand to these three waivers, it is now understood that the consequences of which a trial court is bound to assure a defendant\u2019s appreciation before accepting a guilty plea are confined to those that are \u201cdirect,\u201d <em>see Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742 (1970), to the exclusion of those that are merely \u201ccollateral,\u201d <em>State v. Fournier, </em>118 N.H. 230, 385 A.2d 223 (1978); <em>Strader v. Garrison, </em>611 F.2d 61, 63 (4th Cir. 1979); <em>accord Nunez Corvero v. United States, </em>533 F.2d 723, 726 (1st Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The possible significance of a guilty verdict for purposes of the habitual offender act is a classic example of a conviction\u2019s consequence that is collateral, <em>see State v. Fournier supra, </em>in the sense that the consequence requires application of a legal provision extraneous to the definition of the criminal offense and the provisions for sentencing those convicted under it. Thus we have consistently held, that a sentencing court need not advise a defendant about the habitual offender law before accepting a guilty plea to a predicate offense under that law, <em>see State v. Harper, </em>126 N.H. 815, 498 A.2d 310 (1985); <em>State v. Levey, </em>122 N.H. 375, 445 A.2d 1089 (1982); <em>State v. Fournier supra; see also Strader v. Garrison supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>It is clear that we could not follow these cases limiting the scope of the court\u2019s mandatory enquiry and at the same time treat the failure of counsel to give complete advice as a matter to be raised by challenging the voluntariness or intelligence of a plea. For if defense counsel\u2019s failure to advise of collateral consequences could render a plea involuntary and unintelligent, it would follow that the judge before whom a plea was offered would be obliged to enquire whether counsel had given such advice; nothing less would discharge the court\u2019s own responsibility to make a clear record that the defendant\u2019s decision to plead was knowing and voluntary. And to require that enquiry would be tantamount to requiring the court to enquire into the substance of the advice itself, for the court could hardly assure itself that counsel had succeeded in effectively advising of collateral consequences without discussing those consequences with the defendant to ascertain that the defendant knew what the court was asking about. Any such requirement would, of course, be wholly at odds with the line of cases previously cited, limiting a sentencing judge\u2019s responsibility to assuring that the defendant understands the direct consequence of his guilty plea. We adhere, rather, to those cases in concluding that a defendant\u2019s knowledge of collateral consequences is not within the scope of the \u201cintelligent and voluntary\u201d state of mind that must affirmatively be demonstrated to the court before acceptance of a guilty plea. We consequently hold that defense counsel\u2019s failure to advise of collateral consequences, as under the habitual offender law, is no ground for withdrawing a plea as unintelligent and involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In so confining our holding to the issue raised below, we do not, of course, purport to rule on the broader claim expressed in the defendant\u2019s brief, that \u201cin certain circumstances defense counsel\u2019s failure\u201d to advise the defendant of collateral consequences \u201cmay render a plea constitutionally invalid.\u201d Since a defendant is as much entitled to the effective assistance of counsel when entering a plea as on standing trial, <em>see Downs-Morgan v. United States, </em>765 F.2d 1534 (11th Cir. 1985); <em>Strader v. Garrison, </em>611 F.2d at 64, we must recognize at least the possibility that deficiencies in advice about collateral consequences of a plea may pull a lawyer\u2019s representation below the level of \u201creasonable competence\u201d by which effective assistance of counsel is constitutionally measured, <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); <em>State v. Faragi, </em>127 N.H. 1, 4, 498 A.2d 723, 726 (1985). <em>Compare Downs-Morgan v. United States supra </em>and <em>Strader v. Garrison supra </em>(plea open to collateral attack when coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>sel positively misinformed defendant of significant collateral consequence of plea) <em>with State v. Harper, </em>126 N.H. at 821, 498 A.2d at 315 (failure of counsel to advise of plea\u2019s collateral consequence constitutionally irrelevant). (It is well to add that even on the assumption that inadequate advice about collateral consequences would constitute a want of reasonable competence under some circumstances, a defendant would obtain no relief from the consequences of his plea without demonstrating prejudice as well, <em>see Strickland, supra </em>at 694; <em>Faragi, supra </em>at 5, 498 A.2d at 726.) But that is an issue for another day. Here, it is sufficient to say that a request to withdraw a guilty plea on grounds of inadequate advice about the plea\u2019s collateral consequences must be litigated as raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, not as a claim of judicial error in accepting an unknowing and involuntary plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b222-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
