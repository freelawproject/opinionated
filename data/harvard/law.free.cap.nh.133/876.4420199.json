The plaintiff, Portsmouth Advocates, Inc. (Advocates), challenges the Superior Court\u2019s <em>(Nadeau, </em>J.) order upholding the City of Portsmouth\u2019s rezoning of its historic district boundaries to move certain properties from the city\u2019s Historic District A to its less restrictive Historic District B. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">At the center of this dispute is a Portsmouth restaurant owned by Peter Lukas, trustee of the intervenor in this case, B &amp; L Portsmouth Realty Trust. In 1977, the Portsmouth City Council established a historic district, now known as Historic District A, which encompasses most of the city\u2019s downtown area and until recently included Mr. Lukas\u2019s restaurant. The city\u2019s zoning ordinance requires that before proceeding with any new construction on existing buildings in this district, approval from the city\u2019s Historic District Commission (H.D.C.) must be obtained. In 1982, the city council added Historic District B, which borders Historic District A and covers much of the remainder of the central part of Portsmouth. In this district, approval from the H.D.C. is only required for demolitions to the buildings therein, and is not required for new construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">From 1985 until 1987, Mr. Lukas unsuccessfully sought the H.D.C.\u2019s approval for construction of a solarium addition to his restaurant. Instead of appealing the H.D.C.\u2019s denial to the Portsmouth Zoning Board of Adjustment, Mr. Lukas, in early 1987, petitioned the city council to amend the historic district boundaries in order to remove his restaurant from the more restrictive District A. The city council responded by preparing a proposed change in the zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>ordinance and referring the matter to the Portsmouth Planning Board for its recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">The planning board, after a public hearing, recommended against the proposed change, apparently fearing that such an amendment to the zoning ordinance would be characterized as illegal spot zoning. In response to the planning board\u2019s concerns, Mr. Lukas asked the city council to revise the proposed zoning amendment to include seven properties that linked the Lukas property to the boundary between Districts A and B. The city council agreed to the revision and voted to hold a public hearing on the revised proposed amendment. In April 1987, the hearing was held and the council voted to accept the boundary change.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">After failing to persuade the city council to reconsider the zoning amendment, the Advocates, pursuant to RSA 677:4, appealed to the superior court claiming that the rezoning violated RSA 674:46-a, IV (Supp. 1990) (relating to historic districts), and that it represents illegal spot zoning under New Hampshire law. Prior to the hearing on the merits of the appeal, Mr. Lukas, through B &amp; L Portsmouth Realty Trust, intervened and filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of lack of standing. The superior court properly denied the motion, <em>see </em>RSA 677:4, and, in January of 1989, held a hearing on the merits of the Advocates\u2019 appeal. Soon thereafter, the court ruled that the redrawing of the boundaries between Historic Districts A and B was both a proper and a legal exercise of the city council\u2019s powers. It is from this ruling that the Advocates now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The first argument raised by the Advocates is that the rezoning of the two historic districts violated RSA 674:46-a, IV\u00a1 which provides that \u201c[a]ll [historic] districts and regulations shall be compatible with the master plan and zoning ordinance of the city, town, or county in which they exist.\u201d According to the Advocates, this statutory provision prohibits the city council from legislatively revising its historic districts when the change is incompatible with the city\u2019s master plan. Because the Portsmouth Master Plan includes the Lukas property in Historic District A, the Advocates contend that the rezoning violated the statute\u2019s compatibility requirement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">RSA 674:46-a, IV is the final part of a section entitled \u201cPowers and Duties of the Historic District Commission.\u201d This section provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that local historic district commissions have the powers to research and prepare a historic district ordinance for legislative con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>sideration, RSA 674:46-a, I; to establish any applicable regulations, RSA 674:46-a, II; and to administer whatever historic district ordinances and regulations have been established, RSA 674:46-a, III. Nowhere in this section does the legislature discuss the powers and responsibilities of the local legislative body. This discussion takes place in the preceding section of the statute, RSA 674:46, where the legislature directs, without restriction, that it is the city council that has the authority \u201cto establish, change, lay out and define historic districts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, adherence to the defendant\u2019s position that the Portsmouth City Council is legally bound by the city\u2019s master plan would be contrary to what both the legislature and this Court have said about the role of the master plan in New Hampshire. <em>See </em>RSA 674:1, I; RSA 674:2 (Supp. 1990); <em>Rancourt v. Town of Barnstead, </em>129 N.H. 45, 49, 523 A.2d 55, 58 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Viewed in this context, we conclude that RSA 674:46-a, IV\u2019s mandate for ensuring compatibility between a town\u2019s master plan and its historic district is directed to the local historic district commissions in performing their duties, and not to a municipality\u2019s legislative body. Accordingly, the Portsmouth City Council\u2019s boundary change between Historic Districts A and B did not violate the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The Advocates also argue that the trial court erred when it ruled that the redrawing of the boundaries for the purpose of removing the Lukas restaurant from District A did not constitute illegal spot zoning under New Hampshire law. \u201cThe mere fact that the amendment zoned a small area at the request of a single owner does not itself make the result spot zoning.\u201d <em>Edgewood Civic Club v. Blaisdell, </em>95 N.H. 244, 246, 61 A.2d 517, 518 (1948), <em>quoted in Bosse v. Portsmouth, </em>107 N.H. 523, 530, 226 A.2d 99, 105 (1967). Rather, the question to be answered is whether an area has been \u201csingled out for treatment different from that of similar surrounding land which cannot be justified on the bases of health, safety, morals or general welfare of the community and which is not in accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u201d <em>Schadlick v. Concord, </em>108 N.H. 319, 322-23, 234 A.2d 523, 526 (1967), <em>quoted in Treisman v. Town of Bedford, </em>132 N.H. 54, 60, 563 A.2d 786, 789 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">When reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling on a claim of spot zoning, we ask whether its decision is unsupported by the evidence, <em>see Edgewood Civic Club v. Blaisdell supra, </em>or erroneous as a mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>ter of law, <em>see Munger v. Town of Exeter, </em>128 N.H. 196, 198, 512 A.2d 418, 420 (1986). We do this, keeping in mind that the plaintiff carries the burden before the trial court to demonstrate that the rezoning by the city is unreasonable or unlawful. <em>See </em>RSA 677:6.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">After a review of the record, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s ruling was unsupported by the evidence. Although this zoning change clearly was instigated at Mr. Lukas\u2019s request, as noted above, this factor alone does not render the city council\u2019s actions unreasonable. The Advocates assert in their brief, however, that in addition to this factor, there was \u201cno rationale related to any public purpose for the inclusion of the Lukas or other properties within the re-zoning proposal.\u201d This assertion is unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The protection of historic landmarks and areas is a legitimate and recognized exercise of a town\u2019s police powers for the purpose of promoting that town\u2019s general welfare. <em>See Victorian Realty Group v. City of Nashua, </em>130 N.H. 60, 62, 534 A.2d 381, 383 (1987); RSA 674:45. The trial court found, and the Advocates do not dispute, that the eight properties affected by the boundary change are not of historical significance. As the trial court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-7\">\u201cThe Lukas building was built during the 1930\u2019s and it is neither one of the older buildings in Portsmouth nor is it historically significant. Additionally, a Historic District Survey . . . conducted for the City lists most of the structures abutting Lukas\u2019 property as intrusions or noncontributing buildings to the City\u2019s history.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">The Advocates claim, however, that despite the lack of historical importance of these properties, their inclusion originally into Historic District A was a result of the Portsmouth Master Plan, which expresses the community\u2019s long-term development plans and desires. Consequently, according to the Advocates, the rezoning was not in accordance with the town\u2019s comprehensive plan and is therefore invalid. <em>See Bosse v. Portsmouth, </em>107 N.H. at 530, 226 A.2d at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Portsmouth\u2019s master plan was, however, almost a decade old when the city council made the boundary change requested by Mr. Lukas. The master plan serves as guide for the community, and is made up of recommendations for a city\u2019s future development. <em>See Rancourt v. Town of Barnstead, </em>129 N.H. at 48-49, 523 A.2d at 57-58. In this case, pursuant to the recommendations found in its 1980 Master Plan, the city originally adopted historic district boundaries in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>accordance with the 1980 master plan. The plan, however, recognized that the strength of its recommendations, over time, would become diluted. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-4\">\u201c[A]s the Plan attempts to cover a longer period of time, the level of detail of the recommendations must necessarily decrease. The needs, opportunities, and trends of the next five years can be anticipated much more accurately. Consequently, while some of the general policies established may be valid for a long period, most of the content of the Master Plan focuses on the development of the City over the next five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">This language recognizes the need for flexibility in the area of Portsmouth\u2019s long-term development. Thus, contrary to the Advocates\u2019 contention, the city council\u2019s departure from the Plan\u2019s recommended boundaries does not, in and of itself, indicate either that the rezoning was not compatible with Portsmouth\u2019s comprehensive plan or that it was an unreasonable action by the city council. To the contrary, the city council reasonably exercised its powers to adjust historic district boundaries in order to remove buildings lacking historical significance. Accordingly, we affirm the ruling by the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b909-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
