The lawsuit stemmed from an automobile accident involving a vehicle owned and operated by the plaintiff Audrey Blucher and a vehicle owned by the defendant Doris Jean Ekstrom and operated by the defendant Carroll Lee Ekstrom. The plaintiff\u2019s mother, Betty J. Hoyer, was a passenger in the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle at the time of the accident. In Count I of the complaint, the plaintiff sought damages for her own personal injuries based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>theories of negligence and respondeat superior. Count II of the complaint encompassed the same damages but on a theory of negligent entrustment. Count III of the complaint represented a separate claim for different alleged damages based upon the asserted cause of action reflected in the previously quoted certiorari question.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss Counts II and III of the complaint, and a hearing on the motion was held. At the conclusion of the hearing on December 23, 1985, an order was entered on the docket stating: \u201cMotion Granted as to Count 3. Court reserved ruling as to Count 2.\u201d The plaintiff then filed an order of appeal from the order granting the motion to dismiss Count III. On January 28, 1986, the Court of Special Appeals dismissed the appeal, stating that no order had been entered pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602 and that there was no final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">On March 18, 1986, the circuit court signed an order which recited that a motion to dismiss Count II and III had been filed and which went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\u201cORDERED that Count III of Plaintiffs Complaint be dismissed without leave to amend. This Court thus enters final judgment for the Defendant on that Count. \u201cIt is further ORDERED, that this Court will reserve judgment as to Count II of Plaintiffs Complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">A docket entry on the same date contained the same language as the order. The plaintiff on March 27, 1986, filed an order of appeal from the March 18th order.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Next, on April 9, 1986, the circuit court signed the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">\u201cORDER NUNC PRO TUNC AS SUPPLEMENT TO THE FINAL ORDER ENTERING JUDGMENT ON MOTION TO DISMISS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">Upon review of the final Order presented and signed on March 18, 1986, it is, this 9th day of April, 1986,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A92a\">FURTHER ORDERED, that there is no just reason for delay and thereby expressly orders and enters judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>for the Defendant as to Count III of the Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">All other portions of this Court\u2019s previous Order remain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">This order was entered on the docket the following day, April 10, 1986. No order of appeal was filed from the order entered on April 10th. The last order of appeal filed was on March 27, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The plaintiff and the defendants proceeded in the Court of Special Appeals on an expedited basis and an agreed statement of facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreed statement of facts recited that the circuit court\u2019s decision on Count III \u201cwas finalized by Order dated March 18, 1986, in compliance with Maryland Rule 2-602.\u201d The March 18th order was not quoted, and the agreed statement made no mention of the order signed on April 9th and filed on April 10th. The Court of Special Appeals, proceeding on the assumption that it had jurisdiction, affirmed. <em>Blucher v. Ekstrom, </em>68 Md.App. 459, 513 A.2d 923 (1986). As previously mentioned, we then granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Rule 2-602, which was formerly numbered Rule 605 a, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">\u201cRule 2-602. JUDGMENTS NOT DISPOSING OF ENTIRE ACTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">\u201c(a) Generally.\u2014Except as provided in section (b) of this Rule, an order or other form of decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all of the claims in an action (whether raised by original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim or third-party claim), or that adjudicates less than an entire claim, or that adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties to the action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">(1) is not a final judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">(2) does not terminate the action as to any of the claims or any of the parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>(3) is subject to revision at any time before the entry of a judgment that adjudicates all of the claims by and against all of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">(b) When Allowed.\u2014If the court expressly determines in a written order that there is no just reason for delay, it may direct in the order the entry of a final judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">(1) as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">(2) pursuant to Rule 2-501(e)(3), for some but less than all of the amount requested in a claim seeking money relief only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">For a recent discussion of the history of Rule 2-602, <em>see Yarema v. Exxon Corp., </em>305 Md. 219, 232-240, 503 A.2d 239, 246-249 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">None of the trial court orders in the instant case disposed of the action or purported to adjudicate anything other than Count III. Consequently, under the above-quoted language of Rule 2-602(a), none of the orders constituted a final judgment or terminated the action as to any claim unless there was compliance with subsection (b) of Rule 2-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Under subsection (b), a trial court may order the entry of final judgment as to an entire claim<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or party, but less than all claims or parties, if the court in a written order makes an express determination that there is no just reason for delay. In this case, neither the order of March 18, 1986, nor any earlier order contained the trial court\u2019s express determination of no just reason for delay. When the order of appeal was filed on March 27, 1986, there existed no appeal-able judgment in the case. It was not until the trial court\u2019s order dated April 9, 1986, and entered on April 10, 1986, that the express determination of no just reason for delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>was made. Thus, the final judgment with respect to the claim set forth in Count III was entered on April 10, 1986. No order of appeal, however, was filed on or after April 10, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Under a long line of this Court\u2019s decisions, when an order of appeal is filed <em>before </em>the appealable judgment, the order of appeal is of no force and effect. There must still be an order of appeal filed <em>after </em>the appealable judgment to confer appellate jurisdiction. <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. Comm\u2019n v. Crawford, </em>307 Md. 1, 38 n. 17, 511 A.2d 1079 (1986); <em>Director of Fin., Pr. Geo\u2019s Co. v. Cole, </em>296 Md. 607, 614, 465 A.2d 450 (1983); <em>Parkington Apartments v. Cordish, </em>296 Md. 143, 146, 460 A.2d 52 (1983); <em>Institutional Mgt. v. Cutler Computer, </em>294 Md. 626, 630, 451 A.2d 1224 (1982); <em>King v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>294 Md. 236, 449 A.2d 390 (1982); <em>Eastgate Associates v. Apper, </em>276 Md. 698, 350 A.2d 661 (1976); <em>Merlands Club v. Messall, </em>238 Md. 359, 362-363, 208 A.2d 687 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Moreover, in the present case the trial court\u2019s use of the \u201cnunc pro tunc\u201d language in the April 10th order did not make the March 18th order appealable, thereby giving vitality to the premature order of appeal filed on March 27th. If the plaintiff desired appellate review of the dismissal of Count III, she was required to file another order of appeal within thirty days after the entry of judgment on April 10th. <em>See Lewis v. Lewis, </em>290 Md. 175, 181, 428 A.2d 454 (1981) (\u201cthe order of the trial judge under Rule 605 a was entered here <em>after </em>Mrs. Lewis filed her ... order for appeal____ The nunc pro tunc language of the May 27 order was a nullity since it purported to affect that which had already been appealed\u201d); <em>Lang v. Catterton, </em>267 Md. 268, 275-286, 297 A.2d 735 (1972) (same situation as in the present case, and this Court dismissed the appeal). <em>See also Lindsay v. Stemper, </em>166 Md. 257, 261, 170 A. 766 (1934), where the Court commented: \u201cBut obviously the trial court could not confer upon this Court jurisdiction where none existed, nor by the mere use of the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>\u2018nunc pro tunc \u2019 </em>give to an order passed in October the same effect it would have had if passed in June.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">As there was no order of appeal filed in this case from the final judgment dismissing Count III and entered on April 10, 1986, the Court of Special Appeals acquired no appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS' VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO DISMISS THE APPEAL.
