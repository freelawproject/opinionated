Frank Joy Company (Joy) to provide labor and miscellaneous services for several of PEPCO\u2019s power facilities, including the Chalk Point power plant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 29, 1980, Joseph Lathroum (the appellant), an employee of Joy, was working as a laborer in an underground coal hopper at the Chalk Point power plant when he sustained the injury which is the subject of the present lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The record reveals the following facts. During normal operations at the Chalk Point power plant, railroad cars operating at ground level dump coal into the underground hopper for transport to the furnaces. In cold weather, however, some of the lumps of coal may freeze together and lodge up against the walls of the hopper room. On the date in question, the appellant, stationed on a grate inside one of the hoppers, was instructed to clear the hopper by breaking apart the frozen lumps of coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">According to the appellant, each time a railroad car would appear, a PEPCO employee at ground level would sound an alarm and initiate a verbal warning signaling the appellant to move away from the fall area where the coal would be dumped from above. Appellant alleges that while he was performing his coal-breaking responsibilities, certain PEP-CO employees, as part of a joke, negligently dumped coal on appellant without sounding any warning causing serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Subsequently, the appellant and his wife<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed the present tort action against PEPCO<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, PEPCO moved for summary judgment, arguing <em>inter alia </em>that it was the appellant\u2019s \u201cstatutory employer\u201d and therefore the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy was under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d). In response, the appellant denied PEPCO was his \u201cstatutory employer.\u201d He also argued that PEPCO \u201ccontracted away or waived\u201d any immunity afforded under the Act pursuant to its contract with Joy.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>After hearing arguments, the trial court granted PEP-CO\u2019s motion for summary judgment. According to the court, \u201c[tjhere is nothing that has been filed in this case from which even an inference can be drawn that PEPCO was not the [appellant\u2019s] statutory employer.\u201d The court further concluded that PEPCO did not \u201ccontract[ ] away\u201d its immunity under the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judgment was entered on December 5, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In an unreported per curiam opinion (No. 110, September Term, 1986, filed September 29, 1986), the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. We granted appellant\u2019s request for a writ of certiorari. We now reverse the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We begin our analysis with <em>Brady v. Ralph Parsons Co., </em>308 Md. 486, 520 A.2d 717 (1987), which exhaustively reviewed the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d provision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. In <em>Brady, </em>we reiterated that a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d under section 62 of the Act is immune from a suit at law. An injured worker\u2019s exclusive remedy against this statutory creature is under the Act. <em>Brady, </em>308 Md. at 502, 520 A.2d at 726. <em>See State v. City of Baltimore, </em>199 Md. 289, 86 A.2d 618 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Quoting from <em>Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Development Co., </em>278 Md. 453, 365 A.2d 287 (1976) <em>(Honaker I), </em>we outlined in <em>Brady </em>the requirements for qualifying as a \u201cstatutory employer.\u201d There we stated that a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">1) a principal contractor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">2) who has contracted to perform work</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">3) which is part of his trade, business or occupation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>4) who has contracted with another party as a subcontractor for the execution by or under the subcontractor of the whole or any part of such work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><em>Brady, </em>308 Md. at 503, 520 A.2d at 726 (footnotes omitted); <em>Honaker I, </em>278 Md. at 460, 365 A.2d at 291. <em>Accord, Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Development Co., </em>285 Md. 216, 225, 401 A.2d 1013, 1017-18 (1979) <em>(Honaker </em>II); <em>Coffey v. Derby Steel Co., </em>291 Md. 241, 251, 434 A.2d 564, 569 (1981). Elaborating on this scheme, we noted that the statute requires two contracts. The first contract is between \u201cthe principal contractor and a third party whereby it is agreed that the principal contractor will execute certain work for a third party.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>308 Md. at 504, 520 A.2d at 727 (quoting <em>Honaker I, </em>278 Md. at 460, 365 A.2d at 291). This has been referred to as an \u201cantecedent undertaking\u201d or \u201cprincipal contract.\u201d <em>Id., </em>520 A.2d at 727. <em>See Warren v. Dorsey Enterprises, Inc., </em>234 Md. 574, 579, 200 A.2d 76, 78 (1964). The second contract is between the \u201cprincipal contractor and a person as subcontractor whereby the subcontractor agrees to do the whole or part of such work\u201d that the principal contractor agreed to perform for the third party. <em>Brady, </em>308 Md. at 504, 520 A.2d at 727 (quoting <em>Honaker I, </em>278 Md. at 460, 365 A.2d at 291). The work covered by the second contract (i.e., the subcontract) must be work which is a part of the principal contractor\u2019s trade, business or occupation. <em>Id., </em>520 A.2d at 727. <em>See Warren, </em>234 Md. at 578, 200 A.2d at 78; <em>Coffey, </em>291 Md. at 251-56, 434 A.2d at 570-72; <em>Honaker II, </em>285 Md. at 229-32, 401 A.2d at 1019-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Summarizing section 62 in <em>State v. Bennett Building Co., </em>154 Md. 159, 166, 140 A. 52, 54-5 (1928), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFT\">\u201cAlthough acting independently of the other, the principal contractor and the subcontractor, with his worker employed in the execution of the work, were each, in his own separate capacity, co-operating toward the execution of the whole of a particular work which the principal contractor had promised to perform [for a third party].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>See Long Co. v. State Accident Fund, </em>156 Md. 639, 645, 144 A. 775, 778 (1929) (\u201cto create the principal contractor a statutory employer he must have contracted in the first instance to do the work himself, and subsequently sublet the whole or a portion of it to someone else\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The appellant\u2019s principal contention in this appeal is that PEPCO cannot be his \u201cstatutory employer\u201d because there is no \u201cprincipal contract\u201d or \u201cantecedent undertaking\u201d between PEPCO and a third party. In support of this argument, appellant focuses on the various contracts recognized by law and distinguishes between express and implied in fact contracts, and quasi-contracts (or contracts implied in law). According to appellant, the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d provision <em>only </em>contemplates express contracts and implied in fact contracts, whereas the contractual relationship between PEPCO and the public is one implied in law. He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">\u201cThe <em>[Honaker] </em>contract must be express, or at least one implied in fact where there is a real agreement involving the essential elements of contract such as assent, bargain and a meeting of the minds. The quasi-contractual principal of unjust enrichment or remedy for restitution does not apply to agreements deliberately entered into as was intended in <em>Honaker </em>situations by this Court.\u201d (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">While we agree with the appellant\u2019s contention that a principal contract between PEPCO and a third party is absent in this case, we reach our conclusion on somewhat different grounds. Where the appellant focuses on contract law, we prefer to focus on the intent of the legislature. In a long line of cases in this Court beginning with <em>State v. Bennett Building Co. </em>in 1927, we have never remotely recognized the type of relationship PEPCO contends is sufficient to give rise to an \u201cantecedent undertaking\u201d or \u201cprincipal contract.\u201d In our view, the legislature never intended a \u201cprincipal contract\u201d to arise where there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>statutory duty<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the part of a public utility to provide a regulated commodity to the public. Our cases make clear that the \u201cprincipal contract\u201d contemplated by the legislature is one in which a contractor agrees for stated consideration to perform some work or service according to plans, specifications or directions of a third party. <em>See, e.g., Long Co. v. State Accident Fund, </em>156 Md. at 643, 144 A. at 777; <em>State v. City of Baltimore, </em>199 Md. 289, 86 A.2d 618 (1952); <em>Kegley v. Vulcan Rail &amp; Construction Co., </em>203 Md. 476, 478, 101 A.2d 822 (1954); <em>Dorsey Enterprises, </em>234 Md. at 579, 200 A.2d at 78; <em>Honaker I, </em>278 Md. at 460-61, 365 A.2d at 291-92; <em>Brady, </em>308 Md. at 505 n. 22, 520 A.2d at 727 n. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Clearly, PEPCO\u2019s alleged contractual relationship with the public fails to meet this definition. PEPCO is not performing any work or service according to customer specifications or direction; it is merely providing a regulated commodity pursuant to statutorily mandated requirements. If indeed there is a contract in this case, it is more akin to a contract for the sale of a product,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which this Court has concluded is not within the contemplation of the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d provision of the Act. <em>See Roland v. Lloyd E. Mitchell, Inc., </em>221 Md. 11, 18, 155 A.2d 691, 696 (1959); <em>State v. City of Baltimore, </em>199 Md. at 295-96, 86 A.2d at 620-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Our conclusion is in accord with cases from other jurisdictions that have a workmen\u2019s compensation statute similar to our own. <em>See, e.g., Manning v. Georgia Power Co., </em>252 Ga. 404, 314 S.E.2d 432 (1984) (electrical utility is not a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d because it is not acting as a contractor for another entity); <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. Brown, </em>274 So.2d 558 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1973) (same). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number><em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. Brown, </em>for example, the plaintiff was an employee of the T.D. McClure Co. (McClure), an electrical contractor, at the time of the accident involved in that case. McClure was hired as an independent contractor by the Florida Power &amp; Light Co. (FPL) to provide alternate electrical feed to electrical power vaults in order to supply power to a shopping complex, the Pompano Fashion Square. While plaintiff was working in one of the vaults, he touched a terminator thought to be de-energized and received 13,000 volts of electricity. Sustaining serious injury, the plaintiff recovered workers\u2019 compensation from McClure and thereafter brought suit against FPL as the negligent owner of the electrical distribution system. A substantial monetary verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">On appeal, FPL argued that it was immune from suit because it was a \u201ccontractor\u201d [or \u201cstatutory employer\u201d.] under the Florida Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Rejecting this contention, the court concluded that the \u201cnegotiations between the owners of the Fashion Square and F.P.L. did not result in the type of contractual obligation contemplated by the [Workmen\u2019s Compensation] statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561 (citations omitted). Relying on <em>Jones v. Florida Power Corp., </em>72 So.2d 285 (Fla.1954), an identical decision rendered several years earlier by the Florida Supreme Court, the intermediate appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">\u201cOur Supreme Court has noted that in order for a person or company to so qualify as a \u2018contractor\u2019 its primary obligation in performing a job or providing a service must arise out of a contract. The primary obligation of F.P.L., as a public utility, to provide power to its customers in the case before us did not arise out of a contract between the Fashion Square and F.P.L., even assuming such a contract existed.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] F.P.L.\u2019s primary obligation arises out of a statute rather than a contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6ok\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>Brown, </em>274 So.2d at 560 (citations omitted). <em>See Williams v. Pan American World Airway, </em>448 So.2d 68 (Dist.Ct.App.1984) (\u201cPan American is not a \u2018statutory employer\u2019 because its \u2018primary obligation\u2019 in transporting luggage arises not out of its countless individual contracts, that is, the tickets, with its passengers, but from generalized statutory and common law requirements that it do so.\u201d). The Florida court further concluded that the type of antecedent contract covered by the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d provision was one in which \u201cthe contractor agree[d] for a stated consideration to construct an improvement or perform the work in accordance with agreed plans or specifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Luckie, </em>145 So.2d 239 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>148 So.2d 278 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">PEPCO relies on <em>Wyatt v. Potomac Electric Power Co., </em>64 Md.App. 614, 498 A.2d 278 (1985) to support its contention that it was the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d of the appellant. In our view, however, <em>Wyatt </em>provides no support since there was no disputed issue there such as exists in the present case. Moreover, the decision in <em>Wyatt </em>is inconsistent with the conclusion we reach here.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">According to the Court of Special Appeals, the documents in support of, and opposed to, PEPCO\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u201crevealf ] that no genuine dispute was generated in the circuit court regarding the fact that Pepeo has a contractual agreement with the public to provide utility service.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u201cThe only instance where [appellant] disputes the existence of an antecedent or principal contract, other than in his argument to this Court, is in his Supplemental Response to Defendants\u2019 Motions for Summary Judgment. There, he baldly alleges that \u2018[t]here is no contract between Pepeo and some third party____\u2019 This unsworn, unsupported statement is not sufficient to raise a genuine dispute of fact concerning Pepco\u2019s status as a principal contractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We are troubled by these conclusions. First, the court\u2019s statement ignores the appellant\u2019s initial answer to the motion for summary judgment, wherein he clearly stated: \u201cPlaintiff is adamant that PEPCO is not a \u2018contractor\u2019 under the [Workmen\u2019s Compensation] statute. Private corporations furnishing services to the public are required by law to do so and the elements of contract do not exist.\u201d More significantly, our conclusion rests on the idea that whatever contractual relationship may have existed between PEPCO and its customers, it was not the type of relationship that the legislature contemplated when it enacted the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d provision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Therefore, even assuming the absence of a genuine issue of material fact concerning the contractual relationship between PEPCO and the public, PEPCO was not entitled to summary judgment <em>as a matter of law. </em>Md. Rule 2-501(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Since PEPCO does not have a \u201cprincipal contract\u201d or \u201cantecedent undertaking\u201d with a third party, it is not a \u201cstatutory employer\u201d of the appellant under section 62 of the Act. PEPCO stands in no different position than any third party liable to suit at law under section 58. Accordingly, PEPCO was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the circuit court\u2019s entry of summary judgment was improper.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
