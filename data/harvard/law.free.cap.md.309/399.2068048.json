In particular it involves the interpretation of the terms, \u201cany unpaid or accrued expenses,\u201d as used in the voluntary withdrawal provisions of a partnership agreement between certified public accountants. The parties disagree over the applicability of the quoted terms to unfunded obligations to pay, monthly, determinable amounts to retired former partners for ten years after retirement. The trial court, sitting nonjury, concluded that those obligations to retired partners were not \u201cexpenses\u201d under the agreement. Before the appeal was heard by the Court of Special Appeals, we granted certiorari on our own motion. For reasons set forth below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Appellant and defendant below, McLean, Koehler, Sparks &amp; Hammond (the Firm), adopted a written partnership agreement on October 1, 1979.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Howard A. Schnepfe (Schnepfe) became a partner in the Firm on January 1, 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 31, 1984, Schnepfe voluntarily withdrew from the Firm. On that same date another partner retired. The Firm\u2019s statement of changes in financial position as of December 31, 1984, reported that payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>required to be made to retired partners during calendar 1985 would be $68,245, an increase of $28,395 over the figure reported in the balance sheet as of December 31, 1983, for retirement payments to be made during calendar 1984. The Firm\u2019s December 31, 1984, balance sheet also reported $344,209 as the \u201cLong-Term Retirement Liability.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As of the date of Schnepfe\u2019s withdrawal from partnership the Firm\u2019s current (1985) and long-term retirement liability totaled $412,454 on the balance sheet. In accounting to Schnepfe the Firm set off against the amount payable to Schnepfe his partnership percentage of that total retirement liability. Schnepfe, disputing that the set off was authorized under the agreement, brought the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The partnership agreement of October 1, 1979, was prepared within the Firm by a committee of three partners, including Terry W. Weller (Weller), who has been chairman of the Firm\u2019s management committee since 1980. The contract\u2019s format uses catch words or headings in the margin next to each numbered paragraph. Five paragraphs are particularly relevant to the arguments of the parties. Paragraph 10, \u201cEXPENSES,\u201d reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">All expenses, debts, losses or deficiencies which shall be incurred in carrying on the said practice of accountancy shall be paid out of the funds of the partnership. In case of any deficiency thereof, such deficiency shall be paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the partners in the proportion in which they are entitled to share in the net profits of the partnership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Paragraph 12, \u201cBOOKS OF ACCOUNT,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">The books of account will be maintained on a cash basis and all tax returns will be prepared on the same basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8b\">Paragraph 14, dealing with \u201cRETIREMENT,\u201d in relevant part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">[T]he retiring partner shall be entitled to receive the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">(a) ... the balance in the retiring partner\u2019s capital account____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">(b) An annual retirement or death benefit, payable monthly, computed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">(i) The sum of an amount computed as follows: 1V4% of the retiring partner\u2019s average total earnings credited to his capital account for the four year period during which such earnings are the highest multiplied by the lesser of his full years of accredited service to the firm or 25; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">(ii) There shall be added to the amount computed under (i) above 1% of the average total earnings credited to his capital account referred to above multiplied by his full years of service in excess of 25; but in no event will the maximum aggregate annual retirement benefit exceed 40% of said average total earnings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Paragraph 16 states that the retirement payments \u201cwill be for a period of ten (10) years to the retired partner or, in the case of death, to his spouse or estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">\u201cVOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL\u201d is the subject of If 18 which in relevant part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-13\">Upon voluntary withdrawal of a partner, he shall surrender his interest in the partnership and be entitled to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-14\">(a) The balance in the withdrawing partner\u2019s capital account____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-15\">(b) His percentage of accounts receivable on the books at the date of his withdrawal which are collected within two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>years of the date of such withdrawal reduced by his percentage of the recorded value of work in process of clients taken by the withdrawing partner <em>and any unpaid or accrued expenses as of such date. </em>The amounts to be paid under this paragraph shall be paid within thirty days after the end of the fiscal quarter in which such collections occur. Before any moneys are paid to the withdrawing partner pursuant to this paragraph, such withdrawing partner shall make satisfactory arrangements to pay any moneys owing by him to either the partnership or to any other partner or partners. Until all such debts to the partnership or other partners are fully paid, the partnership shall have the right to apply all payments due against such debts without further authorization from the withdrawing partner. Should the obligation for work in process exceed the partner\u2019s share of accounts receivable, that amount shall be reimbursed to the partnership. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The Firm says, and Schnepfe denies, that the $412,454 liability to retired partners as of December 31, 1984, is an \u201cunpaid or accrued expense[ ].\u201d At that time Schnepfe had a \u00cd0.5% interest in the Firm. Applying, or not applying, that percentage to the retirement liability produces a \u201cswing\u201d of $43,307.67. Under the Firm\u2019s interpretation Schnepfe would owe the Firm money. The trial court, adopting Schnepfe\u2019s position, entered judgment in his favor for $36,742.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Schnepfe testified that an \u201c[a]ccrued expense is an expired cost for which you have not received or normally will not receive an invoice.\u201d In reference to the requirement for \u201cbooks of account [to] be maintained on a cash basis,\u201d Schnepfe explained that \u201cto have expenses recorded [they] must be paid,\u201d while under the accrual method \u201cexpenses are recorded whether paid or unpaid.\u201d Schnepfe introduced into evidence the Firm\u2019s computer generated report of income and expense for the month and the eleven months ending November 30, 1984. \u201c[Retirement expense\u201d is listed under the general category \u201cother expenses.\u201d The amount actually paid in November to retired partners was $3,320.90 and the year to date amount paid to retired partners was $36,529.90. Turning to the December 31, 1984, balance sheet and related statements Schnepfe explained that the payments made in 1984 to retired partners were included in the category \u201cother expenses\u201d on the statement of income and partners\u2019 capital. On the balance sheet, the statement of current and long-term liability for retired partners was presented on an accrual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Counsel for Schnepfe read into the record from the deposition of Weller who acknowledged that the expenses referred to in \u00b6\u00b6 10 and 18 of the partnership agreement are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Weller, testifying in the Firm\u2019s case, said that the requirement for cash basis accounting in \u00b6 10 of the partnership agreement was only for tax purposes and that accountants generally accept using an accrual basis for stating the true financial position of an account. Weller said the retirement obligation was an unpaid or accrued expense as of the date of Schnepfe\u2019s withdrawal because the obligation had been carried on the accrual basis balance sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">There had been one prior instance of the withdrawal of a partner under the 1979 Firm agreement, that of Thomas Jess Crouch (Crouch) who withdrew June 30, 1984. Minutes of a Firm meeting of September 4, 1984, reflect that Weller reviewed at that meeting \u201cthe Crouch Settlement Proposal dated August 30, 1984\u201d and that \u201c[t]he partners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>approved the proposed settlement which shows that Mr. Crouch should settle with [the Firm] for a payment to us of $815.00.\u201d The Firm also introduced through Weller a single page tabulation headed, \u201cSecond Revision\u2014Crouch Settlement Proposal\u2014October 18, 1984,\u201d on which appears a computation following the steps of If 18 of the partnership agreement. The exhibit uses Crouch\u2019s percentage of $400,-000 of \u201c[Retirement liability\u201d to compute a deduction from accounts receivable. The exhibit as typed and as revised by $68 in handwriting reflected a balance to Crouch of $3,064.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The circumstances of Crouch\u2019s withdrawal from the Firm are also described in portions of Weller\u2019s deposition read into evidence by Schnepfe\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">Question: As I understand it you, Mr. Weller, were authorized by the partnership to negotiate a financial settlement with Mr. Crouch including an immediate lump sum payment as opposed to the stretched out accounting if you will of the collection of accounts receivable, isn\u2019t that correct? Answer: No, that is predicated on Crouch\u2019s desire to handle it by withdrawal in that manner. Question: He wanted a deposit payment and have it done with, is that correct? Answer: That is correct. Question: And that was a negotiated settlement? Answer: Effectively, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Crouch testified in the Firm\u2019s case. He \u201cwas aware that on the accrual basis financial statements [he] had seen during [his] association with the firm that that number [representing retirement liability] was there.\u201d Crouch further testified, \u201cI believe the treatment of the liability as an accrued expense was consistent with the treatment of that amount.\u201d By a November 6, 1984, letter from Weller for the Firm and countersigned by Crouch on November 26, 1984, the latter accepted $3,064 \u201cin settlement of [his] withdrawal from the partnership effective June 30, 1984.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AlqA\">In their respective legal positions here and in the trial court Schnepfe essentially emphasized \u201cexpenses\u201d while the Firm emphasized \u201caccrued.\u201d Schnepfe contends that the only accrued expenses are those payable, but not yet paid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>as of December 31, 1984. Schnepfe concedes that the amount of his percentage of accounts receivable was properly reduced by the amount of his percentage in those accounts payable as of December 31, 1984, which the court found to have been \u201cincurred in carrying on the said practice of accountancy[.]\u201d (Partnership Agreement, \u00b6 10). The Firm submits that the payments to be made to retired partners are liquidated amounts which were fixed as to liability on December 31, 1984, and which, even in the event of the death of a retired partner, must be made to the retired partner\u2019s estate or spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The trial court, looking at the agreement\u2019s language from the viewpoint of the Firm, ruled that it was \u201cat best\u201d ambiguous. The court in effect said \u201caccrued\u201d meant payable as of December 31, 1984. But the court went on to say that a retirement benefit payment \u201cis not the ordinary type of accounting expense that is referred to in paragraph 10 and Mr. Weller admitted on Deposition an expense in 10 and 18 are the same.\u201d The trial judge explained that he was \u201climiting the retirement liability on the basis principally it is not an expense as defined in paragraph 10[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u201cAccrued expense\u201d in If 18 is indeed ambiguous from the Firm\u2019s standpoint in that we cannot say that the quoted words necessarily include liability to retired partners as reflected on the balance sheet. E. Faris, <em>Accounting for Lawyers, </em>at 39 (rev. ed. 1964) summarizes the concept of expense with the following excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">\u201cExpense in its broadest sense includes all <em>expired costs which are deductible from </em>revenues____ The narrower use of the term expense refers (only) to such items as operating, selling or administrative expenses, interest, and taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">* * * J[8 #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">\u201cWhile the term expense is useful in its broad and generic sense in discussions of transactions and as a general caption in income statements, its use in financial statements is often appropriately limited to the narrower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>sense of the term. [Bold type omitted; emphasis added. Quoting the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Committee on Terminology, <em>Accounting Terminology Bulletins Nos. 2 and </em>4 <em>(reprinted in Accounting Research and Terminology Bulletins </em>(final ed. 1961)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The meaning of \u201caccrued\u201d was addressed in <em>Dryden v. Baltimore Trust Co., </em>157 Md. 559, 146 A. 752 (1929) in the context of a statute which excluded from the estate tax income accrued after the decedent's death. We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQI\">The words \u201caccrue,\u201d \u201caccrued\u201d and \u201caccruing,\u201d in their generally received sense, are used of something which is to be added or attached to something else. In the past tense the word \u201caccrued\u201d is commonly used in the sense of \u201cdue and payable.\u201d <em>\\Id. </em>at 564, 146 A. at 754.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYRq\"><em>Clark v. Seidel, </em>25 Md.App. 139, 333 A.2d 355 (1975), speaking of a note which provided that \u201cinterest ... shall accrue during any such period of moratorium or other action,\u201d stated: \u201cWe can conclude only that the word 'accrue' has no fixed meaning and that what it means in any use depends upon the context and the intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 333 A.2d at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">1A C.J.S. at 134, speaking of the verb \u201cto accrue,\u201d and its parts, \u201caccrued\u201d and \u201caccruing,\u201d says that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amy\">the word, as used in the law, has two meanings; in other words that it is often applied to a present enforceable demand, and that as often, if not more often, it means simply to arise or come into existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">The meaning of the word is dependent somewhat on the facts of each case and the objects to be accomplished either by the statute or contract in which the word is used. [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">It was therefore appropriate for the trial judge to look to the evidence bearing on the intention of the parties. <em>See Pacific Indemnity Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty, </em>302 Md. 383, 389, 488 A.2d 486, 489 (1985); <em>Truck Insurance Exchange v. Mark Rentals, Inc., </em>288 Md. 428, 433, 418 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>A.2d 1187, 1190 (1980); <em>Rice v. Rice, </em>246 Md. 212, 216, 227 A.2d 742, 744 (1967). Weller had equated the meaning of \u201cexpenses\u201d in \u00b6 18 with \u00b6 10. The latter states that \u201c[a]ll expenses, debts, losses or deficiencies which shall be incurred in carrying on the said practice of accountancy shall be paid out of the funds of the partnership.\u201d We read the trial judge\u2019s oral opinion to have found that the \u00b6 10 \u201cexpenses\u201d relate to ordinary operating expenses, as contrasted with \u00b6 10 \u201cdebts.\u201d In the \u00b6 10 context the latter term carries the connotation of a present obligation to pay at a more remote time in the future than expenses would be paid. \u201cDebts\u201d and not \u201cexpenses\u201d is more characteristic of the liability for retirement payments. Accordingly, there is no error in the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The Firm, nevertheless, argues that Schnepfe is legally bound by the interpretation of the partnership agreement utilized in the Crouch settlement. The trial judge, however, was not required to accept the evidence concerning the Crouch settlement as definitive on the interpretation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Minutes of a November 15, 1984, meeting of the Firm, which Schnepfe attended, recite that \u201cMr. Weller distributed a letter to Jess Crouch which spelled out the financial terms of settlement in detail.\u201d The record contains only the November 6, 1984, letter from the Firm to Crouch. That letter does not recite enclosure of the second revised proposal of October 18, 1984. The October 18 tabulation is not directly referred to in the minutes. In any event, Schnepfe testified that Weller handled the settlement with Crouch.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">It is clear from the entire record that the trier of fact gave little weight to the evidence concerning the Crouch settlement. In a veritable barrage of comments from the bench during the trial the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">What Crouch thought about that doesn\u2019t make any difference in what I think about them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>[The set of minutes] doesn\u2019t show that Mr. Schnepfe approved of anything. It does indicate the Minutes show he registered no objection. I think that\u2019s different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">He [Crouch] is here. I guess you can call him. All right. Go ahead. Frankly, I don\u2019t think it makes any difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">How would that [the Crouch settlement] affect this man [Schnepfe]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an estoppel against Schnepfe [referring to there being no objection registered in the minutes by Schnepfe to the Crouch settlement]____ Nor is there any waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The interpretation of an ambiguous contract becomes a question of fact. We cannot say thht the trial judge was clearly erroneous in declining to accord controlling weight to the evidence concerning the Crouch settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\">. The agreement contains a continuation provision by which \"[t]he addition, retirement, withdrawal or removal of any parties to this agreement at any time during its life shall not dissolve or terminate this partnership or create a new partnership in any way.\u201d A. Bromberg, <em>Crane &amp; Bromberg on Partnership, </em>at 419 (1968) points out that where the partnership agreement contains a continuation provision \u201cthe principal consequence of dissolution [namely, forced liquidation] is properly avoided, [so that] it makes little sense to say there is a dissolution, especially where the agreement says there is not. On the other hand, little harm results other than the waste of a concept.\u201d [Footnote omitted.] Thus, we shall use \"Firm\u201d without regard to changes in the number or identity of the persons who continued to carry on the practice of accountancy under the same name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\">. The plaintiffs in the action below were both Howard A. Schnepfe, individually, and Howard A. Schnepfe, P.A. An addendum of January 1, 1983, to the partnership agreement states the professional corporation is the partner in the Firm. In this opinion the term \"Schnepfe\u201d refers either to the individual or to the professional corporation, as appropriate to the context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\">. A footnote to the balance sheet further explains the item, as follows: Long-Term Retirement Liability</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">The partnership agreement provides for retirement payments to partners calculated as specified in the agreement. Any such liability becomes fixed upon the partners reaching age 65 if other requirements are met as stated in the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">The liability included in the financial statements represents the net present value (discounted at 6%) of the balance to be paid by the partnership. The accrued retirement liability is payable in monthly installments ranging from $1,150 to $2,380 over a period of 3\u201410 years. The annual payments required for each of the next five years are as follows: $68,245\u20141985 through 1987; $63,808\u20141988 and $56,933\u20141989.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b446-5\">. The money judgment entered March 31, 1986, did not adjudicate Schnepfe's claim for breach of contract in its entirety. At that time the full payout on accounts receivable for all of calendar <em>1986 </em>was unknown. Schnepfe\u2019s complaint, however, included a claim for a declaratory judgment on the interpretation dispute. He asked the circuit court to determine the amount of the Firm's expenses, within the meaning of \u00b6 18 of the partnership agreement, as of December 31, 1984. The trial court included its declaration of the amount of those expenses in the March 31, 1986, judgment and then certified the judgment under Maryland Rule 2-602(b). As a result the claim for declaratory judgment has been adjudicated in its entirety and the judgment is appealable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
