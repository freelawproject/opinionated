His wife had predeceased him in 1970 and a son, Richard, had died in 1971, leaving one child, Brian. The testator\u2019s will, executed in 1977, contained the following pertinent provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-13\">\u201cFIRST: I hereby direct my Personal Representatives hereinafter named to pay all of my just debts, and funeral expenses____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-14\">SECOND: I bequeath all my personal property to my surviving children to be divided equally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-15\">THIRD: I devise all my real property to my daughter, MIRIAM ELEANOR EMMERT for the term of her life, in trust, to be known as the \u2018TESTAMENTARY TRUST.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-16\">A. The net income from said \u2018TESTAMENTARY TRUST\u2019 shall be divided equally and paid to my surviving children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>D. The said TESTAMENTARY TRUST\u2019 shall terminate upon the death of my daughter, MIRIAM ELEANOR EMMERT, the Trustee and the principal of the Trustf], the remaining real estate or the proceeds from the sale of the real estate, shall be transferred to the TNTERVIVOS TRUST\u2019 established prior to my death____ After said transfer of principal from the said TESTAMENTARY TRUST\u2019 to the said TNTERVIVOS TRUST,\u2019 the Trustee of the TNTERVIVOS TRUST\u2019 ... shall have the absolute power and discretion to sell the transferred real estate and shall then place the proceeds of such sales in the TNTERVIVOS TRUST.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">FOURTH: All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real and personal, of every nature and description, and wherever situate, including any property over which I may have a general power of appointment, I give, devise and bequeath unto the TNTERVIVOS TRUST\u2019....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">At the time of Roberts\u2019 death, his estate was valued at approximately $750,000. Miriam E. Emmert, the testator\u2019s daughter and the personal representative of his estate, filed inventories showing real property appraised at $425,000, tangible personal property worth approximately $2,500, and intangible personal property, including corporate stocks, bonds, and bank accounts, appraised at $324,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">As personal representative, Emmert filed a petition for declaratory relief in the Circuit Court for Carroll County. The petition alleged that the phrase \u201cpersonal property\u201d in Paragraph Second was ambiguous when considered in light of other provisions of the will; that the testator intended the phrase to mean only tangible personal property; that the existence of the residuary clause in Paragraph Fourth indicated the testator\u2019s intention that some portion of his assets would remain and pass under it; that if \u201cpersonal property\u201d were construed to include intangible personal property, then nearly one-half of the testator\u2019s estate would pass under the bequest of Paragraph Second directly to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>surviving children and not into the <em>inter vivos </em>trust under Paragraph Fourth<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; and that such a result would be contrary to the testator\u2019s desire to treat his children and grandchildren equally, as evidenced by the distributive schemes of the <em>inter vivos </em>and testamentary trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The trial court (Nissel, J.) concluded that \u201cin determining the quantity of interest the testator intended to pass and to which beneficiaries the interest is to pass\u201d a latent ambiguity existed as to whether \u201cpersonal property\u201d in Paragraph Second included intangible as well as tangible personal property. The court held that extrinsic evidence was therefore admissible to \u201cclear the ambiguity.\u201d Over objection,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it admitted the testimony of the personal representative, one of the testator\u2019s children, and the deposition of the attorney who drafted the will, all to the effect that the testator intended \u201cpersonal property\u201d in Paragraph Second to mean only tangible personal property. The court found that the words \u201cpersonal property,\u201d as used in Paragraph Second, applied only to tangible personalty and that the intangible personal property passed under Paragraph Fourth of the will into the <em>inter vivos </em>trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, reversed the judgment of the circuit court. It recognized the rule that extrinsic evidence and declarations of intention are permitted to determine the testator\u2019s intention where a latent ambiguity exists in a will. But it found that the words of the will were clear and that no such ambiguity existed. Relying upon our cases, the court said that the words \u201cpersonal property,\u201d without more, include every form of personal property, both tangible and intangible; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>and that where, as here, the will was drawn by an attorney, the words employed must be given their accustomed technical meaning. In so concluding, the court recognized that Paragraph Second created an inequality among the legatees because it excluded a deceased child\u2019s issue from sharing in the distribution of the personal property. It said, however, that it was not free to interpret the will so as to achieve equality among issue, and that because there was no latent ambiguity, the trial court was in error in admitting extrinsic evidence of the testator\u2019s intention. We granted certiorari to consider the significant question raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In construing a will, the paramount concern of the court is to ascertain and effectuate the testator\u2019s expressed intent. <em>Leroy v. Kirk, </em>262 Md. 276, 279, 277 A.2d 611 (1971); <em>Shellady, Inc. v. Herlihy, Ex\u2019r, </em>236 Md. 461, 471, 204 A.2d 504 (1964); <em>Marty v. First Nat\u2019l Bk. of Balto., </em>209 Md. 210, 216, 120 A.2d 841 (1956). The testator\u2019s intent must ordinarily be gathered from the four corners of the will, <em>Reedy v. Barber, </em>253 Md. 141, 148, 251 A.2d 882 (1969), with the words of the will given their \u201cplain meaning and import.\u201d <em>Leroy, supra, </em>262 Md. at 280, 277 A.2d 611; <em>Marty, supra, </em>209 Md. at 217, 120 A.2d 841. However, words having legal significance will be construed in that sense unless the will clearly indicates otherwise. <em>Patchell v. Groom, </em>185 Md. 10, 15, 43 A.2d 32 (1945). But whether the words of the will are given their ordinary or legal meaning,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">\u201c[e]xtrinsic evidence should not be admitted to show that the testator meant something different from what his language imports____ What he meant to say must be gathered from what he did say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-10\"><em>Fersinger v. Martin, </em>183 Md. 135, 138, 36 A.2d 716 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">Looking first to the plain meaning of \u201cpersonal property,\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (1971), p. 1687, defines it as \u201can estate or property other than real property consisting in general of things temporary or mova<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ble including intangible property.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979), p. 1096, defines the term to mean \u201call property other than real estate.\u201d Thus, there is no distinction between the ordinary and the legal meaning of \u201cpersonal property,\u201d both of which encompass tangible and intangible property. Furthermore, the general rule applied consistently in our cases is that, absent some indication from the will to the contrary, bequests of \u201cpersonal property\u201d are to be construed broadly. As we stated in <em>Cameron v. Frazer, </em>187 Md. 368, 50 A.2d 243 (1946):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">\u201c[T]he words \u2018all my personal property,\u2019 without any limiting context, may be all-inclusive; they may include personal property of every kind, tangible or intangible, goods and chattels or choses in action, owned when the will is made or thereafter acquired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 373, 50 A.2d 243. <em>See also Leroy v. Kirk, supra, 262 </em>Md. at 281, 277 A.2d 611; <em>Frick v. Frick, </em>82 Md. 218, 222, 33 A. 462 (1895); <em>Dalrymple v. Gamble, </em>68 Md. 523, 528-29, 13 A. 156 (1888).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">In <em>Dalrymple, </em>for example, the testator bequeathed to a certain legatee \u201call my personal property,\u201d worth about $100 when he executed the will. Between the time of the execution of the will and the testator\u2019s death, a brother of the testator died intestate; the testator\u2019s distributive share of his deceased brother\u2019s personal estate was worth approximately $30,000. We there held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">\u201c[T]he terms in this will, \u2018all my personal property,\u2019 are sufficient to pass the testator\u2019s distributive share of his brother\u2019s estate, unless their obvious meaning, can, upon good and legal grounds be put aside or restricted, and held not to embrace this property. There is however nothing upon the face of the will to enable the court to give it any such restricted construction. The words are as comprehensive as any that could be used. He does not say \u2018my ranch and all my personal property thereon\u2019 nor \u2018all my personal property in California.\u2019 He makes no enumeration of articles, nor any bequest to any one else, so as to give the court the slightest clue or ground for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>relying on the rule <em>\u2018ejusdem generis \u2019 </em>or <em>\u2018noscitur a sociis.\u2019 </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 528-29, 13 A. 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">We have, on occasion, found that the doctrines of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>and <em>ejusdem </em>generis<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may qualify the bequest of personal property so as to render it less than all-inclusive. In <em>Leroy v. Kirk, supra, </em>262 Md. at 283, 277 A.2d 611, we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">\u201c[t]he maxims mean that the meaning of a word is or may be known from the accompanying words so that, under the rules, general and specific words, capable of analogous meaning, when associated together, take color from each other, so that general words are restricted to a sense analogous to less general (citation omitted).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In <em>Leroy, </em>the testator bequeathed \u201call of my personal property, including my automobile, boat and the contents of my house and outbuildings____\u201d We determined that the phrase following \u201cpersonal property\u201d in the bequest restricted it, by example, to tangible personal property. Thus, the bequest did not include stock certificates worth $150,000 that were mailed to the testator\u2019s house shortly before she died. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Cameron v. Frazer, supra, </em>187 Md. at 371, 50 A.2d 243, a provision of the testator\u2019s will left to a hospital \u201cmy home property <em>located </em>at Earlesville, Maryland, including all <em>furniture </em>therein and <em>other </em>personal property <em>located on the premises </em>\u201d (emphasis added in Cameron). We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">\u201cThese limiting words, like the horse, implements and other goods and chattels covered by them are of the earth, earthy. They suggest tangible property, goods and chattels, which have a \u2018local habitation,\u2019 not securities or other choses in action, especially when securities and choses in action are specifically bequeathed in three subsequent items____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 373, 50 A.2d 243. Accordingly, we held that certain savings bonds, bought by the testator after he executed the will and found in a desk drawer in his home, were not part of the personal property passing to the hospital. <em>See also Frick v. Frick, supra, </em>82 Md. 218, 33 A. 462 (clause in will leaving the \u201cbalance of my estate\u201d restricted testator\u2019s bequest of \u201call my personal property\u201d so that it did not include proceeds from the sale of a farm.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Turning to the will at issue here, we find, as we did in <em>Dalrymple, supra, </em>that there is nothing on the face of the will that qualifies or limits the bequest of personal property. There are no examples in Paragraph Second of articles bequeathed by the testator to illustrate the type or nature of the personal property given to the legatees, nor any description or location of the personal property. The personal representative argues that the existence of the residuary clause, whereby \u201call the rest, residual and remainder of ... [the testator\u2019s] estate, real and personal, of every nature and description, and wherever situate\u201d would pass into the <em>inter vivos </em>trust, indicates the testator\u2019s intention to distinguish between tangible and intangible property. However, the residual personal property passing under this clause is no more clearly delineated than is the personal property in Paragraph Second; the phrase \u201cof every nature and description, and wherever situate,\u201d by itself, is simply insufficient to distinguish intangible from tangible personal property. Moreover, residuary clauses are used frequently in wills and serve generally to insure that the testator will not die intestate as to any possible portion of the estate as would occur, for example, if property and interests are not otherwise disposed of, or if bequests or devises fail. <em>See generally </em>4 W. Bowe &amp; D. Parker, <em>Page on the Law of Wills </em>\u00a7\u00a7 33.46-62 (rev. ed. 1961). We must therefore conclude that the language used in Paragraph Second of the will is unambiguous on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">That a latent ambiguity does not exist in the provisions of Roberts\u2019 will is equally clear. Such an ambiguity occurs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>when \u201cthe language of the will is plain and single, yet is found to apply equally to two or more subjects or objects.\u201d <em>Darden v. Bright, </em>173 Md. 563, 569, 198 A. 431 (1938). Extrinsic evidence is generally admissible to resolve a latent ambiguity. <em>Monmonier v. Monmonier, </em>258 Md. 387, 390, 266 A.2d 17 (1970); <em>Bradford v. Eutaw Savings Bank, </em>186 Md. 127, 136, 46 A.2d 284 (1946); <em>Fersinger v. Martin, supra, </em>183 Md. at 138-39, 36 A.2d 716; <em>Darden v. Bright, supra, </em>173 Md. at 569, 198 A. 431; <em>Cassilly v. Devenny, </em>168 Md. 443, 449, 177 A. 919 (1935). Indeed a latent ambiguity is \u201cnot discoverable until extrinsic evidence is introduced to identify the beneficiaries or the property disposed of by will, when it is developed by such evidence, either that the description in the will is defective, or that it applies equally to two or more persons or things.\u201d 4 W. Bowe &amp; D. Parker, <em>Page on the Law of Wills </em>\u00a7 32.7, p. 255 (rev. ed. 1961).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">There is no defective description of the property that passes under Paragraph Second of the will as there was, for example, in <em>Shellady, Inc. v. Herlihy, Ex\u2019r, supra, </em>236 Md. at 470-71, 204 A.2d 504. There, the testator bequeathed 104 shares of Class \u201cB\u201d stock in a corporation. Upon his death, however, it was ascertained that he owned 104 shares of Class \u201cA\u201d stock in that corporation, but no Class \u201cB\u201d shares. The latent ambiguity allowed the admission of extrinsic evidence to clarify the mistake in the property description. <em>See also Home for Incurables v. Bruff </em>160 Md. 156, 153 A. 403 (1931); <em>Scarlett v. Montell, </em>95 Md. 148, 51 A. 1051 (1902); <em>Littig v. Hance, </em>81 Md. 416, 32 A. 343 (1895). There is similarly no indication that the property bequeathed by Roberts applies equally to two or more persons or things. <em>See, e.g., Monmonier v. Monmonier, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>supra, </em>258 Md. at 387, 266 A.2d 17. Moreover, the unequal treatment of the grandchildren resulting from the testator\u2019s intangible personal property passing directly to his surviving children does not, of itself, create a latent ambiguity. As we stated in <em>McCurdy v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>190 Md. 67, 69, 57 A.2d 302 (1948), \u201c[A]n inequality cannot influence a court in its duty to find out what a testator meant by his will____\u201d Although inequality among beneficiaries may be considered when the testator\u2019s intention is uncertain, that is not the situation presented by this case. Extrinsic evidence of the testator\u2019s intent should therefore have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">If the language of the will is clear and no latent ambiguity exists, the court\u2019s role in the construction of the will is at an end. <em>Fersinger v. Martin, supra, </em>183 Md. at 140, 36 A.2d 716. Absent the proffered extrinsic evidence and any indication to the contrary from the will itself that the testator intended anything other than all his personal property to pass under Paragraph Second of his will, we hold that the bequest in that paragraph is all-inclusive. Accordingly, the testator\u2019s intangible personal property will pass to his surviving children and not into the <em>inter vivos </em>trust through the residuary clause of Paragraph Fourth of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\">. The testator established an <em>inter vivos </em>trust in 1971. According to its provisions, the interest or income was to be equally distributed among the testator\u2019s living children. Upon the death of his last surviving child, the trust corpus was to be divided equally among the testator\u2019s grandchildren, <em>per stirpes.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\">. Four of the testator\u2019s children took the position that the language of the will was unambiguous and extrinsic evidence of the testator\u2019s intent was therefore inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-12\">. <em>Noscitur a sociis </em>literally translates as \u201cit is known from its associates,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979), p. 956, and <em>ejusdem generis </em>as \"of the same kind, class, or nature.\u201d <em>Id., </em>33 A. at 464.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b69-6\">. A patent ambiguity is one that is apparent on the face of the will itself, as, for example, when different clauses of a will dispose of the same plot of land to different devisees. <em>See </em>4 W. Bowe &amp; D. Parker, <em>Page on the Law of Wills </em>\u00a7 32.7, p. 255 (rev. ed. 1961). A patent ambiguity must be resolved not from extrinsic evidence, but from the four corners of the will itself. <em>Hawman v. Thomas, </em>44 Md. 30, 31 (1875). That no patent ambiguity exists in this case is conceded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
