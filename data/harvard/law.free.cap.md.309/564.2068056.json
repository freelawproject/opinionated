The petition was dismissed when it was discovered that Ann was pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">A second petition was thereafter filed on March 5, 1985 alleging that Ann was a child in need of assistance (CINA), as defined in \u00a7 3-801(e) of the Courts Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>court, sitting as the juvenile court, adjudicated Ann to be a CI\u00d1A and committed her to the custody of the County Department of Social Services (DSS) until the birth of her child. Ann later absconded from the foster home in which DSS had placed her and returned to her mother\u2019s home. Subsequently, on May 20, 1985, the juvenile court rescinded DSS\u2019s custody of Ann.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On November 5, 1985, the juvenile court (Carter, J.) conducted a hearing to determine whether Ann should remain in the custody of her mother. During the hearing, evidence revealed that Ann continued her frequent unexplained absences from school. The trial judge orally ordered her to attend school regularly in accordance with Maryland\u2019s compulsory school attendance law, Code (1985) \u00a7 7-301(a) of the Education Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also ordered Ann\u2019s mother to require Ann\u2019s regular attendance at school, citing \u00a7 3-827 of the Courts Article as authority for the two orders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Upon learning that Ann continued her absences from school, and thus had violated the juvenile court\u2019s order, Judge Carter cited her for constructive criminal contempt. A hearing was held on February 13, 1986 in the juvenile court before Judge Rasin who found that Ann had \u201cwilfully disobeyed an order of this Court given in an effort to try to get [her] as much education as [she could] to be better able to take [her] place in life.\u201d The judge held that, \u201cas a punishment for [her] contemptuous conduct in failing to go to school as ... directed by Judge Carter [Ann M.] shall be committed to the custody of the Sheriff of Queen Anne\u2019s County for a period of thirty (30) days.\u201d The court then suspended the actual incarceration until such time as Ann failed to attend school without a valid excuse. After Ann\u2019s appeal to the Court of Special Appeals had been filed, but before consideration by that court, we issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion to address the significant question raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Code, \u00a7 l-202(a) of the Courts Article authorizes a court to \u201cexercise the power to punish for contempt of court or to compel compliance with its commands in the manner prescribed by the Maryland Rules.\u201d Subtitle P of Chapter 1100 of the Maryland Rules (1987) applies to both civil and criminal contempts, both direct and constructive, and is expressly applicable to juvenile causes. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 910 e 2. Rule PI a defines a \u201cdirect contempt\u201d as one \u201ccommitted in the presence of the court, or so near to the court as to interrupt its proceedings.\u201d Rule PI b defines a \u201cconstructive contempt\u201d as one \u201cwhich was not committed in the presence of the court, or so near to the court as to interrupt its proceedings.\u201d As our cases indicate, however, the contempt powers of Maryland courts generally exist independent of statute; their power to punish for contempt arises from the common law and is deemed essential for the protection and existence of the courts. <em>See Hitzelberger v. State, </em>173 Md. 435, 196 A. 288 (1938); <em>Ex Parte Sturm, </em>152 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Md. 114, 136 A. 312 (1927); <em>Ex Parte Maulsby, </em>13 Md. 625 (1857); <em>Goldsborough v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 346, 278 A.2d 623 (1971). A criminal contempt arises from a deliberate effort or a wilful act of commission or omission by the alleged contemnor committed with the knowledge that it would frustrate the order of the court; the sanction imposed is punitive and determinate. <em>State v. Roll, </em>267 Md. 714, 730, 298 A.2d 867 (1973). A civil contempt proceeding usually arises upon the complaint of a private person and primarily affords relief to that individual. It is not a separate or independent action but is filed in, and is a continuation of, the original action. The acts complained of do not themselves constitute crimes or conduct by the defendant so wilful or contumelious that the court is compelled to act on its own motion. The sanction imposed for civil contempt is coercive and must allow for purging. <em>Roll, supra, </em>267 Md. at 729-730, 298 A.2d 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">In this case the parties agree that the court treated Ann\u2019s refusal to obey the oral order of the juvenile court as a criminal contempt, a common law offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ann contends, however, that the court had no authority to order her to attend school. She maintains that, although such an order could be an appropriate disposition for a CINS under \u00a7 3\u2014801(f), it was inappropriate and illegal in her case because she had only been adjudged a CINA under \u00a7 3-801(e). She further alleges that, even if the order'was legal, a finding of criminal contempt for disobeying the order is inconsistent with the purposes of the Juvenile Causes Act and with \u00a7 7-301(e)(2) of the Education Article, which provides that parents, not their children, be the party subjected to criminal punishment for a child\u2019s habitual truancy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to the State, however, a juvenile court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>may, pursuant to \u00a7 3-827 <em>{supra, </em>n. 4) of the Juvenile Causes Act, order a child to participate in rehabilitative services that are in the child\u2019s best interests, and failure to obey such an order may constitute a contempt. Both Ann and the State nonetheless agree that the court did not have the authority to impose a 30-day suspended sentence that could result in Ann\u2019s being confined in a penal facility. Ann requests, therefore, that the sentence be vacated; the State suggests that the case be remanded to the juvenile court for the limited purpose of clarifying or modifying its disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The exercise of the contempt power \u201cdemands care and discretion in its use so as to avoid arbitrary, capricious or oppressive application.\u201d <em>State v. Roll, supra, </em>267 Md. at 717, 298 A.2d 867. Moreover, as we indicated in <em>Roll, </em>both as to direct and constructive contempts, \u201cthe limits of the power to punish for contempt are \u2018the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734, 298 A.2d 867 (quoting <em>Harris v. United States, </em>382 U.S. 162, 165, 86 S.Ct. 352, 15 L.Ed.2d 240 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Under the Juvenile Causes Act, no disposition of a juvenile petition, whether of a delinquent, CINA or a CINS, may result in a criminal conviction. \u00a7 3-824. Nor may a juvenile court, in exercising its jurisdiction under the Act, commit a child to an adult penal facility, \u00a7 3-823(a), or in the case of a CINA or CINS, to a facility used to confine delinquent children. \u00a7 3-823(b). While Ann\u2019s conviction for criminal contempt, and her sentence to an adult detention center, were not the result of a disposition of a juvenile petition, the sanction imposed was plainly inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the rationale undergirding these statutory imperatives in the treatment of juveniles. In this regard, we have reminded judges exercising juvenile jurisdiction to bear in mind that juvenile proceedings are of a special nature designed to meet problems peculiar to the adolescent, <em>In re Fletcher, </em>251 Md. 520, 529, 248 A.2d 364 (1968); and that the juvenile law has as its underlying concept the protection and rehabilitation of juveniles, rather than the imposition of punitive sanctions. <em>In re Johnson, </em>254 Md. 517, 255 A.2d 419 (1969).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">While the juvenile court clearly possesses authority to find a juvenile in contempt of court, the exercise of that authority is necessarily tempered by the prevailing philosophy that, absent waiver of juvenile jurisdiction, a child who commits a criminal act should not be stigmatized with a criminal record or otherwise treated as a criminal offender. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. L.E.A. v. Hammergren, </em>294 N.W.2d 705 (Minn.1980), holding that in view of the juvenile statute\u2019s express disapproval of confining juveniles in secure facilities, juvenile courts should not order such confinement for contempt of court unless there is no less restrictive alternative which could accomplish the court\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We think the exercise of the contempt power in this case was not appropriate in the circumstances. Assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>that an order directing a CINA regularly to attend school may properly be entered in a CINA proceeding, we nevertheless think that the juvenile judge should have considered available alternatives to criminal conviction. Indeed, the Juvenile Causes Act expressly contemplates in \u00a7 3-801(f)(l) that a child \u201crequired by law to attend school ... [but who] is habitually truant\u201d be proceeded against by a CINS petition and thus afforded the requisite guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation contemplated by the exercise of CINS jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">We think the court\u2019s failure to first consider the availability of this alternative when dealing with a CINA, and with an alleged indirect contempt of court, constituted an abuse of the court\u2019s criminal contempt power, and our holding in this case is specifically so limited. In so holding, we have considered cases from other jurisdictions involving con-tempts by juveniles, including status offenders like CINS or CI\u00d1A who may have failed to adhere to orders of a juvenile court. Under varying factual circumstances, and diverse juvenile statutes, some courts have held that juvenile judges violated their criminal contempt powers when convicting a juvenile of direct or constructive contempts. <em>See, e.g., In re Mary D., </em>95 Cal.App.3d 34, 156 Cal.Rptr. 829 (1979); <em>In re Ronald S., </em>69 Cal.App.3d 866, 138 Cal.Rptr. 387 (1977); <em>W.M. v. State, </em>437 N.E.2d 1028 (Ind.Ct.App.1982); <em>State in re Bellanger, </em>357 So.2d 634 (La.Ct.App.1978). Other courts, in some circumstances, have upheld criminal contempt convictions for juveniles who disobey juvenile court orders. <em>See, e.g., L.A.M. v. State, </em>547 P.2d 827 (Alaska 1976); <em>In re G.B., </em>88 Ill.2d 36, 58 Ill.Dec. 845, 430 N.E.2d 1096 (1981); <em>In Interest of Darlene C., </em>278 S.C. 664, 301 S.E.2d 136 (1983); <em>see also In the Interest of Tasseing H., </em>281 Pa.Super. 400, 422 A.2d 530 (1980); <em>State v. Norlund, </em>31 Wash.App. 725, 644 P.2d 724 (1982); <em>In the Interest of D.L.D., </em>110 Wis.2d 168, 327 N.W.2d 682 (1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Nothing in these cases, however, dissuades us from the view that Ann\u2019s conviction of criminal contempt was well in excess of \u201cthe least possible power adequate to the end proposed.\u201d <em>Harris v.
