J. Walter Lord and George W.P. Whip were former partners of the petitioner and are now long deceased. Rule 7.5 of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct governs the use of law firm names and forbids those that are \u201cfalse or misleading.\u201d When the Rule was adopted I stated that I did not concur with that portion of the Comment to Rule 7.5 that states: \u201cA firm may be designated ... by the names of deceased ... members____\u201d I believed then that it was false and misleading for a firm to state as part of its name the name of a lawyer who has been deceased for more than five years. My view today is unchanged. I therefore would not grant the certificate of authorization in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
