Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-601 to 12-609 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut has certified questions regarding uninsured motorist coverage required by the Maryland Insurance Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The statement of relevant facts, as set forth by the certifying court, discloses that on July 23, 1979, Kenneth Hoffman purchased an automobile insurance policy from United Services Automobile Association (USAA), with him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>self and his wife Sandra Hoffman as named insureds. The policy was issued in Maryland where the Hoffmans resided and covered two vehicles owned by the Hoffmans. In addition to liability and uninsured motorist coverage, the policy included a \u201cSupplementary Uninsured Motorists\u201d endorsement which amended the definition of \u201cuninsured\u201d vehicle to include \u201cunderinsured\u201d vehicle, and defined \u201cunderinsured\u201d vehicle. The limits under this coverage were $300,000 for each person injured and $500,000 for each accident ($300,000/500,000). For this coverage the Hoff-mans paid a premium that included a separate amount for each of the cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">On July 19, 1980, while in Branford, Connecticut, the Hoffmans were passengers in a car driven by Richard Whelan, a Connecticut resident. A vehicle driven by Richard Nowakowski, also a Connecticut resident, collided with Whelan\u2019s vehicle. As a result of the accident, Sandra Hoffman was killed and Kenneth Hoffman was seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Whelan\u2019s car was insured by a Hanover Insurance Company policy containing underinsured motorist coverage of $50,000/100,000. Nowakowski had insured his vehicle with Travelers Insurance Company, the policy having liability coverage of $20,000/40,000. For purposes of the certified questions of Maryland law, it is assumed that Nowakowski was the underinsured motorist whose low policy limits triggered the underinsured motorist coverage issued by Hanover and USAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Whelan and Kenneth Hoffman, individually and as personal representative of his wife\u2019s estate, sued Nowakowski in Connecticut. On March 17, 1982, the New Haven Superi- or Court, upon agreement by Hoffman, Whelan, Hanover Insurance Co., and Travelers Insurance Co., apportioned Nowakowski\u2019s liability coverage and Whelan\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage. Under the apportionment, the estate of Sandra Hoffman was entitled to receive a full per person limit of $20,000 from Nowakowski\u2019s liability coverage in Travelers and $30,000 from Whelan\u2019s underinsured motorist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>coverage in Hanover ($50,000 per person limit minus the $20,000 paid by Travelers). Kenneth Hoffman was entitled to receive $5,398 from Travelers and $8,379 from Hanover.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Thereafter, Hoffman, individually and as personal representative of his wife\u2019s estate, sued USAA in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut to obtain benefits under the supplementary endorsement relating to underinsured motorists. On March 9, 1984, Hoffman moved for summary judgment. He sought to combine or \u201cstack\u201d the underinsured motorist coverage of the two cars owned by the Hoffmans for total coverage of $600,000/1,-000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">USAA opposed this motion on two grounds of Maryland law. It relied on \u00a7 543(a) of the Maryland Insurance Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which prohibits recovery of uninsured motorist benefits \u201cfrom more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis.\u201d USAA asserted that in light of \u00a7 543(a), as interpreted by this Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hoffman cannot recover any \u201cuninsured\u201d motorist benefits from USAA as the estate has already obtained $50,000 from another insurer, an amount in excess of statutorily required uninsured motorist coverage. USAA also argued that if Hoffman were to recover any amounts under the USAA policy, the language of that policy and Maryland law prohibit \u201cstacking,\u201d and as such USAA\u2019s total exposure would be limited to $300,000/500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In response to USAA\u2019s first argument, Hoffman contended that the coverage he was claiming was issued in addition to the required uninsured motorist coverage and thus was wholly outside of the limits of \u00a7 543(a). In response to USAA\u2019s second argument, Hoffman contended that because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>he paid a separate premium for each vehicle, he was entitled to recover under the insurance provided each vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The United States District Court stayed the motion for summary judgment and certified to this Court the following four questions of Maryland law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\u201c1. Whether Article 48A, \u00a7 543(a) is rendered inapplicable to the plaintiff\u2019s policy because the uninsured motorist coverage is amended by an endorsement providing underinsured motorist coverage as well as uninsured motorist coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">2. Whether intra-policy stacking is permitted, that is, are the plaintiffs entitled to aggregate the underinsured motorist coverage maintained on each of the two vehicles covered by USAA\u2019s single insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">3. Whether standard provisions in the plaintiff\u2019s USAA insurance policy, such as the declarations page, the \u201cother insurance\u201d provision and the \u201climits of liability\u201d provisions, preclude intra-policy stacking, that is, the aggregation of the underinsured motorist coverage on each of the two Hoffman vehicles covered under the single automobile insurance policy issued by USAA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">4. Any and all other attendant questions of Maryland law, the resolution of which is deemed by the Court of Appeals, to be of assistance to this court in the ultimate resolution of this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Section 541(c) of the Maryland Insurance Code requires every motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued in Maryland to have uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $20,000/40,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As this Court said in <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 737, 436 A.2d 465 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>(1981), \u201cthe purpose of uninsured motorist statutes is \u2018that each insured under such coverage have available the full statutory minimum to exactly the same extent as would have been available had the tortfeasor complied with the minimum requirements of the financial responsibility law\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). This mandatory coverage has \u201cthe purpose of providing minimum protection to individuals injured by uninsured motorists.\u201d <em>Yarmuth v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>286 Md. 256, 264, 407 A.2d 315 (1979). Section 543(a) places certain limits on, <em>inter alia, </em>recoveries of the required minimum uninsured motorist benefits under \u00a7 541(c). Section 543(a) in its entirety reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJp\">\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, no person shall recover benefits under the coverages required in \u00a7\u00a7 539 [personal injury protection] and 541 [liability and uninsured motorist coverage] of this article from more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3u\">USAA urges that \u00a7 543(a) be interpreted to apply in cases such as this, where the insured has already recovered from the primary insurer and now is attempting to obtain benefits from a second policy or insurer under policy language like that here involved. Before addressing USAA\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 543(a) precludes any recovery by the estate, however, it would be appropriate to examine the policy provisions and the nature of the \u201cSupplementary\u201d insurance which USAA in fact sold to the Hoffmans.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The declarations page of the Hoffmans\u2019 policy included, among other coverages, bodily injury liability in the amount of $300,000/500,000, property damage liability in the amount of $10,000, comprehensive and collision with a deductible of $250, and uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $300,000/500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The general terms of the uninsured motorist coverage were provided in an endorsement entitled \u201cProtection Against Uninsured Motorists Insurance\u2014Maryland.\u201d This endorsement stated that USAA \u201cwill pay all sums which the insured or his legal representative shall be legally entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured highway vehicle.\u201d Subsequently the endorsement defined an uninsured highway vehicle as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6l\">\u201c(a) a highway vehicle with respect to the ownership, maintenance or use of which there is, in at least the amounts specified in Section 7-101 of Article 66V2 of the Annotated Code of Maryland [$20,000/40,000], neither (i) cash or securities on file with the Administrator of the Department of Motor Vehicles of the State of Maryland nor (ii) a bodily injury and property damage liability bond or insurance policy, applicable at the time of the accident____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">In addition the policy contained a second endorsement entitled: \u201cSupplementary Uninsured Motorists Insurance (Bodily Injury\u2014Property Damage\u2014Limits\u2014Underinsured Motorists).\u201d This endorsement provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201cIt is agreed that, with respect to such insurance as is afforded by the policy for damages because of bodily injury and property damage caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of an uninsured highway vehicle, or an uninsured motor vehicle, subdivision (a) of the definition of \u2018uninsured highway vehicle\u2019 or \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 is amended to include \u2018underinsured highway vehicle\u2019.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Thereafter the endorsement defined an \u201cunderinsured\u201d highway vehicle as a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u201chighway vehicle with respect to the ownership, maintenance or use of which, as respects damages because of bodily injury or property damage or both, the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury and property damage liability bonds and insurance policies respectively applicable to bodily injury or property damage at the time of the accident is less than the applicable limits of liability under this insurance; ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">By the supplementary endorsement, USAA expressly extended coverage from the traditional uninsured motorist situation, defined in the standard uninsured motorist en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>dorsement, to coverage of what in insurance parlance is referred to as an \u201cunderinsured\u201d motorist situation. Underinsured motorist coverage applies when- an insured is involved in an accident with a motorist, who may carry extensive liability insurance far in excess of any amounts statutorily required, but whose liability coverage is less than the insured\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage. <em>See </em>8C Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 5103 (1981); Note, Underinsured Motorist Coverage: Legislative Solutions to Settlement Difficulties, 64 N.C.L.Rev. 1408 n. 4 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Despite the clear policy language, USAA nevertheless contends that \u00a7 543(a) prohibits recovery under this under-insured motorist endorsement because Hoffman has already recovered statutory m\u00ednimums from another insurer. In fact USAA asserted at oral argument that, under Maryland law, there can be no such thing as underinsured motorist coverage. USAA argues that \u00a7 543(a) precludes a supplemental recovery from a second policy when the insured has recovered the statutorily minimum required coverage from a primary policy; therefore, according to USAA, an insurer cannot offer \u201cunderinsured\u201d coverage which purports to provide this supplemental coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">USAA relies on three cases from this Court which have addressed \u00a7 543(a). In <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Benton, </em>278 Md. 542, 365 A.2d 1000 (1976), we applied \u00a7 543(a) to personal injury protection (PIP) benefits mandated under \u00a7 539 in the amount of $2,500. The plaintiff Benton had incurred medical expenses and lost wages in excess of $5,000 as a result of an accident while riding as a passenger in a vehicle owned by Henry Leland and insured by the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF). Benton had recovered $2,500 PIP benefits from MAIF under the required coverage in the policy on Leland\u2019s vehicle. Benton then sought to recover the $2,500 required PIP benefits from Travelers, Benton\u2019s own insurer. Travelers refused to pay, asserting that \u00a7 543(a) limited recovery to the primary coverage carried by the vehicle owner. To resolve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>question of whether Benton could recover from both MAIF and Travelers, we analyzed \u00a7 543(a) and stated (278 Md. at 545-546, 365 A.2d 1000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">\u201cThe coordination of benefits provision contained in \u00a7 543(a) specifies that recovery shall be under one, but not both policies; it says in no uncertain terms that no person shall recover PIP benefits \u2018from more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Accordingly, we held that Benton could not recover an additional $2,500 under the required PIP coverage issued by a second insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In <em>Yarmuth v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., supra, </em>286 Md. 256, 407 A.2d 315, we considered the application of \u00a7 543(a) to uninsured motorist coverage. Albert Starr, his wife, and their son were killed when the car in which they were traveling collided with an uninsured tractor trailer. The vehicle driven by Starr was owned by his employer and insured by the Zurich Group insurance companies. Yarmuth, the personal representative of the Starr estates, recovered the policy limit of $40,000 uninsured motorist benefits from Zurich. As Starr and his family members were named insureds under their own automobile liability policy issued by the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO), Yarmuth thereafter sought $40,000 from GEICO under the required uninsured motorist coverage in that policy. GEICO refused to pay, asserting that \u00a7 543(a) barred recovery from a second insurer. This Court held that the principles of <em>Benton </em>were applicable to the uninsured motorist situation in <em>Yarmuth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">In <em>Rafferty v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>303 Md. 63, 492 A.2d 290 (1985), Maureen Rafferty, while riding as a passenger in a vehicle insured by State Farm, was killed in a collision caused by an uninsured motorist. Two other women traveling with Ms. Rafferty were also killed. Accordingly State Farm, the insurer of the car in which the women were traveling, divided the policy limits of the uninsured motorist coverage among the three estates, each receiving $33,333. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>In addition, Rafferty\u2019s estate sought uninsured motorist benefits from Allstate which had issued a policy to Maureen Rafferty\u2019s father with Maureen as a named insured. This policy insured three vehicles with uninsured motorist coverage of $20,000/40,000 for each vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ms. Rafferty\u2019s estate claimed $26,667 under the Allstate policy, the $60,000 per person limit less $33,333 received from State Farm. In other words, the personal representative of the estate conceded that \u00a7 543(a), as interpreted in <em>Yarmuth, </em>precluded a second recovery of amounts already, received from the primary insurer, but he maintained that a secondary insurer is liable for amounts greater than amounts paid by the primary insurer up to the coverage limits in the secondary policy. Allstate refused to pay, claiming recovery by Rafferty would be \u201csupplemental\u201d and prohibited by \u00a7 543(a). Because Maureen Rafferty\u2019s estate had recovered $33,333 from State Farm, an amount in excess of the $20,000 statutory minimum uninsured motorist coverage, this Court held that \u00a7 543(a) precluded any recovery from Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">While USAA contends that <em>Benton, Yarmuth </em>and <em>Rafferty </em>control the present case, the circumstances in those cases were significantly different from the circumstances of the present case. Although Hoffman is attempting to recover from a second insurer after receiving an amount in excess of required uninsured motorist coverage, the USAA policy did not purport to provide the same coverage as we dealt with in the prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In <em>Benton, Yarmuth </em>and <em>Rafferty </em>the insurance policies in question provided the statutorily required coverage: $2,500 PIP coverage in <em>Benton </em>and $20,000/40,000 uninsured motorist coverage in <em>Yarmuth </em>and <em>Rafferty. </em>USAA, on the other hand, provided coverage in a greater amount ($300,000/500,000) and for a broader scope (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>underinsured situation) than the required uninsured motorist coverage. While there is language in those opinions which may seem to support USAA\u2019s position, it was written in a different context. Accordingly, we do not believe that the decisions in <em>Benton, Yarmuth </em>and <em>Rafferty </em>preclude Hoffman\u2019s recovery under the terms of the <em>underinsured </em>motorist endorsement in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Moreover, the language of \u00a7 543(a) supports a construction of the section whereby an additional recovery under the required minimum uninsured motorist coverage of a second policy is precluded, but a recovery under the optional excess underinsured motorist coverage of a second policy is not precluded. The statute states that \u201cno person shall recover benefits under the coverages <em>required in </em>\u00a7\u00a7 539 and 541 of this article from more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis\u201d (emphasis added). The General Assembly provided that \u00a7 543(a) applies to coverages required in \u00a7\u00a7 539 and 541, and thus the Legislature precluded the application of \u00a7 543(a) to coverages not required in those sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">This reading of \u00a7 543(a) is also consistent with the scheme of required and optional coverages found in \u00a7\u00a7 539 and 541. Section 539 requires minimum personal injury protection in the amount of $2,500; \u00a7 541(a) requires minimum liability coverage in the amount of $20,000/40,000, and \u00a7 541(c) requires minimum uninsured motorist coverage also in the amount of $20,000/40,000. Section 541(b), conversely, states that nothing prevents an insurer from \u201cproviding liability coverage in excess of the [minimum required amounts].\u201d Sections 539 and 541(c) are less explicit but nevertheless contemplate insurers offering higher coverage. Section 539 states that <em>\u201cminimum </em>medical, hospital, and disability benefits shall include up to an amount of $2,500\u201d (emphasis added). Likewise, \u00a7 541(c) states that all motor vehicle liability insurance policies \u201cshall contain coverage, <em>in at least </em>the amounts\u201d of $20,000/40,000 (emphasis added). <em>See Hines v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., </em>305 Md. 369, 373, 504 A.2d 632 (1986) (\u201cClearly, insurers are free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>provide more than the minimum benefits.\u201d) Thus, a statutory scheme that requires all motor vehicle insurance policies to contain certain coverages, but allows other optional coverages, is consistent with construing \u00a7 543(a) as applying only to required coverages. Under USAA\u2019s reading of \u00a7 543(a), however, optional excess personal injury protection or liability or uninsured motorist coverage could not be provided by a second policy. This would be an unreasonable construction of \u00a7 543(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">That the scheme of required and optional coverages contemplates insurers offering the type of supplementary insurance sold to the Hoffmans is even more apparent from amendments to the Maryland Insurance Code enacted since this case initially arose. Two amendments to \u00a7 541, by implication, indicate that \u00a7 543(a) was not intended to preclude recovery under a second policy when that insurer issues \u201cexcess uninsured\u201d or \u201cunderinsured\u201d coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The General Assembly, in Ch. 510 of the Acts of 1981, added \u00a7 541(c)(1), broadening the concept of an uninsured motor vehicle to include any vehicle insured with liability limits in an amount \u201cless than the amount of coverage provided to the insured under this subsection.\u201d The General Assembly also moved former \u00a7 541(c) to \u00a7 541(c)(2) and added to this subpart the requirement that insurers \u201cshall [make] available to the insured the opportunity to contract for higher amounts than those provided under Title 17 of the Transportation Article [$20,000/40,000] if these amounts do not exceed the amounts of the motor vehicle liability coverage provided by the policy.\u201d Furthermore, the General Assembly added \u00a7 541(c)(3) which states that \u201c[t]he limit of liability for an insurer providing uninsured motorist coverage under this subsection is the amount of that coverage less the sum of the limits under the liability insurance policies, bonds, and Securities applicable to the bodily injury or death of the insured.\u201d As explained in a committee memorandum contained in the Department of Legislative Reference\u2019s file on Ch. 510, this amendment makes uninsured motorist coverage operate as underin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>sured motorist coverage. Ch. 510 would be deprived of force, however, by a reading of \u00a7 543(a) that prohibits recovery of uninsured motorist benefits when the insured has received the statutory minimum benefits from another policy or insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">By Ch. 656 of the Acts of 1983, the General Assembly again amended \u00a7 541 by adding subsection (f), which states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u201cPolicies of insurance that have as their primary purpose to provide coverage in excess of other valid and collectible insurance or qualified self insurance may include uninsured motorist coverage as provided in subsection (c) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Section 541(f) clearly allows \u201cexcess uninsured\u201d or \u201cunder-insured\u201d motorist coverage in separate policies issued by the same or another insurer. Like the 1981 amendment, the 1983 amendment would also be deprived of force if \u00a7 543(a) were to prohibit recovery from a second insurer in all cases in which the insured has received the statutorily required coverage. We note that the General Assembly, neither in 1981 nor in 1983, perceived any need to amend \u00a7 543(a) to allow additional coverage. Instead, it is most likely that the General Assembly never intended that \u00a7 543(a) would apply when insurers offer coverage in excess of the coverages required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In <em>State Farm Mut. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>283 Md. 663, 675, 392 A.2d 1114 (1978), we stated that \u00a7 543 was \u201cdesigned to carry out the legislative purpose of prohibiting the duplication of benefits.\u201d To permit recovery in this case, under the supplementary underinsured coverage purchased by the Hoffmans, would not violate that legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The first certified question is answered \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">The second and third certified questions concern whether the plaintiffs can combine or \u201cstack\u201d the coverage limits of the two vehicles covered by the USAA policy when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the insurer charged separate premiums for each vehicle. In this case, because Hoffman and his wife were named insureds under the coverage for each of two cars, stacking would double the policy limits from $300,000/500,000 to $600,000/1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">USAA\u2019s position is that the declarations page of the policy and the limits of liability clause contained in the supplementary uninsured motorist endorsement preclude stacking of the uninsured motorist coverage. USAA\u2019s declarations page sets forth the policy limits for bodily injury in the amounts of $300,000 for each person and $500,000 for each occurrence. In the underinsured motorist endorsement, the limits of liability clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201c(a) the limits so stated as applicable to \u2018Bodily Injury\u2019 shall apply in lieu of any limits therefor stated elsewhere in the policy and, subject to all the terms of the policy having reference thereto, shall be the total limit of the company\u2019s liability for all damages because of bodily injury as the result of any one accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of uninsured highway vehicles or uninsured motor vehicles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Hoffman\u2019s position is that USAA, having charged a separate premium to insure each of the Hoffmans\u2019 vehicles, \u201ccannot seek to erode that coverage through policy exclusions.\u201d Instead, Hoffman contends that because he \u201cpaid twice for the $300,000/500,000 underinsured motorist coverage on each of their two vehicles, [he is] entitled to aggregate those coverages to create a fund from which to recover.\u201d To hold otherwise, Hoffman argues, would render illusory the payment of the second premium in contravention of \u201cboth public policy and the economics of the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Since oral argument, we have decided another uninsured motorist case involving the stacking issue. In <em>Howell v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., </em>305 Md. 435, 505 A.2d 109 (1986), the plaintiff Howell, while driving a truck for his employer Pritchett Transportation Company, Inc., was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>jured in a collision with an uninsured motorist. Howell attempted to collect against Pritchett\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage, and claimed that because Pritchett paid separate premiums for each of 19 fleet vehicles, the total coverage available was $950,000 (19 x $50,000 limit for any one accident or loss). In resolving <em>Howell, </em>this Court examined Pritchett\u2019s insurance policy and pointed out that \u201cItem Two on the declaration page of the policy, entitled schedule of coverages and covered autos, shows under uninsured motorists coverage that the most that will be paid for any one accident or loss is $50,000.\u201d 305 Md. at 437, 505 A.2d 109. We also noted the limit of liability clause in the uninsured motorist endorsement which stated <em>{id. </em>at 438, 505 A.2d 109):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">\u201cRegardless of the number of covered autos, insureds, claims made or vehicles involved in the accident, the most we will pay for all damages resulting from any one accident is the limit of UNINSURED MOTORISTS INSURANCE shown in the declarations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Based on the clear terms of the policy, we held that the maximum Howell could recover was $50,000 and not $950,-000, stating that \u201c[wjhere there is no ambiguity in an insurance contract the court has no alternative but to enforce the policy\u2019s terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 505 A.2d 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The Court in <em>Howell </em>also examined decisions in other states which are virtually unanimous in not permitting stacking of coverage in standard commercial fleet policies. Notably, certain of these decisions pointed out that premiums for multiple vehicle coverage are not illusory but cover added exposure to the insurer. We cited 8C Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice, supra, </em>\u00a7 5101, at 444-451, for an explanation of the added exposure to the insurer (305 Md. at 441-442, 505 A.2d 109):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">\u201cBut, in considering basic underwriting and the actuarial computation of rate structures, we must take into consideration the customary procedures of mankind. Automobile policies are now written so as to afford liability protection not only to the named insured, who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>usually the owner, but to members of his family, perhaps persons residing in the same household, and\u2014with a few exceptions\u2014anyone operating with the permission of the named insured or adult members of his household. When it comes to UM coverages, we have a like multiplication of exposure, since we have classes of risk, including all of the persons stated above, and pedestrians as well, with benefits granted in many circumstances when one may be in another vehicle or even upon the highway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">\u201cWhen the insured then owns more than a single vehicle, almost always it is with the contemplation that the second, or third, vehicles will be operated by others. And those others may, also, if injured by an uninsured motorist, expose the insurer to loss under that aspect of the contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In our opinion, the <em>Howell </em>decision controls the present case. Although the language establishing the policy limits in USAA\u2019s underinsured motorist endorsement is not identical to that used by Harleysville in <em>Howell, </em>it is equally clear in setting limits of coverage. The declarations page provides limits of $300,000 for each person and $500,000 for each occurrence. The endorsement further states that these limits \u201cshall be the total limit of the company\u2019s liability for all damages because of bodily injury.\u201d Notwithstanding Hoffman\u2019s contention that USAA should have plainly stated that aggregation of benefits under this coverage is not allowed, we perceive no ambiguity in the limits of liability clause to which the parties agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We also reject Hoffman\u2019s contention that, when an insured has paid multiple premiums under the circumstances here, public policy and the economics of the transaction require aggregating coverage limits. The Hoffmans\u2019 underinsured motorist endorsement covered the named insureds (Kenneth and Sandra Hoffman), and any other persons while occupying one of the Hoffmans\u2019 two vehicles. With two cars and two drivers, the total miles driven and the number of passengers riding with the Hoffmans was likely to be greater than if the Hoffmans owned only one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>car. Thus USAA, by insuring two vehicles, had greater passenger and mileage exposure than if it had insured only one. The premium on the second vehicle, therefore, was not illusory but paid for the increased risk of added passengers and miles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">In sum, the principles established in <em>Howell v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>preclude stacking the underinsured motorist coverage in this case.
