He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 10 years. The execution of all but 55 days of the sentence was suspended, and he was placed upon conditional probation for a period of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Apparently Chase was not impressed by his good fortune in escaping a lengthy incarceration. A year later he was found to have violated certain conditions of his probation. The court \u201creimposed\u201d the 10 year sentence, gave credit for 250 days served, and again suspended execution of the balance in favor of probation for five years. One of the conditions of this grant of probation was that he \u201cobey all laws.\u201d Chase was still not convinced that he should abide by the conditions upon which he was permitted to stay out of jail nor did he attempt to become a respectable member <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>of society. Less than a year later, he tempted fate again. He was observed by two police officers in an area of considerable narcotic trafficking engaged in what they believed to be a drug transaction. They arrested him and searched him incident to the arrest. Their belief proved to be correct. They seized from his person marijuana, drug paraphernalia and a substantial amount of cash. He was charged with violations of the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act. Chase filed a motion in the criminal cause against him to suppress the evidence seized from him. The court conducted a plenary hearing and granted the motion. It found that the officers did not have probable cause to arrest Chase. Therefore, the warrantless arrest was illegal and the search and seizure incident thereto was repugnant to the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as unreasonable. The exclusionary rule applied to exclude the evidence from the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief at a criminal trial on the merits. The State, in light of this ruling, nol prossed the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">In the meantime the State had filed a petition to revoke his probation for failure to comply with the condition that he \u201cobey all laws,\u201d in that he possessed marijuana and narcotic paraphernalia. It pursued the petition. Chase asked the court \u201cwhether or not [it] will consider the evidence seized at the time of [Chase\u2019s] arrest as the basis of violation of [Chase\u2019s] probation.\u201d The court treated this question as a motion to dismiss grounded on the claim that the challenged evidence was inadmissible at the revocation hearing. The court denied the motion on the basis that the exclusionary rule did not apply, in the circumstances, to bar the evidence at Chase\u2019s revocation of probation hearing. Upon that ruling, Chase ultimately conceded that he had possessed marijuana. The court revoked his probation and the suspension of the execution of the 10 year sentence, suspended all but four years of it, gave credit for 580 days of previous incarceration and placed him once more on conditional probation for a period of five years commencing upon his release from prison. Chase appealed. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment except as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>length of the probationary period, which it ordered be reduced by 408 days, representing probationary time already served. <em>Chase v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 413, 511 A.2d 1128 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We granted Chase\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and our order for the issuance of the writ accepted the two questions presented by Chase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">1) Is evidence that police have seized without a warrant and in violation of [Chase\u2019s] Fourth Amendment rights admissible to prove that he violated a condition of his probation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">2) Must the record of [Chase\u2019s] violation hearing show either that he was present and contested the charges or that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights to be present and to contest the charges?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">The violation of probation hearing consisted of two phases, conducted about three months apart. The first phase dealt with the matter of the admissibility, at the hearing on the merits of the revocation of probation, of the evidence seized from Chase incident to his arrest. This evidence was the foundation of the State\u2019s case, but, as we have seen, it had been suppressed with respect to the criminal cause. The transcript of the suppression phase of the revocation hearing shows that when the case was called, defense counsel informed the court that Chase was \u201cin the lock-up.\u201d The prosecutor thereupon introduced himself to the court, and the transcript immediately thereafter reads, \u201c(Defendant present).\u201d Defense counsel suggested that the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing in the criminal cause surrounding the arrest of Chase be entered in the revocation hearing by way of stipulation. The following stipulation was proffered by the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">If we were to actually present evidence at this hearing the State would show that Private Andrew Pappas and Private Anderson, who is present in the courtroom, on January the 9th, 1985, were in the 7300 block of Haw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>thorne Street in Landover, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, when they saw the Defendant apparently signal to a passing motorist, who stopped his car. They saw apparently something exchanged between the Defendant, who pulled something out of his glove and gave it to a person in the car. The person in the car gave something back to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">Given the nature of the area, that has a high volume of drug transactions that occur in exactly the same manner, they felt that they had just witnessed a drug transaction and decided to apprehend the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">Both officers did apprehend the Defendant. They conducted a search of the Defendant and recovered from him one plastic bag containing 58.6 grams of marijuana; three manila coin envelopes each containing a quantity, a small quantity of marijuana; and ... 125 small empty manila envelopes, and $171 in U.S. currency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">It was further proffered that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiY\">Officer Anderson did not know the Defendant, Jerome Edwin Chase, Jr., prior to this time. He had no knowledge at the time of the apprehension that he was on probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">In fact, the reason for the apprehension was in order to prosecute him for what they believed to be a drug violation at that point in time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Defense counsel expressly agreed to the stipulation and it was accepted by the court. It appears that the stipulation was in accord with the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing in the criminal cause. It was on that evidence that the court ruled that the articles seized from Chase were not admissible to prove the criminal charges against him, prompting the State to enter a nolle prosequi to all criminal charges. At the revocation suppression hearing, counsel argued whether the evidence seized from Chase incident to his arrest was admissible to establish that he had violated a condition of his probation. After due consideration, the court ruled that it was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Following the ruling of the court, the revocation action came on for hearing on the merits. It is at this adjudicatory phase of the revocation hearing that the record is deficient. When the case was called for trial, Gregory Powell, Esq., informed the court that he was \u201cstanding in\u201d for the defense counsel who was trying a case elsewhere. Powell said that he was ready to proceed and that Chase was \u201cin the lock-up.\u201d The court asked: \u201cHe\u2019s coming around?\u201d The Deputy Clerk of the court answered: \u201cYes, I called for him.\u201d There immediately follows in the transcript a question by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">All right, Mr. Powell, you admit or deny the allegations in the petition for violation of probation?.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">There is no indication in the transcript whether Chase was present in the courtroom when the court asked that question and Powell answered, or how much time elapsed between the clerk\u2019s statement that he had called for Chase to be brought from the lock-up and what thereafter followed. Powell answered the court\u2019s question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">For the record, we would like to preserve the right to appeal. We would deny any violation. But I believe we previously stipulated to the facts of the alleged violation. And basically that was, Your Honor, was that we agreed if there had been testimony presented in this case, the police officer would have provided the same testimony that he presented at the suppression hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">And, also, Your Honor, in light of the fact that there is a drug report in the underlying case reflecting that the material seized from Mr. Chase was, in fact, marijuana, we would stipulate that there was marijuana taken from Mr. Chase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">The court said: \u201cBased upon that evidence, I am going to find the defendant in violation of probation.\u201d Defense counsel and the prosecutor entered into a discussion with the court concerning the disposition to be made of Chase. It was at the end of this discussion that the presence of Chase is affirmatively shown by the transcript. The court addressed Chase: \u201cMr. Chase, do you have anything you wish to tell me?\u201d The transcript reads: \u201cThe Defendant: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>No, sir Your Honor.\u201d The court announced its disposition and informed Chase that he had <em>\u201ca </em>right to appeal this judgment of guilt in 30 days; ask me to reconsider it in 90 days.\u201d According to the transcript the case was called at 9:45 a.m. and the proceedings concluded at 9:55 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">No one, including Chase and his counsel, have at any time suggested that Chase was in fact not present when the hearing went forward. Chase\u2019s complaint is simply that the record does not reflect that he was present at all times. We know that Chase was in the courthouse lock-up awaiting the calling of his case and was readily available. We know that the Clerk had \u201ccalled for him.\u201d We know that he was brought to the courtroom. What we do not know from the record is precisely when during the ten minutes it took to dispose of the case he appeared. It stretches credibility to believe that the hearing would have proceeded in the absence of the defendant, particularly after the judge had asked if he was present, without some indication by the court, defense counsel or the prosecutor that Chase was not in court. We are not willing to assume that judges will knowingly not fulfill their sworn obligations, but it is an assumed proposition that \u201cjudges are men of discernment, learned and experienced in the law ...\u201d and that the application of this proposition in the performance of their duties \u201clies at the very core of our judicial system.\u201d <em>State v. Babb, </em>258 Md. 547, 550, 267 A.2d 190 (1970). <em>See State v. Hutchinson, </em>260 Md. 227, 236-237, 271 A.2d 641 (1970). But, although the probability is that Chase had appeared before the court asked defense counsel whether the charges were admitted or denied and that the reporter had inadvertently neglected to include in the record those magic words, \u201cDefendant present,\u201d it is possible, no matter how unlikely in the circumstances, that Chase was not then present. Of course, he was entitled to be present, as a part of the minimal due process applicable to probation revocation proceedings. <em>See Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 488-489, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2603-04, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). So we shall assume that Chase was not present until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>transcript reveals that his presence was recognized, and we look at what occurred during the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">There were no witnesses called. Evidence was presented by stipulation at the suggestion of defense counsel. It was at the express suggestion of defense counsel that the evidence offered by stipulation in the revocation suppression hearing be accepted in the hearing on the merits. It will be recalled that this was the same evidence adduced at the suppression hearing in the criminal cause in the presence of Chase and received at the suppression hearing in the revocation proceedings in the presence of Chase without objection by him. We note that during the suppression phase of the revocation hearing, Chase conceded that he possessed marijuana when arrested. The strategy of the defense at the hearing on the merits was clear. In the words of defense counsel, \u201cWe would like to preserve the right to appeal\u201d the ruling that the evidence seized incident to an illegal arrest was admissible to establish the violation of a condition of probation. Whether or not that evidence was admissible was the only concern of the defense. The State was content to abide by the ruling that the search and seizure were illegal, and, of course, Chase was happy with that ruling. In no event was Chase in a position to refute successfully that he had been arrested, possessed marijuana and paraphernalia and charged with a crime. If the contraband seized was admissible at his revocation hearing, it would establish that he had not \u201cobeyed\u201d the law; if it were inadmissible the charge apparently could not be proved. The tactics to accomplish the strategy were to deny the violation but to stipulate the facts which Chase had twice before conceded rather than expend time and money by requiring the State to prove the charge by the introduction of testimonial and physical evidence which the defense realistically could not refute. The denial of the violation was simply to preserve the appeal on the vital question, and the tactics employed accomplished that strategic objective. What was done in Chase\u2019s assumed absence did not prejudice him one whit. Furthermore, it will be recalled, when the judge asked Chase toward the end of the hearing, \u201cdo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>you have anything you wish to tell me,\u201d Chase answered \u201cno.\u201d There was no indication that Chase was not aware of what had previously occurred, no intimation that he had actually not been present at all times, and no objection of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 438 A.2d 1301 (1981), we modified prospectively the Maryland common law rule of the defendant\u2019s right to be present in a criminal trial. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">Today, with the complexity of many criminal trials and the absolute right of counsel if there is a danger of incarceration, our system proceeds upon the assumption that it is primarily counsel\u2019s function to assert or waive most \u201crights\u201d of the defendant. Unless a defendant speaks out, normally he must be bound by the trial decisions, actions and inactions of counsel. Otherwise, the system simply would not work. <em>Id. </em>at 218, 438 A.2d 1301.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">With respect to all criminal trials, or parts of trials, taking place after the issuance of our mandate in this case, an effective waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to be present at every stage of the trial will not always require a personal waiver by the defendant. Where the right of confrontation is not implicated, and where there is involved no other right requiring intelligent and knowing action by the defendant himself for an effective waiver, a defendant will ordinarily be bound by the action or inaction of his attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">s\u00a1s sH sH * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">[I]f the defendant himself does not affirmatively ask to be present at such occurrences or does not express an objection at the time, and if his attorney consents to his absence or says nothing regarding the matter, the right to be present will be deemed to have been waived. <em>Id. </em>at 219-220, 438 A.2d 1301.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-11\"><em>Cf. State v. Magwood, </em>290 Md. 615, 432 A.2d 446 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">We think that the teachings of <em>Williams </em>are equally applicable to a revocation of probation hearing, which does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>not require the full panoply of rights and safeguards associated with a criminal trial. <em>See Black v. Romano, </em>471 U.S. 606, 105 S.Ct. 2254, 2259, 85 L.Ed.2d 636 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">On the particular circumstances of the instant case, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals, that \u201c[o]n the record, we cannot find any basis for concluding that, to the extent [Chase] was, in fact, not present, his right of presence was not effectively waived.\u201d <em>Chase v. State, </em>68 Md.App. at 418, 511 A.2d 1128. As the Court of Special Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">[Chase\u2019s] right of confrontation was certainly not transgressed, for no witnesses testified against him. It had already been determined that the evidence taken from him was admissible, and the most damaging thing that occurred was his counsel\u2019s stipulation that the substance seized was, in fact, marijuana. But that was never in dispute; indeed at the [previous] hearing, [Chase] stipulated that a bag containing 58.6 grams of marijuana had been seized. <em>Id. </em>at 417-418, 511 A.2d 1128.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">If Chase was not in fact present at the commencement of the proceedings, counsel made no objection then or later. The record is clear that Chase was not absent during the entire hearing, and when he was given the opportunity to speak, he made no objection regarding any lack of presence on his part or to any action by his counsel. \u201cThere is no war between the Constitution and common sense.\u201d <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 657, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1692, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961). In the circumstances here, the Constitution and common sense are not in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">We have an alternative reason for holding that to the extent Chase was not present at the adjudicatory phase of his revocation hearing, his absence does not require reversal of the judgment. In <em>Noble v. State, </em>293 Md. 549, 446 A.2d 844 (1982), we laid to rest the notion that a violation of the right to be present during a stage of a criminal trial can never be harmless. In doing so we overruled <em>State v. Saul, </em>258 Md. 100, 265 A.2d 178 (1970) and disapproved <em>Young v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>State, </em>5 Md.App. 383, 247 A.2d 751 (1968). <em>Noble v. State, </em>293 Md. at 569, 446 A.2d 844. We held flatly that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">the harmless error principle is fully applicable to a defendant\u2019s right to be present during a stage of the trial. Prejudice will not be conclusively presumed. If the record demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the denial of the right could not have prejudiced the defendant, the error will not result in a reversal of his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 568-569, 446 A.2d 844.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">This teaching is also equally applicable to the presence of a respondent at a revocation of probation hearing. The harmless error principle is set out in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">We have made our own independent review of the entire record. In light of the way in which the defense chose to proceed with its case and the reason for proceeding in that manner as shown by the record, we are convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that Chase\u2019s absence in no way influenced the verdict. As we pointed out above, Chase was not prejudiced one whit if he were not present under the circumstances. As we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, to the extent he was not present at the hearing, he was not harmed thereby, the error may be deemed harmless under <em>Dorsey. </em>We so deem it.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">It follows from all of what we have said that, to the extent Chase may not have been present at the revocation of probation hearing, his absence does not require a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In Maryland, the revocation of probation is considered to be a civil proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chief Judge Murphy, speaking for the Court in <em>Howlett v. State, </em>295 Md. 419, 456 A.2d 375 (1983), described a probation revocation proceeding thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">While a probation revocation proceeding relates directly to the criminal case of the substantive offense, the proceeding is not itself a new criminal prosecution; the commission of a crime is not charged and the alleged violation of probation, if established, is not punishable beyond the reimposition of the original sentence imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 424, 456 A.2d 375.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">It may be that the nature of probation revocation procedures in Maryland is not quite as \u201cflexible and informal\u201d as the Supreme Court perceives such procedures to be generally. <em>Romano, </em>471 U.S. at 613, 105 S.Ct. at 2259. See the description of a revocation hearing in <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 779, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1758, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But even if we have gone beyond the constitutional requirements for the conduct of a revocation hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>luminously clear that Maryland, like the Supreme Court, deems that a revocation of probation proceeding is not a stage of a criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is firmly established as a civil action, and, as we have noticed above, the probationer is not cloaked with the full panoply of constitutional rights and procedural safeguards enjoyed by a defendant in a criminal cause, \u201cA person charged with a violation of probation is not, therefore, invested with all the rights constitutionally accruing to a defendant in a criminal prosecution and the hearing is not subject to all the limitations [and procedural safeguards] imposed by law upon a trial leading to conviction.\u201d <em>Howlett, </em>295 Md. at 424, 456 A.2d 375; <em>Romano, </em>471 U.S. at 613, 105 S.Ct. 2259; <em>Gagnon, </em>411 U.S. at 778, 93 S.Ct. at 1756. For example, the admission of a violation of conditions of probation is not restricted as is the acceptance of a plea of guilty to a criminal charge. Rule 4-346(c) declares: \u201cThe provisions of Rule 4-242 [Pleas] do not apply to an admission of violation of conditions of probation.\u201d <em>See also Howlett v. State, supra. </em>A probationer is not entitled to a trial by jury. Moreover, the Supreme Court said in <em>Minnesota v. Murphy, </em>465 U.S. 420, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">Just as there is no right to a jury trial before probation may be revoked, neither is the privilege against compelled self-incrimination available to a probationer. It follows that whether or not the answer to a question about a residential requirement is compelled by the threat of revocation, there can be no valid claim of the privilege on the ground that the information sought can be used in revocation proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">Our cases indicate, moreover, that a State may validly insist on answers to even incriminating questions and hence sensibly administer its probation system, as long as it recognizes that the required answers may not be used in a criminal proceeding and thus eliminates the threat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>incrimination. Under such circumstances, a probationer\u2019s \u201cright to immunity as a result of his compelled testimony would not be at stake,\u201d ... and nothing in the Federal constitution would prevent a State from revoking probation for a refusal to answer that violated an express condition of probation or from using the probationer\u2019s silence as \u201cone of a number of factors to be considered by the finder of fact\u201d in deciding whether other conditions of probation have been violated. <em>Id. </em>at 435 n. 7, 104 S.Ct. at 1146 n. 7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The right of a probationer to confront the witnesses against him is not absolute. The right is lost if the hearing judge \u201cspecifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation.\u201d Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 786, 93 S.Ct. at 1762 (quoting <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604). <em>See State v. Fuller, </em>308 Md. 547, 552, 520 A.2d 1315 (1987). In <em>Dean v. State, </em>291 Md. 198, 202, 434 A.2d 552 (1981), after observing that \u201c[t]he procedural protections afforded a probationer at a revocation of probation hearing are not equivalent to those accorded at a criminal trial,\u201d we said: \u201cFormal procedures and the rules of evidence are not employed.\u201d We made a like statement in <em>State v. Fuller, </em>308 Md. at 553, 520 A.2d 1315 (citing <em>Gagnon </em>as authority) and added that \u201creasonably reliable hearsay may be received.\u201d In <em>Fuller </em>at 552, 520 A.2d 1315, we noted that <em>Scott v. State, </em>238 Md. 265, 208 A.2d 575 (1965), although \u201cdrastically weakened\u201d had \u201cnot been completely overruled\u201d by <em>Morrissey </em>and <em>Gagnon. </em>We said in <em>Scott, </em>238 Md. at 276, 208 A.2d 575:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Add\">The facts presented to or coming to the knowledge of the judge, as to the breach of conditions of probation, need not establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal offenses; all that is required is that the facts before him be such that the judge reasonably could be satisfied that the conduct of the probationer has not been what he agreed it would be if he were given liberty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">acquittal of a probationer of a charge of criminal conduct which was a violation of probation does not preclude revocation of probation, if the judge passing on the question is with reason satisfied that the probationer actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>did that charged in the indictment on which he was acquitted. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We see nothing in the decisions of the Supreme Court which undermines the viability of this part of <em>Scott</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANH\">Even though a revocation of probation proceeding is a civil action, it does result in a loss of liberty. <em>Gagnon, </em>411 U.S. at 782, 93 S.Ct. at 1759. The deprivation of liberty is \u201cnot of the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only of the conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special parole restrictions.\u201d <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 480, 92 S.Ct. at 2600. Both the probationer and the State have a vital interest. <em>Id. </em>The Court spoke to the interest of the probationer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">[T]he liberty of a [probationer], although indeterminate, includes many of the core values of unqualified liberty and its termination inflicts a \u201cgrievous loss\u201d on the [probationer] and often on others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 92 S.Ct. at 2601.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">It discussed the interest of the State and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6y\">[T]he State has an overwhelming interest in being able to return an individual to imprisonment without the burden of a new adversary criminal trial if in fact he has failed to abide by the conditions of his [probation]. <em>Id. </em>at 483, 92 S.Ct. at 2601.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">It follows that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">[t]he [probationer] is not the only one who has a stake in his conditional liberty.

Bryan, </em>284 Md. 152, 159 n. 6, 395 A.2d 475 (1978). This is so because since \u201cthe liberty [of the probationer] is valuable [it] must be seen as within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 482, 92 S.Ct. at 2601.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees as to State prosecutions that no person shall be deprived of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes procedural and substantive limits on the revocation of the conditional liberty created by probation.\u201d <em>Romano, </em>471 U.S. at 610, 105 S.Ct. at 2257 <em>(citing Bearden v.

Inasmuch as it is clear that due process applies to revocation of probation proceedings, \u201cthe question remains what process is due.\u201d <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 481, 92 S.Ct. at 2600. The precise question before us is whether the admission at the adjudicatory phase of a revocation of probation hearing of evidence seized incident to an illegal arrest is fundamentally unfair and thereby offensive to due process of law. In considering the question, we are aware that the Supreme Court emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afs\">there is no thought to equate [the adjudicatory] stage of [probation] revocation to a criminal prosecution in any sense. It is a narrow inquiry; the process should be flexible enough to consider evidence including letters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">We have no thought to create an inflexible structure for [probation] revocation procedures. <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 489-490, 92 S.Ct. at 2604.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">It follows that the mere fact that the evidence sought to be admitted at the revocation hearing was suppressed as illegally seized at the criminal trial of Chase provides, in itself, no sound reason to exclude it at his revocation hearing. Nor, as we have seen, does the fact that Chase was not convicted of the criminal charges arising from the evidence, render the evidence inadmissible at his revocation hearing. We are also mindful of the wide range of constitutional rights and procedural safeguards, listed <em>supra, </em>which are available to a defendant in a criminal cause but are denied a probationer in a revocation hearing without violating due process. This leads us to the bottom line, whether, for process to be due, the exclusionary rule adopted with respect to the search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment must be applied in revocation of probation hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated____\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">It is a rule of the common law that the admissibility of evidence is not affected by the illegality of the means by which it is obtained. Despite indication in <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 635, 6 S.Ct. 524, 535, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886), that the use of evidence illegally obtained by federal officials was \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d the rule was generally followed by the courts throughout the first decade of this century. Early in 1914, the Supreme Court decided <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>For the first time, the Court held that \u201cin a federal prosecution the Fourth Amendment barred the use of evidence secured through an illegal search and seizure.\u201d <em>Wolf v. Colorado, </em>338 U.S. 25, 28, 69 S.Ct. 1359, 1361, 93 L.Ed. 1782 (1949). The Court \u201chas ever since required of federal law officers a strict adherence to that command____\u201d <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 648, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1688, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961). Thirty-five years after <em>Weeks, </em>the Court, again for the first time, discussed the effect of the Fourth Amendment upon the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. But, although it declared that the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment was enforceable against the states through the due process clause and announced that it \u201cstoutly adhere[d]\u201d to the <em>Weeks </em>decision, the Court \u201cdecided that the <em>Weeks </em>exclusionary rule would not then be imposed upon the states as \u2018an essential ingredient of the right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mapp, </em>367 U.S. at 650, 81 S.Ct. at 1689 (quoting <em>Wolf, </em>338 U.S. at 29, 69 S.Ct. at 1362). In <em>Irvine v. California, </em>347 U.S. 128, 139, 142, 149, 74 S.Ct. 381, 386, 388, 392, 98 L.Ed. 561 (1954), the Court expressed the hope that the states would adopt the federal exclusionary rule. But it took until 1961 for the Court to appreciate that its hope was largely unrealized. So it settled the issue itself. It flatly declared in <em>Mapp, </em>367 U.S. at 655, 81 S.Ct. at 1691:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">We hold that all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">In a revealing opinion in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), the Court discussed the exclusionary rule and a number of its decisions concerning it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It laid to rest the notion that the exclusion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ary rule is a necessary corollary of the Fourth Amendment or that the rule is required by the conjunction of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">The Fifth Amendment theory has not withstood critical analysis or the test of time ... and the Fourth Amendment \u201chas never been interpreted to proscribe the introduction of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 906, 104 S.Ct. at 3411 (quoting <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 486, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 3048, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">It declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">The Fourth Amendment contains no provision expressly precluding the use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands, and an examination of its origin and purposes makes clear that the use of fruits of a past unlawful search or seizure \u201cworks[s] no new Fourth Amendment wrong.\u201d <em>Leon </em>468 U.S. at 906, 104 S.Ct. at 3411 (quoting <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 354, 94 S.Ct. 613, 623, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">It explained, in the words of <em>Calandra, </em>at 348, 94 S.Ct. at 620, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">[t]he rule thus operates as \u201ca judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.\u201d <em>Leon </em>468 U.S. at 906, 104 S.Ct. at 3412.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">It noted that its decisions made clear that whether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case is \u201can issue separate from the question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 223, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2324, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">The imprimatur of the Supreme Court on the application of the exclusionary rule has been confined to criminal trials, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>and within those trials, to the prosecution\u2019s case in chief on the merits of guilt or innocence. Standing to invoke the rule has been limited to cases in which the prosecution seeks to use the fruits of an illegal search or seizure against the victim of the police misconduct. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 910, 104 S.Ct. at 3413-14. However, \u201c[e]ven defendants with standing to challenge the introduction in their criminal trials of unlawfully obtained evidence cannot prevent every conceivable use of such evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Evidence inadmissible in the state\u2019s case in chief as secured in violation of the Fourth Amendment may be used to impeach a defendant\u2019s direct testimony. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Walder v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 62, 74 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed. 503 (1954) and other cases). And such evidence may be used to impeach statements made by a defendant in response to proper cross-examination reasonably suggested by the defendant\u2019s direct examination. <em>Leon </em>468 U.S. at 910, 104 S.Ct. at 3414 (citing <em>United States v. Havens, </em>446 U.S. 620, 627, 100 S.Ct. 1912, 1916, 64 L.Ed.2d 559 (1980)). The <em>Leon </em>opinion pointed out that the Court, when considering the use of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief; had declined to adopt a per se or \u201cbut for\u201d rule that would render any evidence that came to light through a chain of causation that began with an illegal arrest. <em>Id. </em>468 U.S. at 910-911, 104 S.Ct. at 3413-14 (citing <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975)). The Court has also held that a witness\u2019 testimony may be admitted even when his identity was discovered in an unconstitutional search. <em>Leon </em>468 U.S. at 911, 104 S.Ct. at 3414 (citing <em>United States v. Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. 268, 98 S.Ct. 1054, 55 L.Ed.2d 268 (1978)). And in cases not involving the scope of the rule itself, the rule has been held inapplicable. Thus, the Court has not required suppression of the fruits of a search incident to an arrest made in good-faith reliance on a substantive criminal statute that subsequently was declared unconstitutional. <em>Leon </em>468 U.S. at 911-912, 104 S.Ct. at 3414 (citing <em>Michigan v. DeFillippo, </em>443 U.S. 31, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979)). In <em>Leon </em>itself the Court held that \u201cevidence seized by officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>reasonably relying on a warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate ... should be admissible in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief,\u201d even though the warrant was later found to be defective. <em>Id. </em>468 U.S. at 913, 104 S.Ct. at 3415. And we note that this Court, in <em>Logan v. State, </em>289 Md. 460, 486, 425 A.2d 632 (1981), concluded that ordinarily the exclusionary rule \u201cdoes not extend to the sentencing stage of a criminal cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u201cIn the complex and turbulent history of the [exclusionary] rule, the Court has never applied it to exclude evidence from a civil proceeding, federal or state.\u201d <em>United States v. Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 447, 96 S.Ct. 3021, 3029, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046 (1976). The Court explained this statement in the light of forfeiture proceedings in a footnote 17 in 428 U.S. at 447, 96 S.Ct. at 3029:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">The Court has applied the exclusionary rule in a proceeding for forfeiture of an article used in violation of the criminal law. <em>Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, </em>380 U.S. 693, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (1965). There it expressly relied on the fact that \u201cforfeiture is clearly a penalty for the criminal offense\u201d and \u201c[i]t would be anomalous indeed, under these circumstances, to hold that in the criminal proceeding the illegally seized evidence is excludable, while in the forfeiture proceeding, requiring the determination that the criminal law has been violated, the same evidence would be admissible.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 701, 85 S.Ct., at 1251. See also <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 634, 6 S.Ct. 524, 534, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886), where a forfeiture proceeding was characterized as \u201cquasi-criminal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In our revocation of probation proceedings the revocation is \u201cnot a penalty for the criminal offense,\u201d even though the new criminal offense may be the basis for the revocation. <em>See Howlett v. State, </em>295 Md. at 424, 456 A.2d 375. The revocation is a civil action to determine whether the probationer is to remain on probation, not to punish his conduct for which probation may be revoked. <em>Cf. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1038, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 3483, 82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>L.Ed.2d 778 (1984). For further support that <em>Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania </em>provides no sound basis for applying the exclusionary rule to civil or administrative proceedings, <em>see </em>W. LaFave and J. Israel, <em>Criminal Procedure, </em>\u00a7 3.1(g). There it is pointed out that the courts which hold that the exclusionary rule applies in forfeiture proceedings rely on <em>Plymouth\u2019s </em>reasoning that the rule applies to proceedings which are \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d in that their object is to penalize for the commission of an offense against the law and could result in even greater punishment than the criminal prosecution. We iterate that this is not the situation in our revocation of probation proceedings. So it was that the Supreme Court confirmed in <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 909, 104 S.Ct. at 3413, that \u201c[proposed extensions of the exclusionary rule to proceedings other than the criminal trial itself have been evaluated and rejected____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The Court has held that a state prisoner who has been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim may not obtain federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that unlawfully obtained evidence had been introduced at his trial. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 909, 104 S.Ct. at 3413 (citing <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. at 489-495, 96 S.Ct. at 3050-3052). The Court declined to allow grand jury witnesses to refuse to answer questions based on evidence obtained from an unlawful search or seizure. <em>Leon, id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 348, 94 S.Ct. at 620). And it has permitted the use in federal civil proceedings of evidence illegally seized by state officials. <em>Leon, id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 96 S.Ct. 3021, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046). On the same day that <em>Leon </em>was decided, the Court held that the exclusionary rule did not apply in a deportation proceeding, a civil action, to bar the admission of the respondent\u2019s admission of illegal entry after an illegal arrest. <em>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The Supreme Court has not had squarely before it the question whether the exclusionary rule applies to probation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ary revocation proceedings. But its evaluation and rejection of the application of the rule to proceedings other than the criminal trial itself leads to a logical conclusion that, consistent with its other decisions, the rule would not generally apply to our revocation proceedings. We have learned, however, that it is not prudent to speculate about what the Supreme Court may do down the road, and we look for further support for our view.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The exclusionary rule is a remedial device and, accordingly, its application \u201chas been restricted to those areas where its remedial objectives are thought to be most efficaciously served.\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 908, 104 S.Ct. at 3413 (quoting <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 348, 94 S.Ct. at 620, and citing <em>Powell, </em>428 U.S. at 486-487, 96 S.Ct. at 3048-49 and <em>Janis, </em>428 U.S. at 447, 96 S.Ct. at 3028). \u201cClose attention to those remedial objectives has characterized [the Court\u2019s] recent decisions concerning the scope of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Leon, id. </em>Although, from time to time, various notions have been advanced as to the purpose of the rule, the Court \u201chas established that the \u2018prime purpose\u2019 of the rule, if not the sole one, \u2018is to deter future unlawful police conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Janis, </em>428 U.S. at 446, 96 S.Ct. at 3028 (quoting <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 347, 94 S.Ct. at 619, and citing <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>422 U.S. 531, 536-539, 95 S.Ct. 2313, 2317-2318, 45 L.Ed.2d 374 (1975)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">The rule is calculated to prevent, not to repair. Its purpose is to deter\u2014to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way\u2014by removing the incentive to disregard it. <em>Elkins v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 206, 217, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Accord, <em>Mapp, </em>367 U.S. at 656, 81 S.Ct. at 1692; <em>Tehan v.

In sum, the rule is a judicially created remedy with a broad deterrent purpose, designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>through its deterrent effect. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 348, 94 S.Ct. at 620. \u201cJurists and scholars uniformly have recognized that the exclusionary rule imposes a substantial cost on the societal interest in law enforcement by its proscription of what concededly is relevant evidence.\u201d <em>Janis, </em>428 U.S. at 448-449, 96 S.Ct. at 3029. In determining the application <em>vel non </em>of the rule in particular circumstances, the Supreme Court has adopted a balancing test. It weighs the costs and benefits of suppressing reliable physical evidence seized by officers, and this analytic approach has marked all of its decisions on the subject. We pointed out <em>supra </em>the interests of both the probationer and the State in revocation of probation proceedings. In making the decision whether to revoke probation the court must balance the competing interests of the community in safety with the rehabilitative goals of probation. Almost all of the federal courts have refused to exclude, in probation revocation proceedings, evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure. See cases collected in Annot., 30 A.L.R. Fed. 824 (1976 and October 1986 Supp.). A substantial majority of the state courts concerned with the \u201cadmissibility, in state probation revocation proceedings, of evidence obtained through illegal search and seizure,\u201d have generally held that evidence so obtained is admissible. See cases collected under that title in Annot., 77 A.L.R.3d 636 (1977 and August 1986 Supp.). The Court of Special Appeals referred to <em>Thompson v. United States, </em>444 A.2d 972 (D.C.1982), which quoted <em>United States v. Winsett, </em>518 F.2d 51 (9th Cir.1975), as illustrative. <em>Chase, </em>68 Md.App. at 423, 511 A.2d 1128. <em>Thompson, </em>noting <em>Winsett\u2019s </em>belief that \u201cit is extremely important that <em>all reliable </em>evidence shedding light on the probationer\u2019s conduct be available during probation revocation proceedings,\u201d 518 F.2d at 55 (emphasis in original), declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">In determining whether to apply the exclusionary rule to probation revocation proceedings we must weigh the potential benefit\u2014deterrence of police misconduct\u2014which would result against the potential harm to the function of the probation and probation revocation system that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>result from the exclusion of relevant evidence. 444 A.2d at 974.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><em>Thompson </em>followed the conclusion of \u201c[t]he majority of jurisdictions ... that the deterrence which would result from applying the exclusionary rule in this context is outweighed by the need of the sentencing court for full and accurate information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hence the majority have \u201cheld the exclusionary rule inapplicable to probation revocation proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Most of the law review articles, treatises and commentaries concerned with the exclusionary rule in this context appear to be in tune with the majority of the courts. <em>See, e.g., </em>W. LaFave and J. Israel, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 3.1(g) (1985), 1 W. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 1.7 (2d ed. 1987); 1 W. Ringel, <em>Searches and Seizures, Arrests and Confessions, </em>\u00a7 3.6(d) (2d ed. 1986); Cole, <em>The Exclusionary Rule in Probation and Parole Revocation Proceedings: Some Observations on Deterrence and the \u201cImperative of Judicial Integrity\", </em>52 Chi.-Kent L.Rev. 21 (1975); Note, <em>The Exclusionary Rule in Parole Revocation Hearings: Deterring Official Infringement of Parolees\u2019 Fourth Amendment Rights, </em>1979 B.Y.U.L.Rev. 161 (1979); Note, <em>The Exclusionary Rule in Probation and Parole Revocation: A Policy Appraisal, </em>54 Tex.L.Rev. 1115 (1976); Note, <em>The Exclusionary Rule and Probation Revocation Proceedings, </em>11 Val.U.L.Rev. 149 (1976); Note, <em>The Exclusionary Rule in Probation Revocation Hearings, </em>19 Wake Forest L.Rev. 845 (1983). We are convinced by our scanning of such works that the holding of the majority of the courts that the exclusionary rule does not apply to revocation proceedings is the correct one; and we are not persuaded otherwise by the rationale of the minority of the courts and scholars who favor the application of the rule to such proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">So it is that we adopt the following general rule: In revocation of probation proceedings, the exclusionary rule does not apply to bar evidence illegally seized by the police from the probationer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>We adopt this general rule because we are satisfied that the prime purpose of the rule\u2014to deter police misconduct\u2014 would not be fulfilled by applying it to such proceedings. We are confident that its application would be subversive of the goals of the probation system. The harm to that system would far outweigh the marginal deterrent effect, if there be any at all by applying the rule. We find that our view is amply supported. It reflects the rationale of the decisions of the Supreme Court. It is in accord with the holdings of the majority of the courts in other jurisdictions, federal and state. It is in harmony with the better reasoned conclusions of the scholars.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We have seen that the validity of a revocation of probation proceeding is governed by the precepts of due process of law. Given compliance with those basic precepts outlined by <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 488-490, 92 S.Ct. at 2603-2605, and <em>Gagnon, </em>411 U.S. at 786, 93 S.Ct. at 1761 <em>(see Romano, </em>471 U.S. at 609-612, 105 S.Ct. at 2257-2558), and given that the police have illegally seized evidence from a probationer, we adopted <em>a general rule </em>that due process of law does not require that such evidence be suppressed at a revocation of probation hearing. In other words, the exclusionary rule does not ordinarily apply in such circumstances. \u201cWhere the official action was pursued in complete good faith ... the deterrence rationale loses much of its force,\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 919, 104 S.Ct. at 3418, <em>Michigan v. Tucker, </em>417 U.S. 433, 447, 94 S.Ct. 2357, 2365, 41 L.Ed.2d 182 (1974), <em>Peltier, </em>422 U.S. at 542, 95 S.Ct. at 2320, and the rule we have adopted serves to admit the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Inherent in the characterization of our rule as a \u201cgeneral\u201d one is the recognition that in particular circumstances the conduct of the police may be such as to call for the application of the exclusionary rule in revocation proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">The deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in willful, or at the very least negligent, conduct which has deprived the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>defendant of some right. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 919, 104 S.Ct. at 3418 (quoting <em>Tucker, </em>417 U.S. at 447, 94 S.Ct. at 2365, which was reiterated in <em>Peltier, </em>422 U.S. at 539, 95 S.Ct. at 2318).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Therefore, when the officer has acted in bad faith and not as a reasonable officer would and should act in similar circumstances, the evidence should, in any event, be suppressed. Cf<em>. Powell, </em>428 U.S. at 539-540, 96 S.Ct. at 3073.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We are not willing to assume that every time a person subjected to what ultimately is held to be an illegal search and seizure by a police officer proves to be on probation, that the officer acted in bad faith. We observe that police officers who violate the constitutional rights of citizens are subject to both state and federal penalties, and we note that such police officers are further subject to civil liabilities. In today\u2019s litigious climate, that is no idle threat. Cole postulates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">Since it is highly improbable that a particular suspect is a probationer, it is abundantly clear that the likelihood that constitutional police conduct will be fruitful is infinitely greater than is the likelihood that unconstitutionally obtained evidence will ever actually be available for use at a revocation hearing. 52 Chi.-Kent L.Rev. at 36-37.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Accordingly, Cole posits,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">it cannot realistically be supposed that a police officer, no matter how venal he may be, will refrain from obeying the law, thereby losing vital case-in-chief evidence, in the vain hope that in exchange he may obtain evidence which can only be used \u201cshould it subsequently appear that the victim of such conduct was a [probationer].\u201d The contrary arguments blink reality. <em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_p\">On the other hand, however, we did not adopt a rule that evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure was per se admissible in revocation proceedings because we thought that it would derogate due process of law to presume conclusively that in such cases the police officer acted in good faith. Our rule affords the probationer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>opportunity, upon due challenge, to establish that the officer, in fact, acted in bad faith, and gives the State the opportunity to establish that the officer, in fact, acted in reasonable good faith. The fact is to be resolved, of course, by the hearing judge on a preponderance of the evidence. \u201cGood faith\u2014bad faith\u201d in this context is not an esoteric concept. <em>Leon </em>and its progeny have deemed the good faith standard to be relevant and workable in relation to the exclusionary rule, and applied it. Thus, our general rule that the exclusionary rule does not apply to revocation of probation proceedings is modified to permit its application upon a showing that the police did not act in good faith in effecting the search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The question remains how this showing is to be made. The Court of Special Appeals notion was that because it accepted as a general proposition that the exclusionary rule should not apply to revocation proceedings, the burden should be on the probationer to produce evidence showing a lack of good faith. <em>Chase, </em>68 Md.App. at 426, 511 A.2d 1128. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">Once the [probationer] produces sufficient credible evidence that the officer did not act in good faith, however, the State must rebut that evidence and bear the burden of persuading the court that there <em>was </em>good faith. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The intermediate appellate court thought that such an \u201capproach ... makes the rule both fair and reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>So do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Evidence concerning the officer\u2019s conduct which would be sufficient to call upon the State to rebut is credible evidence indicating <em>prima facie </em>to the satisfaction of the hearing judge that the officer\u2019s actions were not in accord with reasonable law enforcement activities but were prompted by improper motives. As the Court of Special Appeals pointed out, the standard of good faith \u201cencompasses all aspects of the officer\u2019s actions\u2014how egregious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the violation was, whether the officer knew the person was on probation or parole, what the circumstances were that led to the seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is clear in <em>Leon </em>that good faith must be evaluated on an objective, not a subjective basis. It declares that the exclusionary rule should not be applied \u201cto deter <em>objectively </em>reasonable law enforcement activity.\u201d 468 U.S. at 919, 104 S.Ct. at 3418 (emphasis added). <em>Leon </em>notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">We emphasize that the standard of reasonableness we adopt is an objective one. Many objections to a good-faith exception will turn on the subjective good faith of individual officers. \u201cGrounding the modification in objective reasonableness, however, retains the value of the exclusionary rule as an incentive for the law enforcement profession as a whole to conduct themselves in accord with the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n. 20 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">As we understand Chase\u2019s argument, he does not contend that the evidence found to have been illegally seized was prompted by bad faith on the part of the police. His basic claim, which we have rejected, is that the exclusionary rule applied in any event to revocation of probation proceedings. He urges that \u201ca good faith standard can be justified only where the initial probable cause determination is made by a neutral and detached judicial officer.\u201d It is correct that, thus far, the Supreme Court has invoked the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule only when the police acted under color of a search warrant or a statute. But we repeat that the exception has been so considered only in the frame of reference of the State\u2019s case-in-chief at a criminal trial. We see nothing in <em>Leon </em>and its progeny which forestalls our view of the role good faith may play in the application of the exclusionary rule <em>vel non </em>to revocation proceedings when the sanctity of such proceedings are at stake and the purposes of probation are a vital consideration. A good faith evaluation of the officer\u2019s conduct, as we have pointed out, is in no wise restricted to his subjec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>tive belief that he acted on probable cause, and the motives behind his actions may be objectively determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In any event, as is our obligation when the infringement of a fundamental right is involved, we have made an independent constitutional appraisal of the entire record. We do not believe that the admission of the challenged evidence was fundamentally unfair, and thus due process of law was not thereby affronted. We see no sound reason why our general rule\u2014that in revocation proceedings, the exclusionary rule does not apply to suppress evidence secured in violation of the Fourth Amendment\u2014should not be invoked. We see no. lack of good faith on the part of the officers in the circumstances here. Whether there was probable cause for Chase\u2019s arrest was a close call, at least arguable. One of the arresting officers not only did not know that he was on probation, but did not know him at all. There was no intimation that the other arresting officer knew Chase or was aware that he was on probation. There was no suggestion that the officers had theretofore harassed Chase. In short, there was no indication whatsoever that the arrest, search and seizure of Chase were other than a bona fide attempt to engage in proper law enforcement activity. We have seen that it was stipulated that the evidence would show that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">[i]n fact, the reason for the apprehension was in order to prosecute [Chase] for what [the officers] believed to be a drug violation at that point in time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">This belief was objectively understandable. The arrest was not an arbitrary action but a rational response, in no way invidiously motivated, to the situation facing the officers at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">We hold that the revocation hearing court did not err in refusing to apply the exclusionary rule and that the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals were not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">.
