For the reasons herein expressed, we hold that, in Prince George\u2019s County, the purchaser of a dwelling house constructed in violation of the building code is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>proper party to serve with a notice of violation after title has passed from the vendor to the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The facts are not in dispute. In 1977, Gerald Passnault commenced construction of a single family dwelling in Prince George\u2019s County pursuant to a building permit issued by the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Licenses and Permits (Department). The house, originally intended as a residence for Passnault\u2019s daughter, was eventually placed on the market for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">While the house was still under construction, Passnault entered into an executory contract for the sale of the property with Bill and Carolyn Bryant, the present owners, in November, 1978. On June 14, 1979, following the standard series of interim approvals and inspections, the Department issued a certificate of use and occupancy. It is at this point that exact dates are difficult to extract from the record but it is clear that sometime in 1979, after the use and occupancy permit was issued, Passnault conveyed title to the property to the Bryants.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Shortly after the Bryants moved in, at some later time in 1979, they became aware of water leakage in the house. It appears that the Bryants initially complained about the roof leakage to Passnault and that Passnault, in response to their complaint, attempted to remedy the problem on at least one occasion in the early 1980s. Sometime thereafter, the Bryants, still dissatisfied, recontacted Passnault who refused further assistance. In December, 1988, the Bryants called the Department and requested that the Department dispatch a building inspector to investigate the leakage problem. The building inspector subsequently issued three notices of violation of the Prince George\u2019s County Building Code, all of which were served on Passnault. These notices cited Passnault with violations of two model codes, the CABO One &amp; Two Family Dwelling Code and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>BOCA Building code, which are adopted and incorporated by reference in the Prince George\u2019s County Building Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The first notice of violation, a field notice dated June 18, 1984, cited Passnault with a violation of \u00a7 R-803, \u201cComposition Asphalt Organic Felt Shingles,\u201d of the CABO One &amp; Two Family Dwelling Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The notice read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u201cNails holding roof shingles are too short and flashing of roof improperly installed, causing leaks and rot in roof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Upon Passnault\u2019s failure to take any corrective action pursuant to the notice, the Department issued a second notice of violation. The second notice, dated July 16, 1984, charged Passnault with violating four provisions of the BOCA Basic Building Code: \u00a7 854.4.4 \u201cNailing\u201d; \u00a7 854.8.3 \u201cAsphalt Shingles\u201d; \u00a7 854.9 \u201cFlashing\u201d; and \u00a7 926.6 \u201cShingle Application\u201d.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Again, Passnault took no action, and a third notice of violation was issued. The third notice, an office notice dated July 18, 1984, cited Passnault with a violation of \u00a7 R-803 of the CABO One &amp; Two Family Dwelling Code, as did the first field notice. The office notice contained the text of \u00a7 R-803 and directed Passnault to take the following corrective action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-4\">\u201cProperly install flashing on roof. Lengthen nails holdong [sic] roof shingles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Passnault challenged the aforementioned notices in an appeal to the Board of Administrative Appeals for Prince George\u2019s County. The Board, in affirming the notices of violation, concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">\u201c1. The roofing and flashing were improperly installed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">2. The contractor is responsible for installing the roof and flashing correctly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">3. Petitioner [Passnault] was the contractor listed on the permit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">4. Petitioner is responsible for having the roof and flashing deficiencies corrected, repaired and/or replaced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Passnault appealed the decision of the Board and the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County affirmed. The Circuit Court, noting that limitations do not run against a municipality for an exercise of a purely governmental function, held that \u201cthere is jurisdiction in the Prince George\u2019s County government to enforce the housing code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>An appeal to the Court of Special Appeals followed and that court affirmed in an unreported, <em>per </em>curiam, opinion. The intermediate appellate court determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\">\u201cNothing in [the BOCA and CABO Codes] limits the authority of the Department to issue a notice of violation of the provisions of those codes to a builder who has received a certificate of use and occupancy from the Department after its inspections of a completed building or after it is sold. Nor is there any validity to the appellant\u2019s assertion that since the building inspectors of the Department failed to discover the violations prior to the Department\u2019s issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the dwelling, the Department is estopped from issuing the violation notices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We granted the petition for writ of certiorari to determine whether the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Licenses and Permits has the authority to serve a notice of violation on the vendor or builder of a dwelling house constructed in violation of the building code and compel the vendor or builder to abate the violation some five years after the dwelling was constructed and sold to a third party. We hold there is no such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Subtitle 4, entitled \u201cBuilding,\u201d of the Prince George\u2019s County Code (County Building Code) adopts and incorporates the 1984 BOCA Basic Building Code (BOCA Building Code).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> P.G. County Code, \u00a7 4-101 (1983, 1984 Supp.). Likewise, the County Building Code adopts and incorporates the 1983 CABO One &amp; Two Family Dwelling Code (CABO Code).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4-108.1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The BOCA Building Code is a national model regulatory construction code which provides detailed minimum standards for safe practices, materials and systems of construction. The code covers such subjects as \u201cBuilding Enclosures, Walls and Wall Thickness,\u201d \u201cStructural Loads and Stresses,\u201d \u201cFire Resistive Construction Requirements,\u201d and \u201cPlumbing Systems.\u201d It further includes general provisions relating to administration and enforcement. The regulations of the BOCA Building Code \u201ccontrol all matters concerning the construction, alteration, addition, repair, removal, demolition, use, location, occupancy and maintenance of all buildings and structures, and shall apply to existing or proposed buildings and structures.\u201d BOCA Building Code \u00a7 100.2 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The CABO Code is a compilation of data from several model codes, including the BOCA Building Code, designed to standardize building requirements of detached one and two family dwellings. The CABO Code is \u201cto be used in interpreting the requirements of the [BOCA Building] Code as they pertain to one- and two- family dwellings.\u201d P.G. County Code, \u00a7 4-108.1 (1983, 1984 Supp.). The provisions of the CABO Code \u201capply to the construction, prefabrication, alteration, repair, use, occupancy and maintenance of detached one or two family dwellings not more than three stories in height, and their accessory structures.\u201d CABO One &amp; Two Family Dwelling Code, \u00a7 R-103 (1983). The significant distinction between the BOCA Building Code and the CABO Code, for purposes of this appeal, is that the provisions of the BOCA Building Code apply to all buildings and structures whereas the provisions of the CABO Code apply to one and two family dwellings.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>The enforcement provisions of the BOCA Building Code and CABO Code are representative of the enforcement provisions in similar local regulatory schemes both in Maryland and in other jurisdictions, <em>see, e.g., </em>9A McQuillin, <em>Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 26.200 <em>et seq. </em>(1986); IB Matthews, <em>Municipal Ordinances </em>\u00a7\u00a7 37.01-37.06 (1986 Rev.), and are set forth in full at Appendix A and B. The basic pattern of the enforcement mechanism is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">1. that it is an unlawful act to erect, construct, use, occupy, maintain, etc., a structure contrary to the specifications of the code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">2. that such an unlawful act is a public nuisance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">3. that such an unlawful act is a misdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">4. that the building official has two avenues of enforcement, namely, he or she may issue a notice of violation and compel the wrongdoer to abate the unlawful action, or he or she may bring a civil suit to enjoin the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The single provision which addresses service of notice of violation is contained in the BOCA Building Code at \u00a7 117.2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB1\">\u201cThe building official shall serve a notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the erection, construction, alteration, extension, repair, removal, demolition, use or occupancy of a building or structure in violation of the provisions of this code, or in violation of a detail statement or a plan approved thereunder, or in violation of a permit or certificate issued under the provisions of this code. Such order shall direct the discontinuance of the illegal action or condition and the abatement of the violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">The preliminary matter presented by the case <em>sub judice </em>concerns the application of the various codes to the present facts. The Department served three notices of violation on Passnault. The first and third notices cited violations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>CABO Code and the second cited violations of the BOCA Building Code. While the substance of the three notices is the same (that the nails holding down the roof shingles were too short and that the flashing was of insufficient weight), the record is silent as to why the building inspector issued the second notice pursuant to the BOCA Building Code where the alleged violations related to the construction of a single family dwelling house.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">It is well settled that where there is a specific enactment and a general enactment, and the general enactment includes what is embraced in the former, the particular enactment is operative and the general enactment governs only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the specific enactment. <em>See Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Casualty v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>302 Md. 248, 268-69, 487 A.2d 271, 281-82 (1985) and cases cited therein. It follows that Passnault is being held to answer for an alleged violation of \u00a7 R-803 of the CABO Code. Accordingly, the instant case is governed by the specific provisions of the CABO Code as they relate to one and two family dwellings, and the general provisions of the BOCA Building Code, not in conflict with the specific provisions of the CABO Code, as they relate to all buildings and structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The essential issue is whether the Department has the authority to compel the vendor or builder of a dwelling house constructed in violation of the County Building Code to abate the violation some five years after the property is sold to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Passnault\u2019s basic argument is that the Prince George\u2019s County Housing Code (County Housing Code),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> rather than the County Building Code, governs the instant case. Passnault contends that once the Department has issued a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>certificate of use and occupancy, the Department\u2019s authority to issue a notice of violation for a subsequently discovered violation is derived from the County Housing Code. Because a notice of violation of the County Housing Code is properly served upon the \u201cowner or occupant\u201d of a non-compliant structure, P.G. County Code \u00a7 13-114 (1983, 1984 Supp.), Passnault reasons that the Department is without authority to compel him to abate the violation five years after he conveyed the property to the present owners. Passnault points to \u00a7 119.6 of the BOCA Building Code in support of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Section 119.6 states, <em>inter alia, </em>that the use and occupancy permit \u201cshall certify compliance with the provisions of [the County Building] Code and the purpose for which the building or structure may be used in its several parts.\u201d Passnault suggests that it follows from \u00a7 119.6 that upon certification of compliance with the County Building Code, as evidenced by the use and occupancy permit, the Department\u2019s source of authority to issue a notice of violation shifts from the County Building Code to the County Housing Code. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">First, the County Housing Code regulates subjects different in kind from the County Building Code. Items covered in the County Housing Code include minimum space per occupant, lighting and ventilation requirements, and specific sanitary and heating facilities. The County Housing Code neither contains specifications for nail length and flashing weight nor incorporates the County Building Code by reference. <em>See </em>P.G. County Code \u00a7 13-107 (1983, 1984 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Second, the County Housing Code applies only to structures used for human habitation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 13-106.2. Under Passnault's suggested approach, an office or.other structure not used for human habitation which is constructed in violation of the County Building Code and which is issued a certificate of use and occupancy is not subject to the prohibitions of either the County Building Code or the County Housing Code. Following Passnault\u2019s line of reasoning, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>non-compliant office building which is mistakenly issued a certificate of use and occupancy is not subject to the County Building Code because the use and occupancy permit has been issued and is not subject to the County Housing Code because the structure is not used for human habitation. We decline to adopt a rule which would render structures not used for human habitation unregulated once the Department has issued a certificate of use and occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">We thus reject Passnault\u2019s contention and rely instead on the express provisions of the County Building Code. As previously set forth, \u00a7 117.2 of the BOCA Building Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">The building official shall serve a notice of violation or order on the <em>person responsible </em>for the erection, construction, alteration, extension, repair, removal, demolition, use or occupancy of a building or structure in violation of the provisions of this code, or in violation of a detail statement or a plan approved thereunder, or in violation of a permit or certificate issued under the provisions of this code. Such order shall direct the discontinuance of the illegal action or condition and the abatement of the violation. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Under \u00a7 117.2, service is proper upon the person responsible for: (1) acts done in violation of the code; (2) acts done in violation of a detail statement or plan approved thereunder; or (3) acts done in violation of a permit or certificate issued thereunder. The term \u201cperson\u201d includes \u201ca corporation or co-partnership as well as an individual,\u201d BOCA Building Code \u00a7 201.3 (1984), and the term \u201cresponsible\u201d is not defined. Undefined terms \u201cshall have the ordinarily accepted meanings or such as the context may imply.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">It is readily apparent that the three disjunctive subjects of service coupled with the breadth of the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cresponsible,\u201d results in \u201cperson responsible\u201d including, among others: the owner of the real property at the time the wrongful act occurs; the owner when the wrongful act is discovered; the occupant, if any, of the dwelling house when the wrongful act is discovered; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the builder, his or her agents, and any other person who works pursuant to a plan, permit, etc. issued by the Department. Section 117.2 contains neither temporal limits nor limits upon the County\u2019s discretion to determine which actor is the \u201cperson responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">We find, however, an express limitation in another provision of the BOCA Building Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a local addition to the BOCA Building Code, Prince George\u2019s County enacted \u00a7 119.1.1, P.G. County Code \u00a7 4-113.(1983, 1984 Supp.) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">Prior to the consummation of the sale (settlement) of any new, one-family dwelling, including the sale of a new condominium unit or a converted condominium which is offered for sale for the first time, there shall be an inspection of the unit and premises by the Building Official and a certificate of use and occupancy issued or a list of the violations or deficiencies requiring correction prior to issuance of such certificate. At the time of consummation of such sale, the certificate of use and occupancy, or a list of the deficiencies or violation which remain to be corrected prior to issuance of such certificate, shall be presented to the buyer. Unless contractually relieved of such responsibility, the seller shall be responsible for correction of any violations or deficiencies necessary for the certificate to be issued. When a certificate of use and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>occupancy has not been issued prior to consummation of the sale, there shall be required a separate, written contractual agreement indicating responsibility for correction of all deficiencies or violations cited by the Department by a date certain. The provisions of this Subsection are not applicable when a new dwelling unit is purchased for resale as a new dwelling unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">As we read \u00a7 119.1.1, unless contractually relieved of responsibility by the purchaser, the vendor is responsible for all <em>issued </em>notices of violation at the time of settlement and such liability exists whether the notices have been issued to the vendor, occupant, builder or other person upon whom service is proper. Implicit in \u00a7 119.1.1 is that the responsibility of the vendor, and those acting by, through, or under the vendor, terminates at settlement and the purchaser is responsible for notices of violation issued subsequent to the transfer of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 119.1.1 is buttressed by \u00a7 13-103 of the County Housing Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">\n<em>Responsibility of seller for violations.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">The seller of a dwelling structure and premises shall be responsible for compliance with all issued notices of violations of this Subtitle <em>or other laws of the County, </em>or actions in any court on account of such violations, against or affecting the property at the date of execution of any agreement of sale or transfer of ownership of such dwelling structure and premises. Nothing contained in this Subtitle shall affect the validity of any sale, transfer or disposition of any interest in real estate. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Accordingly, we hold that after legal title passes from the vendor to the purchaser, the purchaser of the dwelling house is the \u201cperson responsible\u201d under \u00a7 117.2 of the BOCA Building Code.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>In the instant case, Passnault transferred title to the property to the Bryants in 1979. The Department issued the notices of violation in 1984. <em>A fortiori, </em>Passnault is no longer the \u201cperson responsible\u201d for the violation and the County is without authority to compel Passnault to abate the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

According to the majority, conveyance of title terminates the responsibility of a builder who sells a house which he built in violation of the building code. I disagree with this interpretation of the Prince George\u2019s County Code, and therefore I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">In my view, \u00a7 117.2 of the BOCA Basic Building Code, adopted by reference in Prince George\u2019s County Code \u00a7 4-114 (1983, 1985 Supp.), is applicable to this case. Section 117.2 unambiguously states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">\u201c117.2 Notice of violation: The building official shall serve a notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the erection, construction, alteration, extension, repair, removal, demolition, use or occupancy of a build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>ing or structure in violation of the provisions of this code, or in violation of a detail statement or a plan approved thereunder, or in violation of a permit or certificate issued under the provisions of this code. Such order shall direct the discontinuance of the illegal action or condition and the abatement of the violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Under the clear language of \u00a7 117.2, the \u201cperson responsible for the erection [or] construction ... of a building or structure in violation of the [building] code\u201d is subject to a notice of violation and an order directing \u201cthe abatement of the violation.\u201d Passnault, as the contractor named on the building permit, is the person responsible for the construction of the defective house in this case. Therefore, the Prince George\u2019s County Building Inspector acted entirely in accordance with the mandate of \u00a7 117.2 when he issued violation notices and orders to Passnault.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Nevertheless, the majority concludes that \u00a7 117.2 is not applicable to this case. Instead, the Court applies \u00a7 4-115.1 of the Prince George\u2019s County Code (1983, 1985 Supp.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 4-115.1 amends \u00a7 119.1 of the BOCA Basic Building Code as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">\u201c(1) A new Subsection 119.1.9, titled \u201cNew One-Family Dwelling Units\u201d, is added to read as follows: Prior to the consummation of the sale (settlement) of any new, one-family dwelling, including the sale of a new condominium unit which is offered for sale for the first time, there shall be an inspection of the unit and premises by the Building Official and a certificate of use and occupancy issued or a list of the violations or deficiencies requiring correction prior to issuance of such certificate. At the time of consummation of such sale, the certificate of use and occupancy, or a list of the deficiencies or violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>which remain to be corrected prior to issuance of such certificate, shall be presented to the buyer. Unless contractually relieved of such responsibility, the seller shall be responsible for correction of any violations or deficiencies necessary for the certificate to be issued. When a certificate of use and occupancy has not been issued prior to consummation of the sale, there shall be required a separate, written contractual agreement indicating responsibility for correction of all deficiencies or violations cited by the Department by a date certain. The provisions of this Subsection are applicable when a new dwelling unit is purchased for resale as a new dwelling unit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The majority opinion states that \u00a7 119.1.9 is an \u201cexpress limitation\u201d on \u00a7 117.2. The opinion proceeds to interpret \u00a7 119.1.9 as limiting the responsibility of the vendor to those building code violations issued at or before the time of settlement. Without further explanation, the majority then concludes: \u201cImplicit in \u00a7 119.1[.9] is that the responsibility of the vendor, and those acting by, through, or under the vendor, terminates at settlement and the purchaser is responsible for notices of violation issued subsequent to the transfer of title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">I reject the majority\u2019s determination that \u00a7 119.1.9 is an \u201cexpress limitation\u201d on \u00a7 117.2. Section 117.2 by its terms applies to the persons \u201cresponsible for the erection, construction, alteration, extension, repair, removal, demolition, use or occupancy\u201d of a house in violation of the building code. It does not mention \u201cbuyer\u201d or \u201cseller,\u201d and applies regardless of whether the person responsible is a buyer or seller or neither. Section 119.1.9, however, applies only to \u201cbuyers\u201d or \u201csellers.\u201d Both sections are specific in their language; they clearly apply to distinct situations. It is true that a particular set of circumstances may involve both types of situations, <em>e.g., </em>where one is both the builder of a house and the seller of the real estate. Nevertheless, the thrust of each statute is different, and neither operates as an express limitation on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The majority\u2019s interpretation belies the clear language of \u00a7 119.1.9. As pointed out above, \u00a7 119.1.9 applies to \u201csellers\u201d and \u201cbuyers.\u201d The majority relies upon this section to conclude that Passnault, the seller, is not responsible for violations when notices are issued after settlement. Passnault, however, wears two hats; he also <em>built </em>the house that he sold. Therefore, while \u00a7 119.1.9 may relate to Passnault\u2019s responsibility as seller of the house, it in no way relates to Passnault\u2019s liability as builder of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"A6j\">Furthermore, by its terms, \u00a7 119.1.9 deals only with notices of building code violations issued prior to the settlement and deals only with new one-family dwellings. It says nothing about the responsibility for violation notices issued at other times or for structures other than new one-family dwellings.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">For similar reasons, the majority has misplaced its reliance upon \u00a7 13-103 of the County Housing Code. Passnault, a builder, was cited for building code, not housing code, violations. Section 13-103 of the Housing Code expressly deals with a seller\u2019s responsibility for \u201call issued notices of violations ... against or affecting the property at the date of execution of any agreement of sale or transfer of ownership of such dwelling structure and premises.\u201d Like \u00a7 119.1.9, this housing code provision deals only with a <em>seller\u2019s </em>liability for notices of violations issued <em>before </em>the execution of a contract for sale of the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Despite the absence of statutory language expressly supporting the majority\u2019s position, the majority asserts that it is <em>implicit </em>in \u00a7 119.1.9 that Passnault is not responsible for violations when notices are issued after settlement and authorized by \u00a7 117.2. I disagree. This implication is totally inappropriate in light of the differences in the pertinent statutes. An ordinance that deals with the <em>seller\u2019s </em>responsibility for violation notices, issued <em>prior to settlement, </em>concerning <em>new one-family dwellings, </em>does not necessarily imply anything at all about the responsibility of a <em>builder, </em>for notices <em>whenever issued, </em>concerning <em>any buildings </em>or structures that may have been constructed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>altered, repaired, removed, etc. <em>See </em>2A Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 55.03 (4th ed. 1984) (\u201cA necessary implication within, the meaning of the law is one that is so strong in its probability that the contrary thereof cannot reasonably be supposed.\u201d) This is especially true when there is a specific county code provision plainly covering violation notices issued to a builder at any time and covering a broad range of structures, namely \u00a7 117.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The Petitioner Passnault, in his effort to circumvent the plain language of \u00a7 117.2, argues that it would be \u201cunreasonable\u201d to adopt a construction that would allow \u201cthe County to return to a builder decades after the County\u2019s final inspection, issuance of use and occupancy permits and actual sale of the property. The County\u2019s interpretation makes the builder forever a guarantor ... that the property was originally built pursuant to the specifications of the then existent Building Code.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s Brief, p. 24). The answer to this argument is that a builder in this position would have available the defense of laches.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The equitable defenses of estoppel and laches are often available against a municipality. See Judge McAuliffe\u2019s recent discussion of this matter for the Court in <em>Permanent Fin. Corp. v. Montgomery Cty., </em>308 Md. 239, 247-253, 256, 578 A.2d 123 (1986), and cases cited therein. In the hypothetical case contemplated by Passnault\u2019s argument, laches would be applicable, as it seems reasonable for a builder 1) to rely upon a certificate of use and occupancy and 2) to assume that any building code violations would be reported within a reasonable time after a use and occupancy certificate is issued. Therefore, if it were claimed that the County waited too long to issue a notice of violation, and if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>all of the prerequisites to the defense of estoppel or laches were satisfied, the County\u2019s action would be barred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">It is not an \u201cunreasonable\u201d construction to give effect to the plain meaning of \u00a7 117.2 and hold a builder responsible for his violations of the building code under notices served after settlement, particularly considering the availability of the laches defense. In fact, this result is entirely reasonable, as many violations of the code will not be apparent upon final inspection and before occupancy. Some types of violations may be latent and not reasonably discoverable until after occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In this case, the decisions of the administrative agency, the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals were in accord with the clear language of the pertinent statutory provisions. Therefore I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Judges COLE and ADKINS have authorized me to state that they concur with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-5\">.
