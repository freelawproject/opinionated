Cotter III (appellee), an elected member of the City Council of College Park (\u201cCity Council\u201d or \u201cCouncil\u201d), filed suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against the Mayor and seven members of the City Council (appellants). In his complaint, he alleged that the Council held closed meetings in violation of Article 10, section 24 of the Municipal Charter of College Park (\u201cMunicipal Charter\u201d or \u201cCharter\u201d), which states: \u201cAll meetings of the Mayor and Council herein provided for, shall be open to the citizens of the city.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee requested a writ of mandamus \u201crequiring said officials of the City of College Park and their agents to hold open, public meetings and enjoining them from locking the doors of the Municipal Center during meetings of the Mayor and Council.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>According to appellee, the Mayor and City Council have held at least twenty closed meetings in the two years preceding the instant suit. On many occasions, appellee contends, these meetings were held without prior notice to the public; when citizens did attend, they were removed from the meeting hall. Appellee notes that since he took office in December of 1985, four such closed meetings have been held. Appellee asserts that he has registered a protest with the Mayor and City Council and has excluded himself from three of these meetings on the ground that to attend them would violate his oath to uphold the Municipal Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Answering the complaint,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the appellants do not dispute that closed meetings have been held on certain occasions during a three year period beginning in 1983.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They argue, however, that these closed sessions, which have been \u201cheld to consult with City staff, especially the City Attorney, on very limited issues,\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are permitted by the Maryland Sunshine Law (\u201cSunshine Law\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They also contend that the Municipal Charter does not present a bar to such meetings. In their view, the Charter does not \u201cin any way preclude executive sessions for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>consultation with counsel or to discuss other issues which must properly be considered out of the public view.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">After a hearing, the trial court enjoined the Mayor and City council from conducting any closed sessions or meetings as long as Article 10, section 24 of the Municipal Charter remained in force. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\u201c[U]nder the plain language of the [Maryland Sunshine Law] Section 10-504 (1984) conflict of laws provision, since Article X, Section 24, of the City Charter of College Park is more stringent [ (i.e., allows no exception to the open meeting requirement) ], it controls and all meetings of the Mayor and Council of College Park are required to be open meetings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201cWhere the intent of a statute is expressed in clear and unambiguous language, as it is in Article X, Section 24, of the Charter of the City of College Park, the court must carry it into effect even if the court is of the opinion that the policy of the legislation is unwise, harsh or unjust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u201cIf the City of College Park no longer wishes to require all meetings of the Mayor and Council to be open, it has available the Md.Ann.Code Art. 23A (1957) provisions for amending the Charter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">The appellants appealed the lower court\u2019s decision to the Court of Special Appeals and concurrently filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. Before review by the intermediate appellate court, we granted appellants\u2019 petition. We shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">At the outset, we address appellee\u2019s contention that the instant appeal is moot. Shortly after the appellee filed his suit, the Mayor and City Council of College Park proposed an amendment to the open meeting provision in the Munici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>pal Charter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As amended, Article 10, section 24 would read as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\">\u201cAll meetings of the Mayor and Council herein provided for shall be open to the citizens of the city. <em>Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent the Mayor and City Council from holding executive (closed) session from which the public is excluded, in accordance with the safeguards provided by State law, but no ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation shall be finally adopted at such an executive meeting.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">More than 1100 signatures of registered College Park voters were collected to bring the proposed amendment to a referendum vote.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The ballot asked voters whether they were \u201cin favor of closed meetings of the Mayor and Council as permitted by and held in accordance with the safeguards of the State of Maryland Sunshine Act.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On December 9, 1986, the voters defeated the proposed charter amendment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The appellee contends the referendum vote moots the present controversy. He reasons as follows: The vote represents the public\u2019s desire for open meetings. When the Charter provision in force is read as reflecting this desire, the appellants\u2019 contention that Article 10, section 24 permits closed sessions is no longer tenable. \u201cSince there is no longer any controversy with regard to how the voters of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>College Park want the meetings of their Mayor and Council conducted, and the Mayor and Council are the peoples\u2019 duly elected representatives, there is no longer an existing controversy.\u201d We reject appellee\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">As a general rule, appellate courts do not give opinions on abstract propositions or moot questions. <em>See, e.g., County Commissioners of Charles County v. Secretary of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>302 Md. 566, 568, 489 A.2d 1127, 1128 (1985) (and cases cited therein). <em>\u201cA </em>question is moot if, at the time it is before the court, there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any effective remedy which the court can provide.\u201d <em>Attorney General v. Anne Arundel County School Bus Contractors Association, </em>286 Md. 324, 327, 407 A.2d 749, 752 (1979) (citations omitted). When a party is seeking an injunction or similar relief, it will not \u201cissue if the acts sought to be enjoined have been discontinued or abandoned.\u201d <em>Id., </em>407 A.2d at 752 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In the instant case, a controversy still exists between the opposing litigants. The referendum vote, although expressing the will of a majority of the interested voters of College Park, did not amend the Municipal Charter, thereby eliminating the controversy concerning the interpretation of the Charter provision in question. The vote did not prevent the appellants from still maintaining, which they do on appeal,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that Article 10, section 24 permits closed meetings. This is simply not a case where the \u201cacts sought to be enjoined have been discontinued or abandoned.\u201d <em>Anne Arundel County School Bus, </em>286 Md. at 327, 407 A.2d at 752. <em>Compare State v. Ficker, </em>266 Md. 500, 507, 295 A.2d 231, 235 (1972) (offending act sought to be enjoined has been abandoned). Had the referendum vote amended the Charter to explicitly prohibit closed meetings, or to prevent the appellants from pursuing their present position, we would have a very different situation. Since an effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>remedy does exist (i.e., an injunction), we conclude the present appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We begin our analysis with the Maryland Sunshine Law, Md.Code (1984, 1986 Cum.Supp.), State Government \u00a7\u00a7 10-501\u2014510, which will bring the present controversy into focus. The Maryland Sunshine Law requires that meetings of public bodies, with limited exceptions, be open to the public. <em>See Carroll County Education Association v. Board of Education of Carroll County, </em>294 Md. 144, 147, 448 A.2d 345, 347 (1982); <em>Avara v. Baltimore News American Division, </em>292 Md. 543, 440 A.2d 368 (1982).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 10-502 expresses the legislative policy of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">\u201cIt is essential to the maintenance of a democratic society that, except in special and appropriate circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">1) public business be performed in an open and public manner; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">2) citizens be advised and aware of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">(i) the performance of public officials; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">(ii) the deliberations and decisions that the making of public policy involves.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEg\">At the heart of the Act is section 10-505, which states that a public body<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> shall meet<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in open session<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> whenev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>er that body is carrying out an advisory, legislative, or quasi-legislative function.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Act does, however, allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>closed meetings to take place in limited circumstances. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1986 Cum.Supp.), State Government \u00a7 10-508(a).* <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For example, a public body may meet in closed session or adjourn an open session to a closed session to consult with counsel, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 10-508(a)(7), or to protect the privacy and reputation of individuals with respect to a matter that is not related to public business. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10-508(a)(2). A public body that meets in closed session <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>may not discuss or act on a matter not explicitly permitted under section 10-508(a). <em>Id. </em>at 10-508(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Before meeting in an open session, a public body must give reasonable advance notice to the public of the upcoming session. <em>Id. </em>at 10-506(a). <em>See City of New Carrollton v. Rogers, </em>287 Md. 56, 410 A.2d 1070 (1980). Whenever reasonable, the requisite notice must be in writing, and include the date, time and place of the session. Md.Code (1984, 1986 Cum.Supp.), State Government \u00a7 10-506(b).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Act also requires the public body to maintain minutes of its session, reflecting each item that the public body considered, the action taken on each item, together with any recorded votes. <em>Id. </em>at 10-509(b)-(c). These minutes, which are to be prepared as soon as practicable after the body meets, are public records and shall be open for public inspection. <em>Id. </em>at 10-509(d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>In <em>City of New Carrollton v. Rogers, </em>Chief Judge Murphy for this Court summarized the impact of the Sunshine Law then in force. His observations are applicable to the current Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">\u201cWhile the Act does not afford the public any right to participate in the meetings, it does assure the public right to observe the deliberative process and the making of decisions by the public body at open meetings. In this regard, it is clear that the Act applies, not only to final decisions made by the public body exercising legislative functions at a public meeting, but as well to all deliberations which precede the actual legislative act or decision, unless authorized by [\u00a7 10-508] to be closed to the public. The Act makes no distinction between formal and informal meetings of the public body; it simply covers all meetings at which a quorum of the constituent membership of the public body is convened \u2018for the purpose of considering or transacting public business.\u2019 [\u00a7 10-501(f)]. It is, therefore, the deliberative and decision-making process in its entirety which must be conducted in meetings open to the public since every step of the process, including the final decision itself, constitutes the consideration or transaction of public business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 72, 410 A.2d at 1078-79.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">In the instant case, both parties focus on section 10-504 of the Act, entitled Conflict of Laws, which reads as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\u201cWhenever this subtitle and another law that relates to meetings of public bodies conflict, this subtitle applies <em>unless the other law is more stringent.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">This provision establishes that, although the Maryland Sunshine Law is the touchstone by which public bodies are to conduct their meetings, the statute is not exclusive in its application. The statute only outlines the <em>minimum </em>requirements for conducting open meetings. <em>Cf. Annapolis v. Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383, 393, 396 A.2d 1080, 1086 (1979) (Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Art. 23A, implementing Article XI-E, \u00a7 3 of the Maryland Constitution, only establishes minimum requirements regarding municipal affairs; municipalities are free to provide additional standards and safeguards in harmony with concurrent state legislation). It does not supersede legislative enactments designed to bring more openness to public meetings. <em>Cf. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency v. McKay, </em>590 F.Supp. 1071, 1072 (D.Nev.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>769 F.2d 534 (9th Cir.1985) (The Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, a congressionally ratified interstate compact, intended that the sunshine law of the State granting greater public access to meetings of local governments is the law which should control the Compact\u2019s governing agency, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency). Stated differently, section 10-504 permits expansion upon the guarantees of the statute, thereby limiting or eliminating the circumstances enumerated in section 10-508 in which closed meetings may be held.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As so construed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>section 10-504 is consistent with, and best effectuates, the legislature\u2019s commitment to promoting public access to the affairs of state.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Appellee argues, and the trial court held, that the Municipal Charter provision in question (Article 10, sec. 24) is a \u201cmore stringent\u201d law within the contemplation of section 10-504. According to the trial court, while section 10-508 \u201callows public bodies to hold closed meetings under certain conditions, the City Charter of College Park is more restrictive and allows no exceptions to the open meeting requirement.\u201d As a more stringent law, \u201cit controls and all meetings of the Mayor and Council of College Park are required to be open meetings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The issue presented, then, is one of statutory construction. The fundamental task, in such a case, is to discern the objective, goal or purpose of the legislation. <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 512, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). In our \u201cefforts to discover purpose, aim, or policy we look at the words of the statute ... because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>what the legislature has written in an effort to achieve a goal is a natural ingredient of analysis to determine that goal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 513, 525 A.2d 628. We also may consider \u201cother material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal\u201d so that we may read the language of the legislation in the context within which it was written. <em>Id. </em>at 515, 525 A.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">In the instant case, the language of Article 10, section 24 of the Municipal Charter is clear.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is a flat prohibition against closed meetings<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> in the City of College Park. That language is totally consistent with the apparent intent of the provision, which is to mandate open meetings of the Mayor and Council. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra. And see </em>notes 8-11, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text. It is also consistent with the section 10-504 conflict of laws provision, because the Charter provision is a permissible expansion upon the guarantees embodied in the Maryland Sunshine Act.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>In an effort to undermine the trial court\u2019s reliance on the conflict of laws provision (section 10-504), appellants argue that the Charter is <em>not </em>more stringent than the Sunshine Law. Appellants reason as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\">\u201cWhile the new Sunshine Act provides that all meetings, except where specifically provided, are to be open to the public ..., the City Charter states that meetings need be open only to \u2018the citizens of the city,\u2019 which is a more limited group than the \u2018general public\u2019 referred to in the new Sunshine Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Since the Charter provides for less public participation than the Sunshine Law, appellants contend, section 10-504 is inapplicable and the Sunshine Law and its enumerated exceptions should take precedence over the Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We think the appellants read the phrase \u201ccitizens of the city\u201d too narrowly.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The \u201c \u2018meaning of the plainest language\u2019 is controlled by the context in which it appears.\u201d <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 514, 525 A.2d 628 (quoting <em>Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>293 Md. 629, 642, 446 A.2d 1140, 1147 (1982)). As we have already noted, the context of the words \u201ccitizens of the city\u201d is a charter provision designed to assure completely open meetings. In any event, if one of the proposed interpretations would render an enactment valid, while another would render it invalid or ineffective, the court will construe the enactment to be valid whenever feasible. <em>In re Criminal Investigation No. 1-162, </em>307 Md. 674, 685, 516 A.2d 976, 982 (1986); <em>Pickett v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>291 Md. 648, 661, 436 A.2d 449, 456 (1981). Relying on this rule, we conclude that the phrase noted above is consistent with, and not any narrower than, the term \u201cgeneral public\u201d as used in section 10-507(a) of the Sunshine Law. <em>See supra </em>note 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Appellants advance two additional arguments in support of their position. First, appellants suggest that we read the Municipal Charter to incorporate the circumstances enumerated in section 10-508 in which closed meetings may be held. <em>See supra </em>note 18. We decline to accept the appellants\u2019 invitation to do so. Their argument ignores the impact of the Act\u2019s conflict of laws provision (section 10-504). Furthermore, appellants would have us read into the Municipal Charter something which is plainly not permitted by its language, and which is completely inconsistent with the purpose of the Charter.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">As a fallback position, appellants argue that we should at least recognize an exception in the Municipal Charter for closed meetings between the City Council and its attorney. According to appellants, the trial court\u2019s broad construction of the Charter provision will cripple the City Council\u2019s ability to consult with its attorney, thereby emasculating the attorney-client privilege. They reason as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cSettlement and avoidance of litigation are particularly sensitive activities, whose conduct would be greatly confounded, often made impossible, by undiscriminating insistence on open lawyer-client conferences. In settlement advice, the attorney\u2019s professional task is to provide his client a frank appraisal of strength and weakness, gains and risks, hopes and fears. If the public\u2019s \u2018right to know\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>compelled admission of an audience, the ringside seats would be occupied by the government\u2019s adversary, delighted to capitalize on every revelation of weakness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7T\">For the reasons set forth below, we reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The attorney-client privilege, deeply rooted in common law, is now codified in Md.Code (1984 Repl.Vol., 1986 Cum.Supp.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 9-108 (\u201cA person may not be compelled to testify in violation of the attorney-client privilege.\u201d). The privilege is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\"><em>\u201ca </em>rule of evidence that forever bars disclosure, without the consent of the client, of all communications that pass in confidence between the client and his attorney during the course of professional employment or as an incident of professional intercourse between them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\"><em>State v. Pratt, </em>284 Md. 516, 519, 398 A.2d 421, 423 (1979); <em>Harrison v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 135, 345 A.2d 830, 838 (1975). The privilege is based on the public policy of encouraging individuals needing legal assistance to disclose information freely to their attorneys without concern that such information will be revealed. <em>Pratt, </em>284 Md. at 520, 398 A.2d at 423; <em>Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 135, 345 A.2d at 838. A client may waive his right to confidentiality, either expressly or implicitly, but the authority to waive the privilege belongs to the client alone. <em>Pratt, </em>284 Md. at 521, 398 A.2d at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The Maryland Sunshine Law recognizes the attorney-client privilege. Section 10-508 states in part that a public body may meet in closed session or adjourn an open session to a closed session to \u201cconsult with counsel,\u201d Md.Code (1984, 1986 Cum.Supp.), State Government \u00a7 10-508(a)(7), or to \u201cconsult with staff, consultants, or other individuals about pending or potential litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10-508(a)(8). But as we have construed section 10-504, the conflict of laws provision, a jurisdiction such as College Park is authorized to eliminate this exception to the open meeting requirement. Section 10-504 provides legislative authorization for the City of College Park to waive the attorney-client privilege between the governing public body (the City Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>cil) and its attorney. <em>Cf. Smith County Education Association v. Anderson, </em>676 S.W.2d 328, 333 (Tenn.1984). That the General Assembly has the authority to take such action, at least outside the criminal context, is not disputed. <em>Cf. Bremer v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 291, 334, 307 A.2d 503, 529, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 755 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 930, 94 S.Ct. 1440, 39 L.Ed.2d 488 (1974) (The privilege of communication between patient and psychiatrist \u201cexists by legislative grant, and ordinarily the legislature may provide the conditions under which it is applicable.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">In support of their argument, appellants rely on a number of judicial decisions that have fashioned an exception in their open meeting statutes for private attorney-client discussions, even though the statutes do not explicitly contain such an exception. <em>See, e.g., Tahoe Regional Planning Agency v. McKay, </em>590 F.Supp. 1071 (D.Nev.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>769 F.2d 534 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Sacramento Newspaper Guild v.

First, we are not concerned here with establishing an attorney-client exception in the Maryland Sunshine Law; the General Assembly has already recognized this exception in section 10-508(a)(7)-(8). Second, and more significantly, when these cases were decided, none of the open meeting statutes contained a conflict of laws provision similar to section 10-504 reflecting the State legislature\u2019s intention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>provide a given jurisdiction with the authority to afford the public greater access to meetings.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>In reaching our conclusion, we do not belittle the arguments advanced by the appellants that public discussions between the City Council and its attorney may be detrimental to the public\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> On the other hand, we also acknowledge concerns that weigh in favor of holding such discussions in public. For example, \u201cto allow the Council to go into executive session at any time upon the pretext of consulting the City Attorney about legal matters, might readily open the door to repeated and undetectable evasions\u201d of the Sunshine Law. <em>Laman v. McCord, 245 </em>Ark. 401, 406, 432 S.W.2d 753, 756 (1968). <em>See Sacramento Newspaper Guild, </em>263 Cal.App.2d at 58; 69 Cal.Rptr. at 492; <em>Minneapolis Star, </em>310 Minn, at 321, 246 S.W.2d at 454. In any event, the General Assembly has determined that these considerations are to be debated and resolved in the first instance by the voters of College Park. The voters have indicated their preference in Article 10, section 24 of the Municipal Charter, and we must effectuate that clear choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">It may have been unwise for the General Assembly to allow a jurisdiction to open consultations between the City Council and its attorney; and indeed it may have been unwise for the City of College Park to have taken such a step. We do not express an opinion on either of these propositions.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It is simply not our role to sit in judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>on the wisdom of the legislature or the voters of College Park. This Court deals with the construction and constitutionality of legislative determinations, not their wisdom. <em>State v. Wyand, </em>304 Md. 721, 726, 501 A.2d 43, 45 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 1492, 89 L.Ed.2d 893 (1986). <em>See Taylor v. Department of Employment &amp; Training, </em>308 Md. 468, 474, 520 A.2d 379, 382 (1987).

Of course, the Charter provision only speaks in terms of <em>\"meetings,\" </em>which is defined as the convening of a \"quorum of a public body for the consideration or transaction of public business.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 24. It follows from this definition that nothing prohibits the City Attorney from meeting in closed session with less than a quorum of the Council members. Nor is a quorum of the Council foreclosed from convening in private when not considering or transacting public business. <em>See New Carrollton, </em>287 Md. at 72, 410 A.2d at 1078-79.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b637-9\">ELDRIDGE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ApT-\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">The majority holds that the open meetings provision of the Municipal Charter of College Park is a more stringent law than the Maryland Open Meetings Act, Maryland Code (1984, 1986 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 10-501 through 10-510 of the State Government Article, and that, therefore, the Charter provision governs meetings of the College Park City Council. Under the Court\u2019s holding, the City Council of College Park cannot privately meet with its attorney to discuss pending or potential litigation. Nor can the Council meet privately to discuss sensitive personnel issues. Instead, the majority requires the City Council of College Park to discuss these matters only in open public sessions. Because I disagree with the majority\u2019s view of the College Park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Charter and its relationship to the Maryland Open Meetings Act, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The resolution of the dispute in this case depends upon the application of \u00a7 10-504 of the Maryland Open Meetings Act which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">\u201cWhenever this subtitle and another law that relates to meetings of public bodies conflict, this subtitle applies unless the other law is more stringent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Therefore, it must first be determined that a conflict exists between the College Park Charter and the Maryland Open Meetings Act. If there is a conflict, \u00a7 10-504 directs us to apply the \u201cmore stringent\u201d law.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">It is undisputed that a conflict, within the meaning of \u00a7 10-504, exists between the Charter and the State Act. Article 10, \u00a7 24, of the Charter provides: \u201cAll meetings of the Mayor and Council herein provided for, shall be open to the citizens of the city.\u201d Conversely the State Act permits sessions to be closed to the public in very limited circumstances, \u00a7 10-508. Section 10-507 of the State Act, however, requires that most meetings be open to the public generally, without any limitation based on citizenship or any other connection with a particular jurisdiction or geographical area. Consequently, under the plain language of the enactments, there is a conflict in two respects. The issue, then, is which law is more stringent and therefore controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Section 10-504 of the statewide law does not define \u201cmore stringent.\u201d Nevertheless, the policy of the State Act is \u201cthat, except in special and appropriate circumstances [,] ... public business be performed in an open and public manner____\u201d \u00a7 10-502. <em>See Carroll Co. Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Educ., </em>294 Md. 144, 147, 448 A.2d 345 (1982); <em>Avara v. Baltimore News American, </em>292 Md. 543, 545, 440 A.2d 368 (1982). Consequently, when the State Act and a local open-meeting provision conflict, the policy behind the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Act is furthered only when the more stringent provision, <em>i.e., </em>the one allowing greater public <em>access, </em>applies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Moreover, in determining whether the Charter or the Maryland Open Meetings Act allows greater public access, we must compare the entire State Act with the entire comparable provision in the Charter. This is made clear by \u00a7 10-504 of the state statute which provides that when \u201cthis <em>subtitle \u201d </em>and \u201canother <em>law \u201d </em>conflict, \u201cthis <em>subtitle </em>applies unless the other <em>law </em>is more stringent.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See Tahoe Regional Planning Agency v. McKay, </em>590 F.Supp. 1071 (D.Nev.1984), <em>aff'd </em>769 F.2d 534 (9th Cir.1985) (in order to determine which of two state open meetings acts imposed \u201cgreater requirements,\u201d the court examined all parts of the acts, including closed meeting and record keeping provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The majority initially compares the provisions in the Charter and the State Act relating to the permissibility of closed meetings. The College Park Charter, as the majority correctly points out, flatly prohibits closed meetings, while the State statute allows closed meetings in narrowly drawn circumstances. As a result of this comparison, the majority concludes that the Charter is less restrictive of public access and is therefore more stringent under \u00a7 10-504. I would agree with this conclusion if there were no limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>in the Charter concerning who may attend a council meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">As previously pointed out, the State Open Meetings Act requires meetings to be open to the \u201cgeneral public\u201d (\u00a7 10-507(a)) whereas the Charter merely requires meetings to be open to the \u201ccitizens of the city.\u201d The majority, however, concludes that neither the Charter nor the State Act is more stringent than the other in this respect because, in the majority\u2019s view, \u201ccitizens of the city\u201d \u201cis consistent with, and not any narrower than, the term \u2018general public\u2019 as used in section 10-507(a)____\u201d This construction is incompatible with the plain language used and with prior opinions of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The provision in \u00a7 10-507(a) of the State Act, that \u201cthe general public is entitled to attend\u201d meetings of a public body, and the provision in the Charter that meetings are \u201copen to citizens of the city,\u201d lack ambiguity in the present context. The meaning of \u201cpublic\u201d is \u201crelating to or affecting the people\u201d or \u201crelating to the international community or to mankind in general.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1836 (1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus the State Act requires that meetings be open to persons generally, without any geographical or jurisdictional limitation. The phrase \u201ccitizens of the city,\u201d however, given its broadest meaning, refers to the inhabitants or residents or domiciliaries of College Park. <em>See Crosse v. Board of Elections, </em>243 Md. 555, 559-560, 221 A.2d 431 (1966); <em>Risewick v. Davis, </em>19 Md. 82, 93 (1862). If the framers of the College Park Charter had intended meetings to be open to the \u201cgeneral public,\u201d they would have said so, as did the framers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>numerous other charters.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, the framers of the College Park Charter deliberately chose to limit meetings to \u201ccitizens of the city,\u201d and we are not free to ignore the limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">To bolster its conclusion that \u201ccitizens of the city\u201d means \u201cgeneral public,\u201d the majority invokes the principle of statutory construction that, if there are two constructions of a provision which can reasonably be made, a court will avoid the construction that renders the provision invalid or which would involve a decision as to its validity. <em>See, e.g., Heileman Brewing v. Stroh Brewery, </em>308 Md. 746, 763-764, 521 A.2d 1225 (1987); <em>Davis v. State, </em>294 Md. 370, 377, 451 A.2d 107, 111 (1982); <em>Pickett v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>291 Md. 648, 661, 436 A.2d 449 (1981); <em>Moberly v. Herboldsheimer, </em>276 Md. 211, 217, 345 A.2d 855 (1975); <em>Prince Geo\u2019s Co. v. Chillum-Adelphi, </em>275 Md. 374, 383, 340 A.2d 265 (1975); <em>District Land v. Wash. S.S.C., </em>266 Md. 301, 311-312, 292 A.2d 695 (1972). The majority\u2019s reliance upon this principle is entirely misplaced. Under the principle invoked by the majority, the construction which avoids a holding that the provision is invalid \u201cmust be reasonable; it must be permitted by the statutory language.\u201d <em>Heileman Brewing v. Stroh Brewery, supra, </em>308 Md. at 764, 521 A.2d 1225. As previously discussed, the language \u201ccitizens of the city\u201d is not reasonably susceptible to the construction embraced by the majority. Moreover, I see no reason to adopt a strained construction of a local provision in order to save it from an express preemption clause in or a conflict with a state statute. <em>Cf. Montgomery County v. Atlantic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>Guns, Inc., </em>302 Md. 540, 489 A.2d 1114 (1985); <em>Rockville Grosvenor Inc. v. Mont. Co., </em>289 Md. 74, 422 A.2d 353 (1980). To do so would circumvent the intent of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">As earlier mentioned, under the majority\u2019s construction of the College Park Charter, the Mayor and City Council of College Park may not meet privately with the municipal attorney to discuss pending litigation. Similarly, they may not meet privately to discuss sensitive personnel issues. This is unworkable and impractical. No attorney and client team could effectively plan litigation strategy when its discussions are open to its adversaries, yet this is the result required by the majority. The majority opinion cannot be reconciled with the longstanding principle that courts should avoid constructions which are absurd, unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense. <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 512, 525 A.2d 628 (1987); <em>In re Special Investigation No. 281, </em>299 Md. 181, 200, 473 A.2d 1 (1984); <em>Cider Barrel Mobile Home v. Eader, </em>287 Md. 571, 583-584, 414 A.2d 1246 (1980); <em>Hoffman v. Key Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, </em>286 Md. 28, 43, 416 A.2d 1265 (1979); <em>Francois v. Alberti Van &amp; Stg. Co., </em>285 Md. 663, 670, 404 A.2d 1058 (1979); <em>Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 149, 395 A.2d 464 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In summary, the College Park Charter prescribes that City Council meetings shall be \u201copen to the citizens of the city.\u201d Under the broadest reasonable construction of the language, access to City Council meetings is limited to those who reside or are domiciled within the corporate limits of College Park. In light of this limitation, it is obvious that the Maryland Open Meetings Act is less restrictive of public access and is, therefore, more stringent under \u00a7 10-504. Consequently, the state statute should apply to meetings of the City Council. I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Judges COLE and RODOWSKY have authorized me to state that they concur with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\">. Three other states also have express conflict of laws provisions in their open meetings statutes. The statutory language in each of these states indicates that municipalities may enact provisions providing greater public access, and that such local provisions will prevail over state law. Cal.
