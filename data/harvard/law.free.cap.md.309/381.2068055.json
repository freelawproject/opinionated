Section 569(d) specified the types of professional liability insurance policies that the Society could issue. Chapter 713 did not contain any means of capitalizing Legal Mutual, and the Act\u2019s provisions were never implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Codified as Code (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol.) Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 244-244V, Subtitle 16B was added to the Insurance Code by Chapter 737 of the Acts of 1984. Its purpose, as stated in \u00a7 244(b), was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmL\">\u201c(1) [t]o protect policyholders and the public against the adverse effect of excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory rates;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">(2) [t]o encourage, as the most effective way to produce rates that conform to the standards of paragraph (1) of this subsection, independent action by and reasonable price competition among insurers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">(3) [t]o provide formal regulatory controls for use if price competition fails;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">(4) [t]o authorize cooperative action among insurers in the rate-making process, and to regulate such cooperation in order to prevent practices that tend to bring about monopoly or to lessen or destroy competition; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">(5) [t]o provide rates that are responsive to competitive market conditions and to improve the availability of insurance in the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">Prior to this enactment, insurers were required to file proposed rates with the Insurance Commissioner thirty working days before their effective date; and unless the Commissioner disapproved the proposed rates within that period, they became effective. \u00a7 242(d). Subtitle 16B, effective July 1, 1984, changed this process for many types of insurance, including lawyers\u2019 professional malpractice insurance. Section 244D established ratemaking standards, and \u00a7 244E(a) required covered insurers to file information and rates by the date that they became effective. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Insurance Commissioner questioned whether insurers were complying with \u00a7 244D, \u00a7 244-1 provided a mechanism for determining compliance, and \u00a7 244K authorized the Commissioner to require prior approval of all new rates. Before doing so, however, the Commissioner was required to conduct a hearing to determine whether a reasonable degree of competition existed for the type of insurance under investigation. \u00a7 244-I(c)(l); \u00a7 244K(a)(l). At this hearing, the insurer carried the burden of establishing that a reasonable degree of competition existed within the particular market. \u00a7 244\u20141(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Amid growing concern about the availability and cost of legal malpractice insurance, the Insurance Commissioner held a Subtitle 16B hearing on November 14, 1984. 11 Md.Reg. 1948 (1984). As a result, he found that reasonable competition did not exist in the legal malpractice insurance market, and he invoked the provisions of \u00a7 244K that required insurers to justify all rate increases prior to their effective date. 12 Md.Reg. 741 (1985). Without further action by the Insurance Commissioner, that order remained effective for one year. \u00a7 244K(c). On February 10, 1986, the Insurance Commissioner again determined, based on a hearing held on January 30, 1986, that a reasonable degree of competition did not exist in the legal malpractice insurance market. 13 Md.Reg. 720 (1986). That order expired February 10, 1987.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Chapter 281 of the Acts of 1986, an emergency bill that took effect on April 29, 1986, amended Subtitle 40 of the Insurance Code in a number of particulars in order to facilitate the creation and operation of Legal Mutual. Amended \u00a7 567(b) provided that Subtitle 40, as amended, would become effective thirty days after the Insurance Commissioner (1) received a petition from the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>State Bar Association (MSBA) requesting Legal Mutual\u2019s establishment and (2) determined \u201cthat a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in the State for legal professional liability insurance under Subtitle 16B of this Article.\u201d Section 567(b)(2) provided that, if the Commissioner \u201chas not issued an order finding that a reasonable degree of competition does not exist for legal professional liability insurance before receiving the [MSBA] petition,\u201d he must hold a hearing within ten days of the receipt of the petition and pass an order within fifteen days thereafter. The Subsection further specified that, if the Commissioner determined that \u201ca reasonable degree of competition does not exist,\u201d then the provisions of amended Subtitle 40 \u201cshall become effective immediately on the date of the Commissioner\u2019s order.\u201d Upon taking effect, the Governor is required by \u00a7 569 to appoint a Board of Directors to govern the Society and to direct its incorporation. The Society is not an agency or instrumentality of the State, and the State may not budget for or provide general fund appropriations for it. \u00a7 568(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In addition to the types of insurance originally authorized to be written by Legal Mutual under Chapter 281 of the Acts of 1976, amended \u00a7 569(c)(4) authorized it to write property, casualty and surety insurance \u201crelated or incidental to the practice of law or to the facilities, equipment and premises used by attorneys in the practice of law.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Section 570(a) of the 1986 Act made provision for certification to the State Treasurer within thirty days after Legal Mutual\u2019s incorporation of \u201ca list of all attorneys admitted to practice law in the State as shown in the records of the Clients\u2019 Security Trust Fund ... on the date of the Society\u2019s incorporation.\u201d Section 570(b) mandated the imposition upon all such attorneys of a \u201cspecial one-time tax for the privilege of practicing law in the State\u201d in the amount of $150, to be collected by the State Treasurer. Section 570(c) provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that failure to pay the tax would result in a lien being imposed upon the attorney\u2019s real and personal property. Section 570(d)(1) \u201cdedicates the proceeds of the tax ... as the initial policyholders\u2019 surplus of the Society.\u201d Section 570(e) makes provision for a nonrefundable \u201cmembership fee which shall be payable by an attorney at the time of application to the Society for a policy of insurance.\u201d This subsection further provides that the membership fee may not be credited against any premium payable to the Society for a policy of insurance, but that an attorney who has paid the tax \u201cshall be credited with the amount of the tax paid against his liability for any membership fee.\u201d Section 570(f) provides that, upon payment of the membership fee, an attorney may be insured by the Society \u201cfor any and all hazards customarily insured by the Society, subject to any coverage limitations specified by the Society in accordance with policy limitations, exclusions, conditions, deductibles, and loss-sharing requirements.\u201d Under \u00a7 572(c), Legal Mutual is authorized to \u201crefuse to underwrite or cancel any risk that does not meet its underwriting standards subject to the applicable provisions of this Title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On May 14, 1986, the MSBA petitioned the Insurance Commissioner to create Legal Mutual. Thereafter, by let<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ter dated May 20, 1986, the Commissioner determined that the requirements of \u00a7 567(b) had been met by the order of February 10, 1986; he, therefore, authorized the creation of Legal Mutual. The Governor then appointed the initial Board of Directors of the Society, and the Insurance Commissioner approved its incorporation on July 1, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">A number of attorneys filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, mounting a broad-based challenge (a) to the constitutionality of the amendments to Subtitle 40, as enacted by Chapter 281 of the Acts of 1986 and (b) to the legality of Legal Mutual\u2019s activation under the provisions of the statute. Among others, a declaration was sought that the tax was unconstitutional and that the Society\u2019s incorporation was unlawful. The court (Kaplan, J.) declared the Act constitutional in all of the challenged respects and determined that Legal Mutual had been lawfully created. We granted certiorari upon the appellants\u2019 appeal to the Court of Special Appeals to consider the significant issue of public importance involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\n<em>Activation of Legal Mutual</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQ8X\">Appellants first contend that \u00a7 567(b)(1) requires the Insurance Commissioner, as a condition precedent to the lawful creation of Legal Mutual, to hold a Subtitle 16B hearing <em>after </em>the effective date of the 1986 amendments to Subtitle 40, as enacted by Chapter 281 of the Acts of 1986. They argue that the Commissioner\u2019s order of February 10, 1986 did not satisfy this requirement and, as a result, the essential triggering mechanism for the lawful creation of Legal Mutual was not observed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Section 567(b)(1) does not specify when the Insurance Commissioner must make the Subtitle 16B determination of whether a reasonable degree of competition exists within the legal malpractice insurance field. We think it clear, however, from the provisions of \u00a7 567(b)(2) and of Subtitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>16B and from the legislative history underlying enactment of Chapter 281 that the Legislature did not require that that triggering determination be made only after the effective date of Ch. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">As we earlier noted, \u00a7 567(b)(1) does contain a clear formulation for determining whether a reasonable degree of competition exists when the Insurance Commissioner receives the MSBA petition <em>before </em>issuing an order under Subtitle 16B. This legislative recognition that the petition might precede the Commissioner\u2019s determination of the degree of competition indicates that it intended to permit the Commissioner to rely on prior orders and thus, intentionally omitted a requirement that the Commissioner make a new finding after the passage of Ch. 281. <em>See American Security v. </em>Amsterdam, 246 Md. 36, 41, 227 A.2d 214 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Second, \u00a7 567(b)(1) expressly refers to Subtitle 16B. Under \u00a7 244-I(a) of that Subtitle, the Commissioner\u2019s finding of no reasonable degree of competition remains in effect for one year. Of course, the Legislature is presumed to know the existing law and to take it into account when enacting new legislation. <em>Board of Educ., Garrett County v. Lendo, </em>295 Md. 55, 63, 453 A.2d 1185 (1982). Thus, we conclude that the General Assembly intended to give full effect to the provisions of Subtitle 16B and the Commissioner\u2019s orders promulgated pursuant to its provisions. Consequently, an order issued prior to the passage of Ch. 281 would satisfy the requirement of \u00a7 567(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Finally, the legislative history demonstrates that the General Assembly knew when it enacted Ch. 281 that the Commissioner had already issued an order under Subtitle 16B. At committee hearings on the proposed legislation (SB 753), several witnesses noted the existence of such an order and suggested that the bill be amended to require an independent hearing. The Senate Committee report on the bill explained, however, that the Commissioner had already issued an order under Subtitle 16B and thus, a petition from the MSBA of itself would trigger the creation of Legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Mutual. For these reasons, we conclude that \u00a7 567(b)(1) does not require the Commissioner to make a no-competition finding under Subtitle 16B after the enactment of Ch. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\n<em>Procedural Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Appellants claim that their rights were affected by the Commissioner\u2019s no-competition determination of February 10, 1986. Having had no notice of the January 30, 1986 hearing, or an opportunity to be heard prior to the issuance of the Commissioner\u2019s February 10, 1986 order, appellants suggest that their procedural due process rights were violated. As a consequence, they urge that we hold that Legal Mutual was not lawfully created under the statute and that the tax imposed under its provisions was, therefore, void and of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">As we have already indicated, the General Assembly had knowledge of the Commissioner\u2019s February 10, 1986 order. That it did not require a second such finding after Ch. 281\u2019s enactment is tantamount to a legislative determination that a reasonable degree of competition did not exist in the legal malpractice insurance market. In such circumstances, appellants have no due process right to notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to such a legislative finding. <em>See Swarthmore Co. v. Kaestner, </em>258 Md. 517, 532-33, 266 A.2d 341 (1970). Thus, the claimed denial of procedural due process does not prevent the use of the Commissioner's earlier order to activate Legal Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">\n<em>Public Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Appellants contend that Legal Mutual does not serve a public purpose and thus violates Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akjp\">\u201call taxes thereafter provided to be levied by the State for the support of the general State Government, and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the Counties and by the City of Baltimore for their respective purposes, shall be uniform within each class or sub-class of land, improvements on land and personal property which the respective taxing powers may have directed to be subjected to the tax levy; yet fines, duties or taxes may properly and justly be imposed, or laid with a political view for the good government and benefit of the community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">According to appellants, the statute imposes a tax solely to benefit a private entity and provides no benefits to the public. They also object to provisions of the statute that allow Legal Mutual to write property, casualty, and surety insurance and to refuse professional liability insurance to lawyers not meeting Legal Mutual\u2019s underwriting standards. Appellants suggest that these provisions emphasize the private purpose of the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We have consistently interpreted Article 15 to require a public purpose for all taxes. <em>Allied, American Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>219 Md. 607, 616, 150 A.2d 421 (1959); <em>Frostburg v. Jenkins, </em>215 Md. 9, 16, 136 A.2d 852 (1957); <em>Board of Education v. Wheat, </em>174 Md. 314, 319, 199 A. 628 (1938); <em>Finan v. M. &amp; C.C. of Cumberland, </em>154 Md. 563, 565, 141 A. 269 (1928); <em>Balto. &amp; E.S.R. Co. v. Spring, </em>80 Md. 510, 517, 31 A. 208 (1895). The use of public funds to benefit private institutions does not, by itself, determine that a tax serves no public purpose. <em>Johns Hopkins Univ. v. Williams, </em>199 Md. 382, 401, 86 A.2d 892 (1952). The Legislature has the primary responsibility for determining whether a particular revenue measure serves a public purpose. <em>Snowden v. Anne Arundel County, </em>295 Md. 429, 435, 456 A.2d 380 (1983). We have recognized that the definition of public purpose will change in response to changing social and economic conditions. <em>Frostburg, supra, </em>215 Md. at 16, 136 A.2d 852. Thus, if \u201cthe legislation has a substantial relation to the public welfare and can fairly be said to serve a public purpose,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 19, 136 A.2d 852, we will not hold the statute violative of Art. 15. Chapter 281 satisfies these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Clearly, the availability of malpractice insurance is important to the public as well as to lawyers and their clients. <em>See Attorney General v. Johnson, </em>282 Md. 274, 281 n. 8, 385 A.2d 57, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>439 U.S. 805, 99 S.Ct. 60, 58 L.Ed.2d 97 (1978); Maryland Code (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol.) Art. 48A, \u00a7 566(a). The Insurance Commissioner has determined that a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in the legal professional liability insurance market. 13 Md.Reg. 720 (1986); 12 Md.Reg. 741-42 (1985). The Legislature has the power to address those problems in whatever constitutionally rational way it chooses. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>282 Md. at 308, 385 A.2d 57. The provisions to which appellants object do not detract from the statute\u2019s public purpose; rather, as discussed below, the General Assembly may have considered them important to the successful operation of Legal Mutual. Thus, we conclude that appellants have not demonstrated the unconstitutionality of Chapter 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">(D)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\n<em>Due Process/Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ak3\">Appellants contend that several provisions of Chapter 281 violate due process and equal protection guarantees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That the court has a limited role in reviewing economic regulatory legislation under the due process and equal protection clause is well settled. We defer to the Legislature unless the challengers demonstrate that the particular statute is clearly arbitrary, oppressive, or unreasonable. We do not judge the wisdom of a particular legislative enactment as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>long as any considerations related to the public welfare support it. <em>New Orleans v. Dukes, </em>427 U.S. 297, 303-04, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2516-17, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976); <em>State v. Good Samaritan Hospital, </em>299 Md. 310, 325-26, 473 A.2d 892 (1984); <em>Westchester West No. 2 v. Mont. Co., </em>276 Md. 448, 455, 348 A.2d 856 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Appellants particularly object to the Legislature\u2019s failure to exempt government and retired attorneys from the tax, the provisions for a credit of the tax against the membership fee, Legal Mutual\u2019s authority to deny coverage to an attorney, and its authority to write property, casualty, and surety insurance in addition to professional liability policies. These provisions, they say, demonstrate that Ch. 281 is arbitrary, oppressive, and unreasonable and thus violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The challenged provisions, however, merely represent permissible legislative choices concerning the proper way to address the problem of availability of legal liability insurance. For example, the General Assembly could have determined that taxing all attorneys was necessary to fund the policyholders\u2019 initial surplus. Furthermore, it could have reasoned that a credit against membership fees would be an incentive for lawyers to join Legal Mutual, which would help to ensure its success. Certainly, provisions related to the success of a legislative attempt to address an economic-social problem relate to the public welfare. We agree with the State that it is a valid exercise of the police power in the circumstances here present, to stabilize and to create or increase competition in the lawyers\u2019 professional liability insurance market. Substantive due process concerns are not transgressed when, as here, the legislative purpose was to prevent lawyers from being denied access to reasonably priced and reliable insurance coverage in order to ensure that they continue to provide essential legal services to the public and to ensure that adequate malpractice coverages exist to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">As to equal protection considerations, it is conceded that any statutory classification under Chapter 281 need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>only have a rational basis to withstand constitutional attack. Thus, any set of facts on which the Legislature reasonably could have based its decision will sustain such a statutory classification. <em>Nordheimer v. Montgomery County, </em>307 Md. 85, 102, 512 A.2d 379 (1986); <em>Good Samaritan, supra, </em>299 Md. at 328-29, 473 A.2d 892; <em>Governor v. Exxon Corp., </em>279 Md. 410, 439, 370 A.2d 1102 (1977), <em>aff'd, </em>437 U.S. 117, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978). Appellants contend that the Legislature\u2019s decision to credit the tax against membership fees for attorneys who join Legal Mutual has no rational basis and thus violates the equal protection clause. As earlier discussed, however, the General Assembly could have determined that the tax credit would encourage membership in Legal Mutual and help to ensure its success. Thus, the exemption from the tax for those lawyers who join Legal Mutual has a rational basis and does not violate the equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">(E)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\n<em>Delegation of Taxing Power</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The state has the inherent power to tax, limited only by the state and federal constitutions. <em>See Katzenberg v. Comptroller, </em>263 Md. 189, 205, 282 A.2d 465 (1971). Article 14 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights requires that no tax be levied without the consent of the General Assembly. Appellants claim that Chapter 281 unconstitutionally delegates this taxing power to Legal Mutual. They appear to reason as follows: (1) That \u00a7 570(b) imposes a tax on all attorneys admitted to practice in Maryland on the date of Legal Mutual\u2019s incorporation; (2) that \u00a7 570(e) requires that Legal Mutual credit this tax against any membership fee; (3) that \u00a7 572(c) allows Legal Mutual to refuse to underwrite any risk or class of risks; and (4) that Legal Mutual therefore determines who must pay the tax and who receives a credit or rebate. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The General Assembly clearly has imposed the tax and determined who shall receive a credit. Neither \u00a7 570(b) nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u00a7 570(e) leaves any discretion to Legal Mutual. Certain attorneys must pay the tax and are entitled to a credit against membership fees if they choose to join Legal Mutual. Although Legal Mutual may refuse to underwrite particular risks, those decisions must be in accord with acceptable underwriting practices as defined by the Insurance Code. \u00a7 572(c). Thus, Legal Mutual does not have the unfettered discretion to deny coverage and thus determine which attorneys receive a rebate of the tax imposed by \u00a7 570(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">(F)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\n<em>Property Tax</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Apellants contend that the tax imposed by \u00a7 570(b) is a property tax and thus subject to the uniformity requirements of Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. They say that the fact that nonpayment of the tax results in a lien on property transforms the purported privilege tax into a property tax. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">In <em>Weaver v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 349, 356, 379 A.2d 399 (1977), we listed the factors that assist a court in determining the nature of a particular tax, i.e. \u201cthe designation placed upon the tax by the Legislature, the subject matter of the tax, and the incidents of the tax, <em>i.e., </em>the manner in which it is assessed and the measure of the tax.\u201d In this case, the General Assembly imposed the tax for the privilege of practicing law in Maryland. \u00a7 570(b). Such a designation is entitled to considerable weight. <em>Weaver, supra, </em>281 Md. at 356, 379 A.2d 399. The legislature directly imposed the flat tax without regard to the value of the lawyer\u2019s property or assets. These incidents of the tax support the interpretation of the tax as an excise or privilege tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Although nonpayment of the tax may result in a lien on the lawyer\u2019s property, so too does failure to pay income, sales, and use taxes. <em>See </em>Code (1957, 1980 Repl.Vol., Cum. Supp.1986) Art. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 322(1), 342(b), 393(b). Yet we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>consistently held that all three taxes are not property taxes required to be uniform by Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights. <em>E.g., Rafferty v. Comptroller, </em>228 Md. 153, 178 A.2d 896 (1962); <em>Lane Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>228 Md. 90, 178 A.2d 904 (1962). Thus, we hold that the tax imposed by \u00a7 570(b) is an excise tax not subject to constitutional uniformity requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">(G)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\n<em>Title of Chapter 281</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Appellants contend that Ch. 281 is unconstitutional because its title violates Article III, \u00a7 29 of the Maryland Constitution, which requires that \u201cevery Law enacted by the General Assembly shall embrace but one subject, and that shall be described in its title____\u201d Appellants urge that the phrase in the bill\u2019s title\u2014\u201cauthorizing the levy of a certain tax\u201d\u2014does not describe sufficiently the tax imposed by \u00a7 570(b) for the privilege of practicing law. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Section 29 requires that the title to a bill inform members of the legislature and the public about the bill\u2019s nature. <em>Whiting-Turner Contract. Co. v. Coupard, </em>304 Md. 340, 361, 499 A.2d 178 (1985). It does not require that the title include an abstract of the bill\u2019s contents. <em>Equitable Life v. State Comm\u2019n, </em>290 Md. 333, 342, 430 A.2d 60 (1981); <em>City of Baltimore v. State, </em>281 Md. 217, 225, 378 A.2d 1326 (1977). Chapter 281 clearly satisfied these requirements. Its title informed the legislature and general public that the bill would levy a tax, and the statute does levy a tax. Greater specificity is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">(H)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">\n<em>Disputed Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">The circuit court, after fully declaring the rights of the parties and refusing to grant the declaratory relief sought by the appellants, entered summary judgment against appellants. Notwithstanding the court\u2019s declaratory judgment adjudicating the appellants\u2019 rights, they contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the trial judge erred in entering summary judgment because a genuine dispute of material fact exists in the case. Specifically appellants claim that the disputed facts relate to whether a reasonable degree of competition actually exists in the legal malpractice insurance market.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Our cases hold that it is not essential that a declaratory judgment be in any particular form as long as the court, by its judgment, actually passes upon or adjudges the issues raised by the pleadings. <em>Bruce v. Dir., Chesapeake Bay Aff., </em>261 Md. 585, 588 n. 1, 276 A.2d 200 (1971); <em>Reddick v. State, </em>218 Md. 18, 31, 130 A.2d 762 (1957). The trial judge correctly concluded that the issues raised by appellants were solely matters of law. Indeed, implicit in the legislation creating Legal Mutual is a legislative determination that a need existed for it in the legal malpractice insurance market. Moreover, the legislature sanctioned the Commissioner\u2019s finding of fact that a reasonable degree of competition did not exist in that market. Neither finding could be challenged in the declaratory judgment action and, accordingly, the court did not err in entering the summary judgment as part of its declaratory ruling in adjudicating the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\">. By order dated April 2, 1987, based on a hearing held on March 17, 1987, the Insurance Commissioner again concluded that a reasonable degree of competition did not exist in the legal malpractice insurance market.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b430-6\">. Legal Mutual is also empowered by the statute (\u00a7 569(c)) to underwrite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">\"(1) Insurance against liability of attorneys for injury arising out of the rendering of or failure to render professional services by the insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">(2) Insurance against the liability of any person for whose acts or omissions an attorney is responsible under the provisions of paragraph (1), or with whom he is associated, including partners, employees, employers, associates, consultants, or a professional service corporation whose stock is owned by an insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">(3) Insurance against other liability for injury by persons employed in, by property used in, or by activities incidental to, the practice of law by the named insured, when issued as incidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>coverage with or supplemental to insurance specified in paragraph</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\">. Appellants do not state whether they base these claims on the Maryland Declaration of Rights or the federal constitution. We have consistently considered guarantees in the Declaration of Rights to be in <em>pari materia </em>with similar provisions of the federal constitution. Thus, we apply the same standards whether the claim alleges violation of a state or federal constitutional right. <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 704-05, 426 A.2d 929 (1981); <em>Pitsenberger v.
