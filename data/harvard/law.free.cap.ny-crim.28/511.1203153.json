(Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 832; Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 392; Penal Law, \u00a7 2444.) It is error to allow evidence of his admission of the fact.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-10\">Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court, rendered June 6, 1912, at a Trial Term for the county of Westchester, upon a verdict convicting the defendant of the crime of murder in the first degree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-11\">The facts, so far as material, are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-12\"><em>John J. Hughes, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad-\">Appellant having denied on his cross-examination any conviction in the State of Hew Jersey, there remained only one way to prove such a conviction, namely, by the record. (Penal Law, \u00a7 2444; Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 832.) It was reversible error to permit Coroner Squire to testify in rebuttal that appellant had told him that he had spent one year and twenty-five days in Trenton jail. (People v. Smith, 172 N. Y. 234; People v. Koerner, 154 N. Y. 355.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-13\"><em>Francis A, Winslow, District Attorney (Lee Parsons Davis </em>of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ani\">The admission of testimony of Coroner Squire, if erroneous, did not affect the substantial rights of the appellant and should be disregarded. (Code Crim. Pro. \u00a7 542.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AD3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Willard Bartlett, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b594-2\">There is no occasion for a discussion of the facts in this case further than to say that the evidence presented an issue for the jury which was submitted to them fairly and which, we think, they disposed of correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\">One error of law was committed by the learned trial judge in the admission of testimony, but we are satisfied that it did not affect the result and, therefore, it is our duty to disregard it. (Code Crim. Pro. \u00a7 542.) As it might occur in other cases, however, where it would prove seriously harmful, if passed over now without comment, we fell bound to call attention to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The defendant took the stand in his own behalf. On cross-examination he denied that he had ever served time in Trenton jail after a conviction in ISTew Jersey or ever served a term of one year and twenty-five days\u2019 imprisonment for striking a man in the eye in that State; and he also denied that he had ever told Ooroner Squire that he had been so convicted and imprisoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Coroner Squire was subsequently called as a witness for the prosecution in rebuttal and testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Q. Did the defendant tell you that he had spent one year and twenty-five days in jail near Trenton for striking a man in the eye ?</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Mr. Hughes: Objected to as leading and irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">\u201c Objection overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Exception taken- by Mr. Hughes. -</p>\n<p id=\"AbL\">\u201c A. He did.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">\u201c By the Court :</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">\u201c Q. Did he tell you that in English ?</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">\u201c A. Yes, sir, the same day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">It was not permissible to prove the defendant\u2019s conviction of crime in this way. In removing the disqualification of convicted persons as witnesses, the legislature prescribed the methods and the only methods by which a conviction can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>proved. (See People v. McGloin, 91 N. Y. 241.) Section 832 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows: \u201c A person, who has been convicted of a crime or misdemeanor is notwithstanding a competent witness in a civil or criminal action or special proceeding; but the conviction may be proved, for the purpose of affecting the weight of his testimony, either by the record, or by his cross-examination, upon which he must answer any question, relevant to that inquiry; and the party cross-examining him is not concluded, by his answer to such a question.\u201d Section 392 of the Code of Criminal Procedure declares that the rules of evidence in civil cases are applicable also to criminal cases; and section 2444 of the Penal Law provides: \u201c A person heretofore or hereafter convicted of any crime is, notwithstanding, a competent witness, in any cause or proceeding, civil or criminal, but the conviction may be proved for the purpose of affecting the weight of his testimony, either by the record, or by his cross-examination, upon which he must answer any proper question relevant to that inquiry and the party cross-examining is not concluded by the answer to such question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">These enactments which thus explicitly prescribe the record or the admission of the witness on cross-examination as the means whereby his conviction may be proved for the purpose of affecting his credibility impliedly prohibit the reception of any other or different proof. This point was not expressly brought to the attention of the learned trial judge in the case at bar when he made the ruling under consideration, the form of the objection being merely that the question put to Coroner Squire was \u201c leading and irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent.\u201d If the reason why it was incompetent had been specified by counsel, we cannot doubt that the objection would have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In view of the fact, however, that the defendant under cross-examination admitted that he had been convicted of assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>three times and that upon two of the. convictions he had served terms in the penitentiary, the erroneous reception of this testimony by Coroner Squire could not have had any appreciable influence upon the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\">USTo other question of law demands discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Cullen, Ch. J., Haight, Vann, Hiscook, Chase and Collin, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Judgment of conviction affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
