Rutherford has applied for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in his appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction of his consolidated lawsuit relating to the denial of his Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) claim. The district court also dismissed with prejudice Rutherford\u2019s related claims against two defendants based on qualified immunity. Rutherford has also filed in this court motions seeking \u201cInjunction of Relief,\u201d a writ of habeas corpus, a \u201cWrit of Release,\u201d a \u201cWrit of Seizure,\u201d and expedited consideration of two of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">To proceed IFP, Rutherford must show that he is a pauper and that the appeal is taken in good faith, <em>ie., </em>that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Rutherford has not shown that he is financially eligible to proceed IFP in his appeal. <em>See Adkins v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 339-40, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948). His motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Examination of the record, Rutherford\u2019s appellate brief, and his various motions and responses show that this appeal is frivolous. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir. 1997). Rutherford\u2019s remaining motions are also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">ALL MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
