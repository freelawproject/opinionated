(\u2018Williams-Sonoma\u201d), in his action alleging both discrimination and retaliation under: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a) and 2000e-3(a); the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a) and 12203(a); and state law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Zamora alleged that, during the course of his employment as an assistant store manager, WilliamsSonoma discriminated against him on the basis of his Cuban national origin and retaliated against him for opposing such discrimination. He also alleged that Williams-Sonoma discriminated against him on the basis of a disability, namely a chronic ankle condition, and retaliated against him for requesting accommodations for this condition. The district court granted Williams-Sonoma summary judgment on the ground that Zamora failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case for any of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>claims. We have carefully reviewed the record, as well as the parties\u2019 briefs, and we reach the same conclusion, finding no genuine issues of material fact. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Williams-Sonoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-14\">. \"This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>summary judgment rulings and draws all inferences and reviews all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Summary judgment is appropriate only if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Moton v. Cowart, </em>631 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2011) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
