Although Pete was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), the district court sentenced Pete to 188 months in prison based on the Government\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(e) motion. The district court ordered the sentence to run consecutively to Pete\u2019s undischarged state probation revocation sentence. Pete appeals, arguing that the imposition of a consecutive sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">We review a sentence, including its consecutive nature, for procedural error and substantive reasonableness in light of the Sentencing Guidelines and the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472 (5th Cir.2006). Because Pete failed to object to his sentence in the district court for the reasons he argues on appeal, we will review for plain error. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009); <em>United States v. Condono, </em>285 F.3d 348, 355 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Pete\u2019s arguments regarding the substantive reasonableness of his sentence are unavailing. When determining a defendant\u2019s sentence, the district court is required to make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. In the instant case, the district court conducted the individualized assessment required. It adopted the PSR\u2019s findings of fact and calculations and considered the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the appropriate sentence. It also reviewed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, explaining how its chosen sentence satisfied those factors. The record reflects that the district court \u201cthoroughly and adequately articulated several \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d that justified the sentence it imposed. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Pete argues that the district court failed to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and his own history and characteristics. In so arguing, Pete seeks to have this court re-weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. A defendant\u2019s disagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525-26 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">Pete also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because his two prior felony convictions and his parole status were already accounted for in the calculation of his criminal history category. The district court was entitled to give these factors additional weight even though they were already accounted in the calculation of Pete\u2019s advisory range. <em>See Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">Pete further argues that his sentence resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity under \u00a7 3553(a)(6) because his codefendants were sentenced to less prison time. \u201cA mere disparity of sentences among codefendants does not, alone, constitute abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Lemons, </em>941 F.2d 309, 320 (5th Cir. 1991). The record in the instant case does not reveal the reasons for Pete\u2019s codefendant\u2019s sentences. It also fails to reveal whether Pete is similarly situated to his codefendants. Thus, we are unable to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>termine whether an unwarranted sentencing disparity occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Pete also argues that the district court, by imposing a consecutive federal sentence, essentially imposed a unlawful life sentence. Pete\u2019s argument is unavailing. Had the Government not filed its \u00a7 3558(e) motion, Pete would have been sentenced to life in prison. <em>United States v. Krumnow, </em>476 F.3d 294, 297 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 108, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Thus, Pete has not shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable, <em>see Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, nor has he rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 525-26. Pete has failed to show error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
