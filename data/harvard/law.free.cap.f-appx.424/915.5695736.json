The district court concluded that he was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) on the ground that Amendment 706 did not lower the applicable guideline range, because he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and Amendment 706 did not affect his status as a career offender. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-11\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706 retroactively lowered the sentencing range applicable to crack cocaine offenses by amending the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) \u201cto provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. Thus, Amendment 706 may be the basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief when a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment was based on the sentencing range determined in accordance with the offense level calculations under \u00a7 2D1.1. But, if a defendant is sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), \u00a7 3582 relief is unavailable because Amendment 706 did not lower the applicable guideline range for career offenders. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">The record here shows that Tomlin was sentenced as a career offender. The applicable sentencing range under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the range under \u00a7 2D1.1 was 155 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Although the district court imposed a sentence of 170 months\u2019 <em>imprisonment </em>\u2014 i.e., a sentence below the \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) range and within the \u00a7 2D1.1 range \u2014 it explicitly clarified that Tomlin was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), with a downward variance based upon certain \u00a7 3553 factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">Since Tomlin\u2019s sentence was not based on the sentencing range determined in accordance with the offense level calculations under \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendment 706 had no effect on the applicable sentencing range, and consequently, he was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thus, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>court properly denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
