The district court imposed a 60-month statutory mandatory minimum sentence for the drug offense, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), and a consecutive 48-month sentence for the \u00a7 860a penalty. Carpenter argues that the 60-month mandatory minimum sentence violates his Fifth Amendment substantive due process rights and is therefore arbitrary in violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Specifically, Carpenter argues that he has a fundamental right to receive a sentence below the statutory minimum and that a narrowly tailored sentencing scheme would allow, for instance, consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">A constitutional challenge to a sentence is typically reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). The Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process of law includes a \u201csubstantive\u201d component, which protects certain rights that are \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d <em>Coventry First, LLC v. McCarty, </em>605 F.3d 865, 870 (11th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted). Any infringement on a fundamental right must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. <em>Reno v. Flores, </em>507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 1447, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). If a fundamental right is not implicated, substantive due process requires only that the challenged government action rationally advance a legitimate government purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 306, 113 S.Ct. at 1449.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>There is no fundamental right to receive a term of imprisonment below a mandatory minimum sentence. <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 467, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 1928, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991); <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1362 (11th Cir.2008). Further, we have specifically held that the 60-month mandatory minimum sentence imposed pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) rationally advances the government\u2019s legitimate purpose in protecting public health and welfare. <em>United States v. Solomon, </em>848 F.2d 156, 157 (11th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>838 F.2d 1175, 1177-78 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">In non-capital cases, the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment encompasses \u201conly a narrow proportionality principle.\u201d <em>United States v. Brant, </em>62 F.3d 367, 368 (11th Cir.1995). We have previously held that the \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) mandatory minimum sentence is not disproportionate to the offense of drug trafficking. <em>Holmes, </em>838 F.2d at 1178-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Carpenter\u2019s 60-month statutory mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) does not violate his substantive due process rights because Congress could rationally find that the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine \u201cposed a particularly great risk to the welfare of society.\u201d <em>Solomon, </em>848 F.2d at 157. The sentence is therefore not arbitrary, nor is it disproportionate to the offense of drug trafficking. <em>Holmes, </em>838 F.2d at 1178-79. Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
