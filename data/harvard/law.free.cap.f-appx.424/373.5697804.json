Ramon, appeals from his conviction of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. He contends solely that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-18\">The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Vega\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; such a claim generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (\u201cIn light of the way our system has developed, in most cases a motion brought under \u00a7 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-23\">Vega\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Attorney Ramon is WARNED that he \u201cha[s] no duty to bring frivolous appeals; the opposite is true[,]\u201d <em>United States v. Burleson, </em>22 F.3d 93, 95 (5th Cir.1994), and that frivolous appeals in the future may subject counsel to sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
