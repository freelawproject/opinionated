The defendants contend that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2285 is unconstitutional for several reasons and also contend that the sentences the district court imposed are procedurally and substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Some time before December 81, 2008, the defendants set out to sea in a semi-submersible vessel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 31, 2008, Coast Guard officers detected the defendants\u2019 vessel in international waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean about 195 miles off the coast of Ecuador. The Coast Guard dispatched a helicopter to investigate and to take photographs of the vessel. The investigation revealed that the semi-submersible vessel had no flag, registration number, home port, or navigational lights. The officers in the helicopter saw two men emerge from the vessel, and shortly after that two more men emerged. All four men (who later turned out to be the defendants in this case) were wearing life jackets. The defendants left the hatch open, abandoned ship, and the semi-submersible vessel began taking on water. Meanwhile, the Coast Guard had dispatched a boat to execute a \u201cright of visit\u201d on the vessel. But by the time that boat reached the scene, the vessel had taken on a lot of water, and despite the Coast Guard\u2019s efforts the vessel sank.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">After being pulled out of the Pacific and transported back to the United States, the defendants were indicted for one count of conspiring to operate a semi-submersible vessel and a second count for aiding and abetting in the operation of the semi-submersible vessel in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2285(a) and (b), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, raising several constitutional challenges to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2285(a) and (b), which the district court rejected. After that motion was denied, the defendants all agreed to change their plea to guilty on the condition that they retain their right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">At the time of the defendants\u2019 joint sentence hearing on August 28, 2009, no sentencing guideline was in effect for \u00a7 2285 offenses. The United States Sentencing Commission had already submitted proposed U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X7.2 to Congress, which would cover \u00a7 2285 offenses, but that guideline would not take effect until November 1, 2009. In addition to a base level of 26 for \u00a7 2285 offenses, the proposed guideline recommended an eight-level enhancement for offenses that involved the sinking of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The defendants\u2019 presentence investigation reports used the proposed guideline and applied its eight-level enhancement. The reports calculated the defendants\u2019 guidelines range at 108 to 135 months. The defendants objected to the use of the proposed guideline and the enhancement and argued that the district court should apply what they asserted was the most closely analogous guideline in effect at that time \u2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X7.1, which applied to border tunnel related offenses. The district court sustained the objection and refused to apply the proposed guideline, but it disagreed with the defendants\u2019 argument that \u00a7 2X7.1 applied by analogy. In the absence of any analogous guidelines, the court determined the sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1 (\u201cIf there is not a sufficiently analogous guideline, the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 shall control. ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">After hearing arguments from Montano-Ortiz\u2019s counsel in mitigation, the district court noted its obligation under \u00a7 3553(a) to consider a number of factors, specifically referring to at least four of them, including the need to avoid \u201cdisparities among defendants with similar records that have been found guilty of similar con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>duct.\u201d The court noted that, although U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X7.2 had not yet taken effect, it would have had \u201cno problem finding\u201d that its eight-level enhancement would have applied to the defendants\u2019 offenses \u201cbut for [its] effective date.\u201d After considering \u201cthat these people have admitted their guilt and avoided trial for the government,\u201d the district court determined that a 108-month sentence would be appropriate and \u201cthat\u2019s what [the court is] going to give them.\u201d The court imposed two concurrent 108-month sentences on MontanoOrtiz, one for each count in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The court then heard arguments from the other defendants\u2019 attorneys in mitigation and allocutions from the three remaining defendants. For each defendant the district court stated that it was expressly considering all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court also stated that it \u201cincorporates by reference what I said\u201d in determining Montano-Ortiz\u2019s sentence. The court imposed two concurrent 108-month sentences on each defendant, one for each count, and found each defendants\u2019 sentence to be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply\u201d with \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">While we review <em>de novo </em>the constitutionality of a statute, <em>United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1365 (11th Cir. 2006), we need not do so if a panel of this Court has already answered that question, <em>see Nguyen v. United States, </em>556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cWe are, of course, bound to follow prior panel precedent that is on point.\u201d). We have already answered the question on three of the grounds raised by the defendants. <em>See United States v. Ibarguen-Mosquera, </em>634 F.3d 1370, 1378-79 (11th Cir.2011) (holding that \u00a7 2285 was within Congress\u2019 enumerated power under the High Seas Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 10); <em>id. </em>at 1381\u2014 82 (holding that \u00a7 2285 did not violate a criminal defendant\u2019s procedural due process rights because it did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proving that the defendant was not involved in illegal conduct); <em>id. </em>(holding that because it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest \u00a7 2285 does not violate substantive due process); <em>see also United States v. Saac, </em>632 F.3d 1203, 1208-12 (11th Cir.2011) (holding that \u00a7 2285 was within Congress\u2019 enumerated power under the High Seas Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">The one question raised by the defendants that has not already been decided in our circuit is whether two terms in \u00a7 2285 \u2014 \u201csemi-submersible vessel\u201d and \u201cintent to evade\u201d \u2014 are unconstitutionally vague as applied to those defendants. \u201cExcept in First Amendment cases, a party who engages in some conduct that is clearly prosribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\u201d <em>Ibarguen-Mosquera, </em>634 F.3d at 1379-80 (quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Holder v. Humanitarian Law </em>Project,-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2705, 2719, 177 L.Ed.2d 355 (2010)). In <em>Ibarguen-Mosquera, </em>we held that under the facts of that case, \u201csemi-submersible vessel\u201d and \u201cintent to evade\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2285 were not vague as applied to the defendants in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 1379-81. In <em>Ibarguen-Mosquera, </em>we interpreted \u201csemi-submersible vessel\u201d as defined by \u00a7 2285 to mean a vessel \u201chaving [the] general ability\u201d of operating with the \u201cgreatest amount\u201d of its hull and bulk under the surface of the water. <em>Id. </em>at 1379-80; <em>see also </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70502(f)(1). The defendants in this ease stipulated to operating a semi-submersible vessel, as defined by \u00a7 2285, and thus stipulated to operating a vessel having the general ability of operating with over half of its hull under water.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>In <em>Ibarguen-Mosquera, </em>we also found that because there was evidence apart from the fact that the defendants were using a semi-submersible vessel, such as no navigational lights, no registration numbers, and no other markings, \u201cintent to evade\u201d was not vague as applied to the defendants in that case. In this case, as in <em>Ibarguen-Mosquera, </em>it is clear that the defendants had an \u201cintent to evade detection\u201d under \u00a7 2285 apart from the fact that they were found in a semi-submersible vessel. <em>See Ibarguen-Mosquera, </em>634 F.3d at 1380-81. The defendants stipulated that the vessel they were operating had no flag, no registration number, no home port, and no navigational lights. <em>See id.; see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2285(b) (stating that the presence of any indicia in 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70507(b)(1)(A), (E), (F), (G), (b)(4), (b)(5), or (b)(6), which includes false registration numbers, nationality, and homeport and a lack of navigational lights, are prima facie evidence of intent to evade detection). Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 2285 is not vague as applied to the defendant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">\u201cWe review sentencing decisions only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). First we \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1237 (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). \u201c[T]he second step is to review the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness under the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597) (quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The defendants contend that their sentences are procedurally and substantively unreasonable for several reasons. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">The defendants argue that their sentences are procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to take their acceptance of responsibility into consideration. We give great deference to a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s entitlement to an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, which \u201cshould not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Knight, </em>562 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2009). In this case, the district court expressly considered Montano-Ortiz\u2019s acceptance of responsibility before imposing his individual sentence. The court expressly stated that it \u201cincorporates by reference\u201d the same factors it considered and reasons it gave in determining Montano-Ortiz\u2019s sentence, which included acceptance of responsibility, before imposing the other defendants\u2019 individual sentences. The district court thus did not procedurally err because it expressly considered each defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility when determining his sentence under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Olaya argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>court should have applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X7.1 as the most analogous guideline under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cWhether a guideline is or is not analogous to a defendant\u2019s criminal activity is a question of law,\u201d which we review <em>de novo. United States v. Gabay, </em>923 F.2d 1536, 1545 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">As there was no guideline expressly applicable to \u00a7 2285 offenses at the time of sentencing, the district court was required to \u201capply the most analogous guideline.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1. If there is no sufficiently analogous guideline, the district court must determine a sentence under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>Olaya argues that \u00a7 2X7.1 was sufficiently analogous and that the district court erred by rejecting his request to consider it. This Court, however, has already resolved that issue in a way that forecloses Olaya\u2019s argument. <em>See Saac, </em>632 F.3d at 1212-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">In <em>Saac, </em>we noted that Section 2X7.1 concerns border tunnels and subterranean passages. <em>Id. </em>at 1212-14; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 2X7.1. And every provision under \u00a7 2X7.1 expressly and solely addresses convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 555, which makes it a crime to construct, finance, and use tunnels or passages that cross the border between the United States and a neighboring country. <em>Saac, </em>632 F.3d at 1212-14; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 2X7.1. Section \u00a7 2285, however, addresses a global \u2014 not just a United States border \u2014 concern of the use of submersible and semi-submersible vessels for smuggling operations in international waters around the world. <em>See Saac, </em>632 F.3d at 1212-14. The conduct involved in constructing, financing, and using border tunnels under \u00a7 855 thus differs materially from the conduct covered under by the \u00a7 2285, which \u201ctargets maritime smuggling in the broader international arena.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court did not err in finding U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X7.1 insufficiently analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Finally, the defendants argue that their sentences are substantively unreasonable. In reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, \u201cwe must, as the Supreme Court has instructed us, consider the totality of the facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010). \u201c[T]he proper factors are set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d and while a district court has substantial discretion in weighing the factors, it can commit \u201ca clear error in judgment when it weighs those factors unreasonably, arriving at a sentence that does not achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court need not discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). And we review findings of fact that underlie the district court\u2019s sentence only for clear error. <em>Gabay, </em>923 F.2d at 1544.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">The gist of the defendants\u2019 arguments are that they received the same 108-month sentence as the defendants in <em>Ibarguen-Mosquera, </em>which also involved \u00a7 2285 offenses. The <em>Ibarguen-Mosquera </em>defendants, however, did not plead guilty, and they forced the government to prove its case at trial. <em>See Ibarguen-Mosquera, </em>634 F.3d at 1377-78. The defendants in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>this case all argue that because they accepted responsibility and the defendants in <em>Ibarguen-Mosquera </em>did not, their sentences should not be the same. But that disparity does not establish that the district court abused its discretion by imposing substantively unreasonable sentences. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1369 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cOf course, some disparity between similarly situated defendants is an inevitable result of <em>Booker.\u201d) </em>For example, in <em>Saac, </em>we held that a 108-month sentence for violations of \u00a7 2285 in which the defendant plead guilty to the conduct charged \u2014 -just like the defendants in this case \u2014 was substantively reasonable. 632 F.3d at 1214-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">In this case, the district court imposed sentences for each defendant individually. Before imposing the sentences, the district court noted its duty to consider all \u00a7 3553(a) factors and expressly considered many of those factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the seriousness of the offense, the need for deterrence, and the need to avoid sentencing disparities. We find no clear error in the court\u2019s finding that if the proposed guideline had been in effect it would have applied because the evidence showed that the defendants sank the semi-submersible vessel. Had the proposed guideline for \u00a7 2285 offenses been in effect, the sentences imposed would have been at the lower end of the guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, </em>607 F.3d 720, 735 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cIf the district court\u2019s sentence is within the guidelines range, we expect that the sentence is reasonable.\u201d). And the sentences were well below the 15-year statutory maximum for violations of \u00a7 2285. We are not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d 1258, 1264-65 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-10\">. While we permit Olaya to adopt his codefendant's contentions, <em>see United States v. Rivera Pedin, </em>861 F.2d 1522, 1526 n. 9 (11th Cir. 1988), we do not allow Olaya to adopt any of the arguments made by appellants in other criminal cases involving 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2285. <em>See United States v. Bichsel, </em>156 F.3d 1148, 1150 n. 1 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-6\">.

Montano-Ortiz and Olaya also argue that their sentences are procedurally unreasonable because the district court should have sentenced them under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X7.2 as it was proposed at the time. At the sentence hearing they both objected to the application of the proposed guideline, so if the court erred by not applying it, Montano-Ortiz and Olaya invited that error. <em>See United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006) (\"It is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
