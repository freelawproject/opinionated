McNeal, federal prisoner # 06212-089, appeals the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his 40-month sentence following a guilty-plea conviction for escape from a federal prison camp. McNeal contends: he is actually innocent of his career-offender sentence enhancement under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1 because his escape conviction is not a crime of violence in the light of <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009); and he is entitled to \u00a7 2241 relief under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). In an appeal from the denial of habeas relief, rulings on legal issues are reviewed <em>de novo; </em>findings of fact, for clear error. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">\u201cSection 2255 provides the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence\u201d based upon alleged errors that occurred at, or prior to, sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 425-26 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). McNeal\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition will be considered only if he establishes that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>Id. </em>at 426. McNeal bears the burden of establishing \u00a7 2255 as an inadequate or ineffective remedy. <em>See id. </em>This requires his showing: (1) his claim \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d; and (2) his claim \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">McNeal\u2019s claim fails the first prong of the <em>Reyes-Requena </em>test because he can <em>not </em>establish that his conviction for escape from a federal prison camp was for a nonexistent offense. A claim of actual innocence of a career-offender <em>enhancement </em>is <em>not </em>a claim of actual innocence of the crime of conviction and, thus, <em>not </em>the type of claim warranting review under \u00a7 2241. <em>E.g., Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 427 (contrasting claims challenging sentencing and claims challenging conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
