Jefferson, alleging that he was subjected to a false arrest and malicious prosecution. The district court determined that AUSA Jefferson was entitled to absolute immunity and dismissed the malicious prosecution claim against him as frivolous. The district court docket sheet reflects that claims remain pending against the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"A4T\">Because the district court dismissed some but not all claims and defendants, we must sua sponte examine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>Martin v. Halliburton, </em>618 F.3d 476, 481 (5th Cir.2010). We have jurisdiction over appeals from (1) final orders pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; (2) orders that are deemed final due to a jurisprudential exception, such as the collateral order doctrine; (3) interlocutory orders specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a); and (4) interlocutory orders that are properly certified for appeal by the district court pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) or \u00a7 1292(b). <em>Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., </em>849 F.2d 955, 957 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Save the Bay, Inc. v. U.S. Army, </em>639 F.2d 1100, 1102 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1981). Because the order from which Poydras appeals does not fall within any of these categories, we lack jurisdiction to consider the appeal, and the appeal is DISMISSED. Poydras\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
