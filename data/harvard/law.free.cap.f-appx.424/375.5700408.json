He contends that this within guidelines sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and, thus, it was substantively unreasonable. More specifically, Juarez argues that, because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and it results in \u201cdouble counting\u201d of prior offenses, his guidelines sentence does not merit a presumption of reasonableness. He also maintains that the guidelines range failed to reflect his personal history and characteristics, including his benign motive for reentering the United States. Finally, he asserts that his sentencing range was unreasonable because of an unwarranted sentencing disparity between defendants sentenced in the Western District of Texas, which does not have a \u201cfast-track\u201d program, and defendants sentenced in districts that do have such a program.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-22\">We need not decide whether, despite his arguments in the district court in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>of a downward variance, Juarez\u2019s failure to object to the reasonableness of the sentence imposed results in plain error review. <em>Compare United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>with United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008). Juarez\u2019s arguments fail under either a plain error or an abuse of discretion standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">We have rejected the contention that a sentence is not substantively reasonable, or that a presumption of reasonableness should not apply, merely because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not supported by empirical data and because it may result in double-counting. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). Furthermore, as Juarez concedes, we have held that the disparity between districts with fast-track programs and districts without them is not unwarranted. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.2008). In this case, the district court made an individualized sentencing decision based on the facts of the case in light of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court\u2019s conclusion that a within guidelines sentence was appropriate is entitled to deference, and we presume that this sentence it is reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1930,176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). We see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s discretionary decision to impose a sentence within the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
