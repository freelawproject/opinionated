This court has a duty to examine the basis of its jurisdiction, sua sponte, if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement in a civil case. <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 213-14, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-24\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A) requires that the notice of appeal in a civil action be filed within 30 days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>of entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken. Hatfield\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely under Rule 4(a)(1)(A) because it was filed at the earliest on September 22, 2010, more than 30 days after the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his suit was entered on May 12, 2010. Additionally, Rule 4(a)(5) and (6) do not assist Hatfield with respect to the untimeliness of his notice of appeal. Given the absence of a timely notice of appeal in this case, this appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
