Linebarger, Goggan, Blair, Pena &amp; Sampson, LLP (Washington </em>I), we held the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, prohibited plaintiff Denise Washington from challenging in federal court the constitutionality of a New Orleans city ordinance assessing a 30% collection penalty on delinquent <em>ad valorem </em>taxes. 338 F.3d 442 (5th Cir.2003). After our decision, in separate litigation, the Louisiana Supreme Court held the 30% collection penalty violated the Louisiana constitution. Washington then reasserted her claims in this putative class action, essentially asking the district court (and now us) to reconsider <em>Washington I </em>in light of the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s decision. For the second time, we hold there is no federal jurisdiction over this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">The essential facts of this case are related in <em>Washington I. </em>In 1998, defendant New Orleans City (the \u201cCity\u201d) enacted an ordinance authorizing the collection of delinquent <em>ad valorem </em>taxes through private parties and assessing an additional 30% penalty to \u201cdefray the costs of collection.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 338 F.3d at 443M4. The City contracted with a collection agency <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a law firm<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>to collect the delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest. <em>Id. </em>at 443. In exchange for their services, the collection agency and the law firm received 30% of the delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest they actually collected. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In 2002, plaintiff Denise Washington, along with other putative class representatives, sued the City, the collection agency, and the law firm in federal court. <em>Id. </em>The lawsuit challenged the constitutionality of the 30% collection penalty. <em>Id. </em>The district court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction under the Tax Injunction Act, which prohibits a federal district court from enjoining, suspending or restraining the \u201cassessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the court of such State.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Washington appealed, asserting the 30% penalty was a \u201cfee\u201d and not a \u201ctax\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1341. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed, finding that the 30% penalty was \u201cinexorably tied to the tax collection itself,\u201d and also that a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy existed in the Louisiana courts. <em>Id. </em>at 444-45. We concluded Washington was required to \u201cchallenge the New Orleans ordinance in Louisiana courts and, if need be, secure review by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On July 1, 2008, in separate litigation, the Louisiana Supreme Court held the City\u2019s imposition and collection of the 30% collection penalty violated the Louisiana constitution. <em>See Fransen v. City of New Orleans, </em>988 So.2d 225, 241-42 (2008) (citing La. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 25). The court specifically found the Louisiana constitution \u201cprohibits methods or proceedings other than tax sales to collect delinquent <em>ad valorem </em>property taxes,\u201d and also prohibits \u201cpenalties, other than interest, upon delinquent ad valorem property taxes on immovables.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 243. Those proceedings are now pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">On December 4, 2009, Washington filed this putative class action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in federal court against the City and Reginald Zeno, the Director of Finance for the Parish of Orleans. The substance of this action is the same as <em>Washington I: </em>Washington asserts the 30% collection penalty violated various provisions of the United States Constitution. Washington seeks restitution, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The district court dismissed Washington\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to the Tax Injunction Act and our decision in <em>Washington </em>I.Washington appealed. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">II.STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s determination that it lacks jurisdiction under the Tax Injunction Act. <em>Washington I, </em>338 F.3d at 444. When, as here, the district court determined its jurisdiction based on the complaint alone, our review is \u201climited to determining whether the district court\u2019s application of the law is correct.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Christus Spohn Health Sys. Corp., </em>628 F.3d 731, 734 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">III.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">A. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">The Tax Injunction Act provides \u201c[t]he district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Section 1341 reflects \u201cthe fundamental principle of comity between federal courts and state governments that is es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>sential to \u2018Our Federalism,\u2019 particularly in the area of state taxation.\u201d <em>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. McNary, </em>454 U.S. 100, 103, 102 S.Ct. 177, 70 L.Ed.2d 271 (1981). Section 1341 is not \u201ca narrow statute aimed only at injunctive interference with tax collection, but is rather a broad restriction on federal jurisdiction in suits that impede state tax administration.\u201d <em>A Bonding Co. v. Sunnuck, </em>629 F.2d 1127, 1133 (5th Cir.1980) (quoting <em>United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Whitman, </em>595 F.2d 323, 326 (5th Cir.1979)); <em>see also Rosewell v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank, </em>450 U.S. 503, 101 S.Ct. 1221, 67 L.Ed.2d 464 (1981) (Section 1341 is \u201ca vehicle to limit drastically federal district court jurisdiction to interfere with so important a local concern as the collection of taxes.\u201d). \u201c[Fjederal courts must guard against interpretations of the Tax Injunction Act which might defeat its purpose and text.\u201d <em>Arkansas v. Farm Credit Servs. of Cent. Ark., </em>520 U.S. 821, 827, 117 S.Ct. 1776, 138 L.Ed.2d 34 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">In <em>Washington I, </em>we held \u00a7 1341 prohibited Washington from challenging the City\u2019s 30% collection penalty in federal court. 338 F.3d at 444-45. We specifically found that the penalty was \u201cinexorably tied to the tax collection itself,\u201d and that Louisiana courts offered a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy for Washington\u2019s claims. <em>Id. </em>In this action, Washington essentially asks us to revisit these findings in light of the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fransen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">As a preliminary matter, <em>Fransen </em>confirms our finding that the Louisiana courts offer a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy for Washington\u2019s claims. The Louisiana Supreme Court has already invalidated the 30% collection penalty, and Washington has identified no reason why the Louisiana courts would not now award and enforce any restitution or damages to which she may be entitled. Washington asserts her claims will be subject \u201cto the whim and caprice of a municipality loathe to pay its judgment creditors,\u201d but it does not appear Washington has even pursued her claims in the Louisiana courts. We decline to presume the Louisiana courts would not adequately protect Washington\u2019s federal rights. <em>See California v. Grace Brethren Church, </em>457 U.S. 393, 417 n. 37, 102 S.Ct. 2498, 73 L.Ed.2d 93 (1982) (rejecting taxpayers\u2019 argument \u201cto the extent that it assumed that the state courts will not protect their constitutional rights\u201d); <em>cf. Smith v. Travis Cnty. Educ. Dist., </em>968 F.2d 453, 456 (5th Cir.1992) (observing \u201cthe taxpayers have not demonstrated that the state courts have refused to entertain their federal claim in their pending state court actions\u201d). Indeed, we have repeatedly recognized that Louisiana\u2019s payment-under-protest statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides an effective procedural vehicle to raise federal claims in Louisiana courts. <em>Washington I, </em>338 F.3d at 444-45; <em>MRT Exploration Co. v. McNamara, </em>731 F.2d 260, 263 n. 5 (5th Cir.1984); <em>United Gas, </em>595 F.2d at 324. Absent unusual circumstances not demonstrated here, this is all \u00a7 1341 requires. <em>See Rosewell, </em>450 U.S. at 523, 101 S.Ct. 1221 (finding state payment-under-protest statute was plain, speedy, and efficient remedy).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Furthermore, that the 30% collection penalty was invalidated by the Louisiana Supreme Court does not affect our finding that the penalty was \u201cinexorably tied\u201d to tax collection. <em>Washington I, </em>338 F.3d at 444. Valid or not, the penalty was an attempt by the City to compel the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>of delinquent <em>ad valorem </em>taxes. Because the penalty directly sought to \u201csustain the essential flow of revenue to the government,\u201d it falls within the broad scope of \u00a7 1341. <em>Home Builders Assoc. of Miss., Inc. v. City of Madison, </em>143 F.3d 1006, 1011 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Lastly, it is of no import that Washington seeks only retrospective relief (i.e., restitution, damages, fees, and costs) and not an injunction against future enforcement of the 30% collection penalty. <em>United Gas, </em>595 F.2d at 327 (finding \u00a7 1341 \u201cprecludes actions for refunds even if anticipatory relief is not sought\u201d). Nor does it matter that Washington\u2019s claims are asserted under \u00a7 1983. <em>See, e.g., McNary, </em>454 U.S. at 116, 102 S.Ct. 177 (holding \u201ctaxpayers are barred by the principle of comity from asserting \u00a7 1983 actions against the validity of state tax systems in federal courts\u201d); <em>Moss v. State of Georgia, </em>655 F.2d 668, 669 (5th Cir.1981) (holding \u00a7 1341 barred \u00a7 1983 action seeking compensatory and punitive damages for allegedly unconstitutional <em>ad valorem </em>taxes).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is because the purpose of \u00a7 1341 is to protect the integrity of the state treasury, and a suit for a refund can be as disruptive of state tax administration as a suit for declaratory or injunctive relief. <em>Sunnuck, </em>629 F.2d at 1133; <em>United Gas, </em>595 F.2d at 327. Washington emphasizes that her claims seek restitution of an invalid penalty and not a tax per se. This argument simply fails to acknowledge the breadth of \u00a7 1341. Ordering the City to return millions of dollars assessed to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes plainly would disrupt Louisiana\u2019s \u201cfiscal operations\u201d and \u201cstate tax administration.\u201d <em>Sunnuck, </em>629 F.2d at 1130, 1133; <em>see also McQueen v. Bullock, </em>907 F.2d 1544, 1547 (5th Cir. 1990). Section 1341 requires that \u201csuch judicial threats should come only from state courts.\u201d <em>Sunnuck, </em>629 F.2d at 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">In sum, the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fransen </em>presents no reason to disturb our decision in <em>Washington I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">B. Writ of prohibition</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Certain documents in the pending state-court <em>Fransen </em>action are covered by a protective order. Washington\u2019s counsel, Henry Klein, moved the state trial court to lift the protective order in order to file the protected documents in this action. The trial court ruled that Klein needed to either proceed by \u201crule to show cause,\u201d or else independently obtain the documents with a federal subpoena. Klein then directed a federal subpoena to the <em>plaintiffs </em>in the <em>Fransen </em>litigation (who are themselves bound by the protective order and represented by Klein), and filed the protected documents in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">The state trial court held Klein in contempt for violating its protective order. The trial court ordered Klein to remove the protected documents from the record in this action, and not to make any further use of the documents outside the <em>Fransen </em>action. Klein sought review of the trial court\u2019s contempt order in the Louisiana court of appeal. The court of appeal upheld the trial court\u2019s finding of contempt, but also held the trial court was without jurisdiction to order documents removed from federal court. The protected documents remain in the record on appeal in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">Klein now seeks a writ of prohibition preventing the state trial court from further enforcing its contempt order. We deny the motion. Klein has identified no authority permitting a party to flout a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>state court protective order simply because documents in a state action might prove useful in a separate federal action. We observe the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure offered Klein ample opportunity to obtain the documents he needed without violating the state court\u2019s protective order. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 34(c), 45 (authorizing third-party subpoenas). Although it appears Klein attempted to use a Rule 45 subpoena, the subpoena was directed not to the third parties that originally possessed the disputed documents, but instead to Klein\u2019s own clients who are themselves bound by the protective order. It was for the state trial court to determine whether this strategy violated its protective order and, if so, what sanctions are appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">For the reasons stated, the district court\u2019s decision dismissing this case is AFFIRMED. Appellant\u2019s motion for writ of prohibition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
