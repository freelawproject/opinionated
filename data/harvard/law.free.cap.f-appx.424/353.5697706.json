Albritton challenges only the court\u2019s underlying judgment dismissing his complaint as frivolous. He does not challenge the court\u2019s postjudgment order in which it rejected his claim that he had filed a notice of appeal on March 14, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-25\">For civil appeals, \u201c[t]he filing of a timely notice of appeal, within thirty days after entry of the court\u2019s judgment, is mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Kinsley v. Lakeview Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr. LLC, </em>570 F.3d 586, 588 (5th Cir.2009). Because the record does not reveal a timely notice of appeal from the underlying judgment, this court lacks jurisdiction to review Albritton\u2019s argument. <em>See id. </em>Although we have juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>diction to review the court\u2019s subsequent postjudgment order, Albritton has failed to brief any argument challenging the order and, therefore, has abandoned the only cognizable claim on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v.
