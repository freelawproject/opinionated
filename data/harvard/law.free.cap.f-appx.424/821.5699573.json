After careful review, we affirm Biddy\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>A sentence is proeedurally unreasonable if the district court selected a sentence based upon clearly erroneous facts. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). When sentencing a defendant, a district court may not rely solely upon the government\u2019s assertions that evidence exists, or summaries of evidence the government is able to present. <em>See United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559, 1567-69 (factual findings made at initial sentencing hearing were clearly erroneous because no record evidence existed despite government\u2019s summary of evidence that it could present). Nonetheless, we will affirm a sentence where an error is harmless and non-constitutional. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2005) (affirming sentence despite non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error). A non-constitutional error is harmless if, considering the proceedings in their entirety, the error did not affect the sentence, or only had a slight effect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The district court clearly erred in finding that Biddy accessed child pornography while on supervised release because there was no evidence presented at the revocation hearing to support that finding. <em>See Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d at 1567-69. The error was harmless, however, because the district court did not rely on the incorrect finding in fashioning Biddy\u2019s sentence. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292-93. Upon Biddy\u2019s objection to the sentence, the court specifically stated it was imposing a term of imprisonment because Biddy violated the prohibition against accessing a computer and viewing \u201cany pornographic materials whatsoever.\u201d This limited the court\u2019s previous statement that Biddy had \u201caccessed pornographic materials involving both adults and minors.\u201d Thus, the court did not base Biddy\u2019s sentence on the Government\u2019s unproven assertion, but rather on the fact that Biddy accessed a computer and actively sought out pornographic material in violation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Further, Biddy\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The court specifically considered deterrence, the nature and circumstances of the offense and the need for correctional and/or medical treatment for Biddy\u2019s recidivist behavior. Although the district court sentenced Biddy above the Guidelines, it based Biddy\u2019s sentence on the fact that he engaged in conduct related to his underlying convictions for receiving child pornography. We have upheld sentences above the applicable Guidelines range where the supervised release violation paralleled the conduct for which the defendant was originally convicted. <em>See United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378-79 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010). Accordingly, we affirm Biddy\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-15\">. The terms of Biddy\u2019s supervised release prohibited him from owning, possessing, or otherwise accessing a computer. At his revocation hearing, Biddy admitted to accessing a computer and the internet to seek out adult pornography. The Government alleged Biddy encountered child pornography as well but did not offer evidence at the revocation hearing to prove this assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-25\">.
