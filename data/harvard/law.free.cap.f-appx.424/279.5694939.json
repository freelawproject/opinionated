Orozco\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Bates contends the district court erred in ruling that Officer Orozco was entitled to qualified immunity. Bates claims Officer Orozco violated Bates\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights because there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>was no probable cause justifying his initial detention, subsequent searches, and arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">A summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Xtreme Lashes, LLC v. Xtended Beauty, Inc., </em>576 F.3d 221, 226 (5th Cir.2009). When defendant asserts qualified immunity, the court must determine whether plaintiff presents a violation of a statutory or constitutional right and, if he does, \u201cwhether that right was \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time of the defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct\u201d. <em>Ontiveros v. City of Rosenberg, </em>564 F.3d 379, 382 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Bates fails to show he was subjected to an unlawful detention, search, or arrest. Officer Orozco had articulable facts supporting his reasonable suspicion that justified Bates\u2019 initial detention. <em>See United States v. Michelletti, </em>13 F.3d 838, 840 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). Additionally, Officer Orozco\u2019s actions following the initial detention were reasonably related to the circumstances justifying it. <em>See United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 506-07 (5th Cir. 2004). Because Bates did not show a violation of the claimed constitutional right, the district court properly granted summary judgment on ruling that Officer Orozco was entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Ontiveros, </em>564 F.3d at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
