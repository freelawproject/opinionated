No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">Trial testimony revealed that Pineiro worked for United Parcel Service (\u201cUPS\u201d) as a cargo handler at the Miami International Airport. Authorities with UPS had been alerted to a suspicious package aboard a cargo plane arriving in Miami from the Dominican Republic. With the aid of surveillance cameras, authorities discovered that Pineiro had removed the package from the tarmac, hid it in a grocery bag under a bag of potato chips, and put it in his car. Pineiro\u2019s codefendants (two of his fellow coworkers) later removed the package from Pineiro\u2019s car and exited the airport in two separate cars. Law enforcement officers conducted a traffic stop and discovered that the package contained 2,883 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>At trial, Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent Marco Suarez testified for the government. Suarez had interviewed Pineiro after arresting him and issuing him Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings. In pertinent part, Suarez testified (1) that Pineiro told him that one of his codefendants had asked Pineiro to remove the package and (2) that, although the codefendant had not told him what was in the package, Pineiro thought the package contained either drugs or money. On redirect examination, Suarez answered that he had no way to verify whether Pineiro\u2019s statement about his lack of knowledge of what was in the package was true: \u201cAll I had was the statement he made to me.\u201d Pineiro objected to this line of questioning and moved for a mistrial, arguing that Pineiro\u2019s lack of knowledge could be verified by the statements of his codefendants, who had admitted that they did not tell Pineiro what was in the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">On appeal, Pineiro argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial because the government improperly questioned Suarez on re-direct examination about Pineiro\u2019s post-arrest statement that he did not know the contents of the package. He contends that the questioning produced the erroneous and false conclusion that no corroboration existed for the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a mistrial motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ettinger, </em>344 F.3d 1149, 1161 (11th Cir.2003). A defendant is entitled to a mistrial only upon a showing of substantial prejudice. <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1352 (11th Cir. 1999). In addition, prosecutorial misconduct requires a new trial only if we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks (1) were improper and (2) prejudiced defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1438 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">We discern no abuse of discretion here and conclude that the government made no improper remarks. That Pineiro\u2019s codefendants may not have expressly informed Pineiro that the package contained cocaine does not fully corroborate Pineiro\u2019s statement that he did not know personally what the package contained. The government never implied that the codefendants had implicated Pineiro or that the codefendants had contradicted Pineiro\u2019s statement that his codefendant had never told him of the package\u2019s contents. Thus, Suarez\u2019s statement that no additional evidence showed Pineiro\u2019s complete lack of knowledge about the contents of the package other than Pineiro\u2019s own statement was not false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">More important, and even assuming the question was improper, we cannot say the government\u2019s line of questioning prejudiced Pineiro\u2019s substantial rights given the wealth of evidence against him. Video evidence showed Pineiro removing the package and hiding it in a grocery bag before taking it to his car. And Pineiro told Suarez that he thought the package contained money or drugs. In addition, Suarez testified as an expert that the package felt like \u201cthree kilograms of brick narcotics that were bound together very tightly with tape.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rouco, </em>765 F.2d 983, 992 (11th Cir.1985) (explaining that prejudicial testimony is less likely to mandate a mistrial when there is other significant evidence of guilt that reduces the likelihood that the otherwise improper testimony had a substantial impact on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>verdict of the jury).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AS5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-7\">. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1624, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b864-15\">. Because we conclude that no improper remark or substantial prejudice occurred, we reject Pineiro\u2019s argument that the government\u2019s line of questioning improperly shifted the burden to him to prove his lack of knowledge. <em>See United States v. Simon, </em>964 F.2d 1082, 1086 (11th Cir.1992) (recognizing that a prosecutor's comment may be so prejudicial as to shift the burden of proof and may require reversal if the misconduct is so pronounced and persistent that it permeates the entire atmosphere of the trial). And even still, the district court properly instructed the jury on the government\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
