After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">For purposes of this appeal, the summary judgment facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">A. Kurzweg\u2019s Employment with SCP</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">Beginning in 2005, Kurzweg worked as a delivery truck driver for SCP, which required him to load and unload the truck. In May 2007, Kurzweg was placed on discretionary leave while he had bladder surgery. In July 2007, Kurzweg returned to work with a doctor\u2019s restriction not to lift more than fifty pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">On April 9, 2008, Kurzweg was placed on discretionary leave so he could have neck surgery. On May 1, 2008, Kurzweg\u2019s doctor sent a letter to SCP advising that Kurzweg was not yet able to return to work. On May 8, 2008, Kurzweg\u2019s doctor had still not released him to return to work, but his available leave time expired on May 8. SCP extended Kurzweg\u2019s discretionary leave to June 8, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">On June 9, 2008, Kurzweg did not return to work. On June 16, 2008, SCP received a \u201cPhysical Capabilities Worksheet\u201d from Kurzweg\u2019s doctor indicating that Kurzweg could return to work with no restrictions. On June 19, 2008, SCP sent Kurzweg a letter terminating his employment effective June 9, 2008. In July 2008, Kurzweg filed a charge of disability discrimination with the Florida Commission on Human Relations based on his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">B. Social Security Disability Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">Off and on since 2003, Kurzweg had been treated by Dr. Faisal Munasifi, a psychiatrist. Dr. Munasifi diagnosed Kurzweg in 2003 with bipolar disorder and attention deficit disorder and prescribed Lithium and Stratera. Dr. Munasifi had last seen Kurzweg in October 2006, at which time Kurzweg\u2019s mental status was stable.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-17\">After his termination in June 2008, Kurzweg became severely depressed. In the fall of 2008, Kurzweg began seeing Dr. Munasifi again. Kurzweg told Dr. Munasifi that he had recently developed cancer, for which he was receiving treatments, and had been terminated from his employment. Based on their sessions, Dr. Munasifi opined that Kurzweg\u2019s termination was a \u201cmajor stressor\u201d that \u201chad complicated his mental health conditions\u201d and that Kurzweg\u2019s termination and medical conditions contributed significantly to the deterioration of Kurzweg\u2019s mental status.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-18\">In May 2009, Kurzweg filed an application for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits. Kurzweg\u2019s application alleged an onset date of June 9, 2008, the effective date of his termination from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>SCP. Kurzweg\u2019s application stated that he \u201cbecame unable to work because of [his] disabling condition\u201d on that date. On January 26, 2010, the Social Security Administration issued a favorable determination on Kurzweg\u2019s SSDI claim, finding that he met the medical requirements of disability and that the onset date was established as of June 9, 2008.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">C. Kurzweg\u2019s ADA Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">On August 28, 2009, Kurzweg filed this complaint alleging that SCP violated his rights under the ADA and the FCRA when it terminated him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following discovery, SCP moved for summary judgment, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that Kurzweg\u2019s ADA claim was barred because it was inconsistent with his statements in his SSDI application that he was unable to work as of June 9, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">During a summary judgment hearing, Kurzweg explained that the SSA had used the June 9 termination date as the disability onset date because that was the last day Kurzweg had worked. Kurzweg maintained that on June 9, 2008 he was actually able to perform the duties of his job and that he only became disabled afterward based, at least in part, on the deterioration of his mental health condition after learning of his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">The district court, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., </em>526 U.S. 795, 119 S.Ct. 1597, 143 L.Ed.2d 966 (1999), concluded that Kurzweg\u2019s explanation for the inconsistency between his representations to the SSA and his representations in the ADA case was not sufficient. The district court noted that, under <em>Cleveland, </em>it was possible for an employee to be able to work with an accommodation and be disabled for Social Security purposes without that accommodation, but that Kurzweg was not making such a claim. The district court concluded that \u201cit is not an adequate explanation to say, as the plaintiff seems to say here, I was able to work, I was wrong when I asserted to the Social Security Administration that I was unable to work. I got the benefits, though I wasn\u2019t entitled to them. In fact, I didn\u2019t become disabled until later, after the date when I told the Social Security Administration I was disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">After the hearing, the district court entered an order granting SCP\u2019s summary judgment motion and adopting the reasons the court had set out \u201cat greater length\u201d during the hearing. The district court\u2019s order further stated that \u201c[o]n the facts of this case, the plaintiff could not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>both qualified for his job as of June 9, 2008, as required under the ADA, and unable to work as of that date, as he successfully asserted in his social-security application,\u201d and, thus, Kurzweg\u2019s ADA claim was barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Kurzweg filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Under the ADA, an employer may not discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is one who, \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position.... \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). Thus, \u201c[b]ecause the ADA reserves its protections for individuals still able to perform the essential functions of a job, albeit perhaps with reasonable accommodation, a plaintiff who is totally disabled and unable to work at all is precluded from suing for discrimination thereunder.\u201d <em>Slomcenski v. Citibank, N.A., </em>432 F.3d 1271, 1280 (11th Cir.2005) (involving a claim of long-term disability benefits under an ERISA plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">To obtain social security disability benefits, an applicant must prove he is disabled. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). A disability is defined as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). The impairment must be \u201cof such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">In <em>Cleveland, </em>the Supreme Court stated that \u201cin context, these two seemingly divergent statutory contentions are often consistent\u201d and that the \u201cpursuit, and receipt, of SSDI benefits does not automatically estop the recipient from pursuing an ADA claim.\u201d 526 U.S. at 797, 119 S.Ct. at 1600. However, to survive summary judgment, \u201can ADA plaintiff cannot simply ignore her SSDI contention that she was too disabled to work\u201d but \u201cmust explain why that SSDI contention is consistent with her ADA claim that she could \u2018perform the essential functions\u2019 of her previous job, at least with \u2018reasonable accommodation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>119 S.Ct. at 1600; <em>see also Talavera v. Sch. Bd. of Palm Beach Cnty., </em>129 F.3d 1214, 1220 (11th Cir.1997) (explaining that whether a certification of total disability for SSDI purposes is inconsistent with an ADA claim depends on \u201cthe facts of the case, including the specific representations made in the application for disability benefits and the nature and extent of the medical evidence in the record,\u201d but that \u201can ADA plaintiff is estopped from denying the truth of any statements made in her disability application\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">The Supreme Court identified several ways an ADA plaintiff might be able to perform the essential functions of the job, but still be deemed \u201cdisabled\u201d by the SSA. First, an SSDI applicant might be able to perform the work with a reasonable ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>commodation, but the SSA does not take possible reasonable accommodations into account in determining whether an SSDI applicant is disabled. <em>Cleveland, </em>526 U.S. at 803, 119 S.Ct. at 1602. Second, an SSDI applicant who can actually perform the work may qualify as disabled under the impairment listings in the SSA\u2019s regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 804, 119 S.Ct. at 1602-03. Finally, an SSDI applicant may fall within the agency\u2019s nine-month trial-work period used to facilitate reentry into the workforce. <em>Id. </em>at 805, 119 S.Ct. at 1603.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Here, Kurzweg\u2019s statements to the SSA were inconsistent with his ADA claim. The SSA sent Kurzweg a March 3, 2009 application summary that contained a summary of Kurzweg\u2019s statements to the SSA used to complete his electronically stored SSDI application. According to the summary, Kurzweg stated, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cI became unable to work because of my disabling condition on June 9, 2008,\u201d and he \u201caffirm[ed] that all information I have given in connection with this claim is true.\u201d Kurzweg, who was represented by an attorney in the SSA proceedings, does not appear to have done anything to correct the onset date. The SSA\u2019s subsequent favorable decision states that Kurzweg was \u201calleging disability since June 9, 2008.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Furthermore, Kurzweg\u2019s explanation for his inconsistent representations does not fall within any of the examples listed in <em>Cleveland. </em>Kurzweg did not argue that he needed a reasonable accommodation to do his job for SCP. In fact, he claimed he was fully able to do his job on June 9, 2009, stressing that his doctor had released him to return to work without restrictions. Kurzweg did not contend his impairments met or equaled an impairment listing or that he was in a nine-month trial-work period. Instead, Kurzweg essentially argued that the SSA erroneously (and without his objection) used his termination date, when in fact he was fully able to do his job on that date and that the real onset date occurred sometime after he learned he had been terminated and became severely depressed. We agree with the district court that Kurzweg\u2019s explanation does not reconcile the inconsistency in his representations before the SSA and in this ADA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Kurzweg successfully maintained before the SSA that he was unable to do his past relevant work (i.e., his work at SCP) as of June 9, 2008 due to his disability. Therefore, Kurzweg is estopped from asserting in this ADA action that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job at SCP on June 9, 2008, when SCP terminated him. Accordingly, the district court properly granted SCP\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-13\">. We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Witter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir. 1998). Summary judgment should be granted \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.RXiv.P. 56(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-7\">. The SSA's decision found, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) Kurzweg had not engaged in any substantial gainful employment since June 9, 2008; (2) he had the severe impairments of \u201cresiduals of invasive urothelial carcinoma, status-post radical cystoprostatectomy with ileostomy and urinary diversion; lymphoma (versus lymphoproliferative disorder); bipolar disorder; attention deficit disorder; cervical degenerative disc disease; sleep apnea; and restless leg syndrome\u201d; (3) Kurzweg was unable to perform his past relevant work because the demands of that work \"exceed the residual functional capacity\u201d; and (4) Kurzweg had the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work, but that he could not perform such work for eight hours a day, five days a week due to \"psychologically based symptoms\u201d; he could not perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods; he could not deal with normal work stress; and he could not meet competitive standards for maintaining regular attendance and being punctual within customary, usually strict tolerances, sustaining an ordinary routine without special supervision and working in coordination with or in proximity to others without being unduly distracted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b866-13\">. Kurzweg filed his action in Florida state court, and SCP removed the action to federal district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b867-9\">. Although SCP moved for summary judgment on Kurzweg\u2019s FCRA claim, the district court\u2019s summary judgment order did not explicitly address this claim. Nonetheless, because Kurzweg\u2019s FCRA and ADA claims were essentially identical and are analyzed under the same framework, see <em>Greenberg v. Bell-South Telecomms., Inc., </em>498 F.3d 1258, 1263-64 (11th Cir.2007), the district court necessarily denied the FCRA claim for the same reasons it denied the ADA claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
