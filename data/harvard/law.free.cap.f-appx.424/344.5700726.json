Bolden argues that the district court erred in denying a safety valve reduction because the Government\u2019s assertion that he was untruthful was based on mere conjecture. He further asserts that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA) should be applicable to his case because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>his appeal was still pending at the time Congress enacted the provision. Additionally, Bolden argues that because the FSA imposed only a procedural change, it is exempt from the Savings Clause. Bolden\u2019s motion to file his reply brief and record excerpts under seal is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision whether to grant a safety valve adjustment for clear error. <em>United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457 (5th Cir.2006). Here, the district court made an \u201cindependent determination,\u201d concluding that Bolden\u2019s testimony was not credible and that, as evidenced by the credibility and demeanor of all the witnesses, Bolden had not been completely truthful with the Government. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 968 (5th Cir.1999). We afford great deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determination. <em>United States v. Powers, </em>168 F.3d 741, 753 (5th Cir.1999). Moreover, the district court\u2019s factual determination is plausible in light of the entire record. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in denying a safety valve reduction based on Bolden\u2019s failure to truthfully and fully disclose to the Government. <em>See Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961 at 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Bolden\u2019s assertion that the FSA is applicable to his case is equally without merit. We have held that pursuant to the federal Savings Clause, which requires courts to apply the penalties in place at the time the defendant committed the offense unless the relevant act expressly states otherwise, <em>see </em>1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, the FSA\u2019s reduction of statutory penalties in \u00a7 841 was not retroactive. <em>United States v. Doggins, </em>633 F.3d 379, 384 (5th Cir.2011). Bolden committed the instant offense on July 24, 2008; therefore, the FSA is of no benefit to him in spite of the fact that his appeal was still pending when the FSA was enacted. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\"> Pursuant to <em>5m </em>Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
