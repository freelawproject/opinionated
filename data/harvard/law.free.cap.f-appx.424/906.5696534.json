Campos argues that he should not have received a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b) for having previously been deported after a felony conviction for a drug trafficking offense. He argues that his prior state conviction was not for a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d as defined by the Sentencing Guidelines, because \u201cintent to distribute\u201d is not an element of the North Carolina statute under which he was convicted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-23\">The district court properly held that Campos\u2019s objection to the 16-level enhancement was foreclosed by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228 (11th Cir.2003), in which we expressly rejected the argument that \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d requires that intent to distrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>ute be an element of the statute of conviction, and held that \u201cfederal law [ ] permits an inference of intent to distribute from a defendant\u2019s possession of a significantly large quantity of drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1233 (citation omitted). <em>See also United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150 (11th Cir.2005) (relying on <em>Madera-Madera </em>to hold that intent to distribute can be inferred from the defendant\u2019s possession of between 200 and 400 grams of cocaine).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Campos was previously deported after a felony conviction for \u201ctrafficking in cocaine\u201d by possessing \u201c200 grams or more, but less than 400 grams,\u201d in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-95(h)(3)(b). Accordingly, under <em>Madera-Madera </em>and <em>James, </em>the district court did not err in applying a 16-level enhancement to Campos\u2019s guidelines range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-16\">.
