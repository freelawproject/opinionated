Casta\u00f1eda now contends that his 37-month sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court placed undue weight on and improperly relied on his prior criminal conduct, which had already been included in calculating his Guideline range. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s sentence fell at the top of the applicable 30-37 month range, and we ordinarily expect guideline sentences to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Moreover, Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s 37-month sentence was also well below the 20-year statutory maximum penalty. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (holding that the sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">The district court did emphasize Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s prior criminal convictions. However, the court also explicitly or implicitly referenced several other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. For example, the court inquired about sentences for defendants in illegal re-entry cases with a criminal history category V. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). The court also discussed the need for deterrence, the need to protect the community, and the hope that incarceration would help Casta\u00f1eda deal with his alcohol addiction. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C), (D). To Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s benefit, the district court considered that Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s family resides in Mexico, but ultimately determined that his family was not a sufficient deterrent to prevent a future attempt to re-enter the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>Therefore, although the court placed emphasis on Castaheda\u2019s prior convictions, it did not do so \u201csingle-mindedly\u201d to the detriment of the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006) (holding a sentence unreasonable when the court focused \u201csingle-mindedly\u201d on restitution). The weight to be given any particular factor is left to the sound discretion of the district court absent a clear error of judgment. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). Because Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s sentence was supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court did not commit a clear error of judgment in weighing those factors. As the district court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm the sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
