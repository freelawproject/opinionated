We will dismiss this appeal as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-20\">In dismissing Davis\u2019s complaint, the District Court observed that it \u201crepresented] the third action that plaintiff has filed within the past three months, with each action naming Thomas M. Gauby, Sr., Linda K.M. Ludgate, Kevin D. Gillespie, and Kevin M. Beals as defendants.\u201d In <em>Davis v. Gauby, </em>408 Fed.Appx. 524 (3d Cir.2010) (per curiam), we analyzed one such suit, whose claims were identical to those currently before us: allegations of institutional abuse now barred by the statute of limitations, unclear references to bias and denial of due process, charges of judicial and prosecutorial misconduct, and habeas corpus arguments (such as ineffective assistance of counsel) \u2014 all haphazardly pleaded in a freewheeling style that assumed previous familiarity with the actors and events while equating conclusion with fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time, we determined that Davis\u2019s appeal was meritless. <em>Id. </em>408 Fed.Appx. at 526-27. In the interests of judicial economy, we decline to repeat today our analysis of his claims, and instead incorporate by reference our prior decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-21\">Furthermore, we agree with the District Court that this suit shows Davis\u2019s \u201clack of regard for the Court\u2019s limited time and resources.\u201d Accordingly, we will dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the appeal as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Davis\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied; to the extent that his other filings with this Court (many styled as \u201cmotions\u201d) request independent relief, they are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-16\">. <em>E.g., </em>\"The police have violated my due process I have the right by law to make a statement my 8th amendment was denied on the ground I had the right to press charges on the correctional officers who had assault battery me I was denied my rights by the police officer who never investigation on the case racist discrimination play big part in this case.\u201d 9/20/2010 Statement 3, ECF No. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-22\">. To the extent that Davis raised one <em>new </em>claim' \u2014 an access-to-the-courts charge, predicated at least partly on interference with his legal mail \u2014 he asserted it for the first time on appeal; hence, we decline to address it. <em>Harris v.
