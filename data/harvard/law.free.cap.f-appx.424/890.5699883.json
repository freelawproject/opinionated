On appeal, Manzano-Hernandez argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not adequately explain the sentence. He also argues that the sentence was substantively unreasonable because the court relied too heavily on his criminal history, which was already accounted for in his guideline range of 21-27 months, when it imposed an upward variance and 72-month sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Manzano-Hernandez first entered the United States illegally in 1996 and was ultimately ordered removed. He illegally reentered and was later arrested for driving under the influence in 2002. Following his removal, he again reentered and was arrested for driving under the influence in 2003 and domestic battery in 2005. He was removed in 2007. In June 2009, Manzano-Hernandez illegally reentered and was arrested the following year for driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Manzano-Hernandez was charged with and pleaded guilty to one count of illegal reentry after deportation. The district court calculated his sentencing guideline range as follows: Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the base offense level was eight. There was a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D) because Manzano-Hernandez had been previously deported, and a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Based on his prior reentries and driving-under-the-influence offenses, Manzano-Hernandez had a lengthy criminal history, which placed him in category V. He also had numerous other convictions which were not counted in his criminal history calculations. The resulting guideline range was 21 to 27 months. The government requested an upward variance; Manzano-Hernandez requested a sentence within the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">The district court noted that ManzanoHernandez had been imprisoned for fifteen months, the top end of the guideline range, following his prior illegal reentry and that he had quickly returned to the United States after completion of his supervised release. After considering the guideline range, the statutory factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and the parties\u2019 arguments, the court determined that an upward variance from the guideline range was necessary to meet the goals of sentencing. Finding that a sentence at the top end of the guideline range had been no deterrent previously, the court sentenced ManzanoHernandez to 72 months\u2019 imprisonment. Manzano-Hernandez objected to the sentence and now appeals on the ground that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), pet. for cert, filed </em>(U.S. Nov. 24, 2010) (No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>10-727). We will only vacate a sentence if \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3558(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the ease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we conduct a two-step review, first ensuring that the sentence was procedurally reasonable, meaning the district court properly calculated the guideline range, treated the guideline range as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and \u201cadequately explain[ed] the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA district court\u2019s unjustified reliance on a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor may be a \u2018symptom\u2019 of an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir. 2008). But it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to determine how much weight to give to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, and where the court has explained why it \u201cattached great weight to one factor,\u201d we have held the sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally sound, we must examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the' offense, adequately deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">When reviewing a sentence outside of the guideline range, we \u201cmay not apply a presumption of unreasonableness.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">We conclude that Manzano-Hernandez\u2019s 72-month sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district court properly calculated the guideline range, treated that range as advisory, stated that it needed to impose a sentence that met the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and explained which factors most influenced its decision to impose an upward variance. The court explained that because of Manzano-Hernandez\u2019s criminal history and recidivism, it relied most heavily on the prior conduct, the need to protect the public from future crimes, and the need for deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">We further conclude that Manzano-Hernandez\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. Manzano-Hernandez had been convicted for driving under the influence four times, he had been deported from the United States twice, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>before the court on his second conviction for illegal reentry. Furthermore, his last sentence for illegal reentry was at the high-end of the guideline range, and yet he committed this illegal reentry less than a year after his supervised release in that case ended. The upward variance was thus justified by his criminal history and the lack of deterrence from the previous sentence. We cannot say that the court abused its discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
