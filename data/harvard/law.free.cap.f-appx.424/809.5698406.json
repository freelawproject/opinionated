Seognamiglio argues that the district court clearly erred by finding that Seognamiglio took a substantial step toward executing his murder plot to justify application of the United States Sentencing Guideline for attempted murder. The district court committed no reversible error; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">The guideline for unlawful possession of a firearm under Section 922(k), to which Seognamiglio pleaded guilty, cross references the guideline for attempt and directs that, if a defendant used or possessed the firearm in connection with the attempted commission of another offense, the correct guideline is the offense level for the attempt. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A); \u00a7 2X1.1. The guideline for attempt, in turn, directs that, if an attempt is expressly covered by another guideline, that other guideline applies. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Xl.l(c)(l). Section 2A2.1(a)(l) imposes a base offense level of 33 for a first-degree murder attempt, which was the base level used by the district court as part of its sentencing calculations.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-14\">Attempted murder, prohibited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113, requires proof of a specific intent to kill the victim. <em>Braxton v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 344, 111 S.Ct. 1854, 1859 n. 1, 114 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). A person is guilty of attempt if he had the specific intent to commit the underlying crime and took a \u201csubstantial step\u201d towards committing that crime. <em>United States v. Yost, </em>479 F.3d 815, 819 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cA substantial step can be shown when the defendant\u2019s objective acts mark his conduct as criminal and, as a whole, strongly corroborate the required culpability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court\u2019s determination about a \u201csubstantial step\u201d is a question of fact, which we will not disturb unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>United States v. Rothen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number><em>berg, </em>610 F.3d 621, 627 (11th Cir.2010) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Scognamiglio took a substantial step towards committing first-degree murder. The district court identified the following evidence in determining that Scognamiglio had taken a substantial step: Scognamiglio ordered a silencer, Scognamiglio gave an undercover informant a barrel to be threaded for a silencer and a gun in payment for the silencer, and Scognamiglio traveled to a meeting where he was to pick up the silencer. The transcripts of the meeting between Scognamiglio and the confidential source also contained evidence of Scognamiglio\u2019s insistence on being the trigger-man, of his specific identification of the victims, and of his surveillance of potential locations for the murders. In addition, the transcripts supported the police officer\u2019s uncontradicted testimony that Scognamiglio never expressed a desire to abandon the plan. We cannot conclude, based on this evidence, that the district court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Given the district court\u2019s finding that Scognamiglio\u2019s conduct constituted a substantial step towards first-degree murder and satisfied the elements of attempted murder, we see no reversible error in the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-10\"> Because the statutory maximum sentence was less than the minimum of the ultimate applicable guideline range in this case, the guideline sentence was the 60-month statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
