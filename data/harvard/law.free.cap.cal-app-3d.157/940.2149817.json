J.</author>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Defendant Samuel P. Delug<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of plaintiff Norman H. Kallen on the first and second causes of action of plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint, alleging respectively the breach of an oral contract and the breach of a written contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">In January 1979, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant and others, alleging nine separate causes of action on various theories, including breach of contract, fraud and quantum meruit. Following assorted procedural rulings, defendant answered plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint and the parties undertook discovery proceedings. Ultimately, the matter was set for trial on June 28, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">On May 22, 1982, defendant moved for an order determining certain issues to be without substantial controversy (formerly a motion for partial summary judgment), the motion to be heard on June 1. After plaintiff interposed an objection on the ground the motion had been made less than 45 days before the commencement of trial, the court continued the matter to June 28, 1982, determining that it should be heard at time of trial. Thereafter, due to court congestion, the trial was continued until January 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">As a consequence, defendant once again moved for partial summary judgment, the motion to be heard on August 3, 1982. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion as to all causes of action except quantum meruit, but plaintiff moved to set aside the order granting defendant\u2019s motion on the ground of lack of notice. Consequently, the court vacated its ruling, stayed the motion and set it for reargument on August 31. Plaintiff moved for the partial adjudication of issues, the motion also to be heard on August 31. Each of these motions was based on declarations and particular documentary evidence attached thereto, as well as all records, pleadings and other papers on file in the instant action. After hearing the respective motions, the trial court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion and denied defendant\u2019s. Subsequently, on October 5, 1982, plaintiff moved for summary judgment on the first and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>second causes of action. The trial court granted the motion, after which judgment was entered accordingly. Plaintiff dismissed the remaining causes of action without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The evidentiary papers on file in the underlying motions at issue herein include the declaration of defendant, the declaration of defendant\u2019s attorneys Laurence Strick and Gordon D. Soladar, plaintiff\u2019s declaration, authenticated copies of retainer agreements and a substitution of attorney signed by Marna Balin, the transcript of defendant\u2019s deposition testimony and a letter addressed to defendant and dated December 6, 1974, bearing plaintiff\u2019s signature and defendant\u2019s written acknowledgement. From these materials we glean the following pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In late 1974, defendant met with Marna Balin (Balin), who told him the circumstances of two automobile accidents she had suffered in 1972 and indicated she wished to discharge the attorney presently handling the matters; that attorney was plaintiff. Balin requested that defendant \u201cimmediately obtain the files for her case\u201d from plaintiff. As a consequence, defendant wrote to plaintiff at least twice, requesting that he execute a substitution of attorney at the request of his client, Balin, and transmit all of Balin\u2019s files to defendant\u2019s office. Balin had signed a substitution of attorney form on November 27, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">When plaintiff failed to respond to defendant\u2019s correspondence, defendant telephoned him. Plaintiff stated to defendant that \u201cbefore he would execute a substitution of attorneys <em>(sic) </em>or transmit the files to [defendant] he would have to have some kind of agreement with [defendant] as far as his [plaintiff\u2019s] legal fees were concerned. He stated that he had done basically all the work that had to be done on the files, that he was now losing the files, and did not feel that was fair. Although I [defendant] reiterated to him that he had retained a lien on [Balin\u2019s] cause of action, he stated to me that he wanted a firm written agreement regarding the matter of his fees before he would execute a substitution of attorneys <em>(sic) </em>and before he would deliver the files . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Defendant told plaintiff that Balin was pressing him to obtain her files from plaintiff. He also expressed to plaintiff his view of plaintiff\u2019s ethical responsibilities \u201cregarding withholding the files until the matter of his fees had been settled. [Defendant] told [plaintiff] that he did not have the right to withhold a client\u2019s file once the client had instructed him to give it up. Nevertheless, [plaintiff] told [defendant] that he would not execute a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>stitution of attorneys <em>(sic) </em>or deliver the files until we had settled the matter of [plaintiff\u2019s] fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">On December 6, 1979, plaintiff wrote to defendant, memorializing his understanding of an acceptable fee arrangement. The letter states: \u201cThis letter is being written to confirm my understanding with respect to executing Substitution of Attorney forms concerning the [Balin] matters. I have agreed to execute the Substitution of Attorney forms under the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">\u201c1. [I have] a lien for service rendered against any and all proceeds of any settlement, judgment or verdict which may be paid to [Balin] as a result of the above captioned matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">\u201c2. In consideration of executing the Substitution of Attorney forms [defendant] gives to [plaintiff] forty percent (40%) of all attorney\u2019s fees recovered by way of settlement, judgment or verdict in the [Balin] matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">\u201c3. Any draft or check issued by any defendant in the [Balin] matters shall include Norman H. Kallen [plaintiff] as a named payee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">\u201c4. Samuel P. Delug [defendant] will reimburse [plaintiff] forthwith for any advances made on behalf of [Balin] with respect to the above captioned matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-9\">\u201cI shall tender the files and Substitution of Attorney forms upon receipt and acknowledgement of these provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">Defendant\u2019s client, Balin, \u201cwas extremely anxious for me to begin working on her case and I did not feel it fair on [plaintiff\u2019s] part to compel me to seek an order of court directing him to execute a substitution of attorneys <em>(sic) </em>and/or deliver [Balin\u2019s] files <em>to </em>my <em>office.\u201d </em>Consequently, defendant felt he had no choice but to acknowledge the terms of the letter agreement. Defendant signed the letter in acknowledgement of its terms in the space provided on December 9, 1979, and returned it to plaintiff. On December 12, plaintiff executed the substitution of attorney and surrendered Balin\u2019s case files to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">In contraposition to defendant\u2019s version of events, plaintiff simply stated: \u201cI at all times negotiated openly and freely with [defendant], never in any way attempted to, or in fact intimidated, threatened, or otherwise deprived [defendant] of his willing capacity to negotiate with me; at all times during my discussion with him, we engaged in free and open dialogue and always there was a healthy give-and-take . . . ; at all times during those discussions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>[defendant] left me with the unmistakeable impression . . . that he did not perceive himself to be victimized by me . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">After receiving Balm\u2019s case files from plaintiff, defendant discovered that a great deal of work remained to be done to bring the cases into a state of trial readiness. Significant gaps in the record required further conferences with Balin to clarify the factual circumstances of the cases. Defendant also became concerned about what he perceived as a conflict of interest in plaintiff\u2019s joint representation of Balin and another party. In view of the scope of the remaining preparation necessary on Balin\u2019s cases, defendant eventually associated another attorney with himself in Balin\u2019s representation. This attorney, Steven Gorman, thereafter undertook primary responsibility for preparing the cases for trial. Plaintiff repeatedly had urged Balin to settle the cases for $25,000; the cases ultimately were settled for $810,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Pursuant to defendant\u2019s contingency fee agreement with Balin, the total attorney\u2019s fee amounted to $324,000. In accordance with defendant\u2019s subsidiary fee-sharing agreement with Attorney Gorman, defendant\u2019s professional corporation received 50 percent of that amount, while the remainder went to Attorney Gorman. Following the settlements, plaintiff demanded 40 percent of the resulting $324,000 fee. Defendant took the position that the letter agreement was unenforceable on the ground it was contrary to public policy and refused to honor plaintiff\u2019s demand. Instead, defendant offered plaintiff a sum which defendant believed represented the reasonable value of plaintiff\u2019s services prior to his discharge. Plaintiff rejected the offer, after which he initiated the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Defendant contends the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment, in that defendant\u2019s evidence establishes the fee-splitting agreement is illegal and contrary to public policy and, hence, unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">Defendant further contends the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment, in that defendant\u2019s evidence establishes the fee-splitting agreement was not supported by valid consideration, but was obtained by duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">Finally, defendant asserts the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment, in that defendant presented evidence which raises triable issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>of material fact as to whether the agreement was induced by plaintiff\u2019s material misrepresentations as well as with respect to the amount of recovery due plaintiff if the agreement is in fact enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Preliminarily, we note that in reviewing the propriety of a summary judgment, this court must resolve all doubts in favor of the party opposing the judgment. <em>(Wynner </em>v. <em>Buxton </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 166, 172 [158 Cal.Rptr. 587].) As a consequence, the declarations of the moving party must be strictly construed, while those of the opponent are liberally construed. <em>(Blair </em>v. <em>Pitchess </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 258, 285 [96 Cal.Rptr. 42, 486 P.2d 1242, 45 A.L.R.3d 1206]; <em>Tresemer </em>v. <em>Barke </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 656, 668 [150 Cal.Rptr. 384, 12 A.L.R.4th 27].) However, the opposing party \u201ccannot rely on his pleadings, but must make an independent showing that he has \u2018sufficient proof of the matters alleged to raise an issuable question of fact\u2019\u201d if the moving party\u2019s evidence, standing alone, is sufficient to entitle him or her to judgment. <em>(Cullincini </em>v. <em>Deming </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 908, 913-914 [126 Cal.Rptr. 427].)  Summary judgment is proper if the evidence in support of the moving party would be sufficient to sustain a judgment in his favor and the opposing party has not presented any facts which give rise to a triable issue of material fact. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c; <em>Stationers Corp. </em>v. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 412, 417 [42 Cal.Rptr. 449, 398 P.2d 785].)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Defendant contends the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment, in that defendant\u2019s evidence establishes the fee-splitting agreement is illegal and contrary to public policy and, hence, unenforceable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\"> jn substance, defendant argues the fee-splitting agreement is illegal and contrary to public policy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in that plaintiff\u2019s conduct in refusing to execute a substitution of attorney and withholding the client\u2019s files was (1) designed and intended to\u2014and did in fact\u2014extort or coerce defendant\u2019s acquiescence in the agreement and (2) violates rule 2-108(A) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>California Rules of Professional Conduct. At this juncture, that plaintiff did indeed refuse to execute a substitution of attorney and withheld from plaintiff the client Balin\u2019s files must be treated as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Defendant presented evidence that plaintiff repeatedly ignored written requests that he execute the substitution of attorney and forward Balin\u2019s files, after which, in the course of a telephone conversation, plaintiff stated, \u201cbefore he would execute a substitution of attorneys <em>(sic) </em>or transmit the files to [defendant] he would have to have some kind of agreement with me [defendant] as far as his legal fees were concerned. ... I told [plaintiff] that Mama Balin was pressing me to obtain her files from him. ... I told him that he did not have the right to withhold a client\u2019s file once the client had instructed him to give it up. Nevertheless, [plaintiff] told me that he would not execute a substitution of attorneys <em>(sic) </em>or deliver the files until we had settled the matter of his fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Plaintiff never denied this course of conduct or the substance of the conversation as related above; he presented no evidence conducive to a contrary inference. To the contrary, in his response to this appeal, plaintiff implicitly accepts the truth of these representations. Moreover, the December 6, 1974, letter which constitutes the written agreement expressly recites: \u201cIn consideration of executing the Substitution of Attorney forms [defendant] gives to [plaintiff] forty percent (40%) of all attorney\u2019s fees recovered by way of settlement, judgment or verdict in [Balin\u2019s causes of action]. ... I shall tender the files and Substitution of Attorney forms upon receipt and acknowledgement of these provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">A contract may be illegal or in contravention of public policy either in its apparent substance and purpose <em>(Blue Cross of Northern California </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 723, 740 [174 Cal.Rptr. 901]) or in the consideration upon which it is based (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1607, 1667; <em>Bowyer </em>v. <em>Burgess </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 97, 100 [4 Cal.Rptr. 521, 351 P.2d 793]). Unlawful consideration is that which is: \u201c1. Contrary to an express provision of law; [1f] 2. Contrary to the policy of express law, though not expressly prohibited; or, [f] 3. Otherwise contrary to good morals.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1607, 1667.) The concept of unlawful consideration embraces a promise to refrain from wrongful conduct directed at the promisee or a third person. <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>Prater </em>(1948) 64 Wyo. 293 [191 P.2d 160, 166]; Rest., Contracts, \u00a7 578; see also <em>Grasko </em>v. <em>Los Angeles City Board of Education </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 290, 297 [107 Cal.Rptr. 334] [questioned in <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 721, 728-729 [119 Cal.Rptr. 631, 532 P.2d 495] and <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 898, 916-917] [120 Cal.Rptr. 707, 534 P.2d 403].) As <em>Campbell </em>noted in a different factual context, illegal consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>encompasses such a promise because it is contrary to law or public policy for an individual who has acted wrongfully to the injury of another to exact a consideration for relinquishing such conduct. In other words, the law finds repugnant the coercion inherent in a promise which carries the implied threat that, without acquiescence in the return promise exacted, the wrongful conduct will continue. <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>Prater, supra, </em>191 P.2d 160, 166; see also Rest., Contracts, \u00a7 578, com. a.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Rule 2-111(A)(2) of the California Rules of Professional Conduct provides: \u201cIn any event, a member of the State Bar shall not withdraw from employment until he has taken reasonable steps to avoid foreseeable prejudice to the rights of his client, including giving due notice to his client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, delivering to the client all papers and property to which the client is entitled, and complying with applicable laws and rules.\u201d  It is settled that rules relating to the withdrawal of an attorney from employment \u201capply with no less force to the discharge of an attorney. His duty to his client is not altered by the circumstances of who terminates the relationship.\u201d <em>(Academy of California Optometrists, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 999, 1005-1006 [124 Cal.Rptr. 668].) It is a breach of the duty imposed by rule 2-111(A)(2) to retain a client\u2019s case files after discharge <em>(ibid), </em>in that an attorney\u2019s work product belongs absolutely to the client whether or not the attorney has been paid for his services <em>(Weiss </em>v. <em>Marcus </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 590, 599 [124 Cal.Rptr. 297]), or to fail to forward the client\u2019s files to a successor attorney <em>(Finch </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 659, 665 [170 Cal.Rptr. 629, 621 P.2d 253]).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">It is further settled that a client has an absolute right to substitute one attorney for another for any reason, whether or not the client owes the attorney money; it is immaterial that such a substitution will work to the purported detriment of the original attorney. <em>(Meadow </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 610, 616-617 [30 Cal.Rptr. 824, 381 P.2d 648]; accord, <em>Fracasse </em>v. <em>Brent </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 784, 790 [100 Cal.Rptr. 385, 494 P.2d 9].) Once an attorney has actually undertaken the representation of a client, negotiating with defendant and filing pleadings, the execution and filing of a substitution of attorney is essential to an effective change in representation; until the substitution is a matter of record, the successor attorney cannot act affirmatively to protect the client\u2019s interests and the original attorney retains the power to bind the client by his or her actions. Hence, a client\u2019s power to substitute one attorney for another has little meaning unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>its exercise is accompanied by the original attorney\u2019s prompt execution of a substitution of attorney. The original attorney\u2019s refusal to comply works a serious hardship on the client and puts the client\u2019s interests at risk.  As <em>Hulland </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 440, 448 [105 Cal.Rptr. 152, 503P.2d 608] recognized, \u201cWhen an attorney, in his zeal to insure the collection of his fee, assumes a position inimical to the interests of his client, he violates his duty of fidelity to his client.\u201d The same principle must apply with equal force to a discharged attorney\u2019s duty to his former client. Accordingly, an attorney breaches his ethical duty as defined in rule 2-111(A)(2) when he uses his refusal to execute a substitution of attorney as a device to protect his fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">It is clearly contrary to the public policy of this state to condone a violation of the ethical duties which an attorney owes to his client. <em>(Academy of California Optometrists, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.3d 999, 1006.) In recognition of this premise, \u201c[contracts which violate the canons of professional ethics of an attorney may for that reason be void.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It defies logic to void a contract which, in its substance, involves a violation of an attorney\u2019s ethical duties (e.g., id.; <em>Hulland </em>v. <em>State Bar, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 440) but to enforce one procured by a promise to cease violating and begin performing those duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The uncontradicted evidence defendant presented in support of his motion for partial summary judgment unequivocally reveals that plaintiff obtained defendant\u2019s acquiescence in the fee-splitting agreement precisely by that means. The letter agreement reveals on its face that execution of the substitution of attorney and relinquishment of Balin\u2019s files was the sole consideration plaintiff offered for defendant\u2019s agreement to split fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Inasmuch as the instant contract was procured by plaintiff\u2019s promise to refrain from the further violation of his ethical duties, it is repugnant to the law within the meaning of subdivision 2 of Civil Code section 1667. Since the consideration therefore is unlawful, the entire contract is void. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1608.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">In conclusion, we note that whether a contract is illegal or contrary to public policy is a question of law to be determined from the circumstances of each particular case. <em>(Russell </em>v. <em>Soldinger </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 633, 642 [131 Cal.Rptr. 145].)  There is no controversy as to the circumstances of the instant case. Not only are the facts as defendant recites them uncontradicted, but plaintiff lends support by his implicit admission of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>accuracy. Accordingly, it was error not only for the trial court to grant plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the first and second causes of action (breach of oral and written contract) of the second amended complaint, but also to deny defendant summary judgment on the same causes of action. In view of the conclusion we have reached, we find it unnecessary to address defendant\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The judgment is reversed and the trial court is directed to enter a new and different judgment in favor of defendant on the first and second causes of action and to vacate the dismissal of the remaining causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Lillie, J., and Dalsimer, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-11\">In addition to defendant Delug, individually, an appeal has been taken by him as a professional law corporation and by Delug &amp; Matyas as a professional law corporation and as a partnership.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Since an illegal contract is void and public policy considerations are involved, illegality need not be pleaded in the answer or even argued to preserve the issue on appeal, so long as the illegality is apparent on the face of the contract or evidence presented to prove the contract discloses the illegality. <em>(Lewis &amp; Queen </em>v. <em>N. M. Ball Sons </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 141, 147 [308 P.2d 713]; <em>Fewel &amp; Dawes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pratt </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 85, 92 [109 P.2d 650]; <em>Santoro </em>v. <em>Carbone </em>(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 721, 732 [99 Cal.Rptr. 488].) In any event, a simple denial of the agreement may suffice to enable the defendant to offer proof on the issue. <em>(Fewel &amp; Dawes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pratt, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d 85, 92.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b770-6\">California has expressly recognized this principle with respect to the substance of a contract; if the sole benefit of an agreement is its extortionate effect on the promisor, the agreement is unenforceable as against public policy. <em>(Academy of California Optometrists, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior court </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 999, 1005 [124 Cal.Rptr. 668].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Defendant\u2019s agreement cannot be based on any other consideration, in that the services plaintiff previously performed for Balin plainly are inadequate as consideration for the new promise extracted from defendant. <em>(Simmons </em>v. <em>Cal.
