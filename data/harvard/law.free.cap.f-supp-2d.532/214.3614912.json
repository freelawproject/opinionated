WOODLOCK, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">At issue in this litigation are allegations of grant date manipulation in the award of stock options to current and former directors and employees of iBasis, Inc. (\u201ciBasis\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d). David Shut-vet and Victor Malozi (the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) are shareholders of iBasis. Each filed a shareholder derivative action on behalf of the Company, and the actions were consolidated into a case against twenty of the Company\u2019s current and former directors and officers (the \u201cDefendants\u201d). The Plaintiffs allege violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) and raise state law claims including unjust enrichment, breaches of fiduciary duty, and waste of corporate assets. The Defendants have filed motions to dismiss,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and for reasons I discuss below, I find that the Plaintiffs fail adequately to assert viable federal claims. Given the nascent stage of this litigation, I will decline to exercise my supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. Accordingly, I will dismiss all of the claims in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">A. Stock Option Grant Date Manipulation</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">This litigation is part of a growing number of shareholder derivative suits focused on manipulation of the timing of stock option grants. On March 18, 2006, <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>published the article, \u201cThe Perfect Payday: Some CEOs reap millions by landing stock options when they are most valuable. Luck \u2014 or something else?\u201d (Comply 58.) Since the article\u2019s publication, a number of companies have disclosed director and officer involvement in stock option grant manipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">In September 2006, iBasis announced an internal investigation of its previous options grant practices. (ComplV 9.) The investigation led to the discovery that \u201cthe appropriate measurement dates for determining the accounting treatment of certain stock option grants differ from the measurement dates used by the Company in preparing its financial statements.\u201d (ComplJ 9.) In October, the Company announced that the SEC had initiated its own investigation into the matter. (ComplV 79.) Ultimately, the Company issued an accounting restatement on June 12, 2007 that totaled $10 million. (Comply 9.) The restatement revealed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the Company had uncovered e-mail messages either sent to or from Jonathan Draluck (\u201cDraluck\u201d), the General Counsel at the time, indicating that the option grant dates were likely determined in hindsight. (ComplJ 80.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">B. 1997 Stock Incentive Plan and Stock Option Grant Manipulation</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The granting of iBasis stock options at times relevant to the Complaint was controlled by the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (\u201c1997 Plan\u201d). (ComplJ 44.) The 1997 Plan gave the Compensation Committee authority to grant stock options pursuant to the terms of the 1997 Plan. (ComplJ 46.) The terms required that \u201cthe purchase price under an Incentive Stock Option [awardable only to employees] shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant of such Option.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (ComplJ 45.) The Fair Market Value of the Common Stock was determined based on the last reported NASDAQ price. (ComplJ 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The Plaintiffs have identified six dates when alleged stock option grant date manipulation took place: May 25, 2000; April 4, 2001; June 20, 2001; November 15, 2001; November 19, 2001; and September 14, 2004. (ComplJ 50.) Plaintiffs claim the first five dates involved stock option backdating and the last date involved stock option spring-loading. (Compl,\u00b6\u00b6 70, 74)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Using an algorithm based upon the work of an options backdating expert, the Plaintiffs assert that there is only a .024 percent probability that the five backdated grants would have occurred randomly. (ComplJ 72.) Specifically, Plaintiffs allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">\u2022 The May 25, 2000 option grant was priced at the lowest share price for the 14 month period of November 10, 1999 through September 29, 2000. Plaintiffs allege that Ofer Gneezy was granted 13,333 stock options; Michael Hughes was granted 8,333; John Henson, Jr. was granted 8,333; and Gordon VanderBrug was granted 10,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">\u2022 The April 4, 2001 option grant was priced at the lowest share price for the 22 month period of November 10, 1999 through July 30, 2001.

Plaintiffs allege that Charles Skibo was granted 16,667 stock options.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">\u2022 The September 14, 2004 option grant was dated on the day before iBasis announced the launch of its Pingo service, which precipitated a 10% increase in the Company\u2019s stock price over the next four weeks. Plaintiffs allege Ofer Gneezy, Paul Floyd, Dan Powdermaker, Charles Tennant, and Gordon VanderBrug received a total of 66,665 of these stock options.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">(CompLW 67, 74,100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">C.

Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">David Shutvet and Victor Malozi separately filed essentially identical actions initiating this litigation on December 21, 2006. (Docket No. 1.) I granted the motion to consolidate the cases on May 1, 2007. A Consolidated Complaint against the current twenty defendants was filed on June 15, 2007. (Docket No. 33) The case is now before me on two motions to dismiss \u2014 one jointly filed motion by the several iBasis Defendants and one individually filed motion by Draluck. (Docket Nos. 36, 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">A motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is evaluated by \u201ctaking as true the well-pleaded facts contained in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Phoung Luc v. Wyndham Mgmt. Corp., </em>496 F.3d 85, 88 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Garrett v. Tandy Corp., </em>295 F.3d 94, 97 (1st Cir.2002)). The Supreme Court recently addressed this standard in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly </em>noting that the claims raised must be more than simply conceivable \u2014 they must be plausible. \u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The First Circuit in response has observed that \u201ceven under the liberal pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8\u201d, the <em>Bell Atlantic </em>standard requires that a complaint \u201callege a plausible entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Rodriguez-Ortiz v. Margo Caribe, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">B. Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act</p>\n<p id=\"b259-17\">The Plaintiffs seek to allege that iBasis made false and misleading statements to its shareholders in its January 31, 2000<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and April 13, 2005 proxy statements (the \u201cProxies\u201d). (Comply 119.) In Count I, the Plaintiffs claim the Director Defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act by allowing the Company to issue the Proxies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Comply 119.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Defendants raise three arguments against the Section 14(a) claim: 1) it is time barred; 2) the Consolidated Complaint fails to show a causal link between the Proxies and any harm suffered by the Plaintiffs; and 3) the Consolidated Complaint fails to meet the PSLRA pleading requirements. The first and second arguments combined are sufficient to cause dismissal of the claims. Accordingly, I will dismiss the Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) claim without addressing the third argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">1. The Limitations and Repose Time Bars of Section 14(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The Section 14(a) claim can only proceed if it is brought within the relevant limitations period. The courts have recognized for Section 14(a) claims that related and similar causes of action under the Exchange Act have effectively supplied \u201ca limitations period of \u2018one year after the plaintiff discovers the facts constituting the violation, and in no event more than three years after such violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Franklin, </em>993 F.2d 349, 353 (3d Cir.1993) (quoting <em>In re Data Access Systems Sec. Litig., </em>843 F.2d 1537, 1550 (3d Cir.1988)) <em>(superceded in part by </em>statute<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>as stated in In re Exxon Mobil Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>500 F.3d 189, 198 (3d Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">The one-year limitations period functions as a statute of limitations and the three-year limitations period functions as a statute of repose. The Supreme Court has recognized this distinction, noting that because \u201cthe purpose of the three-year limitation is clearly to serve as a cutoff, ... tolling principles do not apply to that period.\u201d <em>Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, et al. v. Gilbertson, </em>501 U.S. 350, 363, 111 S.Ct. 2773, 115 L.Ed.2d 321 (1991). The Plaintiffs first filed Complaints on December 21, 2006 (Docket No. 1) consequently any proxy statements filed prior to December 21, 2003 (or December 21, 2001, if the extended SOX time period were to apply, <em>see </em>Note 6, supra) would be barred by the statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">Plaintiffs rely on a line of cases dealing with fraudulent schemes alleged to violate other provisions of the Exchange Act for the proposition that their three-year stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ute of repose did not start until March 23, 2006 when the last materially false proxy statement was filed. These cases hold that \u201cthe statute of repose runs from the date of the last fraudulent misrepresentation\u201d. <em>Quaak v. Dexia, S.A., 357 </em>F.Supp.2d 330, 338 (D.Mass.2005) (Saris, J.). But the cases relied on by the Plaintiffs not only assert non-Section 14(a) claims, they involve ongoing and continuing fraudulent schemes that relate to the very core of each company\u2019s business. <em>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>Civil Action No. 00-10874-RWZ, 2006 WL 1738348, at *1 (D. Mass. June 23, 2006) (Zobel, J.) (alleging that an engineering firm violated Sections 10(b) and 18 because it \u201cdeliberately underbid\u201d on contracts in order to overstate earnings, \u201cfraudulently concealed\u201d its loss on a large contract, and misrepresented the likelihood of bankruptcy); <em>In re Dynex Capital, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 05 Civ. 1897CHB), 2006 WL 314524, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.10, 2006) (Baer, J.) (alleging that a financial services corporation that issued debt securities using mortgages as collateral violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) by purchasing large volumes of \u201cbad paper\u201d without disclosing the quality of the mortgages in its public offerings); <em>Quaak, 357 </em>F.Supp.2d at 332 (alleging that a company violated Section 10(b) by creating and providing funding to sham holding companies in order to help increase the generation of fictitious licensing revenue). These cases \u201cinvolved continuous, integrated schemes that were operated by the same group of people over a period of time to achieve the same purposes.\u201d <em>In re Zoran, </em>511 F.Supp.2d at 1014 (N.D.Cal.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Recent cases addressing allegations of stock option grant date manipulation under Section 14(a) have disavowed the broad fraudulent scheme approach and instead required that the initial misstatement regarding option dating fall within the statute of repose period. <em>See, e.g., Stoll v. Ardizzone, </em>No. 07 Civ. 00608(CM), 2007 WL 2982250, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct.9, 2007) (\u201cPleading the existence of a \u2018scheme\u2019 does not resurrect stale claims relating to proxy statements that are more than three years old at the time an action is filed; there is no \u2018continuing violations\u2019 exception to the absolute bar of the statutory limitations period.\u2019 \u201d); <em>In re Zoran, </em>511 F.Supp.2d at 1014 (holding that \u201cthe statute of limitations accrues as of when the violation itself occurs, not when the last violation in a series of alleged violations occur\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The Plaintiffs have failed to provide any sort of link between the January 31, 2001 and April 13, 2005 Proxies. Even if the Defendants were engaged in a broad fraudulent scheme of granting manipulated stock options, the Plaintiffs have failed to allege that the Proxies are connected together in this scheme. Thus, despite the presumptive difficulties in discovering backdated stock options, I find that the statute of repose for Section 14(a) claims applies to each individual proxy statement. The statute of repose bars the Plaintiffs from raising a Section 14(a) claim based on proxy statements issued prior to December 21, 2003 (or December 21, 2001 if the SOX statute of repose applies). Consequently, claims based on the January 31, 2001 proxy are time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">2. Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">As to the April 13, 2005 proxy statement, the Plaintiffs have failed to show a causal nexus between any alleged injury to iBasis and the transactions approved in the Proxies. The First Circuit has noted that Section 14(a) claims require \u201ctransactional causation\u201d connecting a company\u2019s alleged injury with the \u201ccorporate transaction authorized (or defeated) as a result of the allegedly false and mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>leading proxy statements.\u201d <em>Royal Bus. Group, Inc. v. Realist, Inc., </em>933 F.2d 1056, 1063 (1st Cir.1991). The Complaint states: \u201cThe January 31, 200[1] and April 13, 2005 proxies each contained proposals to \u00a1Basis\u2019 shareholders that they vote to approve increases in the number of shares and options awardable under the 1997- Plan.\u201d (Comply 119.) I observe that, while not specifically pled, the April 13, 2005 proxy statement concerned reelection of three directors alleged earlier to have engaged in stock grant timing manipulation. The Complaint further alleges that \u201c[t]his information would have been material to \u00a1Basis\u2019 shareholders in determining whether or not to approve amendments to the 1997 Plan contained in the Proxies.\u201d (ComplA 121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">These allegations fail to create the required causal connection. As discussed above, any proxy statement before December 21, 2003 (or, perhaps, December 21, 2001) is time-barred. Thus, the Plaintiffs can only proceed with a Section 14(a) violation claim based on the April 13, 2005 proxy statement, the only other proxy statement mentioned in the Complaint. The Complaint identifies six potential manipulated options grant dates between May 25, 2000 and September 14, 2004. (Comply 50.) All of these dates pre-date the April 13, 2005 proxy statement. No backdated or spring-loaded stock options are alleged to have been issued after April 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The Plaintiffs rely on <em>Zoran </em>for support that they have adequately alleged harm caused by the April 13, 2005 proxy statement. The <em>Zoran </em>court held that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged causation by pleading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">[T]he directors used the proxy solicitations to maintain their positions on Zoran\u2019s board. Shareholders allegedly kept voting for the board members in blissful ignorance of the scheme to grant insiders backdated options while shortchanging the company. Shareholders also authorized the stock-option plans under which the allegedly-backdated options were granted. With each election, the board could continue to grant backdated stock options to itself and Zoran executives. Zoran was damaged because defendants caused it to divert company assets to recipients of backdated stock options. Zoran was also exposed to an inquiry by the SEC as a result and has allegedly suffered damage to its reputation and investor confidence. Had shareholders known that defendants had not followed the dictates of the plan in the past, this likely would have changed their votes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\"><em>Zoran, </em>511 F.Supp.2d at 1016. The Plaintiffs argue that a similar situation exists here, since the Company suffered harm from costs associated with an SEC investigation, additional accounting expenses, and loss in investor confidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the 2005 proxy statement had properly disclosed the stock option grant manipulation, then shareholders likely would have voted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>against the incumbent directors and amendments to the 1997 Plan, and the Company would have taken corrective action earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Reliance on <em>Zoran </em>does not assist the Plaintiffs, however, because the harms alleged by the Plaintiffs pre-date the 2005 proxy statement. Correcting a proxy misstatement might prevent future option grants from being manipulated but cannot change the impact of stock options that have already been granted. Even if the 2005 proxy statement had disclosed the actions of the directors, the fallout from the SEC investigation and the accounting restatement would still occur since the allegedly manipulated stock options had already been granted. What was at issue in <em>Zoran, </em>511 F.Supp.2d at 1016 (\u201cWith each election, the board could continue to grant backdated stock options to itself and Zoran executives.\u201d), and what the Plaintiffs fail to allege in this case are manipulated stock option grants that <em>post-date </em>the 2005 proxy statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Transactional causation for stock option grant manipulation customarily involves a three-step-process. First, there is a stock option grant manipulation that pre-dates a proxy statement. Then, there is a false or misleading proxy statement that leads to approval of the recommended action, generally the reelection of directors or the amendment of the Company\u2019s stock option plan. Finally, these directors grant additional manipulated stock options. This is the scenario alleged in <em>Zoran </em>and the Plaintiffs argue that the same situation exists with iBasis. They have alleged the first two requirements but have failed to allege the last required step, that any related \u2014 but not essentially preexisting \u2014 injury occurred <em>after </em>the shareholders approved the recommended action in the proxy statement. The Plaintiffs have failed to establish the required transactional causation linking a vote in favor of the April 13, 2005 proxy statement with new injury to iBasis.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">C. The Lack of a Private Right of Action Under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">Count II of the Complaint, a claim against Gneezy and Tennant for violating Section .304 of SOX, can only proceed if Congress actually provided a private right of action to enforce this section. After reviewing the statutory text, the structure of other sections within SOX, and the decisions of other courts, I find that no private right of action exists for the enforcement of Section 304 violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">Because the text of Section 304 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> does not explicitly grant a private right of action, I turn to other sources for guidance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Whether Congress intended to create a Section 304 private right of action can be gleaned from the structure of the statute\u2019s other sections. <em>See Alexander v. Sandoval, </em>532 U.S. 275, 288, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001). Although Section 304 is silent, Sections 303 and 306 explicitly address this issue, with the former limiting enforcement to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the latter granting a private right of action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7242(b); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7244(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">As <em>Neer v. Pelino, </em>389 F.Supp.2d 648 (E.D.Pa.2005) observed: \u201cSections 304 and 306 share an important characteristic in that each provides for issuers to be reimbursed with wrongdoing officers\u2019 profits\u201d while Section 303 does not. 389 F.Supp.2d at 655. By contrast, Section 303 covers SEC enforcement against officers and directors who improperly influence an accountant\u2019s performance of a financial statement audit. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7242. \u201cGiven the similarity of Sections 304 and 306, a comparison of these two sections\u2019 enforcement language is more telling than comparisons with [Section] 303\u201d. <em>Neer v. Pelino, </em>389 F.Supp.2d at 655. I too find the text of Section 306 to be the most analogous to Section 304. The explicit grant of a private right of action in Section 306 persuades me that Congress, which explicitly authorized no such private right of action in Section 304, cannot be viewed as intending to do so by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The type of remedy provided by Section 304 further convinces me that no right of private action exists for this section. The language of Section 304 allows for the possibility of a remedy that is punitive in nature. If the company is required to issue an accounting restatement due to the company\u2019s material noncompliance with any securities law financial reporting requirement \u201cas a result of misconduct\u201d, the CEO and CFO of the company are required to pay back the bonus and incentive or equity-based compensation that they received over a twelve-month period. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7243(a)(1). Section 304 does not elaborate on what sort of misconduct is necessary, so the pay back remedy could be applied if any misconduct, however slight, leads to an accounting restatement. Remedies that provide greater sanctions than placing a victim in the position it would have been in had improper conduct not taken place are customarily administered by government regulators and not private citizens. Without language explicitly granting a private right of action, I cannot find that Congress intended to have the Section 304 remedy administered by private citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Although First Circuit courts have yet to consider whether Section 304 provides a private right of action, all other courts that have had the occasion to address the issue directly have found that Congress did not create a private right of action for purposes of enforcing Section 304 of SOX. <em>See In re Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Derivative Litig., </em>2007 WL 43557, at *7 (N.D.Ohio Jan.5, 2007); <em>In re Digimarc Corp. Derivative Litig., </em>Civil Action No. 05-1324-HA, 2006 WL 2345497, at *3 (D.Or. Aug.11, 2006); <em>Kogan v. Robinson, </em>432 F.Supp.2d 1075, 1082 (S.D.Cal.2006); <em>In re Whitehall Jewellers, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litig., </em>No. 05 C 1050, 2006 WL 468012, at *8 (N.D.Ill. Feb.27, 2006); <em>In re BISYS Group Inc.

Pelino, </em>389 F.Supp.2d at 657; <em>Mehlenbacher v. Jitaru, </em>No. 6:04CV1118ORL-22KRS, 2005 WL 4585859, at *10 (M.D.Fla. June 6, 2005). The Plaintiffs do cite one case, <em>In re Qwest Communications Int\u2019l, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>387 F.Supp.2d 1130 (D.Colo.2005), for the proposition that courts have \u201csuggested a private right of action exists under \u00a7 304.\u201d But <em>Qwest </em>never directly addressed the private right of action issue.- Instead, that case was dismissed because the plaintiff failed to bring a derivative claim on behalf of the company and would not in any event itself be entitled to receive reimbursement under Section 304. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Although the text of Section 304 is not explicit about the question, I am persuaded by the statutory structure of SOX, the nature of the penalty provision, and precedent from other courts that have directly and thoughtfully considered the issue that Congress did not intend to provide a private mechanism for enforcing Section 304. Thus, I find that the Plaintiffs have no private right of action to bring a claim under Section 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">D. State Law Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">My jurisdiction over the remaining claims exists through supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a). Having dismissed both federal claims and given the early stage of litigation, I decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Gonzalez-De-Blasini v. Family Dept., </em>377 F.3d 81, 89 (1st Cir.2004); <em>Camelio v. Am. Fed\u2019n, </em>137 F.3d 666, 672 (1st Cir.1998); <em>Rodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., </em>57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir. 1995). Accordingly, I will also dismiss the remaining state law claims and in doing so decline to address the motion to dismiss of Jonathan Draluck who is only implicated in state law claims raised by the Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">For the reasons set forth more fully above, I dismiss the federal claims in this case and decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. Accordingly, I GRANT the iBasis Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this case without addressing any of the state law claims and direct the Clerk to DISMISS this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\">. Of the twenty defendants identified in the verified consolidated shareholder derivative complaint (\"Complaint\u201d), seventeen have filed a joint motion to dismiss and will be referred to as \"iBasis Defendants\u201d. One defendant, Jonathan Draluck, who is only implicated in the state law claims, has filed a separate motion to dismiss. (Docket Nos. 36, 39.) The remaining two defendants had not been served when the motions to dismiss were filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\">.

Backdating involves issuing stock options on one date but providing documentation indicating that the options were actually issued on an earlier date, generally when the stock option grant price was lower. <em>Ryan v. Gifford, </em>918 A.2d 341, 345 (Del.Ch.2007) (Chandler, C.). Spring-loading options involves issuing option grants prior to the public announcement of positive news, thus allowing the owner of the stock option to take advantage of the increase in share price from the good news. (ComplJ 7.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\">. The Defendants submit records that indicate iBasis never issued a proxy statement on January 31, 2000. <em>(See </em>Phinney Decl. \u00b6 7, Ex. F.) I am allowed to consider these official public records in a motion to dismiss even though they were not included in the Complaint. <em>Watterson v. Page, </em>987 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1993) (Campbell, J.). The Plaintiffs failed to explain the date discrepancy in their Opposition. When the issue was raised at the motion to dismiss hearing, Plaintiffs' counsel was unprepared to address the issue. Noting that iBasis did issue a proxy statement on January 31, 2001 (Phinney Deck Ex. F.), I indicated I would treat the allegation in the Consolidated Complaint as referring to the January 2001 proxy. As will appear, this difference in dates does not, in any event, change the outcome of the time bar analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b259-19\">.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act,(\"SOX\u201d), enacted on July 30, 2002, includes a more specific limitations provision for a private right of action involving fraud. This provision requires the action to be brought within two years of discovery of the violation or five years after the occurrence of such violation, whichever occurs first. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b). Courts have found that the SOX limitations provision does not extend the one-year statute of limitations and three-year statute of repose previously recognized for Section 14(a) claims, because a Section 14(a) violation does not require fraud as an essential element. <em>In re Exxon Mobil Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>500 F.3d 189, 196-197 (3d Cir.2007); <em>In re Zoran Corp. Derivative Litig., </em>511 F.Supp.2d. 986, 1016-1017 (N.D.Cal.2007). As will appear, even if the SOX statute were to be construed to include Section 14(a), there was no actionable violation here within the extended five-year period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b262-5\">. The Plaintiffs also argue that the Company was harmed because it paid compensation to the directors after April 13, 2005. They argue that the directors would have been replaced if the 2005 proxy statement had properly disclosed their actions. But the Plaintiffs fail to allege that the directors were paid anything more than what the Company would normally pay a director. Thus, if the directors had been replaced, the Company presumably would have paid the same amount of money, albeit to different directors. The Plaintiffs would essentially have Section 14(a) apply anytime a director commits a bad act and is re-elected without the bad act being disclosed in the proxy statement. Such a broad reading of Section 14(a) is untenable, since it would essentially negate the transactional causation requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">.

As a consequence, I do not address the Defendants\u2019 arguments that the case must be dismissed in its entirety because the Plaintiffs fail to meet strict pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23.1 because the Plaintiffs (1) have failed to show compliance with the contemporaneous stock ownership requirement of Rule 23.1(1) and (2) have failed to plead with particularity that demand was futile and thus excused.
