J. W. Mack, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\" pgmap=\"96\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Court affirming a decree entered October 4, 1904, by the circuit court of Cook county, disallowing the claim of appellant against the Pacific Railway Company, an insolvent corporation, then in the hands of a receiver.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\" pgmap=\"96(227) 97(29)\">This company was organized under the laws of this State August 23, 1889, and in January, 1891, a judgment creditor filed a bill, for himself and other creditors, against said company under section 25 of the Incorporation act, to enforce the stockholders\u2019 liability for the purpose of paying the debts of the company. A receiver was appointed January 19, 1891, and is still acting. The bill alleged that C. B. Holmes was a stockholder, and as such was indebted to the company. Later, as of December 4, 1891, the law firm of which appellant was the senior member filed Holmes\u2019 answer, in which it was alleged that at the time the bill was filed Holmes owned 527 shares of the capital stock of the company fully paid, and that he was a creditor to the amount of $200,000. The cause was referred to a master, who afterwards reported his finding of fact and law, and the circuit court, on July 1, 1898, entered a decree holding the stockholders, including among them Holmes, liable at the sum of $68 per share on each share of the stock held by them, respectively, at .the date of the filing of the bill. Later on, after a further reference and report from the master, a decree was entered January 8, 1900, against Holmes, fixing his liability as a stockholder of said company at the sum of $31,620, with interest from August 1, 1898. Execution having been issued on said decretal judgment, it was thereafter returned wholly unsatisfied.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-3\" pgmap=\"97\">The record sets forth that some time between January, 1891, and April, 1894, Holmes became indebted to appellant for $5000 for legal services rendered and to be rendered said Holmes in the litigation over the appointment of the receiver and allied proceedings, and that during the same interval the said appellant- had loaned said Holmes certain moneys, so that on or about April, 1894, the entire indebtedness amounted to $20,000; that in payment of this indebtedness said Holmes in October, 1894, and after the appointment of the receiver, transferred to appellant thirty bonds of the Pacific Railway Company, of the face value of $1000 each, payable to bearer on January 1, 1920, bearing six per cent interest, which bonds said Holmes had owned since some time before the receiver was appointed. Appellant filed his claim in this cause upon said thirty bonds July 19, 1898. The master reported in favor of allowing the claim, but the chancellor, on the hearing on the master\u2019s report, sustained exceptions filed thereto as to this claim of appellant and dismissed the claim., The chancellor found that appellant, when he purchased said bonds, was defending said Holmes in this cause, and knowing that Holmes had not paid for his stock and was liable thereon at the time of his purchase, appellant stood in no better position than Holmes would stand if he still retained and owned said thirty bonds, and that the decree rendered against said Holmes upon his stock liability should be set off against the claim made by appellant upon said bonds. The decree also found that all of the assets of the company had been collected and that they were only sufficient to pay forty-four and one-half per cent of the indebtedness that hence the amount of said decretal judgment against said Holmes largely exceeded the amount due on said thirty bonds, and that there was nothing due to appellant from said estate.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-3\" pgmap=\"98\">Nathaniel C.

Cas. 490.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-4\" pgmap=\"100\">A court of chancery will not permit a stockholder to escape the payment of his stock subscription and obtain payment on indebtedness due him from the insolvent corporation by assigning his claim .to his solicitorsand the fact that such claim was upon bonds due at a future date is wholly immaterial when the estate is being administered by a court of chancery.</p> <opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"AG\" pgmap=\"100\">Per Curiam :</author> <p id=\"Alx\" pgmap=\"100\">Appellant insists that the decretal judgment against Holmes on his stock liability in favor of the creditors cannot be set off against the liability of the corporation on these bonds in appellant\u2019s hands, even with notice, because the mutuality necessary to a set-off, either in law.or equity, does not exist; that the bonds in question are negotiable instruments, and as they were purchased for value by appellant before maturity he took them free from any set-off that could be urged against the liability of Holmes on his stock. We have gone over the authorities cited in the very exhaustive briefs of counsel, and would be inclined to agree with these contentions of appellant if these bonds had been assigned to him before the receiver was appointed by the circuit court for the Pacific Railway Company. Few authorities have been cited (and we have been able to find no others in our own research) which are similar, as to facts, to the case now under consideration. The cases in which the facts are most nearly similar are Ex parte Deey, 2 Coxe, 423, and Ex parte Rogers, Buck\u2019s Bankruptcy Cas. 490. These decisions are against the contention of appellant.</p> <p id=\"b100-6\" pgmap=\"100\">Counsel argue that .the decisions in bankruptcy matters cannot be held conclusive in proceedings not under the bankruptcy laws. While it is true they may not be conclusive, still the reasoning in these cases, not being based upon the special wording of the Bankrupt act, must necessarily have great weight as to the general questions of law involved .therein.</p> <p id=\"AY\" pgmap=\"101\">Appellant practically admits in his brief that if Holmes had remained the owner of these bonds at the time the decretal judgment was rendered against him, then a court of chancery could compel him to pay his judgment on stockholder\u2019s liability before it would allow him any dividend on these bonds. We have held that when a court of equity acquires jurisdiction of the assets of an insolvent corporation for the purpose of administering upon them, it will administer them upon the principle that equality is equity, and will, distribute such assets ratably among all the creditors, having in mind the legal rights and preferences existing before the jurisdiction was acquired. (Blair v. Illinois Steel Co. 159 Ill. 350.) The rights and liabilities of the creditors and debtors of the insolvent corporation are fixed and determined at the time of the appointment of the receiver. All the defenses that could have been made against the holders of these bonds at the time the receiver was appointed can certainly be made against anyone who purchased .them with notice after said receiver had been appointed. The bankruptcy cases heretofore referred to, hold that these defenses can be made in bankruptcy cases even against a bona \u00f1de purchaser without notice. While the precise point does not seem to have been, decided by any of the courts of .this country, the following decisions, which are the most nearly in point of any called to our attention, are clearly against appellant\u2019s position: Colt v. Brown, 78 Mass. 233; Balch v. Wilson, 25 Minn. 299; King v. Armstrong, (Ohio,) 34 N. E. Rep. 163; Richmond v. Irons, 121 U. S. 27.</p> <p id=\"b101-5\" pgmap=\"101(75) 102(12)\">To permit Holmes to dispose of these bonds of the insolvent company for full value after the receiver had been appointed and escape the payment of his stock liability, while the purchaser of the bonds, with full notice of all the facts at the time of the purchase, is permitted to collect full dividends on the bonds from the estate, would be contrary to the fundamental principles of equity that have always been invoked in the distribution of the assets of an insolvent corporation.</p> <p id=\"b102-3\" pgmap=\"102\">Finding no reversible error in the record, the judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b102-4\" pgmap=\"102\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
