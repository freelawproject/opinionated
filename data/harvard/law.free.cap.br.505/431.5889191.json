CAREY, UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY JUDGE</author>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">On May 21, 2013, Anita B. Carr (the \u201cPlaintiff\u201d or \u201cMs. Carr\u201d) filed the \u201cVerified Complaint for Violations of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Stay, Fraud and Fraudulent Conveyance and Application for Preliminary and Permanent Injunctive Relief and Reservation of Rights\u201d (the \u201cComplaint\u201d) commencing this adversary proceeding against Defendants JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJPM\u201d), Chase Home Finance, LLC (\u201cCHF\u201d) and \u201cany known or unknown dba used by said Defendants and DOES 1-10\u201d (jointly, the \u201cDefendants\u201d). In her Complaint, Ms. Carr asks for judgment against the Defendants in the amount of $2,346,000.00, and seeks to enjoin the Defendants from taking any action to sell, convey or attempt to sell or convey certain real property located in Dublin, California, or from taking any action to evict Ms. Carr from that real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">On July 3, 2013, JPM and CHF filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint (Adv. D.I. 13), along with a Memorandum of Law in support thereof (Adv. D.I. 14), asserting that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Complaint and that the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted (the \u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d). Ms. Carr filed the \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Opposition and Objection to the Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Verified Complaint and the Defendants\u2019 Request for Judicial Notice\u201d on July 22, 2013 (Adv. D.I. 22). JPM and CHF filed a reply on August 1, 2013 (Adv. D.I. 25). For the reasons set forth below, the Motion to Dismiss will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">Bankruptcy Background</p>\n<p id=\"b465-15\">On April 2, 2007, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On November 20, 2009, the Court entered an Order confirming the Modified Second Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Liquidation (the \u201cModified Plan\u201d) (Main Case D.I. 9905).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Modified Plan adopted, ratified and confirmed the New Century Liquidating Trust Agreement, dated as of August 1, 2008, which created the New Century Liquidating Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) and appointed Alan M. Jacobs as Liquidating Trustee of New Century Liquidating Trust and Plan Administrator of New Century Warehouse Corporation (the \u201cLiquidating Trustee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The Order confirming the Modified Plan provided that the Liquidating Trustee was deemed the representative of the Debtors\u2019 estates and that the Liquidating Trustee \u201cshall have all powers, authority, and responsibilities specified in the Modified Plan and the Liquidating Trust Agreement, including, without limitation, the powers of a trustee under sections 704,108 and 1106 of the Bankruptcy Code and Rule 2004 of the Bankruptcy Rules (including without limitation, commencing, prosecuting or settling Causes of Action, enforcing contracts, and asserting claims, defenses, offsets and privileges).... \u201d (Main Case D.I. 9957, \u00b6 28). The Liquidating Trustee has made three distributions to creditors. <em>(See </em>Main Case D.I. 11271 at 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Standard for Consideration of a Challenge to Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"AP7\">JPM and CHF move to dismiss the Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P 12(b)(1), made applicable to this proceeding pursuant to Fed.R.Bankr.P. 7012.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because jurisdiction is a threshold issue, I will examine this issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">A Rule 12(b)(1) motion may be treated as either a facial or factual challenge to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. In reviewing a facial attack, the court must only consider the allegations of the complaint and documents referenced therein and attached thereto, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. In reviewing a factual attack, the court may consider evidence outside the pleadings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-10\"><em>Gould Elec. Inc. v. United States, </em>220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir.2000) (citations omitted) <em>holding modified on other grounds by Simon v. United States, </em>341 F.3d 193, 204 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">The Motion to Dismiss appears to assert a factual challenge to jurisdiction because JPM and CHF ask this Court to take judicial notice of various state court filings in considering the jurisdictional challenge. In her opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, Ms. Carr objects to the request for judicial notice, arguing that while the Court may take judicial notice that documents were filed in state court, it may not take judicial notice of the contents of or averments within those documents. Ms. Carr\u2019s response raises her repeated challenge to the authenticity or effectiveness of various state court filings and the state court foreclosure action that followed. The disputes over the state court issues, however, need not be resolved to determine the jurisdictional issues surrounding this adversary proceeding. Rather than consider the additional documents offered by JPM and CHF, I will treat the Motion to Dismiss as a facial challenge to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction by reviewing the allegations in the Complaint in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Plaintiffs Factual Allegations and Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Ms. Carr\u2019s Complaint is rather confusing and sets forth very few factual allegations amid a number of claims and legal conclusions. This Court must construe liberally a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s pleadings. <em>Higgs v. Atty. Gen. of the U.S., </em>655 F.3d 333, 339 (3d Cir.2011) citing <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) and <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). The factual allegations that can be gleaned from a liberal construction of the Complaint are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u2022 JPM and CHF became creditors of the Debtors in 2007;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">\u2022 The Debtors filed bankruptcy petitions on April 2, 2007;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">\u2022 Ms. Carr was a borrower of debtor Home 123 Corporation (\u201cHome 123!\u2019) and was not provided with notice of the Debtors\u2019 bankruptcy filing;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">\u2022 The Debtors had possession of the Carr Loan on the date of the bankruptcy filing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">\u2022 After the bankruptcy filing, the Carr Loan was transferred to the Defendants; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-13\">\u2022 The Defendants fabricated and falsified documents, which they filed at the Alameda County Recorder\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">The Complaint does not set forth separate claims, but based upon the alleged facts and asserted legal conclusions, the Court interprets the Complaint as setting forth the following claims against the Defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-15\">\u2022 Violation of the automatic stay of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 based upon the transfer of the Carr Loan out of the bankruptcy estate (the \u201cStay Violation Claim\u201d);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-16\">\u2022 Violation of Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 101(31), \u00a7 101(54), \u00a7 547 and \u00a7 548 based upon the transfer of the Carr Loan and \u201cPlaintiffs property\u201d (the \u201cAvoidance Claim\u201d);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-17\">\u2022 Fraud, bad faith and abuse of the judicial process based upon the filing of documents with the Alameda County Recorder\u2019s Office (the \u201cFraud Claim\u201d); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u2022 Violation of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights (Calif. Assem. Bill No. 278, Sen. Bill No. 900 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.)) (the \u201cCalifornia Claim\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Based on these claims, Ms. Carr seeks damages of $2,346,000.00 and a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining all Defendants from selling or conveying her Property or from evicting Ms. Carr from the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">(1) <em>Ms. Carr does not have standing to assert the Stay Violation Claim or the Avoidance </em>Claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Upon review of the factual allegations and claims in the Complaint, the first issue that arises is whether Ms. Carr has standing to pursue the claims. To appear and be heard in a bankruptcy case, a party must establish standing under either (i) Article III of the United States Constitution (which is required for all litigants in all federal cases), or (ii) Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 1109.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>In re Global Indus. Tech., Inc., </em>645 F.3d 201, 210-11 (3d Cir.2011). The Third Circuit decided that the boundaries for both Article III standing and standing under the Bankruptcy Code are coextensive. <em>Id. </em>at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">\u201cA party seeking constitutional standing must demonstrate an \u2018injury in fact\u2019 that is \u2018concrete\u2019, \u2018distinct and palpable\u2019, and \u2018actual or imminent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210 citing <em>Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em>495 U.S. 149, 155, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990). The Third Circuit further decided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiZ\">The party must establish that the injury fairly can be traced to the challenged action and is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. We have noted that the contours of the injury-in-fact requirement, while not precisely defined, are very generous. The standard is met as long as the party alleges a specific, identifiable trifle of injury or a personal stake in the outcome of the litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABQ\"><em>Id. </em>at 210 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Similarly, Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 1109 grants standing to a \u201cparty in interest,\u201d which has been described as \u201canyone who has a legally protected interest that could be affected by a bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d <em>Matter of James Wilson Associates, </em>965 F.2d 160, 169 (7th Cir.1992).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-15\">Ms. Carr claims that the transfer of the Note and Deed of Trust to the Defendants violated the automatic stay of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The purpose of the automatic stay is to protect the debtor and its creditors. <em>Radogna v. Williams Twp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>(In re Radogna), </em>331 Fed.Appx. 962, 965 (3d Cir.2009) quoting <em>Matter of New Era, Inc., </em>135 F.3d 1206, 1210 (7th Cir.1998). Moreover:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">The automatic stay is one of the fundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy law. It gives the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors. It stops all collection efforts, all harassment, and all foreclosure actions. It permits the debtor to attempt a repayment or reorganization plan or simply to be relieved of the financial pressures that drove him into bankruptcy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">The automatic stay also provides creditor protection. Without it, certain creditors would be able to pursue their own remedies against the debtor\u2019s property. Those who acted first would obtain payment of the claims in preference to and to the detriment of other creditors....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiVt\"><em>Assoc. of St. Croix Condominium, Owners v. St. Croix Hotel Corp., </em>682 F.2d 446, 448 (3d Cir.1982) quoting H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong. 1st Sess. 340 (1977), reprinted in U.S. Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1978, p. 5787. At the time she filed this adversary proceeding, Ms. Carr was neither a debtor nor a creditor of the Debtors and, therefore, she lacks the authority to enforce the automatic stay either on behalf of the Debtors or herself.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Radogna, </em>331 Fed.Appx. at 965. <em>See also Yanik v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>2011 WL 223739 (C.D.Ca. Jan. 21, 2011) (\u201cthe Ninth Circuit has limited standing to assert claims for violation of a stay to individuals Congress designated as beneficiaries of the stay.\u201d). Ms. Carr does not have standing to pursue the Stay Violation Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Ms. Carr\u2019s Avoidance Claim asserts that the Defendants violated Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 101(31), \u00a7 101(54), \u00a7 547 and \u00a7 548. Bankruptcy Code sections 101(31) and 101(54) define the terms \u201cinsider\u201d and \u201ctransfer\u201d and do not provide a basis for relief. Ms. Carr\u2019s Complaint alleges that the Carr Loan was transferred post-petition and, therefore, the factual allegations do not support claims against the Defendants based upon Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 547 or \u00a7 548, since those sections au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>thorize a trustee to seek to avoid certain <em>pre-petition </em>transfers only. Further, even assuming that the Carr Loan was transferred pre-petition, the time for pursuing such actions has passed. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 546(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Further, Ms. Carr is not a trustee and has no standing to pursue claims under either \u00a7 547 or \u00a7 548, and allegations in the Complaint do not support a grant of derivative standing. <em>Official Comm. Of Unsecured Creditors of Cybergenics Corp. v. Chinery, </em>330 F.3d 548 (3d Cir.2003). <em>See also In re Yes! Entertainment Corp., </em>316 B.R. 141, 145 (D.Del.2004) (Generally, derivative standing requires (1) a colorable claim; (2) that the trustee unjustifiably refused to pursue the claim, and (3) permission of the bankruptcy court to initiate the action); <em>In re Redden, </em>2013 WL 5436368, *3 (Bankr.D.Del. Sept. 30, 2013) (\u201cWithout an argument that granting standing would benefit the bankruptcy estate, derivative standing is necessarily improper.\u201d). Finally, because Ms. Carr is not a creditor of the Debtors or the Liquidating Trust, she has not shown an injury that could be redressed by the avoidance of the Debtors\u2019 transfer of the Carr Loan and its return to the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">(2) <em>This Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Fraud Claim or the California Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"Abb1\">Whether this Court can exercise jurisdiction over the remaining Fraud Claim and California Claim depends on an analysis of the statute granting federal district courts and bankruptcy courts subject matter jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters. Federal bankruptcy jurisdiction is established in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334 which provides that \u201cdistrict courts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title 11\u201d (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(a)), and that \u201cdistrict courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11\u201d (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b)). <em>In re Combustion Engineering, Inc., </em>391 F.3d 190, 225 (3d Cir.2004). Further, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(a) permits district courts to refer most matters to the bankruptcy courts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis broad jurisdictional grant allows bankruptcy courts to \u2018deal efficiently and expeditiously with all matters connected with the bankruptcy estate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Edwards, </em>514 U.S. 300, 308, 115 S.Ct. 1493, 131 L.Ed.2d 403 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Thus, Bankruptcy Court jurisdiction extends potentially to: (i) cases under title 11; (ii) proceedings arising under title 11; (iii) proceedings arising in a case under title 11; and (iv) proceedings related to a case under title 11.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Combustion Engineering, </em>391 F.3d at 225. The first category, \u201ccases under title 11\u201d refers to the bankruptcy petition itself and is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>applicable here. <em>Id. </em>n. 38. A claim will \u201carise under\u201d title 11 if \u201cthe Bankruptcy Code creates the cause of action or provides the substantive right invoked.\u201d <em>Stoe v. Flaherty, </em>436 F.3d 209, 217 (3d Cir.2006) quoting <em>Halper v. Halper, </em>164 F.3d 830, 836-37 n. 7 (3d Cir.1999). The causes of action asserted in Ms. Carr\u2019s Fraud Claim and California Claim are not created by the Bankruptcy Code. A claim will \u201carise in\u201d a title 11 case if that claim, by its nature, and not the particular factual circumstance, could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case. <em>Stoe, </em>436 F.3d at 218 citing <em>Halper, </em>164 F.3d at 836. Ms. Carr\u2019s claims for fraud, bad faith, abuse of process and violations of the California Homeowner Bill of Rights are not claims that arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case. There is no \u201carising under\u201d or \u201carising in\u201d jurisdiction to consider the Fraud Claim or the California Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The remaining question is whether there is \u201crelated to\u201d jurisdiction. Generally, a proceeding is \u201crelated to\u201d a bankruptcy case if \u201cthe outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Stoe, </em>436 F.3d at 216 quoting <em>Pacor, Inc. v. Higgins, </em>743 F.2d 984, 994 (3d Cir.1984).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, this adversary proceeding was filed post-confirmation and \u201crelated to\u201d jurisdiction narrows post-confirmation. In <em>Binder v. Price Waterhouse &amp; Co., LLP (In re Resorts Int\u2019l, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>Inc.), </em>372 F.3d 154 (3d Cir.2004), the Third Circuit decided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">[T]he jurisdiction of the non-Article III bankruptcy courts is limited after confirmation of a plan. But where there is a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding, as when a matter affects the interpretation, implementation, consummation, execution, or administration of a confirmed plan or incorporated litigation trust agreement, retention of post-confirmation bankruptcy court jurisdiction is normally appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3z\"><em>Resorts, </em>372 F.3d at 168-69. In <em>Geruschat v. Ernst Young LLP (In re Seven Fields Dev. Corp.), </em>505 F.3d 237 (3d Cir.2007), the Third Circuit clarified that the Resorts \u201cclose nexus\u201d test applies to proceedings that are filed post-confirmation, writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFR\">After our present consideration of <em>Resorts, </em>we are satisfied that the \u201cclose nexus\u201d test is applicable to \u201crelated to\u201d jurisdiction over any claim or cause of action filed post-confirmation, regardless of when the conduct giving rise to the claim or cause of action occurred. We reach this conclusion because in <em>Resorts, </em>though we were dealing with post-confirmation rather than pre-confirmation conduct, we focused on the point of time in which the cause of action was instituted: whether it was filed in the \u201cpost-confirmation stage,\u201d <em>ie., </em>the \u201cpost-confirmation context.\u201d Furthermore, we did not indicate that the test should be confined to situations in which the conduct giving rise to the complaint occurred post-confirmation. Moreover, since <em>Resorts, </em>we have stated that we use the test to determine whether \u201c \u2018related to\u2019 jurisdiction ... exist[s] at the post-confirmation stage,\u201d <em>Sloe, </em>436 F.3d at 216 n. 3 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\"><em>Seven Fields, </em>505 F.3d at 264-65. Because this adversary proceeding was filed three and a half years after confirmation of the Modified Plan, the \u201cclose nexus\u201d test applies to determine whether this Court has \u201crelated to\u201d jurisdiction over the Fraud Claim or the California Claim. Ms. Carr asserts that the Defendants filed certain fraudulent documents post-petition in the state recorder of deeds office in an attempt to \u201csteal\u201d her real property and, further, that these actions violated the California Homeowner Bill of Rights. The issues in those claims, including whether the third-party Defendants hold a valid chain of title to the Deed of Trust or whether the third-party Defendants engaged in fraud or bad faith when filing documents and attempting to foreclose upon her real property, do not affect the interpretation, implementation, consummation, execution, or administration of the Debtors\u2019 confirmed plan or the Trust Agreement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Ms. Carr argues that the Defendants were creditors of the Debtors at the time the petition was filed (and perhaps even at the time the Defendants performed the conduct complained about), but the Defendants\u2019 status as creditors of the Debtors does not provide any basis for bankruptcy jurisdiction for disposition of Ms. Carr\u2019s claims by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Ms. Carr is a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff. I understand her position that she has suffered injuries from the Defendants\u2019 alleged conduct, but as I have previously stated\u2014 repeatedly \u2014 this Court is not the appropriate forum \u2014 indeed, it does not have jurisdictional authority \u2014 to hear and determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Ms. Carr\u2019s claims. As I explained in the First Adversary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">To the extent the Plaintiff seeks further relief regarding the validity of assignments and the enforceability of the note or deed of trust, she must address these claims in an appropriate forum with the participation of the entity or entities now claiming an interest in or ownership of the note and deed of trust. Such claims involve the rights and interests of third parties not currently before the Court, and the outcome of any dispute between or among those parties will not have any effect upon the Debtors\u2019 bankruptcy estate. Therefore, the Bankruptcy Court currently does not have jurisdiction over such disputes. <em>See Pacor, Inc. v. Higgins, </em>743 F.2d 984, 994 (3d Cir.1984)5 (\u201cThe usual articulation of the test for determining whether a civil proceeding is related to bankruptcy is whether the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.... An action is related to bankruptcy if the outcome could alter the debtor\u2019s rights, liabilities, options, or freedom of action (either positively or negatively) and which in any way impacts upon the handling and administration of the bankrupt estate.\u201d).6 <em>See also In re Resorts Int'l, Inc., </em>372 F.3d 154, 168-69 (3d Cir.2004) (Post-confirmation, a bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to matters in which \u201cthere is a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or a proceeding, as when a matter affects the interpretation, implementation, consummation, execution, or administration of a confirmed plan or incorporated litigation trust agreement\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">[n.5 While <em>Pacor </em>was overruled on other grounds by <em>Things Remembered, Inc. v.
