In the spring of the year 1816, <em>Craven P. Beading </em>intermarried with <em>Rosetta Lackland, </em>one of the slaughters and devisees as aforesaid of <em>James Lack-land, </em>and at. the time of their intermarriage, and at the several times hereinafter mentioned, the estate, real and personal, of <em>James </em>Lackland, was held by the devisees in common, and undivided, nuder the care of the executors named in the will, according to the terms and provisions of the same. After this marriage <em>Craven P. Deeding </em>received from the estate of <em>James Lackland, </em>at various periods and dates, personal properly to the value of S1129 10. In February 1818, the real estate of <em>James Lackland, </em>being then held in common under the will aforesaid, and. the devisees of the age of twenty-one finding it impossible to have a sale or division of the real estate, without legislative interference, they the said children and devisees, with the aid and consent of the guardians of those under age, procured the passage of an act of assembly of this state, 1817, <em>ch. </em>215, entitled. \u201cAn act to appointtrustees for the sale of the real estate of <em>James LucMand, </em>late of <em>Montgomery </em>county, deceased.\u201d By this act, <em>William Dame </em>and <em>Dinnis Lackland </em>were appointed trustees to make sale of all the real estate of <em>James Lackland, </em>upon certain terms and conditions, first giving bond, with security to be approved by the orphans court of the county. The money\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>arising from the sale of the said lands, after the payment .of expenses and the debts due by the estate of <em>James Lack-land, </em>was directed to be paid over to hi\u00e1devise\u00e9s, or to his? her or their guardian or guardians, representative or representatives, in equal proportions. The trustees entered into bond, agreeably to the direction's of this act of assembly, on the 15th of August 1818, but had not sold any part of the land therein mentioned at the time the attachment in this case was laid on the property in question. After the passage of the act of assembly, but before any sale was made under it, <em>C. P. Beeding, </em>and <em>Rosetta </em>his wife, executed and delivered; on the 21st day of February 1818, and which was duly acknowledged and recorded, an indenture, conveying and transferring to <em>James C. Lackland </em>all their right.and title to one eighth part of the real estate of <em>James Lackland, </em>deceased, \u201cto have and to hold the said estate and interest so as aforesaid described, and hereby bargained and sold, or meant, mentioned, or intended hereby so to be, and every part and parcel thereof, to the said <em>James C.

Beeding </em>and <em>Rosetta </em>A. <em>Beeding, </em>or either of them, would be entitled if the sale had been so authorised and made before the execution of this instrument of writing; and the said proceeds, so received, he the said <em>James G. Lackland, </em>and his heirs, shall hold and employ for the sole separate and exclusive use and benefit of the said <em>Rosetta L,. Beeding,' </em>and her heirs and assigns, for ever.\u201d On the 19th of September 1818, <em>Craven P. Beeding, </em>duly executed, acknowledged, delivered and recorded, an indenture, conveying and transferring to <em>James G. Jiackland </em>all his personal property, and directing the same to be sold, and out of the proceeds to pay certain of his creditors, and the residue, if any, to be divided amongst all his other creditors, &amp;c. On the 15th of October 1818, <em>Craven P. Beeding </em>drew certain drafts on <em>William Dame </em>and <em>Bennis </em>Lackland, as trustees under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u2022the act of assembly aforesaid, one in favour of <em>Jl. Taney, </em>admitted to be for a valuable consideration, and the other in favour of <em>James C. Lackland, </em>which were by them accepted, with the following proviso: \u201cprovided however, that it. shall not be payable by us until a sale of the estate of <em>James </em>Lackland, deceased, and not then unless allowed by the court, which shall hereafter govern us in the payment of the money felling due for <em>Rosetta L. Beeding\u2019s </em>part. And provided also, that if the conveyance to <em>James C. Jjackland </em>should be sustained as valid for the whole interest conveyed, or the draft in said <em>Lackland\u2019s </em>favour, this day by us accepted', be sustained in the whole, then this acceptance shall be void.\u201d In the summer of- fall of 1819, <em>V. P. Heeding </em>became an insolvent debtor in the county of <em>Washington, </em>in the District of <em>Columbia, </em>where lie then lived, and had lived for more than three years before, and obtained fiotn one of the judges of the circuit court for the county aforesaid, a discharge according to law, under the acts of congress provided for the relief of insolvent debtors. It was also agreed, that the promissory notes filed with the affidavit made by the plaint ill, were drawn by <em>C. P. Heeding, </em>and delivered to the plaintiff, and that <em>C. P. Bee 'ing </em>was not a citizen of the state of <em>Maryland </em>when the affidavit in this cause was made by the plaintiff) and the attachment was issued an-:! laid. Also that the plaintiff resides, and always has resided in <em>Gcorge-Town, in </em>the District of <em>Columbia; </em>and that after (lie said notes were drawn and delivered, they were (as it had been intended they should be,) endorsed by the plaintiif and <em>Janies Melvin, </em>and son, and discounted, for the accommodation. \u00ed\u00bbf <em>Heeding, </em>'at the Bank of <em>Columbia, </em>in renewal of certain other notes of the same amount, and similarly drawn and endorsed, and discounted before them, and which had been coniinued in said bank, asan accommodation to <em>Deeding, </em>for a year previous to the date of those now filed; and that when the said last notes fell due, they were not paid by Deeding, but taken up and paid by the plaintiff, <em>Deeding </em>having; then failed or stopped payment, and having been considerably indebted for some time before and at the time of his conveyances and drafts herein before mentioned. It was further agreed, that the affidavits of the several defendants, relative to the real and personal estate of <em>James Lackland, </em>and the proceeds and profits thereof, and <em>Deed* </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>ing\u2019s </em>interest therein, should be considered a part of thi\u00e1 statement. On these facts the plaintiff'prayed the court to instruct the jury, that the deed from <em>Craven P. </em>Deeding; and <em>Rosetta </em>his wife, to <em>James C. </em>Lackland, dated the 2.1st of February 1818', and the draft in favour of <em>James C. Lackland, </em>were fraudulent and void as against the plaintiff; that <em>Deeding, </em>by his intermarriage with his said wife, became seized of an interest in the lands of which her father died seized as aforesaid, and upon that interest the plaintiff had a right to lay ah attachment, and having laid it thereon, was entitled to a condemnation thereof in satisfaction of the amount of his claim; as also for the sums stated to be and to have been in the hands of the defendants, as garnishees, for the reiits and profits thereof, at the time of laying the attachment, and since. The courtj <em>[Ridgely </em>and <em>\u00c9Slgour, </em>A. 3-3 gave the following opinion; The plaintiff hath prayed the court to direct the jury, upon the aforegoing statement offacts, that the deed from <em>Beetling, </em>and wife, to <em>James C. Lackland, </em>dated oil the 21st of February 1818, and also the order in favour of <em>James C\u201e Lackland, </em>bearing date on the 15th of October 1818, drawn on <em>Dame </em>and <em>B. Lackland, </em>are fraudulent and void as against the plaintiff. That <em>Deeding, </em>by his intermarriage with his 'wife, became seized of an interest in the lands of which her father died seized, and upon that interest the plaintiff had a right to lay an attachment, and is entitled to condemnation thereof, in satisfaction of his claims; also condemnation for the amount of all sums of money stated to be and to have been in the hands of the defendants, as garnishees, arising from the rents and profits of said testator\u2019s real estate at the time of laying said attachment and since. Upon this application to the court three questions arise for their consideration and <em>direction </em>\u2014 First. Whether the deed from <em>Beetling </em>and wife to <em>James C. Lackland, </em>dated on the 21st of February 1818, and the order drawn by <em>Beetling </em>on <em>Dame </em>and <em>2). Lackland, </em>dated the 15 th of October 1818-, ana conditionally accepted by them on the 19 th of the same month, are fraudulent and void against the plaintiff? The court are of opinion, that fraud is a fact that may as properly be inquired into in a court of law as in a court of equity. That by the intermarriage of <em>Seeding </em>and wife, (there being no previous marriage contract between them,) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>be the husband, in virtue of his marital rights, acquired an interest in the wife's proportion of her father\u2019s real estate, subject to the terms prescribed in the father\u2019s will. That it being admitted by the parties that <em>Heeding </em>was indebted to the plaintiff, (at the time of the execution of the said deed and at the time the saitiorder was drawn,) to the amount for which this suit is brought, and the said deed appearing on the face of it to be a voluntary deed without valuable consideraci\u00f3n, it is therefore declared by the court to be void against the plaintiff*, an antecedent creditor, and of no legal effect <em>to </em>defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim in the present suit; and that the order drawn <em>on Dame and D. Lack-land </em>by <em>Heeding, </em>in favour <em>o\u00ed\u2019James V. Lackland, </em>as trustee for the separate use of his wife, (being founded on the supposed right of die husband to make such a disposition, although previously involved in debt,) and being in pursuance of and in conformity of the deed of trust aforesaid, is also deemed by this court to be null and void, so far as the plaintiff'may be affected as a creditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-4\">With respect to the <em>second </em>question, whether the plaintiff had a right to lay his attachment on the undivided interest in the real estate acquired by <em>Beading's </em>wife under the will oi her father, and have condemnation thereof in this suit? will depend on the present condition of the real estate. By the act of assembly of 1817, referred to, the real estate of the testator, <em>James </em>Lackland,, was placed under the power and control of trustees, who accepted the trust, gave bond and security for their lailhfui performance, and who have proceeded to execute the same long before the present attachment was laid upon the lands. It is therefore the opinion of the court, that die trustees have acquired such a disposing power and interest in the lands, that the present attachment cannot affect or bind die same, even if it had been laid in their hands, and they had been made parties to the suit. That the plaintiff' lias no remedy in the present suit against the said real estate, hut his relief is in a court of equity, where trusts are alone cognizable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">In relation to the <em>third </em>question respecting the rents and profits, &amp;c. received by the defendants, the court are of opinion, that whatever sum or sums of money which were in the hands of the defendants as executors, and received as the wife\u2019s proportion of the rents and profits, or in \u00bfho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>hands of the defendant <em>James C. Lackland, </em>as trustee, are liable to. be affected by the present attachment,, and condemnation may be rightfully had therfeon, not only the. monies in their hands at the time of laying the attachment, but all monies, respectively received' by them since that period to the present time. After this opinion was given, it was further admitted, that the defendants, <em>James C. </em>and; <em>George L. Lackland, </em>had in their hands, at the time the at-, tachment was laid, the sum of-, which had been received on\u2019account of the rents and profits of the lands of' the testator, and- retained as <em>Rosetta Bceding\u2019s </em>share of-the same; and that since then they have received the further. sum of-, and retained the .same, (or paid it over to, Mr. <em>Beeding,) </em>on the same account. It was also admitted, that of the lands of the testator, one: tract called-, was sold- by <em>Dame </em>and <em>B. Lackland </em>in May 1820, for. 552000, and that out of that sum 55600, with the interest on that part of the purchase money from the. time of .the. sale, was retained on account of .a debt due from the testator, which debt had been either actually paid, or the. funds as aforesaid retained for that purpose, and that there was no other debt known or believed to be outstanding, against the estate; and. that Mrs. <em>Beeding\u2019s </em>share or in-, ferest in the balance of the purchase money was in the. hands of <em>Dame </em>and <em>\u00a3). Lackland, </em>the trustees, appointed by the act of assembly, and, had not been paid over to, <em>Beeding </em>or Mrs. <em>Beeding, </em>or <em>to James C. Lackland, </em>but remained in their hands to be paid over to <em>James C. Lack-land, </em>as her trustee, on the determination of this suit, in case the deed, to him from <em>Beeding </em>and wife, or the draft and acceptance of the trustees aforesaid, should be sustained as valid against the plaintiff. It was further agreed, 1 that of the lands of the testator some were occupied by the defendants, <em>George L. Lackland, </em>and some by <em>James C. Lackland, </em>under an agreement with the other b^irs to. pay rent of \u2014--r, annually, and that some of said, lands were rented out by defendants to others, and that some were in wood and untenanted. That the said lands lie. in, this county, &amp;c, and that the yearly value of them is -, and the gc-s, value of those still remaining unsold is SI 2,800. Upon this statement, and the affidavits of the defendants, the plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury, that the defendants had no right to sett-off against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s claim for the rents coming into the defen-; dams\u2019\u2019 hand\u00bb after the laying of the attachment, their demand for the &amp;5G0 stated in their affidavit to have been over paid <em>.Heeding </em>on account of ihe personal estate. But the court refused to give the said instruction as prayed, but instructed the jury, that the defendants might retain and apply the said rents, as they came into their hands, to the credit of their said claim, on said <em>Heeding. </em>To this refusal and opinion, as also to the opinion before delivered by the court, the plaintiff excepted; and the verdict and judgment being for the defendants, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-3\">The cause was argued before Buchanah-, Ch.

In the. only bill of excepti ms filed in this cause, there are two. opinions delivered by <em>Montgomery </em>county court, unfavourable to the claims of the appellant. In the one the court decide, that the lands atiached are not subject to condemnation for the debt of the appellant; and by the other, they refuse on his prayer to instruct the jury, that the defendant had no right to set off against the appellant\u2019s claim for rents coming into the defendant\u2019s hands after laying the attachment, their demand for 0300 stated in their affidavit to have been overpaid <em>Heeding </em>on account of the personal estate..</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Without examining or adopting the reasons assigned for either o\u00ed those opinions, this court affirm this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The appellant was not entitled to have condemnation of any part of the property attached in this case, having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>failed to show himself of that description of'persons who, have a right to issue an attachment under the provisions of the act of 1795, <em>ch. 56. </em>By that act the remedy is confined- to citizens of this state, or some-other of the <em>United Slates, </em>and it no where appears on the face of this record, that the appellant is either the one or the other. On the contrary it appears, that he resides, and always lias resided m <em>George Town, </em>in the District of Columbia, being neither a citizen of <em>Maryland, </em>nor of any other of the <em>United- States, </em>but a citizen of that district of territory only. .The case of <em>Shivers vs. Wilson, </em>determined in this court, <em>(5 Harr. &amp; Johns 130,) </em>is decisive of this question, being a case in all respects analagous to this. There, as here, the plaintiff in the inferior court is described to be q citizen of the <em>United States, </em>without designating him a citizen of <em>Maryland, </em>or some of the. <em>United States, </em>and his case was decided not to be within the provisions of the aforesaid act of 1795, <em>ch. </em>56.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The appellant here having failed to bring his.case within the provisions of that act, the court below were, right in deciding that the lands attached were not liable to^ con\u00bb demnation for his debt, and in refusing to give any opinion b;iat might enable him to. recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">JUDGMENT APE\u00cdRMED,,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
