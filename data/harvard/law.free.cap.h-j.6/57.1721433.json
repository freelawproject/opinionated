They also offered in evidence a certain paper writing, purporting to be a subscription list of stock, taken and subscribed for bn the 7th of March 1814, pursuant to the said act of assembly for makihg the said turnpike'road, at-Bws/i town, in <em>Harford </em>county, by the commissioners appointed for that purpose; And proved that the signature to the said paper writing, <em>\u201cHosier </em>Barnes,\u201d and the words <em>\u201cfour shares,\u201d </em>writtefi thereto, were in the proper hand writing of the defendant. They further offered in evidence, that the several requisitions of the instalments of capital stock of the said company, set forth and stated iii the declaration, viz. oh the 26th of September 1814, 1st of June 1815, 4th \u25a0 September \u00cd815, 20th Dec\u00e9fnber 18\u00cd5, and on the 10th of March 1816, were made in the manner and form prescribed by the said act of incorporation; and that the president and managers of th\u00e9 said company gave two months public notice of the payment so required. The plaintiffs then prayed the opinion and direction of the court to the jury, that if fee jury sh\u00f3'\u00fcld believe that the time appointed for the payment of <em>the last </em>instalment\" on fee said stock, so subscribed for, ahd required to be paid as is set forth in the declaration, was within three ye\u00e1ri next before the impetration of the' original writ of the plaintiffs; fb\u00e1t they are not barred by the defendant\u2019s pleas' &lt;r the statute of limitations, or by any of them, in their right of action, as to any portion of their said claim, but \u00e1re entitled to recover for the whole subscription then ditev The-court, [ <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Ward </em>A.

The defendant subscribed fer four shares at 825 per share, to be called for in four instalments at 85 each. \u2022The last call was made on the 1 Qth.of January, 1816, payable the 10th March, 1816, and the writissued on the 25th, of January, 1819, within three years before , the time for payment of the last instalment, but not within thrqe years pe to the other instalments; and the act of limitations has been pleaded. The only question is, whether the. plea of. limitations applies to the cage? By the 8th sect, of the act of 1813, <em>ch. </em>167, the act of 1812, <em>ch. </em>78, is referred to as giving the right to,enforce payment, if the party sub-, scribing refuses to pay. The defendant became answerable to pay the whole on failing, to pay each instalment at the time of the last call, otherwise there would be a multiplicity of suits. The right of action only accrued on the last instalment. The plea must be .true, in toto, or not at all. In point of fact the defendant has not made out his pleas, because the limitation cannot bar the who!?, as the last call is not barred. Here he has. pleaded general pleas of <em>non assumpsit infra tres annos, na\u00e1^actio non </em>ac<em>crevit infra tres annos. </em>The opinion of the, chuspis erroneous, because they say the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover any thing.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-4\"><em>Magruder </em>and <em>M.

Sp in. an, action, on open account, where some of the articles, are more than three years standing, and limitations are pleaded \u2014 it will bar all the articles charged more than three, years. Suppose a note for different instalments, on one becoming due. the holder might sue for it, and the right of action then accrued. Here the right to sue arose at the time ea,ch instalment became due. An engagement to, pay. by instalments, entitles the party to sue, on each being dqe, in <em>assumpsit, </em>but not in. debt. <em>Rudder vs. Price, </em>1 H. <em>Blk. </em>547. <em>Cooke vs. Whorwood, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>3 <em>Saund. </em>337. <em>Gray vs. Pindar, </em>2 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>427; <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>414, and <em>note. </em>The plaintiffs, therefore, could have sued for each instalment as they respectively became due. The only doubt is, whether oh the first instalment becoming due'the plaintiffs might sue for the whole? Four of the instalments were of more than three years, standing when the action was brought. Where a party agrees to pay a, sum of money in portions, as it may be called1 for, when called for, the right of action accrues. Whether the opinion of the court below is wrong in part,, is of no consequence, because if a verdict bad been given for the \u00a75 on each share of the last instalment, they could not sustain the action, the amount not being within the jurisdiction of the court. If the case is reversed, will -it be sent hack when it is seen the plaintiffs cannot succeed? The spirit of the act of <em>1790, ch. </em>42, does not embrace a case like this. \u2018 \" .....</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The opinion of. the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b68-9\">Martin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asn\">This was an action brought to recover the price of-four shares in <em>The Baltimore fy Plavre-cle- Grace. Turnpike Company, </em>amounting to \u00a7100; this sum was to be paid in five instalments of \u00a720 each, four of those instalments vyere due before the, 1st of January, 1816, the last on the l()th of- March in the same year, The defendant relied on the statute of limitations, and the court instructed the j.ui-y, that from the evidence, the plaintiffs were-barred of- their right of. action, by the pleas of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">The plaintiffs had a right to demand from the defendant, the amount of each instalment when it became due, and limitation attached at that time; they were then barred by the pleas of the defendant, as to the four first instalments, because inore than three years had elapsed from the time they were demandable to the institution of- the suit. The last instalment of \u00a720 became due on the 10th of March, 1816, and the suit was commenced on the 23th of January, 1819, this being within ijhree years before the suit, limitation did not bar it. Had the plaintiffs then a legal right of action to maintain this suit for the sum of \u00a720? If they had a right of action, they were entitled to the judgment of the court, and to the fruits of that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">By the act of 1809, <em>ch. </em>74, it is d^clar^d, \u201cthat in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>cases where ihe real debt or damages shall not exceed the sum of \u00a750, it shall and may be lawful for one justice of \u2022fhe peace, to fry, hear, and determine, the matter in controversy between-the parties;\u201d and by the 6 th section of the same law, \u201cthat the judges of the several county courts within this state, shall not hold plea in the said courts of any debt or damage, in cases within the jurisdiction given to justices of the peace by this act, which gliall not exceed \u00a750. \u201d The court then having no jurisdiction, unless the sum recovered amounted to aboye \u00a750, a judgment could not havp been rendered on a verdict for \u00a720, and the plaintiffs would have been nonsuited.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">It was contended, that although a judgment could not have been rendered on a verdict for \u00a720, the court were wrong in directing the jury to find for the defendant, and for this error the judgment ought to be reversed, and the case sent back for a second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">By the act of 1790, <em>ch. </em>42, the court are directed, where the judgment, on a bill of exceptions taken by the plaintiff, is reversed, to send the case back with a <em>procedendo. </em>This is evidently intended for the benefit of the plaintiff But why reverse a judgment, and direct a <em>procedendo </em>in a case, where the plaintiffs, by their own showing, never can be benefitted? whgra they never can obtain the judgment of the court, but must suffer a nonsuit. Such a course of proceedings would be idle and nugatory, and sanaot sanctioned by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">judgment A3t;r&gt;i:ed*</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
