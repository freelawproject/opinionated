An inquiry at bar was ordered, and an inquisition returned, assessing the damages sustained by the plaintiff to gl 0,271 53, and 810 costs; upon which inquisition judgment was rendered for 825,000 the debt, being the penalty of the bond, and the above costs, and costs of increase, to be released, &amp;c.

Whether the plea of tender by the defendant is good for that part of the plaintiff\u2019s demand to which it applies? 2. Whether the breach assigned by the plaintiff for not returning the goods ordered to be restored by the judgment of the court in an action of replevin, is within the condition of the appeal bond on which the suit is founded? The appeal bond presents two conditions to free the appellant from its obligation. 1st. He shall prosecute the appeal. 2d. He shall pay the damages and costs awarded in both courts, in case the judgment is affirmed. The <em>first </em>is complied with by bringing the record into this court, as directed by the act of 1713, <em>ch. </em>4, s. 4. The <em>second </em>is, that he shall pay such damages and costs as shall be awarded and adjudged in both courts. The court cannot enlarge the terms of the bond, so that if the appellant paid the damages and costs, it is sufficient to discharge him. If the plea of a tender, to which the plaintiff demurred, is a good plea, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-5\"><em>Taney </em>and <em>11.

That in such a plea the defendant must aver that he was ready to pay, and that he is still ready, and he must bring the money into court. 6 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>tit. <em>Tender, </em>(H.) The plea of tender in an action of <em>debt </em>is not in bar to the action, but to the recovery of damages. 1 <em>Tidd\u2019s Pr. </em>621. The form of the plea is given in 2 <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead. </em>432, 469. 2. That the meaning of the words in the condition of an appeal bond, <em>\u201cto jrrosecnle the appeal with </em>effect,\u201d was to reverse the judgment, or to effect some other successful termination of the appeal. <em>Johns. Dict. </em>tit. <em>Effect. </em>The appeal bond is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>secure the appellee froifi the insolvency of the principal? and all antecedent sureties given; for instance, the sureties in the repleviti bond. The breach in the replication is correctly assigned:. It shows the damage sustained by not jprosecuting the appeal with effect, and that thp goods, <em>Sic. </em>had not been returned; Which constituted a part of the damage sustained.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"ADx\">The opinion of the court, was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"AfD\">Dorsey, L</author>\n<p id=\"AWnT\">On the argument of the demurrefs in this tease, the true construction of the appeal bond; on which the present suit wes instituted? has been, brought into' \u00bfUs. cussion. On the part of the' appellant, it was contended? that the words \u201cprosecute with effect,\u201d mean that the party pr\u00e1ying the appeal, shall prosecute it to final judgment? While the other side insisted, that these words imposed on the appellant.the necessity of. prosecuting the <em>appeal to </em>a siifcfcessful termination, ora reversal of the judgment. This-court \u00e1re of opinion, that the construction adopted by the appellee\u2019s counsel,- is the correct one. It is certainly warranted by the grammatical meaning of the terms used; and if a different interpretation was to prevail, the bond would only be a security in those cases where the judgment be., low was given for debt, damages and costs, and for damages and costs', and judgments in replevin for a return- of the property, (being judgments <em>in rem,J </em>would necessarily be exempt from the operation of the bond. The act of 1713, <em>ch. </em>4, which prescribes the' forui of the appeal bond? declares, that no execution on any judgment shall be delayed,- or any <em>supersedeas </em>on such judgment granted, upon any appeal- or writ of error, unless a bond, With sufficient sureties, be executed. If the appeal and- execution of the bond operates as a <em>supersedeas </em>of an execution on a judgment in replevin, it would seem, on principles- of justice,, that the security should be as comprehensive in such a case, as where the judgment was for money; upon the affirmance of a judgment for money, the obligors are imperatively an- ' swerable for the amount of the debt,, damages and costs/ the delay occasioned by the appeal being the price- paid by the appellee for' the additional security; and where a judgment in replevin, for the return of the goods, shall be af-. firmed, the value of the goods, (if they have not been re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>stored,) and the costs of. suit, would seem to be the true standard by which the damages of the appellee should be measured on a suit brought on the appeal bond. If the appellant should dismiss his appeal, this rule would certainly prevail; and it is difficult to conceive, how. the security of the appellee can be lessened, in the event of his judgment being affirmed, as lire delay occasioned by the <em>supersedeas </em>would not be greater in the former than in the latter case, but generally less.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Having expressed our opinion on the, true construction of the bond, we will next advert to the pleadings in the. cause, and we think the replication cannot be sustained. The plaintiff assigns, his breach in the nonpayment of the costs of the inferior and appellate courts, and in the appellants not having made a return of the goods and chattels, in conformity to <em>the </em>judgment of affirmance.' This mode of replying is defective, the plaintiff should, liave replied, that the defendant did not prosecute his appeal with effect, whereby he had sustained damage to such an amount, liy this mode of replying, the pjaintiff below would have assigned a. breach in the nonperformance of an act which the defendant below had stipulated to perform, and under:, the allegation, that, the plaintiff had sustained damages to such an amount, the plaintiff\u2019might have shown that the goods were not returned. And the court cannot but remark, that tiie pleadings, subsequent to the replication, are in.con-ect. It is an established rule in pleading, that if a plea, avowry or replication, each of which is entire, be bad in part, it is bad. for the whole.. <em>Manchester vs. Vale, </em>1 <em>Saunders, </em>28. <em>(note 2.) Trueman vs. Haist, </em>1 <em>Term. Rep. </em>40. 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead. </em>644, 523, 524. Hence, it necessarily results, that a plea of tender cannot be. rejoined to part of a replication, and a demurrer filed to,the residue; and if the.law was otherwise, the plea of tender, as rejoined in this, case, would be badly pleaded. First,because the debt or duty continuing, the tender should be pleaded with a <em>profer\u00ed in </em>curia; 6 <em>Bacon\u2019s Abridgment, </em>tit. <em>Tender, </em>(H 4;) and secondly, because the rejoinder concludes in. bar to the action, instead of praying judgment whether the plaintiff ought to recover any damages, by reason of the nonpayment of the sum alleged to have been tendered.
