This opinion the court refused to give, being of opinion, that without such admission he would not be competent, and further, that it was immaterial and unnecessary to decide on the competency of the witness, after all objections to him had been withdrawn by the defendant, and an offer made by him that the said witness should be sworn <em>to </em>ike jury, without any prejudice to his testimony from the opinion first expressed by the court.

In 1782 <em>The Brothers </em>was all in. woods. <em>James Clarke </em>lived in <em>Baltimore., </em>and claimed title to the land as his own, and agreed to lease a part of it to the witness, who went on the land in the summer of 1782, under that agreement, and cleared about an acre, and fenced it in and built a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>cabin near the lines of <em>Walnut Bottom,', </em>but after seeing tha lines run, and finding the lines of <em>Walnut Bottom </em>t\u00edies\u00ed; held by <em>George Mason looll </em>in part of the land be expect, ed to lease, he refused to take the lease, and left the land, and went to, <em>Baltimore, </em>after having remained on the land eight or ten months. \"Witness lived in <em>Baltimore </em>from <em>2783, </em>at which time he left <em>The Brothers </em>until 1787,. when, witness again returned wilh his family.

From sometime between 1790 and 1795, to this time, <em>Beall, </em>and those claiming under him, have been in the actual possession and occupation of different parts of that part of <em>The Brothers </em>lying to the east of <em>Wills </em>creek, by cutting timber and clearing when it suited him, and leasing out and selling parts of the said tract to different persons, <em>Beall </em>claiming at the same time, title to the whole tract as having been purchased by Aim from <em>Faw, </em>except where he <em>Beall </em>had sold out parts of it. Witness knows nothing as to the possession on the west side of <em>Wills </em>creek, between 1795 and 1800. <em>James M'Coy </em>cleared a field, claiming under <em>Beall. </em>On tin? cross examination by defendant, witness stated, that about twelve years ago he saw some of the lines of <em>The Brothers </em>run, one of them run into the field of Colonel Lamar, who never claimed or held any of his land, under the title of <em>The Brothers,- </em>to the knowledge of the witness.

The witness does not know the lines of <em>The Brothers </em>on the west side of <em>\u00a1fills </em>creek, and does not know of any acts of ownership by <em>Beall </em>on the west side. The witness docs not know whether or <em>not Clarke or Fmo </em>was over in possession of <em>The Brothers, </em>it was in woods when the witness first know it, and very little improvement was made on u, until <em>Beall </em>got it.

The money was paid, and the witness obtained a deed from <em>Beall, </em>which was offered in evidence, dated the 7th of November 1795.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVN\">The witness- afterwards conveyed said land, to <em>Ly.m$ </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>.Lynn </em>went into possession of the land soon after the deed <em>to the </em>witness; witness lives in sight of the fields before mentioned by him, and knows of no act of ownership or possession by <em>Beall, </em>on any part of the said fields, since the deed to the witness, except occasionally surveying said lauds, on disputes between the plaintiff and defendant in <em>Allegany </em>county court about the location of their lands. If any part of the fields before mentioned by witness, are included in <em>George\u2019s Adventure, </em>then the defendant had possessed such part of <em>George\u2019s </em>Adventme, in the manner before stated. Witness knows another field, which he d\u00e9scribed; some part of that field was enclosed about 25 or 26 years ago by <em>Zachariah </em>Magruder, as a part of <em>George\u2019s Adventure, </em>but the part so included is not located on the plats. <em>Zachariah Magruder </em>from the year 1792 until his death, which happened in the year 1798, or thereabouts, exercised acts of genera! ownership over the tract called <em>George\u2019s Adventure, by cutting timber in </em>different places; claiming and cultivating in others, and claiming title to the whole tract; and about 12 or 13 years ago the defendant entered into <em>George\u2019s Adventure, </em>claiming under the heirs of said <em>Magruder, </em>and has ever since exercised acts of general ownership over the said land, by cutting timber and wood, clearing and cultivating diffeVent par\u00eds, and claiming title to the whole; the heirs of <em>Magruder </em>exercised the same sort of ownership over the said land from his death, until the possession was transferred to the defendant. The plaintiff further offered in evidence by <em>Beall </em>Howard, esq. a, competent witness, and one of the counsel for the plaintiff', and residing in <em>Allegany </em>county, that in 1813 or 1817, witness made a diligent search among the records ia the office of the court of appeals, with the assistance of the clerk of that court, for a deed from <em>Thomas French, </em>the nn fan ten of <em>The Brothers, to James Clarke, </em>for <em>The Bi </em>without success; and in 1817 or 1818, he made a among the land records of <em>Frederick </em>county1' could find no such deed, and could find no de kind from <em>Thomas French </em>to <em>James Clarke </em>t cords. The plaintiff'further offered in evidence <em>Myers, </em>a competent witness, that the witness is the office of the clerk of <em>Washington </em>county i transacts the greater part of the business of that office; he has been 12 years a clerk in the office, and ig familiar with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>its business. He 'diligently searched \u00a1the records of <em>Washington </em>county court, from the beginning.ofthem, to'the 7th of November 1785, for a de.ed fr.om <em>Thomas French </em>to <em>'Janies Clarke, </em>for the tract called <em>The Brothers, </em>and could find np such deed 0\u00bb the land records. The records of .deeds in <em>Washington </em>county begin in 1777, he can fifid no \u00ab\u00a1leed of any kind on those records from <em>Thomas French </em>to <em>James </em>Clarke. The defendant then offered in evidence, by <em>F.oger Perry, </em>esqi a competeiit witness in this cause, that .the witness went fo Cumberland,- in <em>Allegany </em>co\u00fcnty, in the year 1794, to reside, and has resided there ever since. That the field first mentioned in the evidence of <em>William McMahon, </em>herein before stated, was cleared, and the wood but Off of it in the winter of 1795; and was enclosed in the spring of 1796, by the defendant, and has remained in his possession ever since. That the second field, also mentioned in the \u00a1testimony of <em>W'illiam M\u2019-Mahon, </em>.was enclosed, as the witness thinks, in 3797, but that he is certain it was enclosed in 1798, and in the possession of the defendant; and has continued to be in his possession, by enclosure; ever since; That the third field, -mentioned in the said testimony of <em>M\u2019-Mahori, </em>was enclosed by the defendant about the year 1799 or 1800, and an orchard planted .on it. That about two years after the first enclosure of paid field; the fence, or a part of it, was taken down to se* cure the fruit trees which had survived the ravages of the locusts, and as the orchard- had never been cultivated, a great nuinber of brushes gr.\u00e9w \u00fap, the field was throwii open, and remained open from four <em>to </em>six years, when it was again enclosed by the-defendant; and still remains in his possession by enclosure and cultivation;. That part of the last field, mentioned in the testimony \u00f3f <em>M Mahon, </em>not included within <em>George\u2019s Adventure, </em>was enclosed by <em>Lynn </em>in 1796, and has remained in the possession, by enclosure and cultivation, of <em>Lynn, </em>to the present time. That part of the last field, included within the lines pf <em>George\u2019s Adventure, </em>when the witness first knew it in the fall of 1794, except a small part of it, was enclosed and in the possession of <em>Zachariah Magruder, </em>and remained in lijs possession until his death. <em>Zachariah Magruder </em>ye.sided on anci exercised general acts of ownership oyer George\u2019\u00a7 <em>Adventure, </em>by cutting timber, and cultivating parts of it. About the year 1798 <em>Magruder </em>died, and bis heirs remained <em>fS </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>possession until about tiie year \u00cd802, when <em>David Lynn </em>purchased the said land of a trustee appointed by the chancellor for the sale of the intercut of the said heirs, and-<em>Lynn </em>then entered into possession as aforesaid, and\u2019 about the year 1802 enlarged his enclosure of that field, and lias remained in its possession, by enclosure, from that time to the present. <em>Lynn </em>claims the laud described above, and for which he has taken defence, part as within the lines of <em>Crooked Meanders </em>and <em>Crooked Meanders llesurveyed, </em>part as <em>Walnut </em>Bottom, purchased by <em>William M* Mahon </em>of' <em>Thomas Beall, </em>and part as <em>George\u2019s Adventure. </em>The defendant further offered in evidence the patent for the tract called <em>George\u2019s </em>Adventure, located on the plats granted to <em>George.-French of Thomas, on </em>the 21st of April 1775. And also the patent for <em>Crooked Meanders, </em>granted to thq. defendant on the 19th of November 171)0.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-3\">The plaintiff then prayed the direction of the court ta, the jury, that if they believed the evidence given by the plaintiff and the defendant, that they might presume that: <em>Thomas French, </em>the patentee of the tract. called <em>The Brothers, </em>conveyed said tract to <em>James Clarke </em>before tho 7th of November 1785.

That the evidence offered by the defendant, of a conflicting- location of another tract of land with <em>The Brothers, </em>and of.pos \u25a0 session of parcels of land within the lines of <em>The </em>Brothers, claiming such possession under an adverse title, although it is evidence against the location of <em>The Brothers, </em>claimed by the plaintiff, is not evidence); to rebut the presumption of title to <em>The Brothers.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-4\">On the points under the <em>first </em>bill of exceptions, he referred to the act of 1766, <em>ch. </em>14, <em>s. 4.

Because <em>one </em>justice of the pbacehad no authority to take the probate of the letter offittorney, and therefore it was not well and sufficiently'proved according to law. 2d. If <em>one </em>justice of the peace had authority to take probate of its execution, it does not legally appear that <em>Richard </em>Thompson, before whom this probate was made, had authority to administer an oath, the clerk not having, certified that he was duly <em>commissioned and sworn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The privilege of acknowledging a deed <em>by attorney, </em>was. conferred by the act of 1766, <em>ch. </em>14, and we must have recourse to that act to see if the letter of attorney was well and sufficiently proved, according to the meaning of the, legislature. After declaring how deeds shall be acknowledged and enrolled, where thc.grar.ior resides within the state, th <em>&amp; fourth </em>section points out the course to be pursued, where the grantor is a nonresident of the state. It declares \u201cthat a deed made by a nonresident of the state shall be acknowledged by letter of attorney, well and sufficiently proved, either in the, provincial court, or. county court where the land intendqd to he conveyed, or the use thereof limited or declared, doth lie, or before <em>one </em>justice of the provincial, or <em>two </em>justices of the county court, as aforesaid.5*</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">It is perfectly clear that the tribunal or persons before whom the acknowledgment is made, may have the witnesses to the letter of attorney brought before them, and if they are satisfied of the due execution of the power, take the acknowledgment. Whether it must be proved before tiie <em>same </em>persons wiip take the acknowledgment, or may be proved before one of the tribunals mentioned in \u00a1he act of 1766, and be acknowledged-before another, as for instance, proved before one provincial justice, and acknowledged before another provincial justice, it is not necessary for us now to decide. The question presented by <em>tho first </em>bill of exceptions is, whether <em>one </em>justice of the peace had authority to take the probate?</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">This act of assembly, giving a new remedy, amLccnfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ring a. special authority, ought perhaps to receive a strict construction; but if we give the most liberal effect to the words \u201cwell and sufficiently proved;\u201d they must mean, proved according to law, that is, proved in the manner ex - pressly required by the, act of 1T66; or before'some person or tribunal authorised to take its probate, independent of that act. It must be conceded, that one justice of the peace is riot empowered to take theprohate, <em>by the express, words of the act, </em>for no authority is <em>'expressly </em>given to <em>one </em>justice of the peace to do any act whatever by that law. Where a justice of the peace is mentioned, the law always requires ihe co-operation of <em>twp </em>of them; thus- 'the acknowledgment is to be made, not before <em>one </em>but <em>two </em>justices of the peace. If the legislature meant to invest <em>one. </em>justice with power to take the probate, why not also give <em>one </em>authority to take the acknowledgment? It surely does not require more talents, integrity or knowledge, to take the har\u00e9 acknowledgment of the deed, than to receive the testimony of tire witnesses, in such a manner as to give, legal effect, and operation to the letter of attorney. If then this act does not <em>expressly </em>authorise <em>one </em>justice to take the, probate, from whence does he derive this power? If.it is by implication, still the act requires it to be \u201cwell and sufficiently proved\u201d. \u2014 that can only mean, proved before some other tribunal authorised, to take the probate. How does a, justice of the peace daim this right? It is not conferred on him by any other act of assembly, and we look in vain to the principles of the common law to find-it. Supposes letter of attorney had been given1 for any other purpose, for instance to collect debts,' and it became necessary, in a trial at law, to use, it, to show the. authority of the agent, what would be legal evidence of its due execution? A certificate from a justice of the peace, that he had <em>in pais </em>examined the witnesses to it? \u2014 surely not \u2014 It must be proved like other deeds. The. court, before, whom the cause, \u25a0was depending, must have the witnesses before them, or in their unavoidable absence, proof of their handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The construction we give' to the <em>fourth </em>section of the, act is, that the letter of attorney must be proved, either before the provincial or county court, or before one justice of the provincial, or <em>two </em>justices of the county court, where the lands lie. It is certainly the safest course to. prove it before the same persons who-take the acknowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>tnent. But whether that is required by the act is a ques\u00ab \u25a0iiou, as before observed, not necessary now to be decided, and on which no opinion is intended to be expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Having disposed of this question, it is unnecessary to examine the objection to the certificate of the clerk. The deed not having been legally acknowledged, il is perfectly immaterial whether that certificate was correct, we therefore pass it without remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">It was contended, by the counsel for the appellant, that although a justice of the peace had no authority to take the probale of a letter of attorney, yet the jury ought to .presume, from the long possession of the plaintiff, and those under whom lie claims, that this letter of attorney liad been duly and legally proved, dr in other words, that it had been proved as required by the act of 1766. The doctrine of presumption, from long possession, is too well Established to be called in question at this day: It is a doctrine founded in justice, <em>and </em>id intended to support th\u00e9 title of <em>bona fide </em>holders of land, where from accident or casualty their title papers may be supposed to be lost. It quiets the possession of estates, and ought to be sustained bv the courts, whore a proper foundation is laid for the pro'Sumption. Eat to direct the jury to presume a fact, in' direct opposition to the evidence produced and relied on <em>hy </em>the party, has never yet been countenanced by any decision we have seen. Had the plaintiff entirely withdrawn tiiis defective deed, and then moved the court to instruct the jury, they might, from the possession and acts of ownership, presume a \u00a1good deed, it would have presented a very different question. In this case, the plaintiff offered in evidence a letter o\u00ed \u00abHomey, proved <em>in pais, </em>before a 'single justice of the peace, and produced a record to show it was thus proved, and yet calls on the jury to presume it was not proved as he has established it, but in a manner entirely different; every presumption that might have arisen \"from the want or absence of proof, is'heie rebutted and destroyed by thfe proof offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>bills of exceptions are in principle alike, and do indeed present an anomaly in judicial proceedings. Witnesses offered by the plaintiff were objected to by the defendant on account of interest, and the court decided they ware incompetent. The defendant then withdrew all objection to the competency and credibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Said witnesses, which might arise from the opinion of tli&amp; court, or from any other cause, and the court were of opinion, and so directed the jury, that the witnesses might be examined; but the plaintiff would have them received upon his own terms, or not \u00e1t all, and took exception to the procedure of the court; we see nothing in those exceptions on which this court Slight to hesitate a moment. Whether the witnesses offered were competent; is nota question before us. The objection made to them was withdrawn by the defendant, and if the plaintiff had not the benefit of their testimony, it was his own fault; We sit here to administer justice, and not to settle points of punctilious etiquette between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\">The <em>fourth </em>bill of exceptioiis remains <em>i'o </em>be considered. This ejectment was instituted, as before stated, to recover two tracts of land, the one called <em>Walnut </em>Bottom, the other <em>The </em>Brothers, the defendant took defence for all the laud included within the lines of a tract called <em>George\u2019s Adventure, </em>and not within the lines of <em>\"Walnut Bottom, </em>as located by him. Also for the land included within the lines of a tract called <em>Crooked Meanders Resv.riieyed, </em>as comprehended within a deed from the lessor of the plaintiff to <em>William Mh Mahon, </em>and a deed from the lessor of the plaintiff to the defendant, dated the 5th day of June 1813, and for all the land located upon the plats as the possession of the defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The plaintiff, to prove his title to the tract called <em>The Brothers, </em>read in evidence to the jury the patent by which <em>it </em>was granted to <em>Thomas French, </em>on the <em>29th </em>of November 1774; he then read a deed from <em>James Clarke to A* brahanv Faw, </em>for this land, dated the 7th of November 1785, and a deed from <em>Faw\"to </em>the lessor of the plaintiff for the same land, dated the 4th of September 1810. Both the deeds from <em>Clarke </em>to Faw, and from <em>Faw </em>to the lessor of the plaintiff, contain veciiak, slating that a deed for this land was passed by <em>Thomas French, </em>the patentee, to <em>James Clarke, </em>on the 23d of October 1779. 'inisdeed, however* was not produced, and evidence was given that no such deed could be found among the records. He also gave parol evidence,. <em>(Filey, Fisher, GimMns, </em>and <em>MiMahon,) </em>to prove that <em>James Clarke </em>claimed the land called' <em>The Brothers, </em>anil exercised acts of ownership over it in the year 1782, and afterwards. That a tenant under him held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>?&gt;bssessiou of part of the laud, and cleared it. That the lessor o\u00ed' the plaintiff, and those claiming under him, have been in <em>actual </em>possession \u2019of parts of this land since the year 1792. That Sic made an addition to the Town of <em>Cumberland </em>more than 26 years before the institution of this suit, by selling out lots to different persons, from <em>The Brothers, </em>(claiming the whole tract under <em>Jibraham Favo,) </em>the possession of which lots has never been disturbed. That in 1799, this land was assessed to <em>Favo, </em>and the taxes were paid by Hie lessor of the plaintiff. The defendant then offered evidence to show, he had been in possession of part of <em>The Brothers </em>for many years, claiming the same <em>not as \u00bf\u00a1art of The </em>Brothers, but as being included within. Cue Hues of other t\u00ed acts of land, to which he was entitled. <em>The </em>counsel for the plaintiff then prayed the court to instruct the jury, if they believed the evidence given on the part of the plaintiff and defendant, they may presume a deed from <em>Thomas French, </em>the patentee, to <em>James Clarke, </em>fo&gt; <em>The Brothers, </em>bCibre the 7th day of November 1785$ which instruction the court refused to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">If ail the testimony submitted to the jury was legal evidence, and the possession of the defendant was not a mixed or conVicting possession, so as to affect the title of <em>The Brothers, </em>it is difficult to imagine a case that would afford a stronger foundation to presume a deed. The court below have not \u00a1hated the ground upon which they rejected the prayer, but it is contended here, by the comiso! for the appellee, in defence of their opinion, that there was a mixed possession <em>o\u00ed The Brothers'by \u00fc\\q </em>lessor of the plaintiff and the defendant, and therefore a deed should not be presumed on the possession of <em>cither </em>against the oilier; and, although the deeds from <em>Clarke </em>to <em>Bax, </em>and from <em>Favo </em>to the lessor of the plain \u00a1iff, were permitted to be read in evidence to the jury, they were not <em>legal </em>evidence, and therefore ought to be rejected by this court, and without their aid, there was not a sufficient foundation to presume the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">If there had been a mixed possession by plaintiff and defendant, both claiming <em>under The Brothers, </em>we are not prepared to say the opinion of the court was erroneous, nor its it necessary to decide that question. But in this case it appears, that although the defendant was in possession of part of this laud, he did not claim it as being part of <em>The </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>Brothers, </em>but as being included within the lines of other tracts of land to which he was entitled, and whose locatU on interfered with <em>The Brothers. </em>(See the testimony of <em>Eager Perry, </em>who was 'a witness produced by the defendant and his counsel in the cause.) His possession then did not conflict with the <em>title </em>of <em>The Brothers, </em>but with its <em>location. </em>lie claimed,-, not as the proprietor of that land, but as the owner of other tracts', whose lines took away a part of it. He might rightfully hold all the land in hi\u00e1 possession under the other tracts, although the plaintiff- had a legal title to <em>The Brothers. </em>His possession does not affect the title to <em>The Brothers, </em>but its location-only. Whe\u00e1 a mixed possession can be used, to prevent th\u00e9: presumption of a deed, that possession must beheld by both parties; 'claiming <em>title </em>to the same laud.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\">It has been urged that the deeds front <em>Clarice </em>to <em>Faw\u00ab </em>hnd front <em>Faw </em>to the lessor of the plaintiff) Were not legal evidence, and ought to be rejected by this court. The examination of this part of the c\u2019ase presents two questions, 1st. Were those deeds, or either of them,, legal evidence? 2d. If they: hr either of them, ar\u00e9 to -be rejected, was there sufficient evidence, without the aid of tire rejected deed, to support the prayer made by the counsel for the plaintiff?</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The opinion of the court on the first bill of exceptions, is conclusive upon the deed Of <em>Faw </em>to the lessor of tho plaintiff. <em>Faw </em>was a nonresident of the state, and the deed\u2019 was acknowledged by letter of attorney; the acknowledgment was made before two justices of the peace of <em>Allegany </em>county, and the letter of attorney was proved* before <em>one </em>justice of the peace for <em>Montgomery </em>county, and before the mayor of <em>Alexandria; </em>Neither of them had authority to take such probate; arid therefore the letter of attorney was not well and sufficiently proved. The deed from <em>Clarice </em>to <em>Faw </em>is not liable to the same objec<em>tion </em>\u2014 Clarke resided in <em>Baltimore </em>county, and the acknowledgment was made by him before <em>Isaac Vn. Bibber </em>and <em>Thomas Euss'ell, </em>who state themselves\u2019 <em>to </em>be two justices of the peace for that county; the certificate of the clerk of <em>Baltimore </em>county is in' the following words: \u201cI hereby certify, that <em>Isaac Vn. Bibber </em>and <em>Thomas </em>Bus- . <em>sell, </em>gentlemen, before whom the above acknowledgment wes made, and who have thereunto subscribed their names. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>were at the day of the date thereof, and still are, two jys\u00a1* tices of the peace for the county aforesaid, and to all certificates by them given, <em>as such, </em>due faith and credit is and ought <em>to </em>be given, as well in courts of justice as there-out.\u201d it is objected that this certificate is not sufficient, because it does not state the justices were <em>duly commissioned and sworn. </em>It has been decided in the second trial of <em>Gitlings and Hall </em>in 1809, that these particular words are not necessary to constitute a good- certificate. The words there w'ere <em>'\u2022'\u2022legally authorised and </em>assigned, and due faith and credit ought to be given to their certificates.\u2019? Chief Justice <em>Chase </em>says, \u201cthe clerk is the person intrust - ed to make the certificate \u2014 he had knowledge of. the facts-whereon to ground his certificate, which is to authorise the recording the deed. The court think a substantial compliance with the directions of the act is all that is requisite, and the court consider the words of that import.Tiie words <em>legally authorised </em>are of the same import as duly commissioned and sworn. The court consider that tSie justices could not he legally authorised unless they had been.commissioned and sworn.\u2019? 1-n that.case there were auxiliary words, not to be found in <em>this </em>\u2014 legally <em>uu~ thorised and assigned </em>\u2014 and the court rely on those words, not because there is any magic ia them, but because they import that the justices must have been commissioned and. awoi'h, and are therefore a substantial compliance with the act. Any other words then, which necessarily import that they were commissioned and sworn, would be as substantial compliance with the act, as legally authorised and assigned. But independent of that decision, and if the question was now for the first time before us, we think justice ought not to be perverted, ami the estates of third persons defeated, by a mere clerical error in the literal observance of a form. \"Where the law requires the clerk to give a certificate, and he substantially complies with it, it is sufficient. This certificate states \u201cthey were justices of the peace, and that due faith and credit is and ought to be, given, as well in courts of justice as thereout, to all certificates given by them <em>as justices.\u201d </em>Now what is the irresistible import of those words? If they were justices of the peace, they must have been duly commissioned, for unless duly commissioned they could not be justices; and if due faith and credit ought to he .given to their certifi,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>cates \u00ab5 <em>justices, </em>they must have be.en sworn, for they are. not authorised to give certificates <em>as justifies </em>unless t-hey had been swqrn. Wo consider this certificate a substantial compliance, with the act, and the deed was proper evidence to be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\">Was there then, sufficient evidence to justify the prayer of the counsel for the plaintiff, if we retain the deed from, <em>Clarke </em>to <em>Faw, </em>and reject that from <em>Faw </em>to the lessor of-the plaintiff? <em>The. Brothers </em>was patented to. <em>French </em>in. 1774. , In 1782, although then a great part was in woods, we find it in the possession of <em>Clarke, </em>by his tenant claiming it as his property, and exercising acts of ownership^ over it. In' 1785 it is conveyed by <em>Clarke </em>to <em>Faw, </em>who stands assessed for it in 1799. The taxes are paid by the lessor of the plaintiff, who continues in the possession of the land, claiming it, as some of the vyitnesses declare, under <em>Faw, </em>from the year 1792. He adds <em>to </em>the town of-<em>Cumberland, </em>by laying out lots from this land \u2014 he sells, leases, and disposes of those lots at his pleasure, and the possession of them, remains undisturbed; and during the whole of this period, from the first possession by Clarke/ no person set up an adversary claim to it. We think this,testimony afforded a sufficient foundation to presume tire deed, and that the court ought so to have instructed the jury/</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">. We concur in opinion with the court below, on the <em>first, second, </em>and <em>third </em>exceptions, and reverse the judgment on the fourth. \u2019 ''</p>\n<author id=\"b364-5\">Archer; J-.</author>\n<p id=\"AuD\">The question arising on <em>the first </em>bill <em>of </em>exceptions taken in this cause, is as to the admissibility in evidence of the deed from <em>George Mason, </em>the patentee of <em>Walnut Bottom, </em>to the lessor of the plaintiff, dat.ed the 25th of October 1783. <em>'Mason, </em>the grantor, at the time of the execution of the deed, resided in the state of Virginia, and on the same day executed \u00bf power of attorney to <em>Jllexunder Claggelt, </em>and <em>Daniel Cresap, </em>junior, empowering them, or either of them, to acknowledge the deed- in his' Xiame, in conformity with the' act of assembly providing - for the acknowledgment of deeds in cases where the grantors resided out of the state. One \u00f3f the attesting; wit- . nesses to the power of attorney appeared before <em>Richard. Thompson, </em>in <em>Montgomery </em>county; and made, oath to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>due execution of the power, which is certified by the said <em>'Thompson. </em>To this is annexed a certificate of the clerk of <em>Montgomery </em>county, that <em>Richard Thompson, </em>at th&lt;^ time when the said proof was made, was a justice of the peace of <em>Montgomery </em>county, duly authorised and assigned. It further appears, that the land intended to be conveyed by said deed, lay in <em>Washington </em>county, and was, by <em>Alexander Cktggett, </em>one of the attornies, on the 8th day of Nov. 1783, acknowledged before two justices of the peace for <em>Washington </em>county, and recorded within the time prescribed by law. Evidence was also given on the part of the plaintiff of his full and undisturbed enjoyment and possession of the land described in the deed iroia the date thereof to the institution of this suit, a period of thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\">Two questions have been discussed in the investigation of this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">1st. 'Whether the power of attorney is well and sufficiently proved in conformity with the act of 1766, <em>ch. </em>11?. And</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">2dly. \"Whether presumption, from length of possession, r;an be called in aid of the defect, if one exist?</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">It has been urged by the counsel for the defendant, that the power of attorney must be proved either before the justices who take the acknowledgment, or before some justice of the <em>county </em>where the land lies. To give the construction to the act, first contended for, would violate every rule of interpretation. It was obviously the intention of the legislature to designate alone where deeds should be acknowledged, and where recorded, and not to limit the place where, or the persons before whom the proof should be made. It was further the intention of the legislature, in their enactment of the <em>fourth </em>section of the law of 1706, <em>ch. </em>id, to facilitate the means by which nonresidents might transfer their lands, and to obviate the difficulties which existed in the transfer of lauded property in cases not provided for by the act of 1715. Viewing it in this light, the most liberal construction, to effectuate the object o\u00ed the legislature, should be given to the section. To confine the proof of the power to the county where the laud lies would, if it did not multiply difficulties to the nonresident grantor in the transfer of his landed properly, at least leave him where it found him. It certainly would be <em>v.hoilyium </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>material where, the proof was made, provided- it was made, before any person having power by law to administer an path. The. object of-the legislature, in requiring proof of the power, was cerfainl-y salutary, but, why should we confine the proof to be made in tire county where the land, lies, when by so doing no object, beneficial to the parties, -could be attained, and a. strained1 construction would, have to be given to the law, and-when this strained, construction would inyolve the legislature in the just imputation of-this absurdity, that they considered, an oath more, obligatory when made in one place than another*</p>\n<p id=\"AMhJ\">The affidavit made by the subscribing witness to the, power, has been considered as <em>entirety voluntary, </em>inasmuch as it was made out of the county where the land lies,- but this presupposes the fact, that either the proof, was.not required to be made, or that the justice of \u2022 <em>Montgomery </em>had, no power to administer the oath, both of which propositions are to.nsidgre.d equally groundless. It has also been urged* that the justice possessed neither a special or general jurisdiction, as it regards the administration of oaths in proof of the power, I consider the act of 17Gb as requiring the proof, and not designating before whom it shall be taken. In such \u00e1 case there,is certainly a power impliedly granted; to <em>all </em>justices of-the peace, and other judicial officers, to. take the proof required. If. it be once admitted that the proof is not limited to. be taken in the county by the act of assembly, and surely spch is the only rational construction, it would seem nepessarily. to follow, that justices of the \u00a1feace any where could take the proof, otherwise the act would in this respec.t be nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"A4aD\">If then the.justice had the.power to take the proof, does it sufficiently appear to the; court that he was a justice ok the peace of <em>Montgomery </em>county? The only evidence of this is the certificate of the clerk of- that county, and this, it has been urged, is insufficient, no. act oFassembly expressly warranting a certificate to be given in this particular case. The, original commissions to all justices of the. peace are transmitted to the .respective counties for which they are appointed. They are required to assemble at the respective court-houses to take tlje, oaths required- by the constitution and the laws, one of whicl), oaths,. at least, is* by the act of 1777, required to be recorded,' By whom, then could their appointment and qualification.be attested. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>un\u00ed by the officer having charge of their commissions, a.mi the evidence on record of their qualifications? Such evidence is certainly admitted in analogous cases, by express legislation. But 1 consider the admissibility of this evidence as settled by the decision of this court, in the case of <em>M\u2018Comas vs. Bradford\u2019s Lessee. </em>This cause was tried iu <em>Harford </em>county court, and was brought up by appeal to this court. A copy of a lease from the agent of the Lord Proprietary, for 99 ymars, dated in 17\"44, was offered in evidence. It was proved by the affidavit of the auditor of the State, in whose office the original was deposited, to be a true copy*. The affidavit was taken in <em>Anne Arundel </em>conniy before a Justice of the peace, with a certificate of the Clerk of that county annexed, that the person, before whom fiie affidavit was taken, was duly commissioned and sworn. This court, at December term 1813, decided that the copy was competent evidence; It will tie perceived by a reference to the act of assembly of 1T93, <em>eh. </em>103, that copies of the books and papers in the auditors office, attested by that officer, <em>and sworn </em>to by him to be true, copies were made evidence, in the same manner as if the original were produced. That case, and the present, have but one feature by which they can be distinguished. The act of IfGG, 1 have endeav oured to show; made no designation of the officer before whom the proof should be made. The act of 1T93 directed generally that the audiior should be sworn, without saying before whom, and in each cas;e the oath is \u00a1nade in a different county from that in which the papers are Adduced in evidence. In neither caSe is there any evi-&gt; deuce to satisfy the mind, that the oath was taken before it person empowered by law to administer oaths, except the certificate of the clerk of the county where the justice resided. The feature before alluded to, which distinguishes the two cases, is that in one certificate-the justice is said in be duly <em>commissioned and sworn, </em>and in the other that ha was <em>authorised and assigned. </em>Since the determination in the case of <em>Gildings and Hall, </em>the expression in either certificate is sufficient, the words being considered equiva-* lent. No other reason can be given for the determination of the case of <em>M\u2019Comas and Bradford?s Lessee, </em>than that this court considered the clerk\u2019s certificate was sufficient to prove that the person, before whom the oath was taken, was a justice of the peace; and governing iu that case, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>should govern iii this. All adherence to decisions, [it can Scarcely be necessary to observ\u00e9,) is of great consequence to the public. Tt would be infinitely better to adhere to a determination, from which no possible inconvenience could flow, relative to the propriety of which a reasonable doubt might be entertained, than by rescinding it, to open a door to endless litig\u00e1tion. I cannot but think, that the giving fefficacy to this deed is of great importance to the security of those land titles which are derived through nonresident grantors. These titles are undoubtedly numerous in the state. The cases of practice under this law, which have come under my observation, have generally been conducted by couns\u00e9l, and in these the proof of the powers, and five acknowledgments of the deeds, have been made iii the \u00a1county courts where the lands lay. What has been the jpopul\u00e1r construction and practice with regard to it, I am tillable to say, but doubtlessly this deed has many intimately allied to it iii the mod e of proof and manner of execution, indeed this record furnishes us with two deeds precisely of the same character, from which a deduction may reasonably be drawn that they are more numerous than at first view might be imagined; ,</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\">Believing the deed sufficient ori the first ground,! do not think it necessary to make any remarks on the power, which it is urged the court would have, to call in to its support the aid of pr\u00e9sumption. So far as regards the compe1 tency of the witnesses, vvliose testimony is detailed in the <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>bills of exceptions, I do not deem it necessary to express an opinion! I concur with the court below in rejecting the prayers made by the plaintiff. When all objections to the competency of the witnesses, and to their credibility! were withdrawn, the plaintiff could have had the benefit of their testimony if lie had pleased, and the jury were surely bound to respect it. To call on the court, under these circumstances! for the expression of their opinion as to the competency of the witnesses, was asking the court, in effect, for a mere speculative opinion, which was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The court below were called upon, in th <em>a fourth </em>bill of exceptions, to direct the jury that they might presume a deed from <em>Thomas French, </em>the patentee of the tract of land called <em>The Brothers, </em>to <em>James Clarke, </em>before the 7th of November 1785, the data of his conveyance to <em>Faiv, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>which conveyance recited that a deed had been made by the patentee to Clark\u00e9. &lt; Presumption is often resorted to for the purpose of supplying defective evidence, and in this country is not oftcner applied to any subject than to supply defective title to lands. It would be difficult to make \u2018out the titles to many of the elder tracts of land in this state, by a regular deduction of title deeds from the patentees down to the present proprietors, without resorting <em>hi some </em>stage of them to presumption. Records may sometimes be lost or destroyed. Ancient title papers may be defectively executed, or the proof of them, from lapse of time, may be impossible. Yet in all these cases the possession may have been invariably in the person claiming the land, and in those from whom he derives his title- In such cases possession, which has been long and undisturbed, and which is in general the concomitant of title, induces a be - lief in the mind, of title little short of that which w\u00f3uldbe produced by the adduction of the most undeniable and best authenticated evidences of right The grant of incorporeal hereditaments is often presumed from the undisturbed user thereof for a length of time. Grants from the crown, in England, are presumed, from length of possession, aud here even proprietary grants, under certain circumstances, arc presumed. In general these presumptions are bottomed upon the existence of certain facts, which can leave but little doubt upon the mind of the truth of the fact which we are called upon to presume. They frequently too, derive their force aud efficacy from that vigilance with which the law guards ancient possessions, which sooner than they should be disturbed, presumes that they had in contract a rightful commencement. In this case, however, it has been strongly urged, that the possession of the plaintiff was not of such a character that a presumption could justifiably be founded upon it, and that if if were of such a chai actor, yet that it has been rebutted by an opposing possession of the defendant, which would preclude the idea that a conveyance had been made in conformity with the prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\">In order to lay a ground for a presumption, it certainly would not be necessary that there should have been a possession by enclosure. Were this the case, presumption need never be called in aid of title, for the statute would protect the possession without it. If one have the right in <em>a </em>tract of land, and possession of part, his possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>p\u00e1rt is possession of the whole tract', according to the trim position and 'location of the land. It appears from the evidence, in addition to the deeds which are contained in the record, and which were offered in evidence, that <em>Clarke </em>ih the year 1782 leased the land to <em>Benjamin Wiley, </em>who lived on it eight or ten months; that in 1788 or lT^S, <em>Wilkins </em>cleared a field on the land; and held it some years* always claiming title under the lessors of the plaintiff, from \\vhich period the lessor of the plaintiff, and those from. *whom he claimed'* and under whom he claimed, have been in the actual possession and occupation of parts of the land, by cutting timber thereon, clearing land, leasing out and . Selling parts of it to different persons* always claiming title to the whole tract aS having been purchased of <em>'Faw. </em>It is unaccountable that the patentee', or his representatives* should 'have permitted <em>Clarke </em>to take possession of this tract of la\u00fad* hold it in his possession for several years* place upon the records of the country \u00e1 deed of conveyance for it, reciting too that the patentee had conveyed his title to him; that he should have permitted <em>Clarke </em>and his grantees* to remain in the quiet and undisturbed possessK on of this property for a period of thirty-one years, without making a single effort to dispossess them, unless we be;lieve he had conveyed the lands; It is not pretended that any such effort ever was made on the part Of the patentee* In the absence then, of such evidence, the conveyances executed by the persons in possession, the long and uninterrupted possession of <em>Clarke, </em>and those who claim under him, furnish evidence of a character sufficiently strong* upon which to build the presumption prayed for by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the court below. The testimony adduced by the defendantis not at all, in my apprehension, calculated to lessen the weight of those circumstances which naturally give rise to the idea of a conveyance having been made. The defendant has taken defence for <em>George\u2019s Jl&lt;h venture, Crooked </em>Meanders* and part of <em>Walnut Bottomj </em>whether this be from the casual interference of the lines off these tracts with <em>The Brothers, </em>Or whether the tracts, when originally taken up, were laid altogether upon <em>The Brothers, </em>under the impression that it did not extend as far as now laid down, and claimed by the plaintiff, or that they were vacancies, are questions perhaps immaterial to the investigation and determination of this subject. The de- . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>lendant, and those from whom he claims, have been in possession of three several parcels of the land for which he fakes defence, one from 1795, another from 1797 or 1798, and the third from 1799 or 1800, but he has never claimed' either as belonging to <em>The Brothers, </em>but sets up a rigid independent of that tract, and in no way, as to title, connected with it, always contending that the just location of the plaintiff\u2019s tract would not cover his lands. His claim and pretensions, his enjoyment and possession of these lands, are in no wise inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s right and title to <em>The Brothers, </em>or with any presumption, which may be made in aid of the plaintiff\u2019s t elective title, except so far as. by the proper location they may be found to interfere. There, has been no mixed possession of the tract which the plaintiff \u2022 claims, but the possession of each has been of separate and. independent tracts of land, by different names and different grants. Each may have a perfect title in the several, tracts which they claim,' so far as grants and regular conveyances alone can confer a right; but which is to have the precedence may, nay must entirely depend on a question of location, which i? a question of fact for a jury alone to. determine. Presumption is a question of law, and if the defendant had been sufficiently long in the possession ot those tracts, for which he takes defence., there could be nothing contradictory or inconsistent in allowing to each the benefit of presumption to supply defective, title papers. In sack a case the determination of the question, of right would be made from the seniority of their respective grants, and their inteifering locations, which would have.to.be adjusted by the judgment off a jury from the evidence each might adduce. I therefore,think the plaintiff entitled- to. the direction he lias asked in <em>the fourth </em>bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">It has, however, been strongly urged, that two of the deeds upon which the plaintiff' grounds hia evidence, upon which, to make the presumption, are defective. I believe the deed from <em>Fai.v </em>to <em>Beall, </em>bearing date the 24th of September 18\u00a10?. good and admissible evidence, for the reasons assigned in the consideration of the question arising on the. <em>fust </em>bill of exceptions. The other deed from <em>Clarke </em>to <em>Fino, </em>dated the 7th of November 1785, was acknowledged before two justices of <em>Baltimore </em>county, and-the clerk of that county has certified that the persons before whom the acknowledgment was made <em>were justices of the peace, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>that <em>to' all their ads as such faith and credit ought to he </em>gipen. The certificate ale\u00f1e is objected to, and it is said-not to be in conformity with the <em>third </em>section of the act of-1766, <em>eh. </em>14, that requires the certificate to state, that fhe persons before whom the acknowledgment was made Were <em>justices of the peace, commissioned, and sworn. </em>In the case of <em>Gittings fy Hall, </em>it ,was determined: that. the. Words of the act need not be, pursued, but that equivalent words would, be sufficient. <em>Faith and credit could not </em>be, <em>given- to their acts </em>as justices, of the peace, unless they were <em>commissioned and sworn, </em>and, the assertion of the. former in the clerk\u2019s certificate', necessarily implies the. latter, and brings the certificate within the decision in the case above alluded to. It is therefore considered, that the deeds objected to are admissible, in .evidence, and can form no ground to support the refusal of the court below to, grant the prayer of the plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">judgment reversed, and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
