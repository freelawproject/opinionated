This Was \u00bf special \u00e1ction on the case, brought by the appellant against the appellees: The declaration charged the defendants below with unskilful management of the concerns of the plaintiff. It contained two counts, to both of which objections were taken; but aS the court did not decide the cas\u00e9 on those objections, it is unnecessary to set out the d eel station. The general issue was pleaded; and at the trial the plaintiff gav\u00e9 in evidence, that being a merchant, extensively engaged in commerce in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>he was, as such, a customer of the defendants, and was in the habit of depositing his money with, them for safe keeping, arid of delivering the promissory notes and bills Wfiich. he held, whether payable in <em>Baltimore, </em>or elsewhere in the Atlantic commercial cities, to the defendant^, to <em>collect </em>for him, and in case such notes and bills were not paid,' they were to be returned by the def\u00e9ndants to him. That bei'njJ; the legal owner and holder of a bill of exchange for g684 95# drawn at <em>Baltimore </em>on the 2d of November 1810, by <em>John Chalmersj </em>junior,- upon <em>John Chalmers </em>of the city of <em>Washington, </em>payable six months after date to <em>William Hawkins\u00bf </em>; or order, endorsed by <em>Hawkins </em>to the plaintiff, and ac-' : cepted by the drawee, he delivered the same to the defendants on the 1st of May 1811, to be by them collected from <em>John </em>Ch'almefs,\u2022 the acceptor, when the same should become due according to law, and the defendants received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the, said bill of exchange for that purpose,. He also gave in evidence, that the defendants did not cause any demand to be made for payment qf this bill on the acceptor, until the Gth of May 1811, when the acceptor refused to pay it. That a protest was immediately made, and notice of-the nonpayment by the acceptor given, to the drawer and endorser, by letter dated the 6th of-May f8.ll, which was immediately forwarded by mail. That, the, plaintiff then applied to <em>William, Ha.ipkins, </em>the endorsos;, for payment, which he also refused to make, and he then instituted suit against <em>Hawkins </em>on the bill, in <em>Baltimore </em>county, court, where he. obtained a judgment by default, from which judgment <em>Hawkins </em>appealed to the court of appeals, where it was reversed. The record and proceedings in that case, it was agreed should constitute a part of the present. <em>LSee that case reported at the end of this.'] </em>The plaintiff further gave in evidence, that <em>John Chalmers, </em>junior, the drawer of the bill, ami <em>John Chalmers, </em>the acceptor, became insolvent about the time the bill became due, and have been regularly discharged under the insolvent laws of this state, and of the District, qf <em>Columbia, </em>and that the plaintiff lias never received any part of the amount of the, bill. The defendants then gave in evidence, that having received the bill.from the plaintiff .on the 1st of May 1811, for the purpose of collection, as stated in the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, they enclosed the same, on the,,2d of May 1811, in a letter from their cashier, addressed,to <em>fflilliam </em>Whann, the cashier of the <em>Bank of Columbia, </em>which bank was the established agent and correspondent of tlm defendants, for the transaction of all such business, in the city of, <em>Washington </em>and <em>George-Town. </em>The letter of tin? 2d ,of May 3811, was sent by mail, and by the regular course, of .the mail,would reach <em>William Whann </em>in the afternoon,, ofstha Sd of May; and that <em>Whann </em>caused the demand tq be made on the Gth of May 1811. They also.gave in evidence, that it was the custom at that time, and constantly before, in the District of <em>Columbia, </em>for the banks there to cause a demand for payment of hills of exchange and promissory notes to be made on the <em>fourth </em>day after they jecame due, and not before. They also gave in evidence, that it is the universal custom, for banks in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>who collect for their customers notes or bills payable at a distance from <em>Baltimore^ </em>ip, use ike hanks of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>place, where the collections are to be made, as agents in. making such collections. On this evidence the defendants prayed the.court to direct the. jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. Which direction the court, <em>(_Dorr sey, </em>Ch. J. <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Ward, </em>A. J.] gave to the jury. The plaintiff excepted; and the verdict and judgment being against him, he. appealed to this court*</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b154-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>-\u2022 An agent is not answerable \u2022 for negligence or- inattention, where a bill of exchange was placed in his Sumas for collection, and he im&gt; jlfcrtook to collect it, according \u2019to the usages and customs ot merchants anc} hanks, by sending it to a bank for collection, and owing to the bill having been demanded and protested for nonpayment on the fourtJi day after itfell due, the endovsor was discharged, and the amount of the bill thereby lost</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b154-13\">foreign merchant \u00bfends goods to his consignee, \u25a0with instruction^ to dispose of them \u00e1orjjim to the best advantage, and the consignee sends them to auction for sale,1 And fhe auctioneer makes way witli them, or sells them, and makes way with the money, and fails, the consignee is not answerable</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b154-14\">The refusal of tlie county court to\u2019. strike out a judgment by default, and suffer the defendant to jplead, is not a subject of appeal, and cannot he revised by the court \u00abof appeals, <em>(note).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b154-15\">The county court* cannot, assess damages on a judgment by default, to the amount of a hill of exchange, in\u2019 an action\u2019 against the endorsor, the declaration setting out no cause of action, hut showing that the bill was not presented for payment in time, whereby the defendant was in law discharged from all liability on-account of his endorsement, <em>(note,)</em></headnotes>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The cause was argued before Bucpanan, Earle, Mar-\u00bb\u2019 tin, and-Stephen, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-5\"><em>Winder </em>and <em>Mayer, </em>for, the Appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbC\">contended, that, the defendants below were responsible to the plaintiff for, the damage which he had sustained by reason of the, delay in presenting for payment, and protesting the hill in question.

Here the same diligence was used by the d\u00e9fe\u00e1d\u00e1nts as they were accustomed to use in their own concerns. They referred to <em>Smith vs. Lascelles, </em>2 <em>T. R. </em>188, <em>(note.)</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The opinion of, the cour.t was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b156-9\">Buchanan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASC\">It is contended, on. the part of the defendants, that the proof offered at the trial by the plaintiff, and. stated in the hill of, exceptions, does not. correspond\u00ed with the agreement set out in the declaration, and that fe\u25a0the yaijan.ee between., the <em>(illegyta </em>and the <em>probata,, tlo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>plaintiff is not entitled to recover. It is not necessary <em>to </em>examine this technical objection to the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery, there being quite enough without it to defeat the, action. <em>John Chalmers, </em>on whom the bill o\u00ed exchange was drawn, resided in the City of <em>Washington, </em>in the District of <em>Columbia; </em>and it is stated in the declaration, that the defendants undertook and promised to collect the amount, according to the usages and customs of merchants and banks in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>Now what is that usage? Why it is stated in the bill of exceptions to be the \u25a0universal custom of the banks in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>that collect for their customers, (who are the merchants,) notes or Dills payable at a distance from <em>Baltimore, </em>to make use of other banks as their agents in making such collections. So far, then, as respects the sending of the bill of exchange in question to a bank in the District of <em>Columbia </em>for collection, the defendants acted in strict conformity with their <em>engagement; and </em>having received it on the first of May 1810, and enclosed it on the day following to the cashier of <em>the Bank of Columbia, </em>their established agent for the transaction of all such business in the city of <em>Washington </em>and <em>George Town, </em>by mail, in a letter, which, according to the regular course of the mail, would reach its destination on the third day of May, two days before it became payable, according to its tenor, and the law merchant of this state. Surely no negligence or inattention is imputable to them in relation to that part of the transaction; nor is it pretended that any loss was sustained by reaspu of delay in sending on the bill. They sent it for collection, in convenient and reasonable time after it was received by them, to a respectable agent, an institution of high standing, and dealt with it, as it was their known and established custom to deal with all notes and bills to be collected in the District of <em>Columbia, </em>without any imputation of unfairness in the course they pursued. But it is urged, in behalf of the piainiifi\", that in '\u25a0iuiFequencc of the demand on the acceptor of the bill for \u25a0payment, and protest for nonpayment being made on the hrv-\u00dci day after it fell due, he has been unable to recover .I'/naiit ike endorser, who lives in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>that the defendants ought to be answerable for the nc^ugence of the <em>Bank of Columbia </em>in not, making the dear,: \u25a0 and protest on the third day of grace, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the law. q\u00a3 this state. But it appears to have been thq, uniform custom of all the banks within the District of <em>Columbia, to </em>cause, deina,nd and protest, to be made on the; fourth, day, and that the <em>Bank of </em>Columbia? in this instance, pursued; the, settled custom. How far that custom is to be legat'ded as, the law of the District, it is not necessary in this caseto inquire. It was the. universal custom of the, banks in, <em>Baltiviore </em>to collect notes and hills for their customers, payable at at distance, by the agency-, of other banks. The. plaintiff was a customer of the <em>Union Bank of Maryland, </em>established in <em>Baltimore, </em>made all his deposits there, and placed there for collection all his notes and bills, whether payable in <em>Baltimore, </em>or elsewhere; he was a merchant extensively engaged in commerce, and must be supposed to have had a knowledge of-the uniform and established mode of making such collections by <em>the </em>banks, and particularly <em>the Union Bank of Maryland, </em>in which he did all his business of.that character. This bill of exchange wap payable in tlie .District .of-<em>Columbia, </em>and the placing it with the defendants for collection, was equivalent toan agreement that it, should be. sent by them for that purpose to.some bank in the District of <em>Columpia, to the Bank of Columbia, </em>their established, agent, thus virtually constituting the <em>Bank of </em>Columbia, his agent, in that transaction, and if that agent did, in, qqnformity with the custom in. tVie District of <em>Columbia, </em>neglect to cause demand and protest tp' be made on the proper, day, the defendants are not chargeable with, any negligence, or other improper conduct. If they are.to be presumed acquainted with the custom, of the banks, in the District, the,same may be predicated, of the plaintiff, and that he-placed his bill with them for collection,, according to that custom, as it was their practice to do, in relation, to all other notes and bills payable, there.' This transaction is not. affected by.the general, law of bailment, except so far as concerns the transmitting of the bill to the <em>Bank </em>of <em>Columbia; </em>and if it had not been transmitted in due time, the defendants would be answerable for any loss sustained by reason of such negligence. But the Mil was sent on, in good time, and no negligence is chargeable to ;the defendants. Suppose a foreign merchant sends goods tc his consignee in <em>Baltimore, </em>with instructions to dispose of them for him to tli.e best advantage, the consignee ;ends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>them to auction for sale, and the auctioneer makes way with the goods, or sells them and makes way with the money, and fails \u2014 In such, \u00e1 case, (to which tins in principle <em>may </em>be aptly likened,) the consignee would clearlj not be answerable\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">JUDGEMENT AFFIRMED. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\"><em> </em>Hawkins <em>vs. </em>Jackson, referred to in the preceding case, was in this court at Jane term on an appeal from <em>Haiti wore </em>county court. It was an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>brought by the appellee against the appellant as the endorser of an inland hill o\u00ed \u00ab\u00bfchange. The declaration contained only one count, which sta ted thatthe bill was dated on the 2d of November 18) 0, drawn ai <em>Baltimore by Joh&amp; 0/\u00bfaimers, </em>junior, upon <em>John Chalmers, </em>se ifior, at <em>Washington, </em>in the district of <em>Columbia, </em>requiring him, six months afterdate, to pay to the defendant, or order, 95, YVhich bill was accepted by <em>John </em>Chalmers, senior, and endorsed by the defendant to the plaintiff.

At the return day of the writ, March term 1612, the defendant appeared <em>hi </em>proper person, and ^ave special bail, and a rule was then \u00edaid on him to plead by October term following, at which term the \u00bf\u2022ule was extended to March term 1813, when the defendant having failed to plead, the court assessed the plaiftUfi\u2019s damages to <em>0762 27, </em>and entered judgment for the damages laid in the declamen, and( costs; to be released on payment o\u00ed the above sum, witli Interest thereon from the 23d of April 1813, and cgpCs, After\u2019 wards, anddurtng the same term, the defendant appeared in court <em>hy </em>-counsel, and with the leave of the court filed an affidavit, gta\u00bb ting that he had spoken to <em>huther Martin, </em>esquire, one of the at* \u00edorneys ofthe court, to appear for him and defend the action, soott alter it was instituted, who promised to do so; and that he had no information to the contrary, until he was informed that judgment was rendered against him. That he had been informed that th\u00e9 suit could not he maintained against him, because the bill of exchange had not been protested in due time, and that no demand <em>tres </em>made on the acceptor of \u00bfhe bill in d\u00f3e and proper time alter it became due.
