That <em>William Dr- sil!, </em>in pursuance of the deed of trust to him from <em>George Lux, </em>and to discharge in part the said debts due by <em>William </em>I.ux, in his life-time, jointly as aforesaid, and which the said <em>George </em>was bound to pay, as heir and devisee of <em>IfiiHcm </em>Lux, did sell the lauds hereinafter deftcribed, being part of the said tract called <em>CkaUworlh, </em>to <em>Daniel I.cmuwt, </em>(the ancestor of the complainants,) who had applied to <em>Gtvgh </em>to allow him a credit on the debts due to <em>Gough </em>from <em>Busedl. Lux </em>and Jltywlyj but it was agreed bctvvoe.'i the parties, that the said land should be conveyed to <em>Gough, </em>in order tomato the same respondido io him for the credit so given. That in conformity with the said agreement and understanding, <em>Bussell </em>did, by a deed duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, according to law, bearing date the 27th of April 1780, convey, in fee eiinple, to Gough, the said land, being part of said tract called <em>Ckatsworth, </em>and part of the property conveyed to <em>Russel! </em>by <em>Lux, </em>and which ia contained within the following description, that is to say, &amp;e. containing and sold for 3ti acies and a quarter of an acre, together with all rights, privileges and advantages, unto the same belonging; that <em>Gough </em>never had actual possession of the said land; he took the said <em>ZammoPs </em>penal bond for the credit granted sis aforesaid, and passed to <em>Lanimot </em>his bond, to convey the said land when the debts of <em>Lux, Bowly </em>and <em>Russell, </em>should fee, discharged, which 'were guaranteed by the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>land. The bill charges, that <em>Daniel Bowly </em>was privy to) and perfectly acquainted with, and fully assented to the transactions aforesaid, being in reality a party thereto\u2014 that the said land above described was in fact sold tp <em>Lam \u25a0- mot </em>by <em>Russell, </em>in two parcels, both of which were included in one conveyance to Gough, as aforesaid, and <em>Gough </em>made a settlement or an adjustment of his claim on <em>Lux </em>and <em>Bowly, </em>with Bowly, whereby on the 20th of July 1787, he credited them with the sum of <em>\u00a3523 </em>15, <em>Maryland </em>currency, for land (being part of tire land herein before particularly described,) sold by <em>William Russellv, </em>and on the 2d of April 1789, <em>Gough </em>credited the account of <em>Lux </em>and Bovjly, with J?70, <em>Maryland </em>currency, for two acres more, (being the residue of the said described land,) and that <em>Gough </em>did charge <em>Lammot </em>with the said two sums of money which he had before credited <em>Lux </em>and <em>Bowly </em>with, as aforesaid, so that tire said purchase money, which <em>Lammot </em>agreed to pay to <em>Gough, </em>for the said land, and which he did subsequently pay in full with interest, was applied to extinguish the like amount of what was due by. <em>Lux </em>and Bowly, and the latter was thereby released and discharged from the further payment of that amount. Of all which facts and circumstances <em>Bowly </em>had the most intimate and exact knowledge, deriving by the transactions aforesaid, very valuable and important advantages. That <em>Daniel Larnnot, </em>at the time, oi; shortly after, his purchase from <em>Russell </em>ot the said described land, (the conveyance of which was made to <em>Gough, </em>as aforesaid,) did enter into actual possession of the said land, and so continued iu quiet and undisturbed, and undisputed possession for many vears, that is to say, until or about the year 1804, (except so far as <em>iAimmot </em>had disposed of certain parts thereof to <em>bona fide </em>purchasers and lessees,) when <em>Boivly </em>pretended that he was entitled to the said land, or to some parts thereof; and on the 29th of September 1804, <em>Daniel Bowly </em>brought an action of ejectment in the general court, which is now depending in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, against the said <em>Daniel Lammot, </em>alleging that the said <em>Bowly </em>was entitled to the said land', or to some part thereof, under and by virtue of the will of- <em>William Lux </em>herein before referred to. That the whole of the purchase money agreed to be paid by <em>Lammot </em>for the said land, having been paid by hipa to <em>Gough, </em>the said Gough, did by his deed, exe\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>suited, ackiiowleged, and recorded according to law, and dated the 9th of May 1801, convey the above described land, being part of <em>GhatswoHh, </em>to <em>Lammot </em>in fee simple; that <em>Daniel Bowly </em>alway s lived within or near the city <em>Baltimore, </em>adjoining to it, and within what is called the western precincts thereof the said land is situated, and that <em>Bowly </em>had early and full knowledge of the contents of the Said will of <em>William </em>Lux, his uncle, (his own name being particularly mentioned in said will,) that he had as before set forth, full, perfect, and exact knowledge of the contents of the said deeds herein referred to, and with all the circumstances, motives, and considerations which accompanied and influenced the execution of them, having participated therein as aforesaid; and further that <em>Bowly, </em>by writing under his own hand, did furnish instructions iii part to the surveyor, appointed to lay out the lands purchased as aforesaid from <em>Russell. </em>Yet that <em>Bowly </em>having thus knowledge of, and acquiescing in the long and continued possession and occitpation of said land, by <em>Lammot, </em>never suggested or pretended that he had any title or interest, cither at law or in equity, in or to the said, land or property, or in or to any part thereof, until in of about the year \u00cdS04, and shortly before the institution of the said action of ejectment, and long after <em>Lammot </em>had paid the whole purchase money for the said land to <em>Goughj </em>and <em>Gough </em>had executed the said deed. The bill then states the death of <em>iMmmot, </em>and that the complainants arc his heirs and devisees, ft also states the death of Bowly, and that the defendants (now appellees) are his heirs, &amp;c.~ Who have become parties to, and are now prosecuting the said action of ejectment against the said complainants, who have become parties to, and are now defending the' Said action; that the said heirs of <em>Bowly, </em>and the complainants, have severally succeeded, and become entitled to all the rights, claims and interest, of their respective fathers, in regard to the land herein before described, and held in possession by <em>Lammot </em>in his life-time. Wherefore the complainants represent, that they are justly am! equitably entitled to hold and enjoy the lauds and pre - mises herein before particularly described and conveyed as aforesaid, (except so miicii thereof as <em>Lammot, </em>in his life-time, sold or leased,) free, clear and discharged, of and from all claims, tule, demand or interest, in or to the'said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>land, or in \u00f3r t\u00f3 any part thereof, of the heirs of <em>Bowly, </em>or of any person or persons claiming under him, them, or dither of them. And that if the said heirs have any title at law, in or to the said land, \u00f3r to any part thereof, (which the complainants do not admit,) yet they are not, in good Conscience or equity \u00e9ntilled to claim, recover; or hold the said land, or any part thereof, hut on the contrary, they are altogether destitute of all just rights or equitable interests therein Or thereto; and to every part thereof.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b508-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>A party contracting under a clear and unequivocal mistake of bis le gul rights, where such rights art' of a doubtful character, will be relieved in equity</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Au0\">A, bj his will, devised to <em>A </em>L, bis wife, \u2018\u2018for and during1 her natural Jife, my tract of land called <em>Chats' </em>worth, with the dwelling honsw, smd all the bin'dings and improve ments thereon, (save &amp; except the rope-walk) And I give to my von <em>G </em>Z, hi9 heirs, fee. my tract of land called <em>Chatsworthy </em>&amp;c. bytm ease nij\u2019 <em>said son should die before he attains of legal age, androith</em>quf issue, then I bequeath the ^aid land to my said, \u25a0wife, and her assigns to be at her own will and disposal, as it originally was, (save smd except five acres to be laid off in a long square, \u00bfic and'that said five acres, together Vjith the rope wallc and all the buildings, fee.

The answer of the defendants admits that <em>William Lux </em>was in Ins life-time seized and possessed of the said tract of land, called <em>Chalsworth, </em>as stated in the bill of complaint; and they are informed and believe that he had been so seized and possessed of the same for many years before, and till his death* and at that time; and that for several years before his death, a rope-walk had been established by him and <em>Daniel Bowly </em>thereon, in partnership, which was carried on by him and <em>Bowly, </em>as partners from the time of its erection until the death of <em>William Lux. </em>They admit that <em>William </em>Lux, being so seized of the said tract of land, did qn the 5th of May 1773, duly make and execute his last will and testament, appointing thereby, <em>Daniel Bowly,, </em>the executor thereof; by which said will, <em>William Lux </em>did, as they are informed and believe, devise to <em>Daniel Bowly, </em>in- fee-simple, five acres of land, part of the said tract called <em>Chatsworth, </em>including the said rope -walk, to be laid of as1 by said will directed; and so it has been, by the High court of appeals solemnly decided, in an ejectment instituted by the lessee of the said <em>Bowly </em>against <em>Lammot, </em>the father of the said complainants, and therefore they deny, that <em>William Lux </em>devised to <em>George </em>Lux, any part of the said five acres of land, but only so much of the said tract of land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>C\u00ed\u00edlled <em>Ch iisivorih, </em>as remained free and clear of the same. That they are informed \"and believe the said <em>William Lux </em>departed this life on or about the 20th of February 1777, leaving bis wife <em>Rgnes, </em>at that time in full life, and that she afterwards departed this life on, &amp;e. and that immediately after \u00bfhe death of <em>William Lux, </em>the said' <em>Daniel South], </em>having entered upon the said rope-walk, and the land adjoinin'!, ao devised to him, the said rope-walk was carried on for a considerable length of time by the said <em>Bowly </em>and <em>Ge orge Lux, </em>whom the said <em>Daniel </em>took into partnership with him in that business; and during that ti.no, the said rope-walk was carried on by <em>Daniel Bowly </em>and <em>George Lnx,'m </em>the same manner as it had been before by <em>William, Lae </em>and <em>Daniel Bowly. </em>They admit that <em>George Lux. </em>having arched at full age, did on the 17th day of April, in the year of our Lord, 1787, duly make and execute to <em>William Russell, </em>a deed duly acknowledged and recorded, which they presume to be the same mentioned by the complainants in their said bill. But they a ay that the said deed purports only to convey such part of <em>Ghatswnrih, </em>of which he was seized in fee, and which lie had uot granted or conveyed away, and did not, nor could it, operate to convey to <em>William Russell, </em>any part of the said five acres of ground, so devised to <em>Daniel, Bowly, </em>or ahy interest therein; nor have they any reason to believe that <em>Georgs Lux </em>intended it should. That they are informed and believe, when <em>William Lux </em>died, <em>Harry Dorsey Gough </em>was possessed of a bond given to him by <em>William Russell </em>and <em>William LgX, </em>for the payment of J100 sterling, and dated on the said 12th day of December, 1769, which sum they are informed and believe to have been the proper debt of <em>William Russell, </em>and that <em>William Lux </em>was only his security. And also, that <em>Harry Dorsey Gough </em>was at that time possessed of another bond given by <em>William Lux </em>and <em>Daniel Bowly </em>to him, for the payment of <em>\u00a3500 </em>sterling; dated the 11th day of August, 1768, which was for their joint debt, and that the said principal sums, with a considerable amount of interest thereon, were remaining due and unpaid on the 20th day \u25a0of June, in the year 1787. But they further say, \u00bfhat they are informed and believe, that at the time of the death of <em>William, Lux, </em>he was largely indebted to <em>Daniel Bowly, </em>and that the said estate of said <em>William Lux </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>indebted to <em>Daniel \u00c9owly, </em>in a much larger sum than the said <em>Boioly\u2019s </em>proportion of the said joint bond so due to Gough; in consequence whereof it was the duty of <em>George Lux, </em>and <em>Daniel Bovdly </em>h\u00e1d \u00e1 right to compel <em>George Lux, </em>to pay and satisfy the whole of said joint debt to <em>Go.ugh, </em>out of the estate of <em>William Lux, </em>which <em>George Lux </em>received, as heir or devisee of said <em>William, </em>and to indemnify him the said Bowly, against the said debt \u2014 And in Consequence of the said deed of trust, <em>William Russell </em>was equally bound so1 t\u00f3 do. And at th\u00e9 same time, they allege that the estate of <em>William Lux, </em>which came to the hands of <em>George Lux, </em>as his heir or devise\u00e9, and which was so conveyed to <em>William Russell, </em>Was much more thaii sufficient for that purpose. They here introduce and exhibit a pial \u00f3f said tract, called <em>Chatsioorth, </em>and certain parts thereof, and illustrations of said plat, which tli\u00e9y consider necessary for the fully apprehending and better understanding certain facts, which they deem important to be stated and understood in the \u00e9xamination aud. decision of this suit; on which plat the said tract, called <em>Chatsioorth, </em>is located; as Begirining!-at the letter A, from whence th\u00e9 first five lin\u00e9s \u00f3f said tr\u00e1ct run, with the back fin\u00e9s, numbered with the black figures, i, 2, 3, thence to the letter E, and thence to the figure 14, which line from the letter B, to the figures 14, is th\u00e9 5th fine \u00f3f the said tract mentioned in said will, on which the said fiv\u00e9 acres are to' be laid ou.t in \u00e1 long squ\u00e1re, and the rope-walk aforesaid is f\u00e9presented oti said plat by the narrow space between the two black lines extending from the small black letter <em>h, to </em>the letter K; through which runs the black broken <em>line, </em>which they \u00e1re informed and believe represents the particular piece of ground, actUal\u00edy us\u00e9d and occupied as the rope-Walk, and which, by the said devise, is directed to be included in the said five acres. They are informed and believe, that <em>George Lux, </em>befoi!e he executed said deed to <em>Williamr Russell, </em>had entered into \u00e1 contraet with <em>Daniel </em>Lammot, whereby hd had agreed, to sell to him a part of <em>Chatsworth, </em>containing \u00cd4 acres and one quarter of an acre, for the suns \u00f3f J523 15s. current money, and contracted to convey the same by certain metes and bounds to him, upon payment of the said purchase money; which said 14 acres and one quarter of an acre are, as they are informed and believe, truly located on said plat, according to said metes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>bounds; \u2014 -Beginning at the small black letter <em>h, </em>on said plat, and running with the red drawn lines, numbered with the red figures, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and thence to the beginning. That they understand and believe, that after the execution of said deed to <em>William Russell, </em>the said <em>Daniel Lam-mot, </em>not having yet paid the said purchase money, it was agreed between <em>George Lux </em>and <em>William Russell, </em>that the money so due should be applied by <em>Russell </em>for payment of debts to be satisfied under the said trust, and that when the money should be thus applied, <em>Russell </em>should execute a deed for the said ground, so sold to <em>Daniel </em>Lammot; and that in consequence of said agreement, and a further arrangement which took place between Russell, <em>Lammot </em>and <em>Gough, </em>lie, <em>Gough, </em>on the 20th day of July, 1&gt;87, received the said debt, so due from <em>Lammot, </em>as a present payment, to the amount thereof, made to him by <em>Russell, </em>in part discharge of the said debt, which was due to him on the said bonds, and for which <em>George Lux </em>was answerable to him, as heir and devisee of <em>Jfilham </em>Lux; and on the said 20th day of July, in the said year, <em>Gougl\\ </em>credited <em>Daniel Bowly </em>and <em>George Lux, </em>on account, of said debt, (the said <em>Bowly </em>and <em>George Lux </em>having previously given to <em>Govgh </em>their bonds for the balance remaining due on said original bonds,) by the said sum of \u00bf\u00a3'523 <em>15s. </em>And on the same day <em>Gough </em>charged <em>Daniel Lammot, </em>as debtor to him, with the same sum of moneyj. and to secure <em>Gough </em>from any risk by reason of this arrangement, <em>William Russe.U, </em>who had the legal title in him by virtue of the said deed of trust, on tito same day exe\u00ab cuted to <em>Gough </em>a deed, conveying to him the said piece or parcel of ground thus sold by <em>George Lux </em>to <em>Daniel Lam* snot, </em>which appears to have been conveyed to <em>Daniel Lam-mot </em>by <em>Gough, </em>on the 9th day of May, 1,801, and not before. That they are informed and believe, that <em>Russell </em>afterwards,'to wit, on the 2d day of April 1789, agreed to sell to <em>Gough </em>two acres more of the said tract of land, called Chatszporth, for the sum of \u00bf270, to be applied by <em>Gough </em>in part discharge of the said balance still remaining due to him, and the same day <em>Gough </em>gave the credit accordingly. That they believe this purchase was made by <em>Govgh </em>for <em>Daniel Ixrmmot, </em>because it appears, that the same day <em>Gough </em>charged him as his debtor for that same sum, on account of said two acres of ground, and did af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>terwards convey it to Lanmot, by the same deed by winch he conveyed to him the said part before sold to him. And that <em>Gough, </em>having neglected to recorr\u00ed in due time (he aforesaid deed executed to him by <em>Russell, </em>the said <em>Russell </em>did, on the 27th day of April 1789, by his deed, duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, convey ,un(o <em>Gough, </em>both the said parcels of ground, to wit, the said 14 acres, and one quarter of an acre, and the said-, two acres of ground; which said two acres are truly located, as they are informed and believe, according to the said metes and bounds, by which they are described in said deed on said plat, beginning at the red figure 3, opposile the north side of <em>Fayette street, </em>and sunning with red lines, numbered with red. figures, 4, 5, 4, and thence to the figure 3, the beginning. That <em>Daniel Bowly </em>had not, any time before either of those sales, located or established any lines, metes or bounds of the said five acres of land, so devised by the said will, according to which they should be held by him; but that no part of said parcel of ground which <em>George Lux </em>so sold, to <em>Daniel Lommot, </em>interferes with, or even is contiguous to the rope,-walk, except a small portion thereof on the north, and not exceeding half an acre; but that in fixing the metes and bounds by which it was laid off and sold, there seems to have, been peculiar attention that it should not interfere in general with any probable location which could, be made thereof, agreeably to said devise. They do not admit, nor do they belieye that <em>Daniel Bowly </em>was privy to, or perfectly acquainted with, or in any manlier assented to even the first of these sales, at least so fin-as the same interfered with the said rope-walk, or that lie had any knowledge it did-thus interfere therewith, or wi(li the five acres thus devised; nor do they believe <em>Daniel Bowly </em>was privy to, or perfectly acquainted with, or in any manner assented to the sale of the said two acres, ochad any knowledge that it in- any manner interfered with ' said devise, until after the settlement that is stated to take, place between him and Gough; but they are informed by those who were intimate with <em>Bowly </em>about that time, and they believe, that he was ignorant of the said two acres having been sold by <em>Russell </em>when made, or that it interfered with the said devise, and that when he discovered it, he uniformly expressed the utmost surprise and indignation at the conduct of <em>Russell </em>in so doing. And as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>alienation that <em>Daniel Bowly </em>was in fact and reality % party in those transactions, they believe ii utterly desti~ tute of foundation, for they say that they believe be consttiered himself no more than nominally concerned or interested in them; for though he was answerable to <em>Gough,'sz </em>far as ho was a party to the said debt, yet as the estate of <em>William Lux </em>was indebted to him to a large amount, much more than bis proportion o\u00ed, or even the whole debt: due to <em>Gough, </em>for the payment of which <em>George Lux </em>was answerable as heir and devisee of las said father, and as the property held by him under his said father, while held by himself, and afterwards thus conveyed in trust to <em>Evs~ sell, </em>was greatly more than sufficient to discharge all <em>William Lux's </em>debts, they apprehend that \u00bfhmiei <em>Jioivly </em>could not contemplate suffering any inconvenience to himself; and as lio was engaged in other concerns of bis own which engrossed all his care, time, and attention, he was less likely to trouble himself with those in which ha could not suppose himself particularly interested; and the less so, as at that time, during those transactions, they believe he hat! no doubt of the honesty and uprightness of either <em>George Luce, </em>or <em>Ifilliam </em>Russell, both of whom were his near relations and avowed friends, and whose disposition to discharge him from any responsibility on account of the said debts due to <em>Gough, </em>he could have no reason to question; and so far was that from being the case, that it was the original intention of <em>George, </em>Lux, to have conveyed the said property to <em>Ihmkl LovJy </em>as Iris trustee, who declined it, because bis other business and occupations would not give him sufficient leisure, and rtcomnmnded it to him to make the deed to <em>Russell. </em>ri hat <em>Lur.id Jioivly </em>did at length lose that confidence in <em>U Ulicm \u00a1\u00bfus-sell, </em>partly, probably on account of his having, nmier preterit of the said deed, thus acted to the prejudice &lt;;f him, <em>Jiowly, </em>and partly in consequence of his having, in many instances, wantonly sold the property which had thus been conveyed to him in trust, below its value, and applied the money to his own use, and therefore <em>Bowly </em>instituted, cc caused proceedings to be instituted against <em>JLissell </em>us vacate the said trust, to prevent further misconduct, tffiiiere \u2022 upon by a deed, in which <em>George </em>Am.\u00bb joined with him, he, Russell, on the 7th day of May, 1796, conveyed to <em>'R/niel Jioivly, </em>all the said property contained in the former deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>of {rust, which remained undisposed of by him upon thi trusts mentioned in said deed thus executed to <em>Daniel </em>Bowly. After which, <em>Daniel: Bowly </em>having thus become seized of that property, out of the proceeds of which the remaining balance of those debts, due as aforesaid to, <em>Gough, </em>was to be paid, he gave his own bond for the same, to wit, on or about the Gth day of June, 1799; that all those credits which had been given by <em>Gough </em>on the said account, against <em>Daniel Bowly </em>and <em>George Lux, </em>had been given by direction of <em>Russell, </em>in consequence of transactions which had passed between <em>Russell </em>and <em>Gough, </em>pi which it dpes not appear, nor do they admit or believe <em>Daniel Bowly </em>bad any participation; that the said balance, as stated, was simply the sum that appeared to remain due after adding up the debits and credits; and therefore, supposing <em>Daniel D.owly </em>did sign the said balance, together with <em>Gough, </em>which they do not know or admit, and which they think immaterial, it amounted to nothing more than an admission on his part, that the difference between the. debits and credits, as so stated and entered in said account, was equal to that sum, as it actually was. It is not suggested that the debits are erroneous, and it could not have been bis duty to have objected to the credits, which had been entered under the direction of the parties to the transactions; but from this fact no inference can he drawn that <em>Daniel Bowly </em>knew that the pieces or parcels of land, for the price of which some of the credits had been given, were situate in such a manner as to interfere with said devise, even if lie took notice that the said credits were on account of land sold, for he well knew that <em>George Dux </em>had conveyed in trust to <em>Russell </em>a much greater quantity of land, which did not interfere with said devise, than was necessary for the payment of all the debts for which he was answerable, instead of the trifling sum for which credits were given in that account, and he could not suspect that <em>Russell, </em>in selling those lands, had violated his duty by selling lands which h\u00e9 had no right to dispose of; and they deny, that it was on any settlement or adjustment between <em>Bowly </em>and <em>Gough, </em>that credit was given for the said sum of \u00a352S 15s. the price of the said 14 acres and a quarter of an acre of land, as suggested in said bill of complaint. They admit, that the money arising from the said sales was applied by <em>Russell </em>and <em>Gough% </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>to th\u00e9 extinguishment of so much of the debt as was due from <em>Lux </em>and <em>Bowly; </em>but say it was for a debt, for which, though the said <em>Bowly </em>was nominally answerable to <em>Gough, </em>yet <em>George Lux </em>was under obligations to <em>Bowly, </em>to pay wholly to <em>Gdngh, </em>and was able to pay it; and they utterly deny that <em>Bowly </em>received great or important advantages thereby, because they say, that as there was abundant property belonging to <em>George Lux, </em>and conveyed in trust to <em>Russell, </em>to have paid ihe same amount, which was liable for the said (\u00cdeb\u00ed, and which <em>Bowly </em>might have compelled to be applied thereto, ii could not, therefore, be a valuable or important advantage to <em>Bowly, </em>that his own property should have been illegally and needlessly sold, and that greatly under Us value, and applied for payment of a debt, which ought, in justice, equity and conscience, io have been wholly paid by <em>George Lux, </em>or by <em>Russell, </em>out of the proceeds of the property which had belonged to <em>George, </em>and which <em>he had </em>conveyed in trust to <em>Russell, </em>among other things, for the payment of that very debt As to the allegation here again repeated by.the complainants, that <em>Bowly </em>had the most intimate and exact knowledge of all the circumstances, they do not admit or be* lie.ve it to be true, nor do these respondents know or believe that <em>Baniel Bowly </em>furnished instructions under his own hand, or in any other manner to the surveyor, or to any other person, directing the said land to be laid out in the manner it: was sold, or interfering with the said devise, for the purpose of its being thus sold; but they think it probable enough, that after the said sale, he may hare furnished instructions to the surveyor to lay out or run the land by the courses, according to which it had been sold, to discover its actual position, and whether it did interfere with Uie said devise. They admit that <em>Gough </em>never Idmself had actual possession of any part of said property so conveyed to him. And that the rope-walk aforesaid, at <em>the </em>time <em>William Lux </em>died, was situated in an old field, constituting part of the farm or plantation of <em>FFiBiam Lvx, </em>and which old field, except ihe small part occupied as a rope-walk, was cu!tiv;;t*'-d or used for pasture, as part of liis said far,!.-, all which remained in the same situation for a long time after the death of <em>William Lux, </em>asid they he-lo we, til! the time when the said sales were made as aforeraid, ?ud had become aa opea common, and fer some time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>after: that the said old field contained within its extent; not only the said rope-walk and both the said pieces of ground s\u00f3 sold, but the piece of ground comprised within .the four red lines located on said plat, beginning at the red figure 4, then running to the red figure 5, to the red figure 6, then to the red figure <em>7, </em>thence to th\u00e9 beginning, (within which lines the letter T is inclosed;) as well as additional ground, all which lay in oiie common field, without being separated; the one part from the other, by any fencing or inclosure; That when <em>Daniel Lammot </em>made the said purchase from <em>George Lux, </em>or shortly after, they are informed and believe, he did enter upon some part of the said land contained within the metes and bounds mentioned, as including the said 1acres, and made improvements thereon; by erecting a tan yard, where he carried on a tannery-, but that thes\u00e9 improvements were made by him a considerable distance from the five acres so devised,, and upon the part which <em>Bussell </em>had a right to convey, as laying clear of the devise to <em>Bowly, </em>and these respondents do not know or \u00e1dmit, that <em>Daniel Lammot </em>did by virtue of the said purchases, actually take possession of any part of the said l\u00e1nd so devised to <em>Daniel </em>Bowly, until many years after the same had been thus Sold as before stated; and although <em>John Eager Howard </em>arid <em>Georg'e Lux, </em>contemplating the probable extension of <em>Ballimore-town, </em>and th\u00e9 advantage which in that case, it might be to their property, agreed upon a street to be called <em>Union-street, </em>tobe established between them, yet at that time neither the said town nor precincts included the place; but the ground thus- fixed upon for a street, constituted part of the old field, \u00e1s far as the same was situate within the tract called Chatsworth, or was part of a common, as they believe and are informed, and was without improvements thereon; and though they admit <em>Daniel Bowly </em>lived the greatest part of bis time in the city of Baltimore, or within a few miles thereof, yet fie might certainly have, lived thus near to those parts of the said tract, without knowing that <em>Daniel Lammot </em>had purchased land, the lines of which included, or that he claimed title to any part of the five acres devised to him, as long as the ground lay either in an old field or a common, without any part of the said five acres, or if any only a very small part of the same, being actually in the possession or .occupation of <em>Daniel Lammot, </em>and the more probably so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>as bis lime and attention was so entirely engrossed with other concerns. They admit that <em>Darnel Bowly </em>was, from the death of said <em>JVilliam Lux, </em>well acquainted with the instrument of writing, executed by <em>JfUliam, Lux, </em>as his lad will and testameut; yet they believe and are assured, that?he was not well acquainted with his rights under that will until some time after, nor of the legal cTect and operation of the said devise to him therein, but was induced erroneously to think that he was to take nothing by that devise, unless <em>Charge Lux </em>should die under the age of 21 years, and without issue, which was, as they understand, the mistaken construction generally given to that devise, ami that which was given to it by the court of <em>Baltimore </em>county on the trial of said ejectment; it is not thereiore to be wondered at, that <em>Basely </em>should thus have remained iu an error himself; and they believe tlut until he was informed by an intimate friend of lega! knowledge, who had occasion to examine the said wilt, that by the said devise he had an immediate right to the said 5 acres, <em>Daniel Hastily </em>did remain in that error; and they are informed and believe, that: a considerable time; several years before he instituted said ejectment, <em>Daniel Bowly </em>was in actual possession of a house which stood upon the said 5 acres, at the place where the letter T is marked on said plat, and the lands around and adjoining to it; which house, and a part of the -said ground, constituting part of the said 5 acres, have been ever since held by <em>Daniel Bowly, </em>or those claiming under him, and are yet so held; and they further say, that they are assured and they believe, that the reason why <em>Daniel Bowly </em>did not sooner bring his said ejectment, was his desire and hope to have settled the dispute with <em>Lammol </em>amicably, and that he a long time before bringing his suit, did inform <em>Lanwiot </em>of his claim, and endeavoured to come to a settlement with him, and that it was not until he lost all hopes of accomplishing that object that he instituted the said ejectment to obtain a legal decision upon his right and title under the said will. That though they do not know or admit that <em>Daniel Rawly </em>was in any manner privy to or acquiescing in the said first sale, as far as it interfered with the said rope-walk, or the said devise; yet should that appear to be the case, they feel the most perfect conviction it was owing to and during the time of his ignorance of ids right, for nothing can be more improbable or absurd, than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>to suppose that he would thus needlessly have consented or permit* ed land, to which he thought himself entitled, to be thus sold for the payment of debts due from <em>William Lux </em>and himself; which <em>George Lux </em>was bound to pay; when the said <em>George </em>had such ample means for payment Out of his own property, which was answerable for <em>it; </em>and that he would so wantonly sacrifice; for so trilling a consideration, property, which from its vicinity to <em>Baltimoretownw </em>as certain to become so highly valuable. And from what was the conduct of <em>Daniel Bowly </em>after he became informed of his right, it may be reasonably inferred what would have been antecedently bis conduct, had he earlier known his right. But should it appear that <em>Bowly </em>has, in any manner, been consenting, for any reason, to the sale of the small part of ground, which according to the first sale interferes with the 5 acres by the location, he has claimed it as located on said plat, so far that the complainants should be considered entitled to relief, as to that part; they contend that they in equity are entitled to be recompensed for it; by being permitted to extend the long square in width so far as to contain 5 acres, clear of that small part; and they say that on the said plat, the 5 acres claimed by <em>Daniel Bowly </em>is included in the parallelogram, formed by the lines, beginning at the letter I, running to the figure 19, to the figure 30, to the figure 14, and thence to the beginning; they say, that of the whole 16j- acres so conveyed to <em>Daniel Lam-mot, </em>they do hot include 3 acres, they believe of the ground so devised to <em>Daniel Bowly, </em>therefore <em>Daniel Lammot, </em>and those claiming imder him, hold and enjoy at least 14| acres of the land so conveyed to him, Ihe title to which is not contested, and this has cost him no more that <em>\u00a359S </em>35s. much less they believe, than what it was worth at the time he purchased it, and is, they believe, at this time independent of the improvements thereon, worth not less than g50,000. They admit, that <em>Daniel Bowly </em>instituted an ejectment against <em>Daniel Lammot, </em>for the purpose of recovering so much of the said land devised to him, of which <em>Daniel Lammot </em>had taken possession, which, on the abolition of general court, was sent to the county court of <em>Baltimore </em>county, to be there tried. That at the said trial, the judges of the said court were of opinion, that <em>Bowly </em>took nothing by the said devise; that the judges of the court of appeals having reversed their judgment, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>record was by <em>procedendo </em>sent back io said county court, where, the said suit is now depending, the said proceedings, a copy of which these respondents exhibit.

Ids i,:st will and testament, which contains the follow <em>-ir </em>clause\u00bb: \u201c1 give and bequeath to my dear wife, <em>Agnes i.-ux, </em>lor and during her natural life, my tract of land wnd &gt;,,.1 station called <em>Chatsworth, </em>with (he dwelling-house, and <em>\u00bfL </em>(he buildings and improvements thereon, (save and eseept the rope-walk.\u201d) \u201cI give and bequeath to my dear son <em>George Lux. </em>ins heirs and assigns, my tract of land ealle.il <em>Chatsworth, </em>lying and being in <em>Dali \u00a1more </em>county, containing nine hundred and fifty acres; but in case my said son should die before he attains of legal age, and without issue, then I leave and bequeath the said tract of land, called <em>Chatsworth, </em>to my dear wife <em>Agnes Lux, </em>or her assigns, to be at her own will and disposal, as il originally was, (save and except lite acres, to belaid of in a long \u00abquare, on the south two degrees west one hundred and thirty-one perches line, being the fifth line from the begiuniug, and that said five acres, together with the rope-walk and all the buildings and improvements thereon, I give and bequeath to my dear nephew and partner, <em>Daniel Bowl;', </em>his heirs and assigns.\u201d <em>George Lux, </em>on the 17th day of April, in the year 1787, by deed, reciting that whereas he was indebted to several persons in large sums of money, which he was desirous to discharge, and for oilier purposes therein specified, conveyed, among other property, all that part of a tract of land called and known by the name of <em>Chatsworth, </em>which had not (heretofore been granted and conveyed, to <em>Mtlliam Bussell, </em>and his heirs, In trust, to sell and dispose of the same, and with the proceeds of sale to pay and extinguish the debts due by him,ihe said <em>Georgs, </em>and the residue thereof, if any there should be, to appropriate in the manner by the said deed directed. On the 20(h day of July, in the year 1787, <em>William Russell, </em>in virtue of the trust with which he was invested by the deed above mentioned, sold to <em>Daniel Larnmot </em>fourteen acres \u00bb;,,i one quarter o\u00ed an acre of land, in fee simple, bain;; part <em>Li </em>the said tract of land called <em>Chatsworth, </em>And on the second day of April, in the year 1789, the said <em>WiHiiua Russell </em>sold to the said <em>Larnmot </em>two acres more of said land, in fee, making in the whole sixteen acres and one quarter of an acre, for Use consideration of five hundred and ninety-three pounds fifteen shillings currant mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ney. <em>William Lux </em>and <em>Daniel </em>Bowly, being indebted t\u00a9 \u00bf 'certain <em>Harry Dorsey Gough </em>in the sum of five hundred pounds, by bond bearing <em>date </em>the eleventh day of August, in the year 1768, it was agreed between the said' <em>Russell, Lammot </em>and <em>Gough, </em>that <em>Gough </em>would credit the bond of <em>Lux </em>and <em>Bowly </em>with the amount of the purchase money, and that the land, so as aforesaid sold, should be Conveyed to <em>Gough', </em>to make, the same responsible to him for the credit so given. In pursuance of said agreement, <em>\u2022William Russell, </em>on the 27th day of April in the year 1789, conveyed the said sixteen and a quarter acres t\u00f3 <em>Gough, </em>in order to make the same responsible to him for the credit so given. On the 9th day of May, in the year 1801; <em>Gough </em>conveyed to <em>Lammot </em>the said sixteen and a quarter acres of land, for the consideration therein Specified. It appears, from the proof in the cause, that <em>Bowly </em>had perfect knowledge of the sal\u00e9 of the fourteen and a quarter acres of land; and of. the location thereof, and there is reason to believe, from the, testimony, that he also knew of the second sale of the two acres; It further appears from the evidence; that On.the days when the said sales were respectively made, the bond of <em>Daniel Bowly </em>and <em>George Lux </em>was credited with the amount of the pur. ihase money, stipulated to be paid for the sixteen and a quarter acres of land sold as aforesaid; the bond of <em>William Lux </em>and <em>Daniel Bowly </em>having been substituted, after the death of <em>William Lux, </em>by the bond of <em>Daniel Bowly </em>\u00e1nd <em>George Lux. </em>In what character <em>Bowly </em>stood bound in the original. bond, whether as principal or surety, no whcffe expressly appears from the proof; though it is strongly to be inferred, from the circumstances in the case, that they were both bound as principals, as if they were not, it is not to be believed that <em>Lux </em>would have assumed upon himself a liability to pay the, debt after the death of his father. The said <em>William Russell, </em>by deed bearing date the 7th day of May 1796, relinquished his trust to <em>Daniel Bowly, </em>who on the 6th of June 1799, substituted the bond of <em>Bowly </em>and <em>Lux, </em>by his own obligation to <em>'Gough, </em>for \u00a31000, which it is presumed he was induced to do, as he had succeeded to the trust originally vested in <em>Russell, </em>and had thereby obtained possession of <em>George Lux's </em>property, which he was authorized to apply to the payment of his part of said debt. Although the bond of <em>Bowly </em>and <em>Lux </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Was credited by <em>Gough </em>with the amount of the said sales of 16.i- acres of land, sold by <em>Bussell </em>to Lammot, it does not appear that <em>Bowly </em>derived any benefit or advantage fey such credit, because it amounted to very little more than <em>Lux\u2019s </em>one half of the debt, supposing them to be equally bound, (which, from the facts and circumstances in the case it is presumed they were;) and because it further appears, that the bond from <em>Bowly </em>to <em>Gough, </em>which was substituted for the bond of <em>Bowly </em>and <em>Lux, </em>was satisfied and paid with <em>Bowly\u2019s </em>own funds; and because; it further appears from the testimony in the. cause, that <em>William </em>Lux, at the time of his death, was considerably indebted to <em>Bowly, </em>for the payment of which debt, the property of <em>William Lux </em>was more than sufficient. It appears from the testimony of the late Judge <em>lUdgely, </em>who wras the intimate friend atid legal adviser of <em>Bowly, </em>that although <em>Bowly </em>was well acquainted with the devise to him in the will of <em>William, Lux, </em>yet ho never believed that lie became entitled to the land thereby devised, till the dea ill of <em>George Lux </em>without issue; and that after the death of <em>George Lux\u2019s </em>son, and he thinks also aiter the death of his wife, he was consulted by <em>Bowly </em>on the legal effect and Operation of certain clauses in <em>William LuxPs </em>will, and particularly with regard to the rope-walk which was effected upon the five acres of land devised to <em>Bowly </em>by the will of <em>William Lux\\ </em>and that, the opinion which he gave to <em>Bowly </em>was, that he became entitled to the <em>rope-walk, </em>and the laud appertaining to that establishment, under said will, independent of the contingency of <em>George Lux\u2019s </em>death without issue.' Some time after <em>Bowly </em>had obtained this opinion, he instituted an action of ejectment in the late general court, for so much of the five acres as <em>Lammot </em>purchased; on the abolition of which court, the cause was sent to <em>Baltimore </em>county court, to be there tried; the judges ol that court were of opinion that <em>Bowly </em>took nothing by the devise, from whose judgment there was an appeal to this courts and at June term 1810, the judgment of the county court was reversed, and the case remitted to said county court, with a <em>procedendo, </em>where the suit is now pending. The complainants, who are the representatives of <em>Lammot, </em>filed a bill on the equity side of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, to obtain an <em>injunction </em>to stay proceedings at law, and to hays a conveyance of all the right and title of <em>Lowly\u2019s </em>ru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>jprese\u00f1\u00edatives, to the purchases made by <em>Lammot </em>in hid life-time, executed to them. The county court, with the consent of the parlies, decreed <em>pro forma \u00e1 </em>dismissal of the complain\u00e1f\u00edt\u2019s bill, with costs to the defendants; front which decree the defendants have app\u00e9\u00e1led to this court; The question now to b\u00e9 decided is, whether or not they have shown sufficient groitnds of equity to entitle them to the relief, which they come hereto obtain? And Whether\u2019 they ate so entitled, depends upon the agency which <em>Bowly </em>had in the purchases made by their deceased ancestor; and the knowledge lie had of his rights at the time they were made. Tlie principle involved in the decision of this question is an important one, as well on account of its immediate bearing upon this case, as of the influence and operation it may hereafter have in deciding questions of title which may arise under similar circumstanced; The question presented for the decision of this court is simply this, whether \u00e1 man, having a legal title to a parcel of-land, but who is ignorant of his right, forfeits his title to that land, by concealing \u2019his right, when he knows th'\u00e1t another is about to purchase it from a third person? And this question is to be\" decided upon the principles of equity and conscience, which can never inflict a punishment upofi innocence', or decree a-forfeiture, when there has been no\u2019 fault. OH the contrary, it is at alj times\u2019 the anxious wish of a court of chancery to r\u00e9li\u00e9ve against forfeitures and penalties, where the principles of justice and equity do not forbid it. Has then the conduct of <em>Daniel Bowly </em>been such as to inerit the infliction of punishment at the hands of this' court? Because a punishment it is t\u00e9Vmed by the authorities which, treat itpon the subject, and they speak of the forfeiture as a punishment inflicted by -reason of the guilt of the party in not disclosing his right. It would, at the first blush,- seem' quite sufficient to ask,- how can a man disclose a title of winch he has no knowledge? To the com~mon sense of the woffl'd this would\u2019 seem to be an impossibility, and the law, which is a system of Written reasrtn, never enforces- a vain or impossible thing. It is proved by all the witnesses who speak upoii the subject, that they never heard of <em>Bowly's </em>claiming any title to the property in question, until long after the purchases were made',by <em>Lammot, </em>and all of them were his neighbours, and some of them his most intimate friends. Nor is it armatter of surprise that <em>Bowly </em>was unacquainted- <em>wit&amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the operation of law upon that clause of <em>William Tmt?s </em>will, under which his representatives now claim title to the property in controversy, since it appears that the judicial tribunals of the slate entertained different opinions upon the true construction of it, aided as they were by all the, lights of science in their exposition of it. it may then be safely assumed to have been at least a doubtful question, and one upon which it is not unreasonable to say, that <em>Bowlij </em>might have been in the dark. If then he was ignorant of his title, what says the law upon the subject? In 1 <em>Powell </em>on <em>Contracts, </em>131, 132, 133, after stating that there, might ha either an express or tacit assent to a contract or agreement, be says, \u201ca tacit assent may arise in several ways \u2014 It may be inferred from inaction, or forbearance of acting. Thus a man, by his silence, in case he be present, and acquainted with what is doing, is supposed to give his assent to what is then done;,unless it appears that he was awed into silence, or any way hindered from speaking.\u201d \u201cAnd in, such cases, assent is presumed even against an infant; for, it is meant as a- punishment for his concealing his right, by which an innocent, person is drawn in to advance his mo\u00bb ney.\u201d If then a tacit assent is imputed to infants, who are peculiarly the objects of a court of chancery\u2019s care anti protection, it can only bo upon the ground of knowing then rights, and a culjsable and fraudulent concealment of such knowledge. T!\u00a1e same author says, iu page 134, \u201cin.or-, der to warrant us in concluding from a man\u2019s silence, that he has relinquished his right, two things are necessary \u2014 . The first is, that he should know that what belongs to him is conveying to another; for when one forbears to act through mere ignorance, it etui have no effect\u201d \u2014 and \u201csecondly, that he should be voluntarily silent, though he has full liberty to speak.\u201d So in <em>1 </em>Fonblanque, 161 \u2014 The author says, \u201cthere\"is also an implied as well as an express assent; as where a man, who has a title and knows of it, stands by, and either encourages, or does not forbid the purchase, he shall be bound, and all claiming under him, by it. Neither shall infancy or coverture be any excuse in such case. And this seems a just punishment for his concealing his right, by which an innocent man is drawn in to lay out his money.\u201d It is then upon the principle, that the party committed a fraud by concealing his right, that ihe becomes bound, and all claiming under him. In <em>Niven vs. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>Belknap, 2 Johnson\u2019s Rep. </em>589, the same principle is recog\u00ed nized by <em>Thompson, </em>Justice, that where a man has a title, and knows o\u00ed it,(and either encourages, or does not forbid the purchase, he, and all claiming under, him, shall be bound by such purchase;.and in support \u00f3fhis opinion he-refers to 1 <em>Fonblanque, </em>161. In <em>Levy vs. </em>The <em>Bank of the United States, </em>1 <em>Binney\u2019s Rep. 27, </em>the case was this; a forged check was credited as cash in the holder\u2019s bank book, and he being, afterwards informed that the check had been forged, under:, a mistake of his legal-rights, agreed that if the. check was a forgery, he would not take advantage of - the deposit. <em>Shippen, </em>chief justice, decided} that., the party was not bound-by his-agreement, it being made under a mistake of-his right, In this case the chief-justice says, \u201cthe case of-<em>Penn </em>and Lord <em>Baltimore </em>is decisive to this point, I was present at the. agreement half a century ago, and heard-. Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>say, though it is not mentioned in the printed report, that if- Lord- <em>Baltimore </em>ma.de the agreement in question, under a mistake of. his right to another-degree of latitude, he ought to be relieved, but that he was not mistaken.\u201d. In <em>Green vs Price, 1 Munford, 453, </em>Judge <em>Tucker </em>lays down the law to be, that if a man has an equitable title to lands, and- knows of- it; and either encourages, or does not forbid the. purchase, he, and all claiming under him, shall be bound\u00a1 by it; and in support of his opinion he refers to <em>1 Fonblanque, B. 1 ch. </em>3, s. 4. Thus it appears, that some of the most enlightened and eminent judges of, our country, have given their sanction' to the doctrine, that a'party is not bound by Ins silence, unless he has a knowledge of- his right, and fraudulently conceals it where he ought to speak. In <em>Bize vs Dickason, </em>1. <em>T. R. 285, </em>Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in delivering the opinion of the court, is reported to have said, \u201cthe rule liad always been, that if a man has actually paid, what the law would not have compelled him to pay, hut what in equity and\" \u2022conscience he ought, he cannot recover it back' again in an action for money had and received. But where money is paid under a mistake, which there was no ground to claim in conscience, the party may recover it back again by this kind of action.\u201d A\\&gt;&lt;ms, in his essays, treating upon mistakes of law, lays down the law to be, that where no natural obligation intervenes, even what is paid under a, mistake in law, may be' recovered back; and he refers, ija. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>support of Ins opinion, to certain decisions of Lord <em>Ecnyon </em>and Lord Mansfield, to the same effect, and observes, that he conceives it may now be positively stated, that this opinion is adopted in the <em>English </em>law. In <em>Evans </em>vs. <em>Llewellyn, </em>2 <em>Brown\u2019s Chancery Cases, 150, </em>it is decided, that a conveyance obtained from persons uninformed of their rights, should be set aside, though there was no actual fraud or imposition. In <em>Hunt vs. Rousmanier, </em>8 <em>Wheat. </em>214, the chief justice, in speaking of the case of <em>Lansdowne vs. Lansdowne, </em>says, if it be law, it&gt; has no inconsiderable hearing on this cause. There are certainly strong objections to this decision in other respects; but as a case in which relief has been granted, or a mistake in law, k cannot be entirely disregarded. He then goes on to say \u2014 Although we do not find the naked principle that relief may be granted on account of ignorance of law, asserted in the books, we find, no case, in which it has been decided, that a plain and acknowledged mistake in law, is beyond the reach of equity.\u2019*, We have here, then, the high authority of this most distinguished man, and eminent judge, that a party acting under a clear and unequivocal .mistake of his legal rights, is entitled to relief in a court of equitable jurisdiction; and that the doctrine of a court of chancery is not, as has been contended, that equity will not administer relief upon that ground, upon the principle that every man is bound to know the law. It is not intended to say, that the plea of <em>ignoranfia juris </em>would in all instances bo available in civil, cases, (in criminal it never can be,) because soma legal propositions are so plain and familiar, even to ordinary mind?, that it would he doing violence to probability to impuie ignorance in such cases; but it is only meant to say, that where the legal principle is confessedly doubtful, and one about which ignorancejnav well be supposed to exist, a person acting under a misapprehension of the law in such a case, shall not forfeit any of his legal rights, by reason of such mistake.) 8o <em>Newland, </em>in bis treatise on contracts, says, that Imstake or misapprehension of the law, is a ground of relief in equity; as if a man purchases his own, estate, and pays for it, the court will order the purchase money to be refunded, on the ground that there was apkin mistake. It appears then, from what has been observed 114 the foregoing opinion, that some of the most enlightened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>and celebrated men, whose characters are recorded in ]&amp;' dicial history, have given the sanction of their illustrious names to the doctrine, that no man, acting under a plain and acknowledged mistake of his legal rights, shall forfeit those rights, in consequence of such misapprehension. The. authorities in support of this principle, might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent, but it is deemed unnecessary further to enlarge upon the subject. It is the opinion of this court, that the decree of the court below be affirmed, with costs to the appellees. decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
