At the trial the plaintiff, (now appellee,) having deduced a title to the lot in dispute down to <em>Jiqidla </em>Brown, gave in evidence, that <em>Brown, </em>being- largely indebted to tlie <em>United States, </em>had removed from this state, (where lie had before resided,) sometime in the year 1802, .and had for several years last past resided in some part of Europe,, and that the <em>United States </em>caused and procured process of attachment to be laid upon said lot, a? the right and property of said <em>Brown, </em>and certain proceedings and judgment thereon to be had in the circuit court of the <em>United States </em>for the <em>Maryland District, </em>and also a <em>fieri facias </em>to be issued from said court on that judgment, and levied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\\:pcm said lot. A record of this attachment, proceedings, judgment and <em>fieri facias, </em>the plaintiff offered in evidence. By the record it appeared, that an action on the case was brought in the circuit court of the <em>U. 3. </em>for the fourth circuit in and for the District of <em>Maryland, </em>by the <em>United Si-ates </em>against <em>Brown, </em>on tho \u00a3lih of September 1816, and the writ of <em>capias ad respondendum, </em>which then issued returnable on the rth of November then next, was returned <em>\u00f1on est\u2018, </em>that an <em>atlas </em>writ of <em>capias ad respondendum </em>was issued on the 17th of March 1817, returnable on the lot of May following. On that day the last mentioned writ was also returned <em>non est, </em>and a declaration in the usual form was then filed on a bill of exchange, dated at <em>Baltimore </em>oil the \u00a32d of December 1801, drawn by <em>Brown </em>on Messrs. <em>Fan Staphorst </em>&amp; Cd. at <em>Amsterdam, </em>for 60,000 guilders, <em>Holland </em>currency, payable 60 days after sight to the order of <em>James Clarke. </em>The bill was endorsed by <em>Clarke, </em>payable to <em>Brown </em>and <em>Ilaekemaa, </em>or order, and by them endorsed to <em>B. 0,.vine's, </em>or order, who endorsed it to <em>T\u201e </em>Tucker, treasurer of the <em>United States, </em>and agent of tho <em>U. 8. </em>and to and for the use of the <em>O. 8. </em>The bill not being accepted was, on tbe 16th of March 1802, protested for nonacccptance and not being paid, on the U)th of May 1802, was protested for nonpayment. The <em>United States </em>filed in court the bill of exchange, and protest thereof for nauacceptance; and on the prayer for a writ of attachment against the lands, &amp;c. of <em>Brown, </em>according to the act of assembly of this state, &amp;c. to attach for them to the value of their damages and costsj and it appearing to-the court, that the <em>United Slates </em>had complied with the law as alleged, and having made proof to the court of their damages to the amount of 858,291 71, a writ of attachment was awarded against the lauds, &amp;c. of <em>Brown, </em>in the usual manner.. (2 <em>Harr. Eni. </em>78.) On the 2d of April 1810, a writ of attachment against the lands, &amp;c. of <em>Brown, </em>was issued in ihe usual form of an attachment on judgment after two <em>non esis, </em>wd\u00edh aclause of <em>scire facias, </em>&amp;c. <em>(d, Harr. Ent. </em>612,) returnable on the 1st day of May ensuing. On that day the marshal of tho district \u00a1nade this return of the attachment, viz, 4\u20184th April 1818, attached and appraised as per schedule.\u201d The schedule stated that the lands and tenements of <em>Brown </em>had been seized and taken by the marshal by virtue of tho writ of attachment, and being an-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>praised by four appraisers, &amp;c. were as follows, viz. \u201cA lot. on <em>SSarleet Street </em>in tbe city of Baltimore, fronting on said street about 66 feet; and about 166 feet deep to <em>Cow-pen Alley, </em>having \u00e1 three story brick house, and a two <em>story frame </em>store thereon, vizi 66 feet front, estimated at 8300 per foot, 819,800.\u201d Then follow other lots and improvements, with their value. This appraisement was signed and sealed by the appraisers. Brown, although solemnly called, did not appear, and on the prayer of the <em>United Stales </em>the lot and promises above described were condemned to satisfy the <em>United States </em>the damages and costs afore\u00f3aid, security being given in the usual manner. <em>{Harr. Enf. </em>03.) Upon this judgment of condemnation a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>issued on th\u00e9, 19th of May 1818, directed to, and, commanding the marshal o\u00ed th\u00e9 district, that of the lands and tenements above described and condemned, he should cause <em>ip </em>be \u00a1nade and levied the damages and costs aforesaid, to render to the <em>United St\u00e1tes, </em>&amp;c. on the <em>Tth </em>of November then next. At tbe return day the marshal made this return of the writ of <em>fieri faciass </em>\u201cI hereby certify to ihe Circuit Court within mentioned, that by virtue of the within writ to me directed, I have caused to be made* of the lands and tenemerits of the within named <em>Aguila </em>Brown, the sum of gl6,104 84, currerit money, which I have here ready to render to tlie within named <em>United Slates, </em>in part of the- damages, costs arid charges, iri the said within writ specified.

The plaintiff further gave iri evidence; that <em>Paul Bentalou, </em>esquire, the marshal of said District of <em>Maryland, </em>to whom said writ of <em>fieri fdcias </em>was directed, after having levied the same upon the sail! premises, gave this notice by advertisement of the sale of said premises: <em>li Marshal\u2019s sale. </em>By virtue and in pursuance of a writ of <em>fieri facias, </em>from tbe Circuit'Court of the <em>United States </em>for the fourth circuit, in the District of Maryland, to me directed, will be sold at public auction, for cash, on tbe premises, at four o\u2019clock in the afternoons on Monday tbe 8th June next, the following.

This deed, after reciting the judgment for attachment, the writ of attachment, return thereof, judgment of condemnation, and the <em>fieri facias </em>thereon issued in the manner as herein before stated, proceeded as follows: \u201cAnd whereas the said writ came to the hands of the said marshal, who in pursuance thereof, after giving due notice of the time and place, of sale, did set up and expose to sale, at public auction, on the premises, ail that part of the lot, piece or parcel of ground, taken on the writ of attachment aforesaid, which is contained within the metes and bounds, courses and distances following; that is to say, beginning,\u201d &amp;c. describing the lot as tbe same is described in the declaration in this cause. At which said sale, that is to say, on the 8th of June 1818 aforesaid, the above named <em>William Patterson </em>became the highest bidder for, and purchaser of the part of a lot of ground above particularly described, with the appurtenances, at and for the price or sum of \u00a79,900. In consideration of which said sum of money the marshal conveyed the premises to said Patterson; which said deed was duly acknowledged and recorded. The plaintiff further gave in evidence, that <em>Brown </em>was a merchant engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>commerce in the city of Baltimore; and, for the purpos\u00e9 <em>0f </em>showing that he had become, and had been declared a bankrupt, Under . and by virtue of the provisions of the statute of the <em>United Slates </em>in such case made and provided; the plaintiff produced, and offered to read in evidence, the petition; commission, qualification, depositions,- and other proceedings before the commissioners' of bankruptcy, duly appointed and qualified, and their judgment thereon, which are set forth; and also a deed from the commissioners aforesaid to <em>George Grundy </em>arid <em>'Joseph Thornburgh, </em>who had been duly appointed assignees of the creditors of said. Brown; which deed is also set out; \u2019and also gave in evidence a deed from said <em>Grundy </em>and <em>Thornhivrgh, </em>to the lessor of the plaintiff, dated the 27th of January 18\u00cd9, reciting that they had, at public sal\u00e9,- af-x ter due ri\u00e9tic\u00e9', &amp;c. sold the lot arid premises herein before described; to <em>William Patterson, </em>for the sum of $50,' it \" being the same lot and premises conveyed by <em>Bentalbu, </em>to <em>Patterson. </em>But the defendant objected to tlie admissibility of said petition, commission; qualification, depositions ? and other proceedings last meiitioiied; for the purpose last aforesaid; but the court, [ <em>Ward, At </em>J.j overruled- the ob'jection, and permitted said evidence to be read to'the jury, for' the purpose for which it was offered.1 The defendant excepted. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-3\"><em>\u00da. </em>The. defendant then prayed the opinion of the court*, and their direction to the jury, that upon the matters so as aforesaid given in evidence by the plaintiff, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover; which direction the court refusectto give.

Under <em>A </em>deed from <em>Grundy </em>and <em>Thornburgh, </em>assignees of <em>Brown, </em>a bankrupt; and 2d. Under .a deed from <em>Paul </em>Bentalou, marshal of the' <em>U. \u00e9. </em>in and for the District of <em>Maryland.- </em>They contended, 1. That the deed from the assignees was not evidence of title without-proving the act of bankruptcy committed, and that the record of the proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>mgs before the commissioners, being the only evidence offered for that purpose, was inadmissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-4\">2. That the deed from the marshal passed no title to the lessor of the plaintiff \u2014 1st. Because the circuit court of the <em>U. S. </em>for the fourth circuit in and for the district of Maryland, had no rightful jurisdiction of-the cause in which the judgment was given and the <em>fieri facias </em>issued, by virtue whereof the marshal sold the property, 2d. Because the proceedings in said cause, the record of, which was given in evidence by the plaintiff below, were irregular, erroneous and defective, and therefore wholly void. On the <em>first point </em>they referred to a decision of this court in <em>Wood vs. Grundy 'S? Thornburgh\u2019s Lessee, </em>at December term 1810, as conclusive that there must be proof of bankruptcy, independent of the proceedings of the commissioners. On the <em>second point </em>they contended, 1. That the record of the circuit court was <em>not </em>evidence, <em>as neither of the </em>parties in this case wsre parties in that proceedings and that, the general rule was, that a judgment was not conclusive except between parties and privies, that it might be evidence, but that it was not conclusive evidence. They referred to <em>Barr vs. Gratz, </em>4 <em>Wheat. </em>220. <em>Morgan\u2019s Lessee, vs. Davis, </em>2 <em>Harr. &amp; M\u2018Hen. </em>9 <em>Runn. Eject. </em>110. <em>Gilb.

That it was not <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a debt, \"and whenever it came before the court, eiiher incidentally or otherwise, might be examined into.

They referred to 1 <em>Com. Dig. </em>tit. <em>Attachment, </em>(I.) 604. <em>Davidson\u2019s Lessee vs. Beatty, </em>3 <em>Harr. 4 Mullen, 534. West vs. Hughes, </em>1 <em>LLarr. 4\" Johns. </em>6. <em>Shivers vs. </em>Wilson\u00a1, <em>B Lian. 4 Johns. </em>130. That the proceeding under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>tachment, being given by the act of 1715, <em>ch. </em>40, is conf\u00edn\u00bb, ed by the 2d section of that act to inhabitants or residents in the state; and the 3d section applies to a different class of persons, absent out of the province, where a short note, &amp;e. was to be left. That this proceeding was under the <em>second </em>section of the act, and did not take in the case of <em>Brown, </em>who was not an inhabitant or resident of the state when the writ of <em>capias ad respondendum </em>issued against him, at the suit of the <em>United States, </em>out of the <em>circuit court </em>of the <em>U. Si </em>that court seeking to carry into effect that act, and which court, they contended, had no jurisdiction thereof, being limited by the subject and character of the parties. That the party plaintiff\" should he one who 'might be a defendant, and here the <em>United States </em>were plaintiffs, and were not liable t\u00f3 be sued, so that the attachment law could not apply to the <em>United States. </em>To show that the circuit court had a limited jurisdiction, they referred to <em>Turner vs. The Bank of North America, </em>4 <em>Dall. Rep. </em>8. By the judiciary act 1789, <em>ch. </em>20, <em>s. </em>11, the circuit court had no jurisdiction ip civil cases, unless the defendant was a resident of the' district in which the court was held. Where the circuit* court'act upon the at- , tachment law, it must appear* that the party is absent out of the <em>U. S. </em>or that court has no jurisdiction. <em>Hollingsworth vs. Adams, </em>2 <em>Dall. Rep. </em>396. ' If the circuit 'court had no right to act upon' the attachment law, no title accrued under the judgment of- condemnation. ' In <em>Shivers vs. Wilson, </em>the character of the' plaintiff was looked at; so, here the character of the defendant must be looked at, to see if he comes within the description of, persons pointed but in the <em>second </em>section of the act of 1715,\u2019' He was neither an inhabitant, nor an'absentee who was to return; iand if he ivas liable to b\u00e9proc\u00e9eded against, he came within the <em>third </em>section of tliat act. 2. There w\u00e1s, no proof of fhe cause of actkmby the plaintiffs; neither the hand-writing of the drawer i nor of any of .the endorsors of the bill of exchange, was proved.' There was n\u00f3 evidence that the bill had b\u00e9\u00e9ti presented 'for payment, and none that the debt was due. ! The bill was endorsed in blank, and, no suit could be .'maintained, thereon by \u2018the <em>United States. </em>They referred t\u00f3 <em>Ringgold vs. Tyson, </em>in this court, at December term 1810, and\u2019\u2019 <em>Hudson vs. Goodwin, </em>5 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>115, In the proceedings there is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>-emission of an entire term between the judgment for attachment, and the issuing the writ. 3. There was no return made by the marshal to the clause of <em>scire facias </em>included in the writ of attachment. Nor, was it stated whether the property attached was in the possession of a garnishee, or any other person. Nor was any garnishee summoned. 4. There was no copy of a declaration or short note left, as required by the act. 5. The act confines the attachment to goods, chattels and, credits, and cannot be extended by construction to lands and tenements\" under the statute \"of 5 <em>George </em>M; and if Hot, then lands and tenements were riot liable to be attached. 6. The return to the <em>fieri facias </em>is defective. The marshal returned that be made of the lands and. tenements of Brown, &amp;c. not showing that they were the lands and tenements mentioned in the <em>fieri facias. ' </em>Nor is it stated that they were sold to the lessor of. the plaintiff, which must appear by the return, and cannot be supplied by the marshal\u2019s deed, which gives no title without the aid of a, proper return to the <em>fieri </em>facias\u201e</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-4\"><em>Taney zn\u00fc.Magrudtr, </em>for the Appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alx\">stated, that the-record of the circuit court had been treated by the counsel for the appellant as if it was under the review of. this court on an appeal. When the act of 1715, <em>ch. </em>40, passed, goods, chattels and credits only, were to be affected under it; but under the statute,of 5 <em>Geo. </em>II, lands and tenements were liable to debts, by construction put upon that statute by our courts; and the same principle which led. to that construction, led to its introduction into the attachment law; and since then it has been the uniform settled practice to attach and condemn lands and tenements. In <em>Davidson\u2019s Lessee vs. Beatty, </em>3 <em>Harr. &amp; M\u2018Hen. </em>600, 608, 612, 616, it was admitted by the counsel who argued the case, and by the court, that lands and tenements were liable to be attached and condemned. They contended, 1. That if the judgment,of the circuit court was <em>res enter alios acta, </em>and was not evidence, there was no mode by which a party, deriving title under such a judgment and <em>fieri facias, </em>could establish it. But that the judgment might be offered in evidence, they referred to <em>Barr vs. Gratz\u2019s heirs, </em>4 <em>Wheat.

By the judiciary act, <em>ITS9, ch. </em>20, <em>s. </em>14, the court may issue all process which may be necessary; and by the 34th section, the laws of the respective states are to be the rules of decision for the government of the <em>United States. Robinson vs. Campbell, </em>3 <em>Wheaton, </em>212. Under the act of 1715, t'po\u2019i two <em>non ests, </em>the plaintiff may proceed against all description of persons, and it was so decided by the general court in <em>Willis vs. Pearce, Garn. of Garrigues, </em><footnotemark><em>(a.)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If the act admired \u00f3f a different constriction, how can the fact be come at that <em>Brown </em>was not a resident of the otate? The record does not show that he was not a resident. The writ and declaration states him to be \u201clate of the <em>Maryland </em>district, merchant,\u201d winch means, that lie LI ?,n the district-according to our practice against all residents of the state. There is nothing in the act which sanctions the principle, that a party who touid not be \u00bb\u25a0 defendant did <em>mi come </em>withit\u00ed the provisions of the act. The proof of the canse of action need not be set out in. the proceedings; \u00bf11 that was necessary was, that the court should be satisfied that the money was due, and to satisfy llunnselves of that, they could resort to viva voce proof. The record slates that the <em>U. 3. </em>made proof of their de - s\u00abc,isd. This was sufficient, and such are the forms in 2 <em>Harr. Ent. </em>78, 79, under the act of 1715.

The practice is to lay the attachment on the property, although no person is in possession; but where any person is in possession, then to take notice of the <em>scire facias. Campbell vs. Morris, </em>3 <em>Harr. &amp; M\u2018Hen. </em>535. <em>Davidson\u2019s Lessee vs. Beatty, Ibid </em>594. It was not necessary that the attachment should have issued, returnable to the terni succeeding, the judgment; there is nothing iri the act which required it. ' The blank endorsement bn a bill of exchange, by the decision of this court, must be filled up before verdict. Hero there was no verdict. It is an objection to form, and has no foundation in reason; The <em>English </em>decisions are opposed to that of this court. Where the judgment is by confession, or by default, no advantage can be taken of such an objection, were it a valid one. The endorsement need not be filled up unless where <em>non assumpsit </em>is pleaded, and the plaintiff is put to the proof of his <em>cause of </em>action. The practice of the courts of this state, under the attachment law, so long and uniformly acted under, is evidence of the law. They referred to <em>M\u2018Keen vs. Delancy, 5 Cranch, </em>22, as a case in which proof of the practice was required, and that being obtained, it was considered the law. All the objections, previous to the judgment, are unfounded; and whether the judgment ia correct or not, or whether the writ of <em>fieri facias </em>was regularly issued, cannot now be inquired into. The case stated admits the sale of the property by the marshal, and the purchase by the lessor of the plaintiff. And the law is, that the sheriff need not return the execution; and this court has said, in <em>Boreing\u2019s Lessee vs. Lemmon, </em>5 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns, </em>225, that the legal estate, in the land sold under a <em>fieri facias, </em>is transferred, by the sale of the sheriff, to the vendee, by operation of law; and that a deed from the sheriff' is unnecessary to vest the legal estate. If a. deed was not necessary, a return by the marshal was unnecessary, as it need not be made. This is the law of <em>England. </em>2 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>tit. <em>Execution, </em>710, 740. The deed, without any thing else, is evidence of title, there must be some writing on the subject. 7 <em>Bac. Ab. Appendix, </em>tit.

If the return is the only evidence of title, then the deed was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>unnecessary, and a nullity; and if the return is defective, the deed cannot aid it. There is no authority on which to ground the principle, that the return is necessary, and that the return alone vests the title to the property sold. The act of 1813, <em>ch. </em>102, <em>s. </em>3, 4, shows that a deed from the sheriff is to be giveil. It is a legislative exposition of the law on that subject. If the deed does not convey the title what operation has it? Is it of no value unless it cooperates with the return? The doctrine in <em>New-York </em>is, that the sale by the sheriff is to be established by legal proof, and that it may be proved as other facts are to be proved. They referred to <em>Jackson vs. Bartlett, </em>8 Johns. <em>Rep. </em>361. <em>Jackson vs. Bush, </em>10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>223. <em>Jackson vs. Rosevelt, </em>13 <em>Johns.

Ca. 153. </em>It is not the sheriff\u2019s sale nor his deed which vests the title in the purchaser, but the law. The return of the sheriff may be evidence, but the sale and payment of the purchase money may be proved in any other way. Courts have protected the title of purchasers of property at sheriff\u2019s sales, notwithstanding the <em>fieri facias </em>be erroneous, or the judgment on which it issued reversed. <em>Jeanes vs. Wilkins, </em>1 <em>Ves. </em>195. 2 <em>Bac.

He contended that the judgment was to be considered as a judgment of a foreign court. It was a special proceeding, under a special authority, which was to be strictly pursued, and differed from ordinary proceedings in other cases in the ordinary course of <em>the </em>court\u2019s jurisdiction. By the law of <em>England </em>a judgment of a foreign court of admiralty having jurisdiction, is conclusive, because all the world have notice. But if the sentence professes to be made on particular grounds which, are set forth, but which appear not to warrant the condemnation, the sentence will not be conclusive as to such facts. The sentence of a domestic court is conclusive within its sphere. But the judgments of foreign courts, acting out of their jurisdiction, are not conclusive, but examinable^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>So of \u00e1 domestic court acting beyond its jurisdiction. A court exercising general jurisdiction may be vested with special powers irt particular cases; and they must be exercised within the sphere Ot these special powers. To seo that they hav\u00e9 been so exercised, may be examined into. It has been urged; that the proceeding under the attachment law of 1715, was according to the course of the (common law; using process to compel appearance. When the defendant is in court, the proceedings are according to the course of the common law; but when the attachment is resorted to; the cours\u00e9 of the common law is abandoned.33y the cours\u00e9 of the commoti law a jiiry may pass on the (claim, t\u00edere it is not permitted, but a judgment is ren-i, dered without the intervention of a jury; This proceeding is to affect the property of the defendant \u2014 a proceeding <em>in rent. </em>The common law course is \u00bfgainst the person,'and hot the property, until the defendant has had an opportunity to defend himself. This is an essential departure from the common law. The writ of attachment is not an ex\u00e9c\u00fatioh, and it was so decided in <em>Davidson's Lessee vs. </em>Beatty, 3 <em>Harr. &amp; M\u2018Hen. </em>534, and <em>Owings vs. Norwood's </em>Lessee, 2 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>96. It is in the. h\u00e1t\u00fcr\u00e9 of mesne process; and a judgment of condemnation, is not a common law judgment. It is a new and irregular proceeding; unknown to the common law; and grows out oif some authority given by the statute, coiitrary to the common law| and being so given, the coilrt must conform Strictly to the st\u00f3ute; If th\u00e9 sentence of a court of admiralty, v hicli ife supposed to act according to the law of nations, may be impeached, there can be no reason Why a domestic judgment should not. Suppose a man was tried and convicted in <em>Baltimore, </em>where the offence was hot Committed within the jurisdiction of the court, would not sucha judgment be examinable? if So, there is ntf distinction in prindiple between that case and the one before the court; There is no reason why a person, n'ot a party to the proceedings, should not take advantage' of th\u00e9 errors .th\u00e9rein. The defendant here is in possession, and it may be that he is so for a valuable consideration, and has a good title. But the-proceeding in this case was under a special authority, to which the general law does not apply. In <em>Shivers vs. Wilson, </em>this court treated the proceeding as a nullity; and, in <em>Kempe's Lessee vs. </em>Kennedy, 5 <em>Cranch, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>173, the supreme court held, that where a court of general jurisdiction acted within the sphere of its authority, its proceedings were not examinable yvhen coming before them collaterally. But that where the jurisdiction was limited, it must be shown, upon the, record itself, that the court acted within the sphere of its authority. So also in 2 <em>Esp. Dig. </em>12. <em>Pullen vs. </em>Birbeck, 1 <em>Ld. </em>Raym. 718; and 2 <em>Salk. </em>563, S. C. Where a special authority is delegated, and the acts under it are not legally and specially in pursuance of it, they are void; and- where acts are void, all persons may take advantage of them. <em>Morgan's Lessee vs. Davis, </em>2 <em>Harr. &amp; M\u2018Hen. </em>9. The. proceedings here are examinable in the same manner as. a.foreign judgment is. The state courts were foreign courts, before the adoption of the constitution of the <em>U. S. </em>By the constitution some change, was effected, so as to point out the <em>manner </em>ia which <em>the </em>judgments, &amp;c. of one state, should be evidence in another state. But the courts remain foreign, to each other as they were before. A judgment in a court of the <em>U. S. </em>must be proved in the state courts in the same manner as foreign judgments are proved, and they are to he received and treated as such, and, are only <em>prima fade </em>evidence. <em>Mills vs. Duryee, 7 Cranch, </em>483. <em>Hampton vs. M\u2018Connell, </em>3 Wheaton, 234. Here the judgment, and proceedings under it, are offered in evidence as an essential link in a chain of title, and it is examinable in the same, manner that a conveyance would be, to see that it is correct in all its parts. There is no distinction, between the judgment coming before the court, collaterally and directly^ Here it is brought in to give effect to the plaintiff\u2019s title,, so that it comes directly before the court. There is no reason why.-tjiq court should ba precluded from looking into the judgment more in. the one case than in the other. The questions decided in <em>Kempe\u2019s Lessee vs. Kennedy, 5 </em>Cranch, 185, &amp; <em>Pratt vs. Law &amp; Campbell, </em>9 <em>Cranch, </em>495, are not similar te the one before this court. In <em>Barr vs. Gratz, </em>4 <em>Wheaton, </em>220, the court did not say that the, judgment was not examinable. Because it was <em>prima fade </em>evidence it does not follow that, it was conclusive evitalice. This case shows, that where the judgment \u00cd8 brought in collaterally, as a muniment of title, it is <em>prima fade </em>evidence. In <em>Tarleton vs. Tarleton, </em>4 <em>Maule </em>&amp; Selw. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>21, there was no objection to the jurisdiction of the court in <em>Granada, </em>which did what it had a right to do; and the court of K. B. was called upon to enlarge the sum awarded, which could not be done unless on appeal'. In <em>Keilburn vs. </em>Woodworth, 5 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>39, 41, a judgment in <em>Massachusetts </em>was offered in evidence in <em>New-York; </em>and although it was a good judgment in <em>Massachusetts, yet </em>the court in <em>New-York </em>refused to receive it <em>os prima facie </em>evidence. This authority -is in favour of the appellant. This judgment is examinable on the ground of its being a foreign judgment, andits also being under a special authority in derogation o\u00ed the common law. In the return to the <em>fieri facias </em>there is no designation or description of the property sold. The deed states, that the land was sold to the lessor of the plaintiff, and this is the only proof of the sale. There cannot be two modes of proof to supply defects in the return to a <em>fieri facias. </em>The return <em>is the </em>only, legal evidence of the sale; and it is the only evidence of title under the sale. There is no principle of law which says, that a title to land can be made out by parol evidence., This was attempted in <em>Maydwell vs. Carroll, </em>in this court, at December, term 1813. Parol evidence cannot supply the defect'of a written title. The return of a sheriff is made under oath, but his. deed is not, and cannot be entitled to the same weight as/his return. In <em>Boreing\u2019s Lessee vs. Lemmon, </em>the sheriff\u2019s return, was special, that he had sold the lands to the. defendant. The court did not in that case say that the deed was evidence of title. The doctrine that a <em>fieri facias, </em>under which lands are. seized and. sold, need not be returned, is not applicable, to our system of laws. It may do in, <em>England, </em>where personal, property only can be seized, and which passes, by delivery. It is not so here where a fee simple is. sold, and where all titles, to land are matters of record. ,</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a.)\">\n<p id=\"b199-5\"> The case here referred to of <em>Willis vs Pearce, Garnishee of Garrigues, n </em>the general court at.

But that in both the writs of <em>capias ad respondendum, </em>the declaration, and th\u00e9.writ of attachment, he is styled <em>Jlquila </em>Brown, <em>late of the Maryland District. </em>The bill of exchange, on which the suit was founded, is dated at <em>Baltimore, </em>and the declaration charges that Brouni was i-esiding in the <em>Maryland District, </em>and there carrying on the business of a merchant, at the time the bill was made. So that whatever may have been the fact in-relation t\u00f3 his residence, it does, technically at least, appear upon the face of the proceedings that he was a resident of the state, and there is nothing in the case from which the contrary appears, or can be inferred; and if his being a resident tvas necessary to the jurisdiction of the court, is not the style and character given him in the proceedings <em>prima fade </em>sufficient <em>i\u00f3 </em>confer aiid sustain that jurisdiction? And what is there in the act of assembly requiring of a plaintiff to make proof of the residence of the defendant by affidavit, or otherwise, or to do any thing more than wad done in the Case of tile <em>United States </em>against <em>Brown </em>to give jurisdiction to the court? No mode of proof is pointed out, nor any description of proof expressly required; all that is said is, that no attachment shall issue, where the defendant is a resident of the state, before a second <em>non 'est inventus </em>has been returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">But is it true that an attachment can only be awarded under the <em>second </em>section against the goods, &amp;e. of a resident defendant? The act is indeed silent as to foreigners <em>eo nomine, </em>but is it not prohibitory only as respects residents? The language used is, not that no attachment shall issue unless the party defendant be a resident of the state, or if he be a foreigner or nonresident, but the words are, \u201cthat from henceforth no attachment shall issue out of any court of this province before a writ or summons be first made out, upon which writ, if the party defendant be an inhabitant or resident within this province,\u201d &amp;c. Then provision is made for the return of a first and a second <em>non est inventus, </em>before an attachment shall be awarded. But it is not provided that an attachment shall not be awarded if he be not an inhabitant or resident; and in the absence of any such provision, the construction found to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>given to that section of the act by the .different coiifts of the state is; that oii the return of two <em>non ests, </em>an attachment will li\u00e9 against the property of the defendant, whether he he in <em>fact </em>a resident or <em>not, </em>and the practice has been so long settled as to command respect whatever would be the construction; if it was now <em>vexata quesiio. </em>it is. also objected, 2d, that there was not sufficient proof made of the cause of action to warrant the issuing of an attachment. 3d; That the attachment awarded is against the lands, tenements, goods, chattels and credits, of <em>Brown, </em>whereas the act of assembly only authorises an attachment \u2019against the goods, chattels and credits. 4th. That a term was suffered to intervene between the time of issuing the attachment, and the term at which it was awarded. And 5th. That it do\u00e9s not appear that there was any service by the marshal of the <em>scire facias </em>contained in the writ of attachment, no notice being taken of any such service in hist return of the attachment. The <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>objections have nothing in them; with respect to the former, the act of assembly prescribes no particular proof, but leaves ifc entirely in the breast of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\">The bill of exchange on which the suit was brought, was exhibited to the court, and appears in the proceedings, and in the judgment for the writ of attachment it is recited, that the <em>United States </em>made proof to the court of their damages to the sum of g58,201 71; and with regard to the latter, it is sufficient to say, that lands were not liable to execution for debt at the time of the passage of the act, and not being\u2019in terms embraced by it, were not subject to. attachment. But under the construction given <em>to </em>the sta-, tute 5 <em>Geo. </em>II, <em>ch. </em>7, lands became liable to be taken and .sold by <em>fieri facias </em>in the same manner as goods and chattels, and have ever since been uniformly held to be subject to. attachment by all the tribunals of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The attachment in question, therefore, was properly awarded under the circumstances of the case, jurisdiction being given to the court on the face of the proceedings. If it were otherwise, property acquired in this state by foreigners residing without the <em>United States, </em>would be completely protected against their creditors, there being no other mode of reaching it, and when they are placed in no worse situation than citizens, and their property is subject-pd only to the same process, it is no cause of complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>that they are styled and treated as citizens in the foiras of \u2019proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">As to the <em>fourth </em>and <em>fifth </em>objections, the attachment Should regularly have been issued as of the tdrm at which it was awarded, and it was the duty of the marshal to have served the <em>scire facias </em>in the attachment on the person or persons who were found in possession of the property attached, and to have certified such service, or if th\u00bf property was unoccupied, to have made a corresponding return. Rut though the intervening of a term before the issuing of the attachment, and the negligence of the marshal, were irregularities in the proceedings, the judgment of condemnation is not therefore void, (whatever disposition might be made of it by an appellate court,) the circuit court being a court of record of competent jurisdiction, from whose decisions an appeal or writ of error lies to the supreme court of the <em>United States, </em>and is not an <em>inferior court </em>according to the technical sense of the term as used in <em>England. </em>It is not like the case of special and extraordinary powers given by statute to a court in relation to a subject matter of which such court has no jurisdiction independent of the statute, but derives its authority to act upon facts arising <em>in pais </em>entirely from the statute giving the power, and prescribing the mode of proceedings The act upon which the .proceedings of the cirpuit court were founded, professes to give no new jurisdiction, blit only to regulate and limit the powers of courts already possessed of full and complete jurisdiction of the whole subject matter. The preamble is in these words: \u201cWhereas it is highly expedient to settle the manner of proceedings on attachments, and limiting the extent of them, and to provide what shall be levied on such attachments aud executions. \u201d It belongs to the sovereign authority of a state to prescribe\u2019 the manner of proceeding in its courts of justice, and to make such provisions for the recovery .of debts as the legislature may deem most expedient. The- proceeding by attachment under that law is only process to compel the appearance of a defendant to a suit before brought and depending in a court of competent jurisdiction, whose person cannot be reached by the process of the court, of which it comes in aid, and without which the plaintiff would be without remedy| and it is not a proceeding in derogation of the <em>principles </em>of the common law, but rather in mitigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>of the severity of the common law in favour of defendant??' By the common law, where a defendant was summoned; and would not appear, his goods were liable to be proceeded against by attachment and distress infinite, and <em>the </em>goods seized were forfeited to the king; and where the defendant was abroad or kept out of the way so that he could not be arrested, the plaintiff might proceed against him to outlawry, which was also attended with a forfeiture to the king of all his goods and chattels; The proceeding to outlawry, or by <em>distringas, </em>was to compel the appearance of the defendant; and so with the attachment here, it is only a proceeding against the defendant\u2019s goods, to compel his appearance, with this difference in favour of the defendant, that a year and a day is given him to come in and appear to the original action, and if he can defeat it, to have a return of his property without any forfeiture to tire state. And it would seem, from the language of the preamble; that the act was passed with a view to a mitigation; bf the rigour of the common law; and an outlawry, though illegal because the party was beyond sea, cannot be set aside by a third person in a collateral action, but is voidable alone by the party himself, and that only <em>sub modo </em>by his appearing and putting in bail. 6 <em>Com. Dig. </em>(C 2,) 488. <em>Simonds vs. Parmiter, </em>1 <em>Wm. Blk. Rep. </em>20. And in the case of <em>The Marshalsea, Coke, 77, </em>it is laid down, \u201cthat if the court of common pleas hold plea in debt, trespass, &amp;c. without an original, it is not <em>void, </em>for they are judges of those pleas, and it cannot be said that the proceeding is <em>coram non judice,\u201d </em>and surely in such case the irregularity is as great as any appearing in the proceeding before the circuit court. And in the same hook, <em>76, </em>it is said, \u201cThat if the court of common pleas, in a plea of debt, awards a <em>capias </em>against a Duke, Earl, &amp;c. which by <em>law </em>doth not li.e against them, and that appears in the writ itself; and if the sheriff arrests them by force of the <em>capias, </em>although the writ be against law, notwithstanding, inasmuch as \"the court has jurisdiction of the cause,- the sheriff is excused;\u2019\"5 which could not be if the proceeding was <em>void.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">With regard to the <em>second point </em>raised, \u201cthat the judgment of the circuit court is a foreign judgment and not conclusive but examinable,\u201d the long and well established' rule in <em>England </em>is, that foreign judgments are not conclusive, but are always 'examinable, where the' parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u00ab\u00bf\u00a1aiming the- benefit of them apply to the courts of that country to enforce, them; as, if an action of ccbt or <em>assumpsit </em>be brought apon such a judgment, it is onjy <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the debt, and may be impeacheid, by the other party; but that the judgments of foreign courts of competent jurisdiction, when coming incidentally in question, have the same force and effect with domes,tic judgments. .That principle was recognized and adopted; in <em>Pennsylvania </em>in <em>Repelje vs. Emery, 2 Dall. </em>231, and in the supreme court of the <em>United States, </em>in <em>Croudson &amp; others, vs. Leonard, </em>4 <em>Cranch, </em>434; and the. same principle applying with equal force in this state, the, same rule will be adopted here. Treating then the judgment of the circuit court as the judgment of a foreign tribunal-of;compefent jurisdiction, it stands upon the same footing, that a domestic judgment offered at the trial for the same purpose would have done, and was not liable to be impeached in the <em>Baltimore </em>county court for any mere irregularity, though such irregularity should be a sufficient ground for reversal in an appellate court, unless the <em>Baltimore </em>county court could have erected itself into a court of errors to, revise and correct the proceedings of the circuit court, nor can it be here. But under the peculiar structure of our political system,, it should not he treated as a foreign judgment. The constitution and laws of the <em>United States </em>are the supreme law of this state; the laws of this state furnish rules of decision for the circuit court, and causes commenced in the state courts may be removed for trial in-, to the circuit court. The citizens of; the state are return j ed and serve as jurors in that court, and-axe amenable to its process; and their properly, real- and- personal, is.liable to seizure and sale by the marshal of the district, under executions issued upon the judgments of-that court, with other attributes of a domestic court, belonging, to that tribunal, which place it on a ground very different from, that-of a foreign court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\">This judgment is also objected to on the ground-, that it <em>is res inter alios aeta, </em>the appellant not being a party to the proceedings. But ffie doctrine that judgments and decrees are only evidence in suits between parties and privies, though generally true, is not applicable to this case;, th e judgment of the circuit court being introduced, not as binding per <em>qe, </em>upon the rights of the appellant, but only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>as a document connected with the chain of the appellee's title, and is no more obnoxious to objection, than a deed from <em>Brown, </em>or any other title papers, equally <em>res inter, alios acta, </em>would bp,' Without showing that judgment, under the authority of which the sale by the marshal was. made to the lessor of the plaintiff, the validity of that sale, would not be established'; and tQ.reject it, would-be in effect to decide that a title derived under a sale by a marshal or sheriff is of no validity in a suit by or against a. stranger, and to render the law in relation to sales of land, by <em>fieri facias, </em>worse than a mockery.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">It has further been contended- in argument, that the lessor of the plaintiff acquired no title by his purchase from, the niarsljal, on the ground \u2014 1st. That a <em>fieri facias </em>issued upon an. erroneous judgment confers no authority upon the officer to. sell; and 2d. That the marshal\u2019s return on, the <em>fieri facias </em>is imperfect and void. The answer to the first oethese positions, is, that if it sho.uld be admitted that there are irregularities in. the proceedings under the attachment, which would on appeal to the proper tribunal be sufficient cause for a reversal of the judgment, yet that judgment is not only not void, but has not been reversed, and is still in full force, and cannot h\u201d impeached by a stranger, in another court, in this collateral way. If it was not merely voidable, but absolutely void <em>ab initio, </em>a different question would be presented; But being a subsisting judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not a mere nullity, the <em>fieri facias </em>clothed the marshal with authority to sell, and if tlje judgment had afterwards been in fact reversed, the title of the purchaser would not thereby have been defeated. The law will not permit even the party himself, who has suffered his land to be sold uncier an erroneous judgment, to disturb the tifie of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, by afterwards procuring the judgment to be reversed! If it was otherwise, there would be no security to purchasers, and writs of execution would be of little effect, as few Would incur the risk attending such purchases. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The objection to the return of the <em>fieri facias^ </em>stands on Jio better ground. It is true that the return does not set out the name of the purchaser, and fhat no description is given of the property sold, for which reason it might perhaps have been set aside on motion. But it is not the return of the officer that gives title to ^ purchaser, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>'previous sale; which was decided by this court in the case of <em>Boreing\u2019s Lessee vs. Lemmon, 5 Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>223. And it would be of dangerous consequence to <em>boya fide </em>purchasers, if after having paid their money for property sold under competent and legal authority, they should be at the mercy of officers who might malee imperfect returns of executions, or if they pleased snake no returns at all. But a sheriff\u2019s sale of land being within the statute o\u00ed frauds, some memorandum in writing is necessary toba made. It is therefore always right and proper, for the security and protection of purchasers, that in addition to a deed for the laud sold, there should be a special return of the execution, particularly describing the premises, and setting \u00abat the name of the purchaser, either of which, though riot operating to, pass the title, would be safe and \u00abcompetent evidence of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">fndhis case the sale by the marshal, was of ihe specific property condemned according to the act of assembly, for which he passed his deed to the lessor of the plaintiff, containing a sufficient description of the premises sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">3 <em>VD </em>GHENT ArEIIUIF\u00bb.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
