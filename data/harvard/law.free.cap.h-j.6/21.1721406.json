The testator wen.t to <em>Edinburgh, </em>married Miss Steries,, by whom he. had issue,, and. lived some years,. The will was not admitted to'probat till, th.e year 1808, In. 181,3 letters of administration <em>de bonis non,, </em>on the estate of the testator, were granted to. <em>Thomas Reliman, </em>who, as \u00ab\u00abmV. <em>d. b. n\u00b0 </em>petitioned, the chancellor to. appoint a trustee to sell. the. real estate Of the deceased-, and the chancellor passed a, decree to that effect at February term 18178 In August 1817, the trustee reported, that under' the said, decree he had sold the property;, and. that Joseph <em>Morton, </em>the appel-: lee, became the purchaser,.

Because the marriage and. birth of a child, revoked the will of <em>Westencys. </em>He cited <em>Rob. on. Wills% </em>395, ' 2. Because the chancellor was not authorised to direct the sale at the instance of the administrator <em>de bonis, non, </em>under the act of 1785, <em>ch. </em>72, <em>s. </em>4, 3. Because, the appellant, not being a party to the proceedings, and claiming under no person who was a party,, his title, could not be inquired into in this summary way,' at the in-., stance of the , purchaser, under the chancellor\u2019s decree. 4. Because in no, case can process, of' this, description be, issued, unless the title, to the property has been first decided by the court, and the decree directs a safe to be made of the. property, and naming the property, or giving it some other certain description. This decree only directed' a sale of the estate directed by the will of <em>J. W. </em>to be sold, and there is no pi-opf in this case that <em>J. Wi </em>was seized of the land no.w in- dispute,, at- the time he made his will. 5. The whole proceedings, und.er the will is erroqeous, because, if the will was valid, it appears by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the proof In the case that Mrs. Westeneys, (formerly Miss <em>Meries,) </em>who was io have the proceeds of sale, survived her husbaud, and chose to hold the land.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-4\"><em>Shaw </em>and <em>Ridout, </em>for the \u00e1ppell\u00e9e.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY\">p\u00c1s the court did hot take into view any of the points insisted on by the appellant\u2019s counsel, except that relative to the power of the court of chancery to issue the injunction referred to, the authorities referred to by the counsel for the \u00e1ppellee are omitted. J They insisted, that the chancellor could not da otherwise than cause possession of the premises to be delivered to the purchaser. That the appellant had not such an interest as to enable him to become \u00e1 party to these proceedings, and to entitle him to an appeal. Ills appeal is from the issuing of a judicial process of the court; and not from the decree confirming the sale which had been made of the premises. <em>1</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\"><em>Magruder, </em>in reply, was stopped by the court.-</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b31-7\">Dorset, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHs\">This court, in reversing the decree of <em>th\u00e9 </em>chancellor, so far from feeling a disposition to interfere with the acknowledged jurisdiction of ihe court of chancery. Wish to preserve it unimpaired. And in this case they think there is no authority to warrant his decision,'and that the principle involved in it, would in pi-actice not only be inconvenient, but subversive of the established modes of deciding the rights of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">That a decree in equity for the sale of lands, to pay debts or legacies, or for the purpose of distributing the proceeds among those entitled, is a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>cannot be questioned, and that the chancellor has the power of enforcing such a decree, by ordering the possession to be delivered to the purchaser under the decree in certain cases; cannot be denied. The exercise of this power, in relation to all such persons as were parties to the proceedings, and whose rights have been determined by the decree, is essential to the full administration of justice; for as the decree,\u2019 and sale under it, passes the right, it is but just and equitable that the possession should accompany it, as part of the title. Anri upon principle it would seem fit, that persons who come into the possession of rhe land <em>pendente </em>lite, diaiming title to it under the parties io the bill, or some of them, should stand in the same predicament with thosd whom they represent in point of interest, on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ffiat their condition cannot be b\u00e9tter thart that' of those under whose authority they have obtained the possession. T\u00e9 send the purchaser, under a decree of the court of chancery; in such cases, to a legal forum; to clothe his title with the poss\u00e9ssion, would be denying to that court the power bf efficiently enforcing rights which had passed <em>in remjudicatam. </em>But the c\u00e1se now before the court is essentially different; As the appellant, <em>Tongue, </em>was not a. party to the original decree, his interest cannot be affected by it; Besides, he was in the possessiori of the land, at the time the original petiticin ivas filed; -claiming, \u00e1dvers\u00e9ly to the will of <em>John Westeniys, </em>under an escheat warrant. From such a possession he could not be removed, until his title was adjudged to be defective iff the regular and established cours\u00e9 of judicial proceeding. Such an interest cannot, consistently with the principles of our jurisprudence, be the subject of inquiry, and decided on, in a summary manner, by' w\u00e1y of motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">It would be both unn\u00e9c\u00e9ss\u00e1ry arid improper, in the view which the court has taken of this subject, to decide whe-* ther the will of <em>John Westeneys </em>was revoked by liis Subsequent marriag\u00e9, and the birth of a child, \u00f3f wh\u00e9tlier th\u00e9 lands were fesch\u00e9atabl\u00e9i It is sfifficierit for lis to decide, that altlio\u00fcgh the court of chancery, in many instances, has jurisdiction to enforce its own decrees, by giving possession! without sending the purchaser1 to a court of law, there t&lt;S seek redress by an action bf ejectment, y\u00e9t that this case' is not one of that description!</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">The court do not mean to. intimate an opinion how far a third person, who comes into the possession during the pendency of the suit in equity, claiming adversely to the litigating parties, can after a decree and sale, be removed, in a summary way, at the instance of the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">DECREE REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
