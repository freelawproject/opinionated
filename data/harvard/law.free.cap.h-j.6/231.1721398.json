The counsel of the plaintiff also produced an attested copy of said bond, certified by the register of wills of <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county} as taken from the original bond fried and recorded in his office. The defendant-then proved by said register of wills of <em>Prince- George\u2019s </em>county,- arid who was register before and has been ever ifinc\u00e9 the year 1812, that the second bond on fil\u00e9 in his office, purporting to b\u00e9 an administration bond on the estate Of <em>Jam Fishwich, </em>and bearing date the 9th of November' \u00cd816, was delivered to him by <em>John M. Hepburn, </em>the administrator On said estate, during the recess of the orphans court, and without any application having been made either to the court or register, by any person interested in said estate, for additional or counter security, and was consequently never called for or acted upon, or sanctioned by the court; and at the time <em>Hepburn </em>delivered to the register the second bond, <em>the </em>register liad some' conversation with him3 but which he could not now recollect. That this bond, being found in the office, was recorded by a deputy in the office, without any orders from the register or the', court. That he did not recollect that he had any instruction from <em>Hepburn </em>at the time the bond was delivered to him'to record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>it as an administration bond. That on the 6th of May 1812, <em>Hepburn </em>filed a bond, which the register produced, dated the 6th of May 1812, executed to the state by said Hepburn, with <em>Jane Hepburn </em>\u00e1nd <em>John S. Brookes </em>his sureties, conditioned for the performance, by said <em>Hepburn, </em>of the office of administrator of said Fishwick, and on the same day obtained letters of administration on the estate of Said Fishwick, which bond was afterwards approved by the orphans court, and still remained on record in the orphans court as the administration bond of th\u00e9 said <em>Fish-wick. </em>The counsel for the plaintiff objected to this proof as inadmissible, and the court, [Stephen, Ch. J. and <em>Key, </em>A. J.] being divided in Opinion, the testimony was rejected. The defendant excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-3\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

Under the act of 1798, <em>ch. </em>101, <em>sub ch. </em>3, an administration bond must be approved by the court before it is admitted to record. A copy of the bond from the record was not conclusive evidence that the bond was given and accepted under any order of the court. Suppose the case of a forged administration bond, and suit was brought on an attested copy, it could not be contended that the person whose name was forged would be estopped from pleading <em>non est factum. </em>lie would not be concluded by the copy, which might be <em>prima facie </em>evidence, but not conclusive evidence of the execution of the bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-6\"><em>Magruder, </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuT\">The law requires that the suit should be brought on an attested copy of the bond. There was no general prayer to the court below, whether the evidence was sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover. The object of <em>the </em>proof of the register was to falsify his record. Parol evidence is not admissible to contradict a record. The register of wills was not a competent witness to prove the facts set forth in the bill of exceptions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>Sewell vs. </em>Hepburn, in this court, at June term 1818, is relied on against the admission of parol evidence in the present case. He also referred to 1 <em>Phill.

Whether the paper dated the 9th of November 1816, oil Which this suit w\u00e1'S instituted, is the deed of Craufurd, signed, sealed, and delivered by him; afe facts to be submitted to the jury; \u00e1nd the only question for the consideration of this coxirt is, whether the testiihorfy offered at the tiia\u00ed Ought to have been i-eceived for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"A1E\">The counsel of th\u00e9 plaintiff, to support the issue's on the part of the plaintiff, read in evidence to the jury the <em>original </em>bond of 1816, having proved by the subscribing witness, that it was signed and sealed In his presence, but nothing said of the delivery. Had he rested his cas\u00e9 <em>entirely </em>on this <em>original </em>paper, it caitfiot be doubted that if would be corripe'tent for the defendant, upon th\u00e9 pleas ill this case, to give evidence that the bond was delivered as an escrow; and if the jury were satisfied that the defenSlant had proved His pleas, they ought to have rendered a Verdict in Ixis favour. -But the plaintiff also offered in evidence a certified copy of this bond from the records of the orphans court, and this px;esents the' question, whether that copy was coiiclusive \u00e9videi\u00ed\u00e9e of th\u00e9 due and legal execution and delivery of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"AQS\">Where' an instrument of writing is required by law to be recorded; the enrolment of it is evidence of all circumstaxices necessary to give it validity. Rut this e vidence is iiot conclusive; it is <em>only prima facie, </em>and like all <em>prima facie </em>evidence may be rebutted. To give it a conclusive effect might be ruinoxis to the Community; an enrolment, however obtained, would exclude all inquiry; it would be a shield and protection to fraud, forgery and deceit,</p>\n<p id=\"ASz\">We therefore think that the court erred in rejecting that-part of <em>Trueman Tyler\u2019s </em>testimony that related to the bond of 1816; the i'esidue of his testimony, respecting the bond of 1812s was not legal evidence, and the court did right in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">The judgment is reversed with costs, and a <em>procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, &amp;C,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
