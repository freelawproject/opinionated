Bond </em>had obtained sundry judgments against the plaintiff, (now ap. pellant,) upon which writs of <em>fieri facias </em>had been issued and placed in the hands of <em>Jason </em>Moore, <em>then sheriff of the </em>county, who in pursuance thereof had levied the .same up\u00bb on the plaintiff\u2019s property, and had advertised the same to he sold on the 19t)i of August 1817, on which day theplain \u25a0 tiff, with sundry persons attended; when in consideration, that the property would not sell, for its real value at that time, and to prevent its being sacrificed, the plaintiff did then enter into an agreement and understanding with the-', defendant, (now appellee,) to bid for the property for and. upon account, of the plaintiff) that he might have an opportunity to- raise the money to pay the e&amp;ecuuons tor which the property was to be sold; and in consequence of such agreement and understanding between the plaintiff and the defendant, the defendant did, bid off the property for the sum of \u00a75000, which was more than sufficient to pay the whole of the executions to <em>Bond, </em>together with all costs,, &amp;c. Yet the defendant, not regarding his said agreement and undertaking, but contriving, &amp;c..to defraud the plaintiff, on the said 19th of August aforesaid, and after the, said sale, did secretly and fraudulently contrive, collude,, a,tjd.agree with <em>Moore, </em>the sheriff, to deprive the plaintiff'of any benefit from the sale of the property, and to defraud-him out of the same, he the defendant did then agree and, determine with <em>Moore </em>to retain the property'- by virtue of the sale,, for their mutual benefit and advantage, and in. consequence thereof the defendant absolutely- refused tc-. relinquish the property to the plaintiff) although, &amp;c.. That; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>fho plaintiff was ready and willing to pay the money fine \u25a0upon the executions, &amp;c. yet, &amp;c. The defendant pleaded not guilty, upon which, issue was joined. At the trial the plaintiff proved to the jury the facts stated in his declaration. And the defendant proved that the property mentioned in the declaration was real estate, and that the understandings and agreements in the declaration stated had relation only to real estate; and that said understandings and agreements were not, nor was either of them, reduced to writing, nor any memorandum or other writing made of the same, nor was there any money paid for or on account of the same or the said land by the plain'Hiif, or by any one else for him, to the defendant. The defendant then prayed the opinion and direction of the court to the jury, that if they believed said evidence, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. Which opinion, the court <em>[Hanson </em>and <em>.Ward, </em>A. J.] gave to the jury. The plaintiff excepted; and <em>the </em>verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>_ A /j <em>fa. </em>oq a judgment obtained by B against I,, was p act'd in the hands \u00f3f M, a sheriff, and by him laid upon the land of L, who, at (he salf, perceiving that it v.ould not sell for iis real value at that timt, entered into an agreement' with <em>\"W </em>(hat lie sh nUl bid it off far and \u00ab;&gt;on I/s account, to triable him ther* by to gain time (o raise the money .WVlid bul off the land at Jess than its vamp; but conceiving the design of turning the mtrehase to his advantage, .-ntered into a f andtilent agreement with M to retain it for their mutual benefit, and r&lt; fused to relinquish it to L, uh\u00ab\u00bb\u2018 had jpade.&lt;n arrangeinvnt with B. for jmjnum of the debt.

Nor was there any averment of a fraud intended to be perpetrated at the time of the agreement. That it-was, nothing mere than the violation, of contract, without any fraudulent motive, That as the agreement related to lands? it ought to have been in writing, and not being so, was within the statute of frauds. He cited 1 <em>Com. Cont. </em>74. 1 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>tit. <em>Agreement, </em>(C) 115. That the statute of frauds is never pleaded, but. is offered in evidence, and that it was with a view of relying on the statute that the defendant offered th.e evidence he did.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW-\">We must take this case, as we find it, which,' as presented by the declaration, and bill of ex-peptions taken at the trial, is substantially this; Sundry writs of <em>fieri facias </em>being sued out, upon judgments obtained by <em>Buckler Bond </em>against <em>Daniel Lamborn, </em>the plaintiff, and placed in the hands of <em>Jason Moore, </em>the sheriff of<em>Marford </em>county, he levied them upon, the land and real estate of <em>Larnborn, </em>who attended at the time and place assigned by the sheriff in his advertisement for the sale of the property; and perceiving that it would not sell for its. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>real value at t\u00ediat lime, entered into an agreement witli <em>John Watson, </em>the defendant, that be should bid it off, for and upon his, <em>Lamborn\u2019s, </em>account, to enable him thereby to gain time, to raise the money to satisfy the executions.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><em>Watson </em>did accordingly bid off the properly at leas than Its value, but afterwards, conceiving the design of turning \u201ethe originally pretended purchase to\u00e1is advantage, entered into a fraudulent engagement with <em>Moore, </em>the sheriff, 'to retain it for their mutual benefit, and refused to relinquish it to <em>Isaniborn, </em>who had made an arrangement with Bond, the creditor at whose instance it was seized* for the pay-<em>meat </em>of the whole amount due to him, with all the accruing costs and charges.</p>\n<p id=\"A56\">For that violation by <em>Ifnison </em>of his agreement this suit was brought, and he rests his defence on the statute of frauds, whidi probably generales as many frauds as it prevents. The expedient resorted to by the plaintiff to prevent an actual sale, in order to gain time, may not be altogether free from exception; but looking at this case, as it appears in the record, more disgraceful conduct than that both of the defendant, and <em>Moore </em>the sheriff, has perhaps seldom found its way into a court of justice, and the de- - fence, set up is entirely of a piece with it; yet as the case is presented, we are constrained to sustain that defence. The eciion is not founded on deceit, misrepresent;\u00bb!ton or fraud, practised by the defendant, by which the plaintiff was tricked into a false confidence, and seduced in \u00bfo a contract by which, he has lost his property; but on a verbal agreement, respecting the sale of lands, not sought for, or moving from the defendant, but procured\u2018by the plaintiff himself for his own purposes, on which, without overturning the statute of frauds, an action at law will not lie, being clearly within the statute, from the operation of which the subsequent abuse by the defendant, in collusion with the sheriff, of the confidence reposed ia him, catm\u00f3t have The effect to rescue it. If the plaintiff could be permitted to recover on this agreement, there is no case in which the statute could prevail, and it would become a dead letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Courts of law, as well as of equity, have Cognizance of fraud; but courts of Law relieve against it negatively, by inquiring into the circumstances, and not permitting plain-tyro to recover in actions brought on deeds or contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>fraudulently obtained, and thus virtually ann\u00falling suck deeds or contracts as against the fraudulent parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">But they cannot entertain actions upon verbal contracts within the statute, on the ground of fraud, in refusing to perform them; if they could, it would be to permit a plaintiff, in the shape of an action on the contract, to recover in damages, not for the breach of the contract as such, but for a fraud subsequently conceived, and on which the action was not founded, (as is attempted in this case,) which would be to annul the statute in relation to such contract\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u2022 JUDGMENT \u00c1EEIIIMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
