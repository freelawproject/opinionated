The injunction was continued by the chancellor until final hearing in May 1824, \u25a0when he decreed, \u201cthat unless the complainant shall, on or before the 13th of May next, pay to the defendant the sum of 85867 25, with interest, &amp;c. \u201cthe injunction heretofore issued shall be dissolved,\u201d &amp;c.

Johnson, </em>in support of the rule,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agv\">contended, That the court of chancery had no right to take a bond which could operate as a <em>supersedeas </em>to stay execution. 2. That the bond which had been taken was informal. 3.. That if the bond operated to stay execution, it \u00abras only on the decree of the chancellor, and this was a decree upon which no execution could issue; but that it did not operate to stay execution op the judgment at law. They insisted, on the <em>first point, </em>that no bond could be. given, unless it was demanded by statute. That the acts of July 1721, <em>ch. </em>14, <em>s. 4; </em>July 1729, <em>ch. </em>3, <em>s. </em>3; 1785, <em>ch. </em>72, <em>s. </em>27; provide for appeals from the court of chancery, but there is no mention made in them as to the bond to be given. It is.admitted, that an appeal in <em>England </em>operates asa <em>supersedeas </em>without a bond being given; and there is no objection to its doing so here on the decree of the court of chancery, but it cannot have the effect to stay execution on the judgment at law. The act of 1713, <em>ch. 4, </em>is applicable only to judgments at law, and the bond in-this case can\u00bb not be brought within its provisions. On the <em>second point. </em>The bond is not in form, if the court of chancery had a right to take one. Unless the bond is in the form prescribed by law, execution may issue. <em>Johnson vs. Goldsborough, </em>1 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>499, The bond is defective In various particulars \u2014 it is made payable to <em>Smithy </em>omitting his executors, &amp;c. The act of assembly is not referred to in the bond, but is wholly omitted The word <em>effect </em>is also omitted. It is a material word, as the words to <em>prosecute the appeal iyilh effect, </em>were held in <em>Karthaus vs. Owings, (ante 134,) </em>to mean to prosecute the. appeal to a successful termination. The act of 1713, <em>ch. </em>4, prescribes a <em>formula </em>which mu,st be substan.tia.Jly if not. strictly pursued \u2014 and so decided as to <em>femes covert </em>in <em>Hawkins et al. Lessee vs. Burress et al. </em>1 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>513, where the word <em>ill-usage </em>was omitted; also in <em>Lewis\u2019s Lessee vs. Waters, </em>3 <em>Harr. &amp; M\u2018Hen. </em>430, where the word was <em>treats </em>instead of <em>threats\u2019, </em>also in <em>Smoot\u2019s Adm\u2019r. vs. Bunbury\u2019s Ex\u2019r. </em>1 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>136, where the words <em>or any security </em>were omitted in <em>the </em>probat to an account; so also in <em>Shivers vs. </em>Wilson, 5 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Johns. </em>130, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>where the form, of the oath was not pursued. On the <em>third point. </em>The bond, if correctly taken, does not operate to stay execution on the judgment at law. The decree is one on which no execution can issue, and the bond, if to stay execution, must be on the decree upon which it operates, and not the judgment at law, with which it h\u00e1s nothing to do. The injunction being dissolved, ther\u00bf is nothing to stay execution on the judgment at law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-4\"><em>Magruder </em>and <em>Taney, </em>against the rule.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aas\">The right to issue execution on the judgment at law, is derived from the decree of the chancellor dissolving the injunction. That decree is siispended by the appeal, and bond being approved, all proceedings under the decre\u00e9 are suspended until a hearing in this court. What will be the decree in this court if the decree of the chancellor is reversed? Not that tlie injunction be revived, but that it be perpetual. The practice lias universally been, that \u00e1 bond in a case like th\u00e9 present, stays execution on the judgment at law. The party appeals as well from that part of the decree dissolving the injunction, as the part decreeing the sum of money that is due. In <em>England </em>no bond is required on appeals from chancery; but the appeal itself stays execution of the decree; and as the appeal itselF, independent of a bond, is a <em>supersedeas, </em>the party, to entitle himself to an execution, must show that ther\u00e9 is some law requiring \u00e1 bond <em>t\u00f3 </em>be given. This is <em>not </em>a case where any bond was required to be given; but if a bond is necessary, and the one given is defective, this court would do what the chancellor would do \u2014 -call on the defendant to give a correct one by a particular time. Why should a bond be given? One has already been given on obtaining the injunction, and none other is required. If the decree had given costs, then, to stay execution on the decree, a bond would be necessary. There are many cases where the party might appeal from a decree where no bond can at all be necessary. The question on the appeal in this case will be, whether or not the injunction ought to have been continued; and until decided on by this court the injunction must continue. The bond being approved by the chancellor, shows that it is the form usually given on appeals from decrees in chancery. If the form prescribed by the act of IflS has not been literally complied with, it ha? been sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>fetantially so: It covers every possible loss which <em>Smith </em>Cari sustain.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b272-4\">ttULE REFUSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
