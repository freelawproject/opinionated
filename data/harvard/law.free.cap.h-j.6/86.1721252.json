At the trial the plaintiff offered in evidence <em>the </em>promissory note upon which the action was brought, admitted by the. defendant to have been executed by him, and delivered to the plaintiff. The defendant then proved, that the consideration of the note was a pair of mill-stones, which the defendant bought and received from the plaintiff, and pu,t up in his mill in the month of February 1819. That the, stones were bad; that one of them w'as composed of block, soft and badly cemented, and that many of the blocks of the other were also, soft and badly cemented, and were not worth the trouble of carrying from the plaintiff\u2019s to the defendant\u2019s mill. The stones were kept in the defendant\u2019s mill from the month of February 1819, <em>to </em>the present time, and used with difficulty in grinding plaisfer. The defendant also proved by a competent witness, that he (the witness,) in the month of September 1819, a few days previous to the writing by the plaintiff of the first letter hereinafter set forth, called on the plaintiff at the defendant\u2019s request, informed him that the stones were, bad., and desired him to repair them; and that the same application, was re:newed subsequent to the date of the last letter hereinafter stated. On the second application, theplaintiffinformed the witness thathe could not then comply with his request. The defendant further offered in evidence the following papers, proved to be the handwriting of the plaintiff. 1st. <em>\u201cLisbon, </em>17th February 1819, Mr. <em>Thomas Ililleary </em>bo\u2019t of <em>Benjamin G.

A letter dated the 24th of September 1819, from the plaintiff to the defendant. \u201cWhen your plaister burs were made, the supply of blocks was but small \u2014 my jour1neyman who built the stones, forced in some contrary to my wishes, during my absence from the shop, although there were hard ones enough to have made them complete. If you will take the dimensions of such as are not sufficient, I will work them out, send them to your mill, and Come myself to put them in the deficient places, having a wish to give general satisfaction to all my customers. You can take the length and breadth at both ends, and note them down ott paper, to enable me to calculate the blocks Accordingly.\u201d Sd. A letter from the plaintiff to the defendant, dated the 12th of January 1820. \u201cUpon due consideration I find that your mill-stones could not he al - tered in a permanent manner unless they were taken apart The eye-blocks could not be put in safely without separating the whole work. This would require a great deal of labour. It would not be possible for me at this time of the year to do them in time for you. In fact, you ought to have sent me a written communication during last summer and fall, and they would certainly have been done, as I requested of you early in September last. You ^could not have taken me in a more unfavourable time of the year. The stones will certainly do to grind plaister with another season, or else they have got to be miserably bad. I would wish you to use them till about the, first of April next, and then send them to me; and if I don\u2019t make them \u2022 good, I will give you the note and interest. I never was so much deceived in a pair of stones in my life. 1 knew three or four blocks were not hard enough, but had no idea that they were as bad as you represent them, and still have my doubts whether they are not. However that may be, I am resolved to make a firm substantial pair of burs out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>of them,.if you will extend your patience to the first of April. , The piece of a stone I showed ydu in my shop is of the hardest and closest quality of bur; I shall work on it every moderate day; and finish it off with the same quality which I intend for your ftinner. I can certainly make a first rate stone out of the .pair you have, , Were you to briiig the stones here now directly, it would not be possible to do them well and iii due tim\u00e9, as my journeyman is sick, in cou\u00ed-se I should have no help. I am resolved to do them myself altogether, without Entrusting any one with'th\u00e9m, \u00f3f course my confidence will not .be betrayed.\u201d Oil these facts the plaintiff prayed the instruction of the court to the jury, that he was entitled to recover. Which instruction the court <em>[Ridgely </em>and <em>Kilgonr, </em>A. J.j refused to give.
