The bill, which was filed by the appellee, (the complainant below,) was for an account, and to recover from the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ant, (the appellant,) the balance that might be found due by him to the complainant. It is unnecessary to state the facts set forth in the bill; they were substantially denied by the answer. A commission was issued to take testimony, which was executed and returned. The cause was afterwards referred to two arbitrators, who were, if they disagreed, to choose a third person, and they, or any two of them, after adjusting the dispute between the parties, were, directed to return their .award, in writing, to the court. The arbitrators did select a third person, without its appearing that they had first differed in opinion, and the three returned this award: \u201cThe above named referees <em>J. TV. Collins </em>and <em>Josh. </em>Jamison, having chosen <em>RobL </em>C. <em>Jong </em>as a third person in the above case, said persons have agreed to the following award, that is, that <em>Jno. E. Rigden, </em>in their j udgment, (agreeably to the papers and other circumstances,) is indebted to <em>Jno. </em>Marlin, for carpenter\u2019s work, &amp;c. on the house in <em>St. Paid\u2019s </em>street, the. sum of five hundred and fifty dollars, and costs of suit. As witness our hands, this 2nd of November 1822. Charges to be paid to referees, exclusive of above, fifteen, dollars \u2014 total five hundred and sixty-five dollars.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Arbitrators imia6 give the parties concerned notice <em>of </em>the time <em>nod </em>place of their mees* ing on the arbitra\u00bb</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-14\">It is not necessary, however, that the award itself should state that such notice was given.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-15\">To impend\u00ed an award for the want of notice, or on account of any other fact, <em>de hors </em>the award* an application, supported by affidavit, must be made to set it aside.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-16\">Where arbitrators are authorised, on their differing in opinion, to call in a third person, they ma|? nail him in immediately, and before they differ.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-17\">An award is not vitiated by the arbitrators joining with the umpire in making it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-18\">Where a decree states that the cause was <em>ready for hearing, </em>it will be presumed by the appellate \u25a0\u00bfours that it w\u00bbs3 though it does not appear to have been set down fti* heaiing*</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>Jas.

A bill was filed on the equity side of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, by <em>John Marlin </em>against <em>John E. Bigden, </em>on a contract enter\u00bb ed into between them, and others, who had associated themselves together to build certain houses in the city of <em>Baltimore. </em>After testimony had been taken under a commission returned to the court, upon the application of the parties, all matters in dispute in the cause depending were referred, by order of court, to <em>James W, Collins </em>and <em>Joseph Jamison, </em>and if they should disagree, to choose a third person; and an award made by them, or any two of them, in writing, should be final between the parties. The arbitrators returned to the court an award in the following words: (He here stated the award.) A motion was made to set aside this award; and two objections are made to the validity of it. 1 st. It does not appear notice was given to the parties of the time the'arbitrators were to meet. 2d. It does not appear that the original referees disagreed, before a third person was appointed, or that he acted <em>only after </em>such disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The-awaril is in genera! terms; it sets-out neither the submission, notice, or any disagreement. It states them to be referees, and the appointment of <em>Robert C. Long, </em>as a third person, &amp;c. and it is signed by all three.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">It has not been contended, that it is necessary to state, those facts in the award, but that they must be proved, and unless proved, the award will not be enforced by the court</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">That the' parties ought to have notice of the time ot meeting, is a position so strongly supported by common justice, that it would seem not to require the aid of authorities. Every man ought to have an opportunity afforded him to-be heard in defence of his rights; and it is with surprise we find in one case, <em>Lord Hardwiche </em>is made to say, notice is not necessary. 3 <em>Atk. </em>529. This opinion, however, is overruled by many authorities. In <em>Kyd on Awards, </em>95, it is. stated, \u201cwhen the person to whom, the parties have, agreed to refer the matters' in dispute, has consented to, undertake, the office, he ought to, appoint a time and place, for examining the matter, and <em>give notice-o\u00ed </em>such appointment to, the parties, or their attornies.\u201d So in 96 \u2014 \u201cThe. arbitrators may adjoujrn from time to time, <em>giving </em>notice,. as at first, of the time and place of every subsequent meeting.\u201d And in 101 \u2014 \u201cIf an, umpire is chosen, he must also give notice to the parties of the,time and place of meeting. See also <em>Caldwell on Arbitration, 45. Falconer vs. Montgomery, et al. 4 </em>Dallas, 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">It is equally cle^r, the original -referees may choose the. third person before they disagree, and this course is recommended by sonj.e of the. judges. <em>Kyd, </em>87. <em>Caldwell, </em>40. <em>Roe vs. Doe, </em>2 <em>Term Rep. </em>644, 645. <em>Harding vs. Watts, </em>15 <em>East, </em>556.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Whether <em>Long </em>acted before or after the disagreement of <em>Collins </em>and <em>Jamison, </em>is unimportant in this case. Had the award been signed by <em>Long, </em>and, <em>only one </em>of the original referees, it vyould then have been necessary to consider that question; here it was signed by al! three of them. The submission did not authorise an umpire to be appointed; for an umpire, technically speaking, whqn he hikes charge of the case', takes it exclusively to himself, and; divests the original arbitrators of all power to proceed in it, and the award is to be made by him alone. 3 <em>Blk. Com. </em>15. The submission in this case is different. If <em>Collins </em>and <em>Jamison, </em>could not agree, they were to choose third person. Their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>power to proceed did not ceas\u00e9 upon this; appointment; but they were to go on conjointly with him, and the award of all three, or any two of theni; was to be binding on the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">If they disagreed, before <em>Long </em>acted, there can be lid doubt the award was good, because it was strictly within 'the terms of the submission. If they had hot disagreed, It would be the award of the two original referees. Being signed by <em>Long </em>would be surplusage, and would not vitiate it. Caldwell, 42. <em>Soulsby </em>vs. <em>Hodgson, (S.C.) </em>3 <em>Burr. </em>1474. 1 <em>Wm. Bl. Rep. </em>463. 4 <em>Taunt. </em>232. 2 <em>John. Ch. Rep. </em>353. These authorities establish the position, that \u201cwhere arbitrators, having chosen an umpire, afterwards join with him in making the award, this does not vitiate it; since iii law it is the award of the thnpire <em>only, </em>who may take what advice, opinion or assessors, he will\u201d \u2014 and <em>e converso, </em>the umpire signing the award, does not vitiate it; It would, be the award of the original referees, Who might take what advice, opinion or assessors, they choose.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The consideration of those questions, however, is not: necessary iii deciding the case now before us, because the' defendant did not pursue the course below, to bring them property before that conrt. The award is silent, both as <em>to </em>notice and the disagreement of the referees, and of course these objections do t\u00edol appear on the face of it. If they can be established, it must be by testimony <em>de horS </em>the award, and in that case, aii application to set it aside, must be founded on affidavit. <em>Caldwell, </em>177, <em>178. Tidd\u2019s Prac. </em>762, 835. <em>Dick vs. </em>Milligan, 2 <em>Ves. jun. </em>28. in this last case, it is said, \u201cif you proceed upon any thing arising on the face of the award, compared with the proceedings in the cause, by which it appears there is some\u00bb thing in the award which ought not to be there, or something omitted which ought to be in it, that is proper matter' for exception. Any thing <em>de hors </em>the award must come <em>upon </em>affidavit. This doctrine is confirmed <em>by </em>a decision of this court at June term 1823, in the case of <em>Cromwell vs. Owings, (ante </em>12, 13.) No affidavit appears in the record, and the motion was not properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">There is nothing in the objection, that the decree was passed without setting the cause down for hearing. The court state the cause then stood <em>ready </em>for hearing, and we will presume all pre-requisites were complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">DECREE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
