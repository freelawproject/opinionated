At the trial the plaintiff (now appellee,) offered in evidence, thatbefore the commencement of this suit, he had built a house for the defendant, on a farm of the defendant\u2019s; that whan the house was first agreed to be built, an estimate was made out by <em>Nicholas </em>Hedges, (a competent witness in this case,) of the work then intended to be done, and which paper was finally, and before-the work was commenced, signed by the defendant, aRd witnessed by his son <em>Benjamin </em>Berry, junr. for whose use and benefit said house and farm was intended by his father, the defendant, and who has since lived in the house, but has rio deed for the land; the paper, so signed and witnessed, was read in evidence to the jury, the estimate amounted to 82315 88. The plaintiff further proved, that work was done, on the house to the amount of the estimate, and also extra work not mentioned in the estimate, amounting to upwards of \u00a7600. The estimate does not include the foundation or foundation walls for the house, nor for any of the extra work charged. There was on the farm an old house which had a foundation, and the plan signed by the defendant, and first agreed on, and which was given in evidence, was such an one as witness believed, from its dimensions, was suited for that foundation, but that the house really erected, was put up, not on the foundation of the old house, but on a different situation, and was made of different and larger dimensions than the said plan. Some of these differences, to wit, the second story of the kitchen and the slate roof, were mentioned and proposed as advantageous alterations of the original to the defendant, and agreed to by him on the terms proposed, to wit, that the slate roof should be charged at $100 more than the one first agreed on, and the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Story of the kitchen at \u00a760 or \u00a770 more.

Hedges </em>and <em>Harbougk, </em>(who were sworn in the cause,) in the presence of the plaintiff, and of his son; the' said <em>B. </em>Berry,-jr. who resided with his father in the neighbourhood, until the s\u00e1ic\u00ae building was completed,' and <em>who </em>was often present alsoatr other times when the said building was- going on, and who appeared to be attending to the Said measurement and valuation, and made no objections- to its Uhe def\u00e9ttdan\u00ed then proved,- that the farm on which' the\u2019 buildings were erected, was intended for his eldest son, and the d welling-house for his residence; that the plaintiff acknowledged to-a witness, sworn- in the cause, that the defendant had agreed, at the time of the contract to build the house,- <em>tot' </em>pay for the said dwelling-house \u00a72000, and refused to pay more; that the wife of the defendant\u2019s son then agreed that he should receive \u00a7300 additional, and plaintiff iii consequence agreed to undertake the work. The defendant also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>proved, that Ills son resided on said place, and was residing there while the plaintiff was making some of the improvements charged in the valuation aforesaid; and proved by the son, that he had given no directions about the said extra work, and knew nothing about it; that he believed it was done through his wife.

That there was no proof of any subsequent contract between the plaintiff and defendant, and no circumstance whence to infer a new contract, by which the defendant was bound to pay more than the sum originally agreed upon, and the additional sum for the slate roof, and 60 or 870 for the second story to the kitchen..</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-5\">2.
