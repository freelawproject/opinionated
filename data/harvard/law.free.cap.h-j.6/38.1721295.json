This deponent further states* that when he was coming up,the <em>British </em>were in the bay* and were close behind him.\u201d The letter mentioned and referred to in the foregoing deposition* dated'at <em>Baltimore </em>the 3d of Aprif, 1813,and directed to the plaintiif, is hereinafter set forth*. The de- \u25a0 fendants further offered in evidence the deposition of <em>Richard Welsh, </em>taken by consent, who proved; \u201cthat late in the fall of 1813, he was at the plaintiff\u2019s tobacco house, where he was getting out wheat; that whilst there, <em>Wm\u00a1 M. </em>Bans-<em>dale, </em>one of the defendants,- rode up,- and requested the plaintiff to deliver the tobacco, or the balance of the tobacco, this\u2019deponent docs not precisely recollect which, and that the plaintiff replied that he could not deliver it, as he was busy in -getting out-his wheat, and that his family depended on that for their living.\u201d The defendants also proved, that a quantity of 'tobacco, about 40 hogsheads, was sold by the plaintiff at a much higher price in the spring of 1815. The plaintiff then offered in evidence the three following letters, admitted, to be in the hand writing of the defendants, and addressed to the plaintiff, viz. 1st. <em>\u201cBaltimore, </em>9th March 1813. Dear Sir,- We have authorised Mr. <em>Harrison </em>to send up your tobacco in his boat, and will thank you to deliver it to him as fast as possible. You will oblige us if you will carefully take the samples of all yon have to inspect, and send them by the boat.\u201d <em>2d.-ciBalti-more </em>3d April, 1813. Dear Sir, We wish you to forward by capt. <em>Allen </em>as much of your tobacco as he can receive. - As the balance of your crop is now to inspect* you wilf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>oblige us by taking samples of every hogshead, and sending with the tobacco. From what we can see through the heads of those here, we think them nothing extraordinary, and hope the yellow is all to come. You will please to 'dispatch capt. <em>Mien </em>as soon as possible.\u201d 3d. Baltimore, 9th April, 1813. Dear Sir, The alarming news received to day makes it necessary for me to 'countermand the orders X gave capt. <em>Mien </em>respecting your tobacco. You will on the receipt of this, stop carrying down another hhd. of your tobacco, and if the capt. has any on board, y\u00f3u will 'particularly oblige me by telling him to have it put back in the shed of the warehouse, and wait to receive from us further orders.\u201d On these facts the defendants moved the court to direct the jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover; which direction the court, <em>[Hanson </em>and <em>Ward, </em>A. J.j gave to the jury. The plaintiff excepted, and verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-4\">The cause was argued before Buchanan;, Martin, and Stephen, J:</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-5\"><em>Magnider, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsL\">It is contended, on the part of the appellant, that for the 21 hogsheads of tobacco proved to have been sold and delivered by him to the appellees, he was entitled to recover. Evidence was given at the trial, that part of the tobacco was delivered. The appellees, by their letter of the 9th of April 1813, countermanded their previous orders, and directed that the balance should not be sent <em>until further orders </em>from them. No further orders were given by them until the fall of the year. The appellant was under no obligation to deliver the tobacco until it was paid for, The appellees should have tendered payment. The appellant can recover for the tobacco delivered, and the appellees\u2019 right of action against the appellant is for the nondelivery. The last letter of the appellees did away the contract. If the appellees had sued the appellant for nondelivery, they could not have founded their action on the contract. They cannot set off the nondelivery of the tobacco in this action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-6\"><em>Ileath, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVq\">A written contract was entered into between the parties on the 3d of February 1813, \u25a0whereby the plaintiff in the court helow was to deliver to the defendants at <em>Beard\u2019s </em>warehouse, 60 hogsheads o\u00ed tobacco of the plaintiff\u2019s make, and on hand, 45,000 of it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>be crop, 'and the residue second tobacco, at stipulated prices; to be delivered between that day and the 10th of May following, to be paid for on the 25th of December following. Part of tlie tob\u00e1ceo was delivered, and on the 9th of April the defendants order a siispension of the delivery of the tobacco, ill consequence of the arrival of the Enemy in the bay, to which the plaintiff does not object. In the autumn they requested \u00e1 delivery of the residue of the tobacco, which the plaintiff declines, but subsequently sells it, and brought this action. .1. The. declaration contains four counts, three general', and one special. On nteither of them .was he entitled to recover. General counts cannot be\u2019proper where there is a special contract still Existing.. and unexecuted. <em>Weston vs. Downes, Doug. </em>23. <em>Power vs. Wells, Cowp. </em>818, recognized in <em>Towers vs. Barrett, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>133. It is not pretended that this contract has beets executed by the plaintiff.; It has not been rescinded or annulled, as the acts of the parties prove. No intention was indicated by the defendants t\u00f3 rescind or annul it, if irideed they could, but one party cannot rescind a contract except wli\u00e9r\u00e9, by the terms of it, privilege is given to do So. <em>Hunt vs. Silk, 5 East, 448. 1 Pow. on Cont. </em>412. The plaintiff acquiesced in the- suspension; he made no objection to or refus\u00e1l of it,- \u00e1tid gave ho notice to the defendants that be considered the contract rescinded. The Contract here is in p\u00e1it Executed, -and the parties could liot be placed in their original situation. Where that is th\u00e9 caste general counts cannot be4 supported. <em>Giles and others vs. Edwards, 7 T.

The special count is bad on three grounds \u2014 isf- Be-\u2019 cause of a variance between the contract declared ofi and that proved. 2d.

The court directed the jury that he,could not recover on any of the counts, He may recover for the value of the tobacco delivered. The only; question is,. whether there is any thing in the contract which prevents a recovery after the letter of the 9th of April. 1813 wa3( received by the plaintiff? The tobacco delivered was in strict compliance with the contract. Where a contract has been pai-tly performed, it may be so situated, as not to be fulfilled, and yet the party may recover so fin- as, he has performed. The letter amounted to a waiver of the, contract. It was similar to a contract to build a, house, where there is. an alteration in the plan. The alteration is a waiver, and the workman may recover for the work done. So here, as far. as the tobacco was delivered, the plaintiff may recover.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>The.opinion of the court was.delivered by.</p>\n<author id=\"b52-4\">Martin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADZ\">This is an action on the case, instituted by the plaintiff to recover the price or, value of twenty-one hogsheads of tobacco, fold and. delivered to. the defendants, The declaration contains.four counts. 1st, A general <em>inde-_ hitatus assumpsit </em>2,d. A <em>quantum. mer\u00faif. </em>3d. An <em>insi~u mul computassent </em>And 4th. On a <em>special agreement. </em>The. plaintiff offered evidence to prove the delivery of, twenty-one hogsheads of tobacco to the defendants, some time in. March 1813. The defendants.then read to the jury a special agreement, admitted, to be in the. hand writing of the. plaintiff, in the following words: C.\u2018T have this day sold to. Messrs. <em>Hodges </em>and <em>Lansdale. </em>60 bhds. of tobacco, <em>of n\\y. make, and now on hand, </em>45-thousand, weight of it crop, and, 15 thousand, weight second, <em>at </em>S3 pr. hundred.forthe crop, and g2:j- pr. hundred for the second, and.SI for each cask, to be paid for on the 25th day of. December <em>next; </em>the tobacco to be delivered and inspected at <em>Beard\u2019s Point </em>warehouse, between this and the 10th of May next. 3d. Febry,, 1813. <em>Nicholas Watkins </em>of. <em>Utos.\u201d,</em></p>\n<p id=\"A7I\">It is an established rule of law, that where there is a subsisting special agreement, a party to it shall not recover, on general counts. Tie must de\u00f3lar\u00e9 on the \u00bfpedal agreement, and that being the <em>gist </em>of the action, it must be stated in the declaration. <em>Weston vs. Downes, Doug. </em>23. <em>Hulle vs. </em>Heightman, 2 <em>East, </em>145. 1 <em>Esp. Dig. </em>263, (139.) If then this contract was in force between the parties, the' plaintiff could pot. recover in this action. He could not recover on the three first counts, which are general, nor on the fourth. For altho\u2019 it is founded on the special agreement, it has oniitted some of its, essential parts. The agreement is, that'foe tobacco sold and to be delivered, <em>\u201cshould he the make of the plaintiff, ar\u00fa on hand at the time </em>the. <em>contract was made.\u201d. </em>This is an important stipulation on the part of the plaintiff, and not mentioned in foe declaration. Rut if the declaration had strictly, pursued the agreement, the plaintiff was not entitled to' recover from the evidence. The agreement formed an <em>entire </em>contract, and. to enable foe plaintiff to recover on it he must prove a performance, or tender to perform every thing required by. it on his part to be performed, <em>Cutter vs. Powell </em>6 <em>Term. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>Rep. </em>320. The agreement is, that lie shall deliver sixty hogsheads of tobacco to the defendants by the 10th of May 1813; the evidence is, that he delivered 4wenty-one hogs-: heads in March, and no attempt is made to show a delivery or tender of the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\">If the original contract was, rescinded by the parties, after a part performance of it by the plaintiff\u2019, either by waiving the performance of the residue of the contract, or entering into a new one, so inconsistent with the first, that they could not stand together, the plaintiff might recover for the part performance on a general count. To bring himself within this principle of law, he offered three letters from the defendants in evidence to the jury, the last of which only, dated the 9th of April 1813-, is connected with \u2022this part of the case. In that letter he states, \u201cthe alarming news received to day makes it necessary for me to countermand the orders I gave. cap\u00ed. <em>R\u00edlen </em>respecting your tobacco. Y ou will, on the, receipt of this, stop carrying down another hogshead of your tobacco, and if the capt has ally on board, you will particularly oblige me by telling him to have it put safely back in the shed of the warehouse, and wait to receive from us further orders,\u201d Hero then a proposition, on the part of the defendants, that the plaintiff should not deliver the tobacco by the time., stipulated in their contract, but that he should keep it until they demanded a delivery of it. Whether the plaintiff assented to this proposition., was a fact, under a different course of-proceedings, that ought to have been submitted to the jury, and evidence was offered to prove that he did assent to it. ilut it is perfectly immaterial in this case, for it has been ire, quently determined, that a subsequent parole agreement to. postpone the delivery of articles under a written contract without seal, is not a waiver of the contract, but only an enlargement of the.time, for the-performance of it. la <em>Warren vs. </em>Stagg, referred to in 3 <em>Term. Rep. </em>591, <em>Buller, </em>J. held, that an agreement to extend the time for the, performance of a contract, was not a waiver, but a continuance of the original contract. In <em>Keating vs. Price, </em>1 <em>Johns. Ca. </em>22, the same doctrine was maintained by the. court. That was an action founded on a special agreement <em>in writing, </em>by which the defendant promised to deliver to the plaintiff' a quantity of staves, on or before the 1st of May 17'9G. <em>Parole evidence </em>was offered to prove the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>knowledgment of the plaintiff, that he had. made the contract as before stated, but that he had agreed to extend the, time for delivering them, until the next spring. A verdict \u2022was taken fop the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court on several points, and among others, whether the timo, of performing the contract could be extended by a subsequent agreement between the parties. The court said this being originally a <em>simple </em>contract, it was competent for the parties to enlarge the time of performing it. An extension of the time may often be essential to the performance of executory contracts, and there can be no reason why a subsequent agreement for that purpose should not be valid: and directed a nonsuit to be entered. So also in the case of <em>Cuff &amp; others vs. </em>Penn, 1 <em>Maule &amp; Selw. </em>21, an action was founded on a special agreement <em>in </em>writing, by which the;, plaintiffs stipulated to deliver to the defendant a quantity of bacon at certain times particularly mentioned in the agreement. After a part of the bacon had been delivered under this contract, a parole agreement was made between the parties, that the time for the delivery of the residue sh\u00aeu,Id be extended. The plaintiffs, after the. time had-elapsed at which they were to deliver the bacon under the contract in writing, tendered the residue to the defendant, who refused, to receive it, alleging the first contract was at end. But Lord <em>Elknborough </em>determined that the subsequent parole agreement did not substitute a new contract, in'the place of the first, but was a dispensation only with the performance of the original contract, in respect of the delivery of the bacon at the stipulated times, and this was confirmed by the court, on a motion to enter up a nonsuit The plaintiff, in the case now before us, if he did not consent to the enlargement of the time stipulated in the written contract, ought to have delivered the tobacco, or tendered a delivery, on or before the 10th of May 1813. If he did assent to extend the time lie ought then to have delivered it, or made a tender, at some subsequent period, and his declaiation ought to have contained a count setting out the contract, and a performance^ or tender to perform, on his yurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">JUDGM^XT. \u00bf.XFIKMEDu .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
