The complainant (now appellant-,) and his wife, had heretofore filed a bill to set aside a settlement made between the defendant and the complainant\u2019s wife, <em>to </em>whom <em>the </em>defendant had been guardian, and to- have an account of <em>the </em>monies in his (the defendant\u2019s) hands,- and to compel him to deliver certain slaves. After a statement of accounts, the chancellor set aside the settlement, and decreed the payment of a specific sum of money, and the delivery of the slaves. This decree, on appeal by the defendant, was affirmed in this court. \u25a0 The money was paid, and the enumerated negroes delivered in pursuance of the decree and affirmance, but the account, as audited, necessarily stopped at a period considerably before the final decree and affirmance. In the mean time the defendant had had the services of negroes from the date of the audit to the time of delivery, compensation for which was not, and could not, be included in the decree. Between the period of executing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>commission in the original case, ascertaining and identifying the negroes, and the final decree, and also between the date of the decree, and the delivery in pursuance thereof, fhe female slaves had children. Those born after the decree were delivered over under the decree? but those born between the execution of the commission and decree, were fetained by the defendant as his property-. The answer of fhe defendant admitted these facts, but claimed an allowance for certain monies which he'ought to have been allowed oil the original decree, and denied the right of the complainant to the negroes.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b152-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Where a complainant hds esliiBlished his right certain negro slaves, he can by jnnew bill recovet* xhe value of the issue bom after the fir*t bill was filed\u00bb and not included in. the former deci ee</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b152-11\">lie is also entiC.od to the value of the services of such slaves from the lime of theau* ditor\u2019s slalemenr, \u00abtown to the period of their actual delivery, under the decree, by \u25a0which his right to them is ascertain* ed*</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Kilty, Chancellor, dismissed the bill \u2014 1.
