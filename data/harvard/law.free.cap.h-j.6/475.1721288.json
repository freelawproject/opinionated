Still solicitous to make a provision for her decent support, in his will he'make's the following bequest: <em>(He here staled the Bequest.) </em>The complainants, in their bill allege, that the payment of the in\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>iciest of the \u00a76000 is necessary for the decent support of <em>Polly Catlett, </em>but that she has only received one year\u2019s interest or, \u00a72000. That the defendants, <em>Lame </em>and' <em>Gas - </em>saway, the executors named in the will, and who accepted the trust, not only refuse to pay the interest, but have fail - ed to place the \u00a36000 out on interest, or invest the same in stock or funds? That <em>Larne </em>has appropriated \u00a72000 of the money to his own use, and <em>Cass away </em>the balance. It is admitted by Larnes in his answer, that he has retained \u00a72000 of the money in hia hands, and that he expects to pay legal interest on the money, and that one year\u2019s interest has been paid by him to Mrs. Catlett. The reason lie assigns for his conduct is, that soon after the testator\u2019s death, \u201che was informed that <em>Polly Catlett </em>had declared that she would not receive the money; whereupon he, and <em>Charles Gassawtty </em>the other executor, determined to make such an application of the said interest as would enable them to meet such a state <em>o\u00ed </em>the said <em>Polly Catletfs </em>circumstances as.sepmed to have been looked to by the testator, should such an event happen;\u201d but on <em>hearing </em>that sha wished to receive the interest on that part of the \u201cfund retained by him,\u201d he sent her one year\u2019s interest, which she accepted. That \u201che supposed it might contribute to her happiness, and was not then advised that it was unnecessary for he'? decent support, he was <em>willing to believe </em>lie should be justified in thus exercising his discretion.\u201d The answer then proceeds, that it is \u201chia solemn conviction, that any decree or act by which the trustees will be deprived of the discretion given to them, will be palpably opposed to the will and intention of the testator, and defeat the just purposes and objects of the devise,\u201d. ' <em>Charles Gassaway, </em>in his answer, also admits that he has retained in his possession the other \u00a74000, and states, as his reason for not paying the interest, that \u201che, don\u2019t believe that any part of the proceeds of the funds is necessary for the decent support of <em>Polly Catlett, </em>at this time, but on the contrary he verily believes, that to pay <em>to </em>her at this time one farthing of the proceeds, would be to deliver it into the hands of the complainant, <em>Grandison Catlett, </em>by whom it would be most grossly misapplied, to the injury of said <em>Polly Catlett, </em>and her children, who were principally intended by the testator to be provided for, by the said devise.\u201d The answer further states, that the defendants were de\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>sirous to be able, from the proceeds of the said fund, fe make some, provision for the. said <em>Polly Catlett, </em>when, from the unbounded indiscretion of . the said, <em>Grandison Catlett, </em>she shall be. <em>left so destitute as. really to need it, </em>for her decent support. That he knew his father, never intended .that any part of the fund should come \u201cto the, hands of the said <em>Grandison Catlett, </em>as he did not think him trust, worthy, and the defendant regrets, that he is constrained to add to that:opinion, the testimony of. his own experience.\u201d On those, grounds stated in the answers, the defendants resist the right of the complainant, Mrs. <em>Catlett, </em>the sister of on,e of the defendants, and the sister-in-law of. the other, to partake in the slightest manner, of. that provision, \u2018designed by her father, not only to prevent, her from suffering for the want of the necessaries of life, but to enable her to make a decent appearance, suitable to one. of his daughters. So far from the indiscretions of her husband' presenting barriers to her right to. the fund, <em>it. </em>w.as them that caused the disposition in her favour <em>to </em>have been guardedly made by the will. But for his conduct.and deportment, but for the want of the same confidence in him, that was pla.ced in his other children, and his other sons-in.rla.w, his bounty towards her would have flowed to hei; direct. The benevolence of the executors would not have been calle,d o\u00f1 to watch her, situation, and to exfend the bounty, of the father towards her, in such a manner as to be out of the control of the husband; and at the same time sq. as to extend to her a decent support. ' Neither of. the defendants pretend to aver that she was in that prosperous situation as not to need her father\u2019s bounty, and the evidence clearly proves that she stands in need of it;, but those executors, who profess so great, a respect to her father\u2019s will, not only refuse to pay to her the interest, but disregarding the other provisions, of the testament, take to themselves the funds; neither let them put on interest, nor invest them in productive funds. It was. their duty to have put the money out at interest, orto have invested it; and if the interest, or the dividends of the stock, was not- applied towards, her decent support, <em>that </em>also should have, been, invested or applied in a way most advantageous for the children. The discretion placed by the testator in the executors would- never have been confided in them, could he have anticipated the manner in which it has been abused.. He never could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Supposed that this son, to whom he had been so bounteous by his will, would have kept from his sister, that which was necessary for her support* least a portion of it should be squandered away, \u201cfrom the unbounded indiscretion\u201d of bar husband, fier father was aware of that indiscretion; the manner in which the provision for her is made, was predicated on that circumstance. It would be strange id the extreme, if the support he designed for her should be defeated on account of the deportment of her husband, when that was the cause of the guarded provision itself. He never could have conceived that his executors would have suffered his daughter to want, because it was their solemn conviction that any decree or \u201cact, by which the trustees will be deprived of the discretion given to them,will be palpably Opposed to the will and intention of the testator) and defeat the just purposes and objects of the devise. \u201d Nor would he have ever placed the trust in them, could he have conceived they would have kept the money to their own use. Trustees are peculiarly under the control of this court, and when a discretion is reposed in them, this tribunal will take care it shall not be abused. The discretion placed in them in this case, was intended forthe benefit of Mrs. Catlett, and her children; if she needed the interest, (as it is evident she did,) it ought to have been paid to her; if she needed it not, it ought to have been again put out at interest or invested, that it might have accumulated for the benefit of her children. And as they have thought proper not so to do, it is the duty of the court to pass such a decree as will place the mother and children (so far as it is practicable,) in the same situation they would have been in had the trustees have done their duty.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-3\">On calculating the interest from the 25th of November 1818, to the 23d of April 1828, on the g&gt;2Q0G retained by <em>Dame, </em>and adding interest on the gl20, he should have annually paid or invested, from the time the same ought to have been paid or invested, there is due from him interest amounting to g534 371; and the interest from <em>Gassaway, </em>calculated on the same principle, but commencing on the 25th of November 1817, there is due on account of interest the sum of gl472 26 2-3.

The \u00e1p 1 pedants\u2019 counsel have urged three grounds for the reversal of the decree in this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">. 1. That by the bill a' discretion is vested in the respondents, with which the chancellor should not interfere,without evidence of an abuse of such discretion, and that there is no such evidenc\u00e9 in the record. -</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">2. That the chancellor, has charged compound interest\u00bb'</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">3. That <em>Deborah Edwards, Eliza Dorsey </em>and <em>Evelina Dorsey, </em>should have been made parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">The first objection cannot be supported. The court are of opinion, that the executors, so far as regards Mrs. <em>Catlett, </em>have been unmindful of the trust reposed in them by the will. One of them has been so entirely inattentive to the wants of the complainant, that he has placed reliance upon the vague information of others, without giving himself the trouble, as it was his duty to have don\u00e9, to investigate its truth. As a vigilant trustee he was called upon, by the character of his trust, to ascertain, by the proper evidences, which was surely always in his power to obtain, that the contingencies had or had not happened upon which the trusts were to be executed, and he was surely wandering from the path of his duty when he depended upon the casual information derived from such questionable sources. The other respondent formed the determination not to pay her any thing, until she should be reduced to a state of utter destitution by the boundless indiscretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Of her husband, and has placed \u00e1 construction oh the terrriS of the bequest entirely inconsistent with the beneficent intentions of the testator. Although the testator has declared expressly, that in this bequest he has <em>made a provision for his </em>daughter, her interests are viewed in a <em>secondary </em>light, and the apprehensions of a profligate expenditure, by the husband, of any thing which might be paid, has but too evidently operated as a reason for the indefinite postponement of the execution of the (iuties of the trust. The testimony in the cause clearly \u2018represents her to have been i\u00fa a situation which the testator anticipated, and they ar\u00e9 both <em>proved </em>to have <em>in effect </em>acknowledged, that her necessities called for their interposition; yet the reception of \u00e1 threatening letter constitutes the frivolous reason for the nonpayment. The chancellor, from the answers and evidence in the cause; has rightly conceived, that the proceeds of this fund should be placed under the control of that court, subject to be applied, as occasion might require, towards the fulfilment of the intentions of the testator, in administering to her wants, and in supplying her with the means <em>of a decent support.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\">But this court cannot concur with the chancellor in the allowance of compound interest. <em>It is neither charged, nor proved, that the executors had appropriated any of the bequest, or of the proceeds thereof, to their own use, or employed them in their own </em>business; <em>or in any way made any profit or gain fiom them, or in any manner subjected them to hazard. Rocke </em>vs <em>Hart, </em>11 <em>Ves. 59. Schieffelin vs Stewart, </em>1 <em>Johns. Chan. Rep. </em>624. <em>Nor is there any reason to presume from the testimony, a profit or a gain.

On the contrary, if any inference is to be drawn from the proceedings in the cause, as to their disposition of the funds, it is merely that they have suffered the trust money to lie idle. Indeed, it does not appear to have been the intention of the- testator, by directing an investment,- that the proceeds should accumulate by a re-investment, but to gratify his object the interest should always have been in such a situation as to be immediately applicable to the object of his bounty, and give her the' means of <em>\u00e1 </em>comfortable subsist-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Mite. The interest was not to be paid at all events annually, but if her exigencies had not been such, in any given year, as to require payment, yet unfortunate occurences might have happened which would have demanded from them the payment of interest, which might have remained on hand for successive years. It was therefore proper that the interest of this fund should always have been kept within their control and power, for immediate relief, when unforeseen necessities or misfortunes might have demanded its application. This control could not have been so well exercised had the interest, as it accrued, been regularly invested, or put out to interest. It is therefore the opinion of the court, that there is no ground to. charge the executors with more than the legal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">It is a general rule, that all persons interested in tl* sub? ject of a suit should be made parties, whether that interest be legal or beneficial. The reason of this principle is, that the court may be enabled to make a complete decree between the parties, may prevent future litigation by. rendering a multiplicity of suits unnecessary, and may make it. perfectly certain that no injustice shall be done either to the parties before the court, or to others who may be in\u00bb forested in a decree that may be grounded upon a partial-view only of the real merits. Mitford, 29, 220, 144 <em>Cooper Eq. Pl. </em>185. To this general rule there are many exceptions growing out of cases where, consistently with practical convenience, it would be incapable of application. <em>West vs. Randal, </em>2 <em>Mason\u2019s Rep. </em>181, 190, per <em>Story, </em>.1., To these cases it is entirely unnecessary to advert, because we do not conceive that the cas,e before us comes within the scope of the general rule. The mother applies to the court to compel the application of the interest to relieve her necessities. This application for relief is confined to the terms of the trust, and to that portion, of the. trust money to which she has an interest. The principal be - longing to her children is not sought to be affected. It is true they have an interest in any balance of this fund, applicable to her use, which at her death may remain unexpended. But the power conferred is entirely discretionary in the executors, and they are at liberty to apply the whole of it to tne mother, if they deem it proper. Having \u25a0-\u2019\u00a1is unlimited discretion reposed in them, it % believe,d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>that they could not be held accountable to the children.' At all events, the interest is decreed to be paid into court for the purposes of the trust, and their contingent rights to this fund are left entirely' <em>untouched by the decree. </em>There it will remain, subject to future appropriation, and if they deem its expenditure at any time made at periods and under circumstances not called for by the ,will, they would doubtlessly have the .power to protect any interest they might have by an original application to the chancellor.
