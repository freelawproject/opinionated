Rep. </em>471. He also contended, that <em>Wilson </em>might have been prosecuted for felony for taking ihe horse in dispute. lie cited 3 Bac. <em>Ab. </em>tit. <em>Felony, </em>(C.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>132.

But that is not this case. Here the appellant parted with his property voluntarily.' Until fraud was proved, <em>Wilson </em>had complete property in the horse. This is not the ease'of a horse stolen from the' appellant, which would not divest the property, but it is a sale with his consent. The appellee had ho notice of the fraud, and is \u00e1 <em>bona fide' </em>purchaser for a valuable' consideration, He cited and relied on <em>Parker vs. Patrick, </em>5 <em>T.
