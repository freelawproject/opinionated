The object of the fajll in this case,, which vyas filed by the appellees against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>yke appellant and <em>John Bell, </em>in the court of chancery, on ihe 22d of September 1812, was, among other tilings, to recover from the appellant the sum of 540,000, which the bill alleged had been deposited by one <em>Marcus Ileyland </em>in the hands of the appellant, to and for the use and benefit of the appellees. The material facts stated in the bill are, <em>thai Ileyland, </em>in the year 1810, having purchased a large quantity of dry goods in <em>England, </em>amounting to about 5Cr,000, drew several bills of exchange in favour of the persons of whom the goods were purchased, on the house of <em>William fy John Bell, 8c Co, </em>of London. The bills were regularly accepted. Before they became due, <em>Will'mn </em>Bell, one of the house of <em>IPMliam 8c John Bell, &lt;f Co. </em>died, in consequence of which the affairs of the bouse became deranged, and the aforesaid bills were not paid at maturity. \u00c1\u00cd the instance of <em>John Bell, </em>(the other defendant,) and one of the firm, and residing at that time in the <em>United Stales, \u2018Ileyland </em>placed in the appellant\u2019s hands about 5510,000, for the purpose of securing the payment of the said bills, or if the same should be paid by the house of <em>W. </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2022 <em>J. Bell %\u25a0 Co. </em>to indemnify them for such payment, they having accepted the bills for the aC\u2018\u2018 eommodatiou of <em>Ileyland. W. </em>$* <em>J. Bell 8c Co. </em>afterwards became insolvent, the bills remaining unpaid in the hands of the complainants. The deposit in the appellant\u2019s hands by <em>Ileyland, </em>was made under a contract between himself and the appellant. It is unnecessary, however, to set out this contract here, as it is sufficiently stated both in the chancellor\u2019s opinion, and in the opinion of this court. There was a subsequent contract between the same parties, which also appears sufficiently in those opinions. The answer of the appellant admits these contracts, and the deposit in his hands under them, by <em>Ileyland. </em>It avers also, that before and at the time of the said deposit, the house of <em>IV. $\u2022 J. Bell 4- Co. </em>were indebted to the appellant in a large amount on account of protested bills of exchange, drawn by their house in the <em>United States, </em>on the house in <em>London, </em>and endorsed by the appellant, and for other bills endorsed by them to the appellant. It also avers, that the deposit by <em>Ileyland </em>was made with the sole view of securing the appellant from loss on account of Ills endorsement, as before stated, of the bills of <em>W. 8y J. Bell 8c Co. </em>drawn by the house here on the house in <em>London. </em>It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>states,.that the design and true construction of the second contract between <em>Heyland </em>and the appellant, which is before referred to,\u2019 was that <em>Heyland </em>should only be indemnified to the amount of the difference between the said deposit, and the debt that might be due from <em>Heyland </em>to <em>W. Sf J. Bell Sf Co. </em>on account of the bills drawn by him, .as already stated, oii that house, and that it was not intended by this last contract to cancel the first one between the appellant and <em>Heyland. </em>The answer further states, that <em>'W. Sf J. Bell fy Go. </em>on the 8th of May 1811, ha.d . actually paid, on account of <em>Heyland\u2019s. </em>bills oil them, the sum of J5511 4 10 st\u2019gl That they afterwards paid a further sum on the same account, and that the holders of the bills were now engaged in collecting, from. the. surviving partner of the house of <em>W. Sf J. Bell Sf Col </em>other and further sums, and that the appellant had reason to believe that they will collect a large \u00e1mount. Tt is unnecessary to notice the answer of <em>John Bell, </em>the other defendant!, At December term 1822, an application was made by the complainants for an order on the appellant to bring the amount deposited \u25a0ivith him. by <em>Heyland </em>into court, to be distributed amongst the several person^' entitled.' On this application the chancellor, at the same term, passed the order prayed for, unless cause to the contrary was shown on or before the 15th of the ensuing January. At March term 1823, an order was passed authorising depositions to? be taken by either of the parties, before a magistrate, to be Used at the hearing Of the order for bringing in. the money. Under this ordeb sev\u00e9r\u00e1l depositions were taken/ and a variety of original letters from the appellant to <em>John Bell, </em>and from him to the appellant, were proved. This evidence sufficiently appears in the opinions of the chancellor, and of this court,, At December term 1824, the Appellant Applied by petition, -for leave to amend his answer.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>An a [i pen I does rot lit- from amen* practical order of the court of chancery, which is om&gt; prumuaiory toa fhial,lK-aring, and by which the rights of the parties are not affected.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-14\">A decretal order, pii.s-.od upon tho i-&lt;ne in the cause m relation to the subject mutter in controversy, ami uh.\u00bb-h sntle-\u00bb the right between the partita, may be apjHuh-d from</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A87\">Whether an appeal lit-s-m any particular ease, is a question to bo decided by the appellate court alone</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A23a\">Where the bid states that the ch iWidant received the money nt dispute for the use of the complainants, fiom the debtor o* the complainants, under a contract between said debrbr and the dcfimlanr, ami i he def ndant in his answer* admits the contract, but dt niis that the construction of it is, that ho was to hold the amount reeeimrunder it for the complainants, hut us\u00bberts that it was so received fur his own u.e, and the chanciller decides that issue against tho defendant, and passe\u00bb an order direct-<em>my </em>him to bring the money into court, lie may appeal lVom that order.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-15\">A writ of error is mandatory, anil leaves nothing to the discretion of the subordinate tribunal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-16\">Appi ais in (hi-, state ai e on \u2019the snive foaling with writs of error, and are equally mandatory upon the court from whose Judgments or decrees they are taken.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-17\">Under the act of 1713, <em>ch </em>4, parties \u00bfre eulit ed to an appeal as a matter of right.

Lord <em>Eldon </em>is reported to have said in 1804, \u201cI remember, when the practice was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Introduced of making a defendant pay in money, appearing, by his answer or examination, to be in his hands.\u201d But it seems to have been attended with so many beneficial consequences, to have been so often resorted to, and so many of the cases have been reported, that the principles of the rule, by which the court is now governed, maybe considered as fairly and fully developed. In the investigation of the principles applicable to this petition, or motion, as indeed in relation to every other legal inquiry, we should perpetually bear in mind, that it i's the <em>reason </em>and <em>spirit </em>of cases make law; not the <em>letter </em>of particular precedents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-4\">It is held to be a fundamental axiom, that the judgment of a'court must be the conclusion of law arising from the facts presented to it. And in the application of this maxim, thei\u00e9 is nothing peculiar in the character of the court, or in the mode of judicial proceeding, by which it can be at all affected of varied. It is a fundamental principle applicable to all courts, and from which none are allowed to depart. The judgment of a court of law is the legal result of the facts admitted by the parties, or found by the jury; and so too, the decree of a court of chancery is the result, according to principles of equity, arising from the facts found in the bill, answer, proceedings and proofs. Such is the acknowledged foundation of all final and general judgments or decrees. But interlocutory orders and decrees, aficcting rights, must, so far as they go, have a similar basis; because, no court of judicature can arbitrarily make a <em>partial </em>any more than a <em>total </em>disposition of the rights of things or persons, without such afoundation. The judge can go no farther than to apply the rule to the case, or to pronounce the law upon the facts, either partially or wholly. It-is of the very nature of judicial power tobe so limited. It is, however, of no importance, as regards this principle, how the facts are made to appear, or in what shape they are presented to the tribunal; whether by confession; by arithmetical calculation; by necessary deduction; or by positive and direct proof. It is enough if the facts are so placed before the tribunal as to preclude all further denial of them. The court may then be called on, in cases like this, to pass an order, or, in other words, to pronounce the equity resulting from the facts. Such are the elementary principles. Let us now bring them near to the ease under consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>In case's of this sort it is not necessary, that the pki-ty moving f\u00f3r the order should show an unquestionable right to a part or to the whole of the money proposed to be cal1 led in. It is enough; that he shows an interest in the safety and final disposition of the funds. The general rule is* that the plaintiff is solely entitled to the fund, or has acquired in the whole of it such an interest, together with others, as entitles him in his own behalf, ahd the behalf of those others; to have the fund secured in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-3\">'A motion* by a party interested; to order money to be brought into court, can only be predicated upon the allegation; that the cle\u2019ar conclusion of law from the facts is* that the person proposed to be called on lias no right 'or title whatever to hold the money of which he has the possession; and, therefore, the first inquiry is, kfe\u2019 there any facts then to be found in the cause warranting such a conclusion? And iiext* if there are; can the party be allowed at any future stage of the proceedings, to contradict or explain them away? It is not necessary to show, that the person called on is a mere naked trustee, without any legal control over the fund; it is sufficient, if it appears that he has no equitable right of title to the money he is called upon to produce: As, where an'executor admitted abalance in his hands, but alleged that an action at laW.was then depending against him, and insisted, that the fund should not h\u00e9 taken out of his hands while he so remained liable tobe 'called bn \u2014 But the cohrt ordered-in the whole balance; ahd, on \u00e1 recovery being had, the money was ordered to be paid the plaintiff in the fiction; find not to the executor*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-4\">1 It is said iti the books; that orders of this kind Wef\u00e9 Originally confined to bases where thb facts Were expressly admitted in the defendant\u2019s-fins-wen It is easy to imagine, that their propriety was originally Suggested by cases of that obvious ahd Unequivocal character; but the court, having been made acquainted with their beneficial consequences, soon perceived the principle on which they were based; and in a short time threw aside the anomalous and technical notions about the necessity of- finding the facts expressly admitted in the answer. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-5\">In the case of <em>Freeman </em>and <em>Fairlie, </em>Which was so cogently pressed upon the attention of the: court by both parties, Lord <em>Eldon </em>says, \u201cI think it fight to say, that* <em>under all </em>circumstances, I can take the personal estate to have been in 1/91, \u00bf\u00a32000, and that I \u2022 may add the accu-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>mulations to 1812; <em>but I have not in this answer any dis\u00b0&gt; tinct admission </em>that he has laid out the money in East India securities, in such a way as to enable me to ascertain and order him to bring in what is the fair amount of the personal estate.\u201d And in conclusion, the chancellor ordered the defendant to bring in the sum of J3680j whence it is clear, that he felt himself at liberty to go as far with his order, or in pronouncing the conclusion of law from the facts in the case, as those facts were then, and in that stage of the case established, and open to no contradiction or explanation in the course of the subsequent proceedings. For, although the chancellor took much pains to show that the defendant had, by his own answer, covered himself with shame, yet the order went no further than the incontrovertible facts in the case would fairly warrant, or, as the chancellor says, \u201cunder, all circumstances.\u201d Hence, if the statements, allegations, and then situation of the cause, in relation to the motion, are of such a nature as to leave the matter open to be.affected by the proofs to be adduced at the final hearing, the.court cannot pass any interlocutory order or decree whatever oi\\ the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-4\">But in this case of <em>Freeman, </em>and Fairlie, the facts appear to have been deduced, under all circumstances, from the answer itself. The first step taken to find facts beyond, but in the immediate precincts of the answer was, when a schedule was referred to in, the answer as containing- a correct statement; the items of which schedule, if-added up, would show the sum admitted to be due. Such a form of admission was, therefore, held to establish the facts as unequivocally as if the sum had been distinctly specified in the answer itself. This position necessarily comprehended another case going apparently one step farther, but which was in fact precisely' the same in principle; that is, where the party referred in his answer to* and produced, a s.et of bpoks of accounts, and alleged that they contained a fair, true statement of facts \u2014 if on referring them to the auditor, he reports, that they show a certain amount to be in the defendant\u2019s hands, it will bn considered as an indirect, but sufficient admission of such fact, and the court will order the money to be brought, in, But if no distinct fact can be deduced from the answer itself, laying a foundation for such a motion, and the ease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>is referred to the auditor, and the party, on his examination there, makes admissions of such facts, they will be Considered as binding and conclusive as if made in the answer itself. So much then for the direct and indirect statements and. admissions of the party himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9l\">There are other cases which show that the court has gone much further with the principle, and distinctly manifested a disposition to follow it out, in all its bearings. For where a controverted case, of account had been referred to the auditor to adjust, and the parties had there fully contested the matter, and. the report of 'the auditor showed a balance in the, defendant\u2019s hands to which he was not entitled \u2014 tin such case, after the lapse of the time allowed to except to it had expired, and after it ha,d been confirmed, an order was granted to have the money brought into court, and this not on the ground of any <em>admission </em>of the party, for the truth might have been, that he contested every item and every point before the \u25a0 auditor, but upon the ground that the court was presented yith facts in that stage of the cause which had been established. in a due course of judicial proceeding, which could not thereafter'be, in any manner, questioned or denied by the same party, 1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-7\">The objects and inducements fur making an interlocutory order, or partial decision of this'kind, are to remove the fund out of \u2019danger, to place it in a state of the greatest security for the benefit of all concerned; and by circumscribing the field of .controversy, to accelerate the further progress of the cause, and save costs; since <em>it </em>is evident, the parties will spin it out while they have the advantage of'keeping the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-8\">Hence it appears, that those who make this motion must show, that\" they have an <em>interest </em>in the money proposed to be called in; and that he who hold's it in his possession has no equitable right or title, to il whatever. \"And .the facts, on which these positions are to be based, must be found in the cause as it now stands, either admitted or so established as to be open to no further' controversy at any subsequent stage of the'proceedings. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-9\">These principles being settled, the next inquiry is, how far the court may allow 'itself to range through this case in search of those facts, which are to be thus taken as admitted or_e.stablished? The plaintiffs contend, that the an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>swcr of a co-defendant, and cei\u2019tain exhibits and proofs, taken in express reference to this motion, should he read and considered. On the other hand the defendant, <em>Thompson, </em>urges, that the very satisfactory explanations of what he calls his supplemental answer, or at least that matter Stated in his petition, filed on the 31st of January last, as the substance of a supplemental answer, which he ought to be permitted now to file, should be taken into view. All these matters must be disposed of before we can safely undertake to bring together what may be considered as the admitted or established facts hi this cause in relation to this motion..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-3\">The answer of the defendant, <em>John </em>Bell, it has been. Urged, may be resorted to as belonging to the <em>r,es gesta, to </em>the same subject, either a\u00a7 direct evidence, or for explanation, or illustration. It is, in general true, that the answer of on'e defendant cannot be used as evidence for or against another defendant. Whatever may be the extent of the exceptions to this rule, none of them Embrace this case; for it is very clear, that <em>Thompson </em>has made no reference to, nor admitted any thing which <em>John Bell </em>has said in-his answer; nor has the truth of any one of <em>John </em>BelPt? allegations been put in issue, before the auditor or-otherwise, and conclusively established against <em>Thompson. </em>The answer of <em>John </em>Bell, the ca-d afeudant, cannot, therefore,'he allowed to furnish any of those facts on which the decision of the court must be founded on this motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-4\">The plaintiffs have also directed the attention of the court to the'exhibits and proofs taken under the order of the tOtli of May last, in reference to this <em>motion, and </em>have contended, that, in eases like this, proofs of collateral facts and circumstances may be introduced. -But the authorities relied on to sustain this position, point to an Important distinction in the classification of cases of this nature. In cases between vendors and purchasers of. veal estate, the purchaser who is not in possession cannot be called upon to pay in the purchase mobey until the title is completed; nor will <em>the mere fact of his </em>taking possession entitle the vendor to call upon him for the payment of the purchase money into court. But if the purchaser, being in possession, exercises acts of ownership, he may be compelled to pay the purchase money into court; and the taking possession, and the acts of ownership, though not mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>in the bill or answer, are the collateral facts which may he shown by affidavits, or by proofs taken in a planner similar to those offered upon the present occasion; but in such cases, that the purchase money is due, and the amount, are facts admitted and established; and whether it should be immediately brought in, or whether the purchaser should be indulged until final hearing, or how much short \u00f3f that, are questions which depend upon equitable circumstances not necessarily involved in the principal controversy, that never would be brought into view, but by such a motion. They are, therefore, truly and properly collateral circumstances. But in this case the'question is, whether, in the <em>\u25a0direct </em>progress of a case, it has been established or admitted that a party holding money has no title to it, and is therefore liable to be called on in this way, In this class, of\u2019cases, it is part of the principal matter in controversy; one of the circumstances of it; as much so as, in the other class, between vendor and purchaser, whether the purchase, money was really due or not; and, being necessarily involved, in the main question, the court will not stop or delay the regular progress of the cause to investigate or establish it by affidavits or proofs taken out of the regular order. The proof of possession, and acts of ownership, lay the foundation of that equity which entitles the vendor to. make the call for his money sooner than he otherwise could do; and, in that class of cases, it is said to be now quite decided, that upon motions of this sort affidavits of such collateral circumstances may be read, and that it was a practice to be encouraged, as it shortened pleading. But there is an obvious distinction between such collateral circumstances and peculiar equity, and the admission or establishment of facts, which go to show the real title to the fund proposed tq be called in. Therefore, the proofs and exhibits that have been taken under the order of the 10th of May last, must, upon the present occasion, be laid aside as altogether inadmissible,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">Having thus disposed of the proffered auxiliaries of the plaintiffs, let us now take a review of those tendered by the defendant <em>Thompson. \u25a0 </em>He Insists that a certain paper he has presented as a supplemental answer ought to be considered as an amended answer, or that he ought now to be permitted to file a supplemental answer as prayed by his petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>tt is well known, that it is with great difficulty permitted to a defendant to make any alteration in his answer, even upon a mistake. And there is no instance of its having been allowed for the purpose of retracting a clear and well understood admission. It should appear due to general justice to permit the issue to be altered. The rule upon this subject is, that the defendant must move to put in a supplemental answer, and accompany the motion with an affidavit, in which he must swear, that when he p\u00fct in the answer he did not know the circumstances upon which he applies, or any other circumstances upon which he ought to have stated the fact otherwise, of that when he swore to his original answer he meant to swear iii the sense which lie now desires to be at liberty to swear to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-3\">The paper tendered as an amended answer ctmtes within no part of this rul\u00e9. It is silent as to the causes which occasioned him to omit mentioning the new matter, therein contained, in his original answer; nor does it, or the affidavit annexed, say any thing of his not knowing of the new circumstances therein disclosed. It, in fact, purports to be a mere additional or amended answer proposed to be put on file with the leave of the court, without any previous affidavit attempting to account for the mistakes or omissions proposed to be corrected or supplied. It must, therefore, be altogether rejected. But this defendant has now filed his petition on oath, in a formal manner, praying for leave to file a supplemental answer. This petition points out, with sufficient certainty, that which the petitioner alleges was a mistake as to the time of receiving the money first spoken of in his answer. But that part of the answer, which is thus designated as erroneous, is too indefinite and obscure to lay the foundation of such an order as this, now asked for by the present motion \u2014 Tt speaks of \u201cconsiderable payments,\u201d without specifying whether they were made in bills, or cash, or what was the amount of all or any of therm; nor does that part of the answer make any such reference to any other document by which the uncertainty might be removed..

The defendant admits he knew; at the time h\u00e9 answered, that all right or claim which he could; in any manner, make to the monied received from Heyland; could only be derived from the deeds which had been previously made and entered into between him and <em>Heyland. </em>He does not pretend to have received kny money from <em>Heyldnd </em>in any way except under and by virtue of those contracts; consequently, his right to hold and apply it; can only be derived from them. His answer distinctly enough states what he believed to be his rights, as well with regard to the then State of tilings, so far as they werij- kiiown to him; as with reference to all other and future occurrences; If these Contracts authorised <em>Thompson </em>to hold the fund; in any way, for his own use, the original answer; in which he has; by explicit reference, embodied those contracts, as a part of it, with suitable and apt words for that purpose, contains all that is substantially necessary for his defence, and, consequently, those after extensions of <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>liability, and subsequent ascertainment of the amount of his claim upon the bills, spoken of in his petition, are more proper and fit subjects for proof and adjustment on the final hearing, than of a supplemental answer.; \u2014 A.supplemental answer is only intended to correct the allegations of the original answer, or to remove, from .it dangerous admissions, so as <em>to </em>let in proof on the hearing of the real merits of the cases In-this case all the merits are, on this motion at least, tob\u00e9 derived from the contracts; and the answer covers the whole ground over which those contracts can in any way be extended; consequently, it is in all respects co-extensiVe with all the real merits of the case in every shape whatever; and, therefore, the supplemental answer prayed for cannot be allowed.

It is' this \u2014 The trustees for all the creditors of <em>Marcus Heyland, </em>appoint1 ed under the insolvent laws of this state, together with sundry of his specified creditors, now move the court to order <em>Hugh Thompson, </em>a defendant, to bring into court the sum of eight thousand eight hundred and eighty nine pounds five shillings find four pence, sterling money of <em>England; </em>which he had received at various times between the 5 th March 1811 and the 13th of September following, as specified in the exhibit E referred to in their bill; Which sum of money, they charge, was received under and by virtue of the last mentioned of the two deeds entered into between <em>Heyland </em>and <em>Thompson, </em>the one dated on the 20th Of November 1810, and the other bearing date on the 8th of January 1811. To this <em>Thompson </em>answers and admits, that the persons named in the bill are the creditors of <em>Hey-land </em>as stated, and that the two deeds were made and entered into as stated; but he denies that the second was intended to cancel or supersede the first; and, after making sundry allegations about the true intent; and the proper interpretation of those contracts, and his right to hold and apply the money received under them; to his own use, he then makes a direct answer to the bill as to the money which it alleges to have been received by him as stated in the exhibit E, in these words: \u201cDefendant did receive from <em>Marcus Heyland </em>the sums of money mentioned in complainant\u2019s bill.\u201d And further, \u201cThat at the time the money Was paid into his hands by <em>Heyland, </em>defendant did not expect it would be appropriated to the payment of <em>Hey land\u2019s </em>creditors in England. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-5\">\u25a0 The true construction of written contracts is a matter which belongs exclusively to the chancellor; no parol proof can be admitted to explain them, unless in cases of latent ambiguity. No such ambiguity exists in the present case. Therefore, all the facts relative to <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>right and title to the money which he acknowledges he has received from <em>Heyland, </em>are as fully before the court <em>note </em>as they, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>can be At,any future stage of the cause, or at the final hearing'. The only opening for any doubt or hesitation is, as to the true intent and meaning of those deeds!

After which the <em>Belts </em>transferred and made oyer this eventual and uncertain claim of theirs upon <em>Heyland </em>to <em>Thompson-, </em>In' consideration of which <em>heyland </em>bound himself by this contract to pay to <em>Thompson, </em>such balahee as might be found to be due from him, <em>Heyland, </em>to the <em>Bells', </em>bn accpunt of these transactions', or otherwise; upon the fate of .the bills being known, and a fair statement of \u00e1cco\u00fchfs between <em>Heyland </em>and the <em>Bells.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-4\">This seems tb be the clear sense ahd substance of this first agreement; From which it appears, that <em>Jhompson, </em>ivas put into the pl\u00e1bfe of the <em>Bells', </em>and'; consequently, to the extent of their claim upon <em>Heyland, </em>became his creditor; and as such, hada fight to the funds which, were placed in his hands under <em>lhat </em>agreement. But it is doubtful, from the answer, whether <em>Thompson </em>ever received any thing or not under this first agreement exclusively! and even supposing he had, the \u00e1iiio\u00fcht not being specified, the court cbuld make no ordfer oh this motion respecting it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">It appears however, that the siim Specified in the exhibit E, and which is distinctly acknowledged to have been received, came to <em>Thompson's </em>hands after thfe execution of the deed of the 8th of January; and coilsequfently, must-be controled and regulated according to that contract, ahd not the first deed of the 20th of November. Hence itbeComfes necessary to proceed directly to the consideration of the second agreement dated on the 8th January 1811.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">This contract, aftfef a recital nearly Word for word the same, and in sense entirely the. same as the first, proceeds to declare, that in consideration of the premises <em>Heyland </em>is held bound to pay to <em>Thompson </em>such balance as might be.found due from <em>Heyland </em>to the <em>Bells, </em>on account of \u00bfrose transactions, or otherwise, up to that time; that <em>Hey-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>land </em>will immediately proceed to account with and pay, <em>to Thompson the arnounf of the aforesaid acceptances, in the same manner as if itt had been ascertained they had been duly paid by the Bells:, </em>that on all those payments <em>Ileyland </em>was to be allowed the current exchange, and further, that <em>Thompson should indemnify Ileyland to the amount paid into Thompson's hands by Heyl\u00e1nd, </em>against all demands that might'be rightfully made against him <em>on account of. those </em>acceptances, <em>either by tin </em>Bells, <em>o%by the holders of-them.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-4\">By thi\u00a7 deed <em>Ileyland </em>does, most clearly and distinctly\u00bb give us to understand, that it was his intention to pay all those of his creditors in whose favour he had drawn bills on the <em>Bells. </em>For, with what other possible view could he have stipulated to account with <em>Thompson </em>for the whole <em>amount of </em>the bills, as if they had been actually paid by the <em>Bells? </em>And with what other understanding was the covenant entered <em>into for </em>an indemnity against all those creditors? It is most manifest, therefore, that <em>Upland </em>placed this fund in the hands of <em>Thompson </em>for the use of that class of his, <em>Heyland\u2019s </em>creditors, the bill-holders* whoever they might be.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\">But it is alleged that <em>Tkompson hzs </em>a. title to at least a. share of this fund as the assignee of <em>the Bells\u2019, </em>and this, it, is said, is proved by the recital in this deed, in which it ia acknowledged, that the <em>Bells \u2018 </em>\u2018had. transferred and made over all the amount due by the said <em>Ileyland- </em>for the goods which said house of <em>William and John'B.ell and.Company </em>accepted to pay on his account to <em>Hugh </em>Thompsonand also by the express stipulation, by which <em>Ileyland </em>bound himself to <em>Thompson </em>for such balance as might be found, due from him, <em>Heyland, </em>to the <em>JMls, </em>on account of those transactions, or otherwise, to the time of executing that, deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">This position may perhaps be more clearly and strongly-presented in another form, <em>thus </em>\u2014 Ileyland, stands indebted ta sundry persons in the sum, suppose for example, of g16000, for, the payment of which the <em>Bells </em>are his securities, and as such, they have paid for him g400G? and consequently ' stand in the, place of his creditors to that amount. But', this claim of the <em>Bells, </em>having been assigned by them to\u2019 <em>Thompson, </em>he has thus circuitously become a creditor of/ <em>Heyland </em>to ike amount of that $4000, part of the original, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>debt of 816000. New, says the defendant's counsel, <em>Thompson </em>must be allowed to return at least one fourth of which has been placed in. his hands for the payment of the whole 816000, since he in fact, stands in the place, of the original creditors, to one fourth of that whole; amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-5\">There is an imposing aspect of equity in this position* and if the court felt itself at liberty to make free with the, positive covenants of the \u25a0 parties, there might be no diffi* culty in applying its equalizing principles to this case, but the courtis not at liberty to reject or impair the covenant of indemnity in this deed of the 6th, of January. By that covenant, <em>Thompson </em>is bound to., save <em>Heyland </em>harmless, not merely against the <em>Bells, </em>but against all the holders of' the acceptances,, whoever they may be, to the amount of' the funds in his- hands. In other words, he is thus constituted a trustee for the bill-holders,of the funds in bishands, to the amount of the balance remaining due and unpaid oa those acceptances; for, otherwise <em>Heyland </em>would not be indemnified, against all demands by the bill-holders, according to the express terms of this contract.. The expressions in-this. deed, \u201con account of the transactions before ahluded, to, or otherwise, to the time of executing these presents,\u201d were intended merely to.refer to the means of .ascertaining the extent of <em>Heyland\u2019sX\\\u00fai\\\\\\iy </em>to the bill-holders, and the amount of the funds- which it was necessary should* be placed in <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>hands to meet those liabilities of <em>Heyland\u2019s, </em>The great leading, object of <em>Hey-land </em>was to provide for the. payment of his <em>own </em>debts due to those, bill-holders. He had nothing to do with.the transactions between <em>Thompson </em>and the <em>Bells,, </em>or with the debts due from the one to foe other of <em>themx </em>The. obvious inducement of <em>Heyland, </em>in making this provision, in. favour of his bill.-holders, was some apprehended inability of those who had thus become his security to them. Hence, whatever might have been the nature or- desiga of the assignment of fhe claim on <em>Heyland, </em>from the. <em>Bells </em>to <em>Thompson, or. </em>of any contract between <em>those </em>parties, that transfer, or contract, cannot be permitted to.\u2019control or contradictthe positive and clear stipulations contained) in this deed of the 8th of January between <em>Heyland </em>and Thompson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-8\">In short, the clear and unequivocal objects, of this deed, were to place funds in <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>hands to igeet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ei'aims of those of <em>Heyland\u2019s </em>creditors, who should present themselves as the holders of his bills, as therein described; and to obtain an indemnity and discharge tor <em>Heyland </em>from every part of those claims; so far as those funds would go. Rut <em>Thompson </em>does not pretend that he stands here as a. creditor of <em>Ileylimd </em>in the special character of <em>a </em>holder of all, or any ope ff the specified acceptances; he is not, by any thing that is alleged or appears, a holder of any one of the designated bills drawn by <em>Heyland. </em>It might be, that <em>Heyland </em>looked to other resources to pay the <em>Bells </em>any proportion or dividends which they might pay on those acceptances; and this seems plausible. But \u25a0whatever may have been the intention of the parties, as to any matters not comprehended in the deed, that contract in itself is clear and unequivocal. The fund in <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>hands was to be applied, to. the satisfaction of the demands of certain designated bill-holders; <em>Thompson </em>is clearly and confessedly not one of them, he has therefore no right or title whatever to the money which <em>Heyland </em>had placed in his hands, for his indemnification against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-6\">It is therefor^, on this twelfth day of February, in the year eighteen hundred and twenty-five, Ordered and adjudged, that <em>Hugh Thompson </em>bring into this court, on or before the fourteenth day of April next, the sum of thirty-? nine thousand five hundred and seven dollars and eighty-five cents, being the value, of eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine pounds five shillings and four pence, sterling money of England, together v/ith legal interest thereon from the first day of January in the year eighteen hundred and twelve, which sum, it appears by the admitted and incontrovertible, facts in this cause, he had received from the said <em>Marcus Heyland, </em>previous to the fourteenth day of September in the year eighteen hundred and eleven, for the use. of said <em>Heyland\u2019s </em>creditors, as specified in the proceedings in this cause; and which the said <em>Hugh Thompson </em>ought, within a reasonable time thereafter, to have paid to the said creditors; Provided a copy of this order be served on the said <em>Thompson </em>on or before the twenty-fifth day of the present month.

In this case the defendant, <em>Hugh </em>Thompson, by his counsel, on the 11th of April last, moved the court to grant an appeal from its order of the 12th of February last, and thereupon filed and offered an appeal bond for the approbation of the chancellor. The motion was permittedto lay over until theplaintiffs eoqld be heard; after which their counsel appeared, \u25a0and asked to be allowed further time to reply, in writing, to the defendant\u2019s motion, which was granted; and, on the 28th of the last month, a written argument, on the part of the plaintiffs, in opposition to the motion, was accordingly submitted to the chancellor. The parties having been thus heard, the motion has been deliberately and maturely considered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-6\">The, chancellor took some pains, after a very eareful research into all the authorities within his reach, to explain the, reasons and. grounds on which he founded the order o\u00a3 the 12th of February last. The greater part of the debatable ground, occupied \"n the discussion of the motion for that order, was as to its foundation, \u2014 as to the kind of admisions, or state of things which would warrant its being made. The cojjrt was, therefore, explicit upon that subject. But, whether such an order was interlocutory, or final \u2014 a \u201cdecretal order\u20195 or not, wan neither mentioned in argument, nor considered by the court. The investigation of the nature of the basis of such an order being a matter of much importance, was, however, mada.vvith great care; because, upon its being ascertained, whether that basis was solid and uniform, or loo^e and shifting, depended the very interesting question presented in that argument\u2014 whether such orders were likely to b\u00ae attended with good- or ill consequences; or whether they were, or were not capable of being used as instruments of oppression? And it was, on finding, that the. authorities required the most broad and solid foundation, <em>no less clear, and strong than that of a final decree itself, </em>that the court was perfectly convinced of their great utility in all cases where there was a proper foundation for making them, and that they were no more capable of being abused, or applied to improper purposes, than final decrees themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>But the foundation1, or basis of an order', does hot determine its effect upon the Controversy or the parties. <em>An admitted, or incontrovertible Mate of facts, is required as the foundation of an order tb bring money into court.

Such questions can only be determined by the order itself, considered, hi dll its relations and bearings \u00fapon the parties and upon the </em>cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-4\">Whether an appeal can be allowed, as moved for, in this, \u00abase, most depend altogether upon, whether the order of the 12fh of February last is or is not a \u201cdecretal order,\u201d within the true intent and meaning of the act of 1818, <em>eh. </em>193, <em>s- </em>1. The <em>English </em>authorities explain, with tolerable accuracy, the difference between interlocutory and final decrees in chancery; but the phrase, \u201cdecretal order,\u201d seems to be variously applied, and to have no settled or distinct meaning or application. The term \u201corder\u201d is almost always used in speaking of those general or special directions by which all suits in chanc\u00e9ty are governed, controled, or facilitated throughout, or in {he course of their progress from beginning to end; and, the term \u201cdecree\u201d is most generally applied to the decisions of the court upon some or all of the rights of the litigating parties. Hence it would seem, that a \u201cdecretal order\u201d can only be such an order as finally determines some right between the parties. But we have a satisfactory and conclusive authority of our Own state upon this question \u2014 The court Of appeals, in the case of <em>Snowden vs. Dorsey, </em>say, \u201cthat an appeal will not lie from a mere interlocutory order by which nothing is finally settled between the parties;\u201d and \u201cwhich was only preparatory to a final decree, and was liable to be reviewed at pleasure\u201d \u2014 or, \u201cwhere nothing is done conclusive upon the chancellor, but the order remains open, subject to his final disposition, and may be rescinded on motion.5' Let the order of the 12th of February last be tested by this decision of the court of appeals, and every difficulty must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>at once removed; it is, upon the fate of it; merely preparatory to a final decre\u00e9; nothing is don\u00e9 conclusive upon the chancellor; The order dire'fcts, that the money; \u201cwhen Kb brought intb court,- shall be deposited in the <em>Farmers Dank of Maryland </em>to the ct\u00e9dit of this cause, subject to the further ord\u00e9t of this court;\u201d The place of the deposit &lt;5f the money is ordered tb be Changed.

But it would be obviously impossible, or very difficult, to apply the provisions of the act of 1713, relative to <em>appeal bonds, </em>on appeals from judgments at common law, to appeals from the multiform and complex decrees of the court of chancery. It has, however, been the constant practice to require bond and security on appeals from the court of chancery, where the thing decreed would be put or continued in jeopardy, or at risk. The practice upon this subject, as heretofore settled and established, the chancellor has neither the disposition nor the power to alter in any respect whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u00cd5l\u00edt if an appeal would lie from such an order as that of the 12th of February last in this case, and if the chancellor could, in no case; on an appeal, -as in <em>England, </em>order the money to be paid into court, to remain there pending the appeal, and if he wer\u00e9 bound, as has been contended, by positive legislative provisions to grant the appeal, on the parties entering into bond with approved security, then it would b\u00e9 utterly futile to ask for or obtain such an order in any case whatever, even in the plainest and strongest that could be imagined, since tile party thus called on could always suspend its execution at pleasure. The order in this case calls on the party to bring the moliey into court, that the court itself may liave it placed in perfect safety for the benefit of all concerned; not that he shall merely give security for the payment of it. But if the party could appeal from such an order, and suspend its execution, by giving an appeal bond, then he could, in effect, prevent the court from going farther than barely demanding security for the payment of the money. The consequence of which would be, that such orders, if made, would operate partially and not alike upon every citizen ; Upon those most wealthy and best able to comply, they would be more cobwebs; but upon those least able to find security they would have their full and just effect; they would operate as rigid injunctions. Upon the whole, the chancellor is perfectly satisfied that an appeal cannot be allowed, and therefore,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-4\">It is ordered, That the motion of <em>Hugh Thompson, </em>to grant an appeal from the order of this court, made on the 12th February last, directing him to bring a certain sum of money into court, as therein set forth, shall be and the same is hereby overruled, and rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">At the present term of this court the appellant filed the following petition, together with a duly authenticated transcript of the proceedings of the court of ch\u00e1ncery in this case, viz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-6\">To the Honourable the Judges of the Court of Appeals for the Western Shore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-7\">The petition of <em>Hugh Thompson, </em>of the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>respectfully showeth, that a certain bill of complaint was heretofore exhibited in the court of chancery against your petitioner, and a certain <em>John Bell, </em>in which said bill <em>\u25a0M </em>complaint a certain <em>John MsKim, </em>junior, and <em>Thomas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>L) </em>Emory,/junior, &amp;c. are named as complainants; and id which said bill of complaint it is alleged, that a large sum of money; p\u00e1id by a certain <em>Marcus Heyland </em>to your petitioner, must be considered as deposited with him for the use of the above named complainants, excepting .from such use the above named <em>MlKim </em>and <em>Emory; </em>and in which said bill of complaint it is prayed that your petitioner may be compelled to pay the money, so received by him, to the said <em>M\u2019Kim nod Emory, </em>for the use of the other parties named as complainants in the said bill of complaint.

All of which will more fully and at large appear by the aforesaid transcript now remaining in this honourable court, to. which your petitioner, for greater, certainty, prays leave to refer. Your petitioner further states, that after the above mentioned proceedings were had, the honourable the chancellor passed another order, dated May 2d, 1825, in the following words; \u201cIt is ordered, that the. motion of <em>Hugh Thompson </em>to grant an appeal from the order, of this <em>(the chance) y) </em>court, made on the 12th February last, directing him to bring a certain sum of money into, court as herein set forth, shall be and the same is hereby overruled and rejected,\u201d as by a copy of the said order, contained in the aforesaid transcript, will among other things appear* Your petitioner also states, that as soon as he was apprised, \u00a9f the last mentioned order, he with all convenient speed, to wit, on May 11th, 1825, presented a petition to the honourable the chancellor, praying him to suspend all further proceedings on the aforesaid order of February 12th, until the meeting of this honourable court, and offering in the mean-time, in addition to the personal security before mentioned, to deposit in the court of chancery one hundred thousand dollars of stock of- the Bank of the <em>United-States, </em>now worth in the market an hundred and twenty thousand dollars; and your petitioner-, upon such securities, for the ultimate safety of the money in question, besought the chancellor to suspend ppoceedsngs on the ordee first herein, mentioned until the meeting of this honourable court, to whom your petitioner is advised it rightfully belongs to ascertain and determine the limits established by law to their jurisdiction in cases of appeal. But the honourable the chancellor .rejepted-the prayer of the said petition, by an order passed, on the 12th day of May 18.25, - as will appear by a copy, off the said, order herewith filed, marked <em>A; </em>and, moreover, on. the tenth day of May 1825, ordered an attachment against your petitioner, for not complying with the order, of February 12, herein before mentioned, and from which said order your petitioner had-appealed in the manner herein before set forth; and which said attachment issued accordingly, May 11, 1825, was made returnable before the meeting of this court, iliptt is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>to </em>say, forthwith, as by a copy of the said attachment herewith filed marked <em>B, </em>will appear.

In this case the appellant admits the execution of the two contracts, stated in the bilb, between himself <em>iuid'Heyland, </em>and that he received- the amount in dispute in this casa under those contracts. If then the true construction of the contracts is, that he Was ,to hold the amount received under them for the use and benefit of the holders of the bills drawn by <em>lleylani </em>on <em>W. fy J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao5\">delivered the opinion of the court.' The first question which presents itself for consideration, is whether the order of the chancellor, of the twelfth of February 1825, is of such a character as to form a fit subject of appeal to this court? That an appeal will not properly lie from every order of the court of chancery, suck as mere practical orders made in the progress of a cause, or orders preparative of a cause for final hearing, and which do not affect the rights of \u00bfhe litigating parties, is most certain, and appeals of that description will never receive the countenance of this court. If it were otherwise, it would be found difficult, if not impracticable, ever to bring a much controverted suit to issue, at every step in the progress of which it may be necessary to make an order of some kind or other. There is, however, much difficulty in drawing a precise line between such orders as furnish sufficient grounds of appeal, and such as do not, so as effectually to guard against the mischief of occasional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>hardship and injustice ori the one side; and vexatious de^ lays on the other; N\u00f3 fixed and definite rule can well be established; but every case must, in some measure, depend upon its owii peciiliar circumstances; \u00edh <em>Snowden\u2019s </em>Ex\u2019rs. <em>vs. Dorsey, </em>decided in this court at the June term i 823, the order .appealed frorii settled nothing in dispute between the parties, it decided no question of right between them, but left the matter iii controversy open for future adjudication; and, in the words of the chancellor, was only preparatory to a final decre\u00e9, the decision therefore was made with \u00e1 view to the particular features of th\u00e1t oi'der; whifch bor\u00e9 rio impress of - the chancellor\u2019s judicial opinion upon the merits of th\u00e9 c\u00e1se, consequently the party was in no way aggrieved, and there was nothing for the- authority of an appellate court to act upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\">But where there is a decretal order passed upon the issue in \u00e1 cause; in relation to the subject matter in controversy; which decides rind settles the question of right between the parties,- tli\u00e9te an appeal will properly lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Arid whether an appeal will lie in any given case, is perhaps a question proper to be decided by this court only, being a question relating to its-jurisdiction touching the rights of .the citizen, which can be controled by no other court.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">, The main question presented by the bill and answer in this cause; is whether the, money in controversy between the parties was deposited with <em>Hugh Thompson </em>by <em>Marcus Hey land, </em>for the use and benefit of the holders of certain bills of exchange which had been, drawn by <em>HeyJand; </em>or was paid to, \u00e1t\u00edd received by <em>Thompson </em>for his own use, in discharge of a debt due to him from the house of <em>William </em>and <em>John Bell </em>&amp; Co. On that question the parties are directly at issue, the bill expressly charging that the money was so deposited for the use and benefit of the holders of the bills of exchange, and the answer of <em>Thompson </em>positively denying it, and avering that it was paid to him for his own use, and on account of a debt due to him from <em>William </em>and <em>John Bell </em>&amp; Co. The solution of which question depends upon the construction of an agreement entered into on the 8th January 1811, between <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Heytand, </em>and filed as an exhibit in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">It is obvious, therefore, that a decision involving, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>construction of that agreement, is a decision of the whole matter in controversy, so far at least as <em>Thompson </em>is \"concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">The chancellor has given a construction to that agreement, and in doing so has expressly decided-, \u201cthat <em>Thompson </em>has no right or title whatever to the money\u201d in controversy; and on that decision, the order of the 12th of February 1825, to bring the money into court, is founded; in which order also the chancellor says explicitly, that Thomp\u00ab <em>son </em>received the money from lleyland, for the use of <em>Heylandds </em>creditors, the holders of the bills of exchange. The order then Was passed upon the issue in the cause relativ\u00e9 to the subject matter in dispute, and involves a decision of the question of right between the parties. It is of a chai'acter to draw after it the coercive process of the court of chancery, and as distinctly decides the matter in controversy, so far as respects <em>Thompson, </em>as if it was a final decree, and if wrong, is as much calculated to aggrieve the party, and therefore as properly the subject of an appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The question next to be considered is, whether an appeal from that decretal order of the chancellor has been regularly taken-,, and properly brought before this? court?</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The act of 1713, <em>ch. </em>4, for regulating writs of error, and granting appeals from and ,to the courts of common law, &amp;c. directs, <em>(sec. </em>4, <em>5,) </em>as the \u201cmethod and rule of prosecuting appeals and writs of error,\u201d that the party appealing, or suing out a writ of error, shall procure a transcript of the full proceedings of. the court from which the appeal shall be made, or against whose judgment the writ of error shall bo brought, under the hand of the clerk of the said court, and seal thereof, and shall cause the same to be transmitted to the court before whom such appeal or writ of error is or ought to be heard, tried and determined; and that all appeals so made shall be admitted and allowed by the superior courts to whom such appeals shall be so made in nature of a writ of error; and that every clerk of a court shall, at the time of the sitting of any court to which he belongs, and when any appeal shall be demanded, enter a memorandum of such demand, as well in his court\u2019s proceedings, as in the fair records of She proceedings of such court, under a penalty prescribed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>This act, it will be perc\u00e9ived; has no. rel\u00e1ti\u00f3n t\u00f3 appeals from chancery; but by the <em>third </em>section of the act of 1729; <em>ch. </em>3, appeals from the court of chancery ' to the court of appeals, are directed to be prosecuted in the same-manner as appeals from the courts of common law are. That manner, it is seen, is to d\u00e9marid an appeal, to procure a transcript of the proceedings tinder s\u00e9al, and cause it to be transmitted to the appellate court; t\u00f3 be there admitted and allowed; of which demand, it is the duty ot the clerk to inter a memorandum as well in his court\u2019s proceedings, as in the fair records of th\u00e9 proceedings of such court. All which has been dime irt this case; the. appeal Was 'demand-id in the ordinary and usual mode, by way of motion to the:: Chancellor to grant an appeal, which he refused. -</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\">A writ of error is mandatory; and does not leave it in the discretion of the subordinate ti iburial to refuse or assent to the c\u00e1iis\u00e9 being carried up. By the laws of this state, appeals ar\u00e9(placed upon the sam\u00e9 footing with writs of error, aud the sahife effect and operation given to them, with directions to th\u00e9 appellate court to admit and allow them. It Was not, therefore, necessary that the chancellor should grant the appeal demanded in this case; to enable the party to bring it up; he was entitled to it as-a.matter of right; which could not be withheld, arid had nothing to do, but to purs\u00fae the mode of prosecuting it, which is directed by the' acts of 1713, <em>ch. </em>4, <em>s. </em>4, 5, arid 1729, <em>ch. </em>3, s. 3. This appears to have been done, arid he is, we think, <em>rectus in curia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><em>' </em>In <em>England it </em>has been thought right in principle that\u2019 appeals should lie from chancery to a tribunal of ulterior jurisdiction, the House of Peers, without consulting the will of the chancellor on the subject. In this state the same principle is recognized, and this court, the court of appeals! is constituted the appellate tribunal; th\u00e9 difference resting only in the constitution of the respective appellate courts, and in the particular manner of carrying up or prosecuting appeals; the mode there being by <em>petition, </em>to the court of last resort, and here, by <em>demanding </em>an ap_ peal according to the directions of the acts of assembly? but neither there or here, is it necessary that the appeal should be allowed by the chancellor, nor is any power vested in him to Withhold it; it lies <em>ex debito justicies, </em>and is not granted by the chancellor <em>ex gratia. </em>Indeed, if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>distinctly admitted, it was scarcely denied by the counsel who closed the argument on the part of the complainants in the bill, that the appeal is properly before us. But it is, contended diat this court, constituted as it is,- a mere appellate tribunal, without any original jurisdiction,has no authority to interpose, by order, or. otherwise, to suspend further proceedings in chancery, pending the appeal, on the matter from whicli the appeal is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><em>It </em>is difficult in this state to ascertain what has been the practice at different periods of onr juridical history. Before the year 1729, the ultimate appeal was at one time, to the King in Councilj and by an act of- the legislature of the then province, passed in the year 1721-,appeals were given to the governor and council, but no mode of prosecuting or carrying them up was provided, and probably the. mode of carrying up appeals in <em>England </em>was formerly pursued here.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">But ba that as it may, (and as far as concerns this case it is unnecessary to inquire,) the manner of prosecuting appeals does not now depend upon mere practice, but is expressly regulated by the positive provisions of the acts of J.713, <em>ch. </em>4, <em>s. </em>4, 5, and 1729, <em>ch. </em>3, <em>s. </em>3. The <em>second </em>section of the act of 1713, <em>ch. 4, </em>provides, that an execution upon a judgment obtained in a court of common law, shall not be siayed or delayed, or any supersedeas granted upon any appeal or writ of error from any such court, unless at the time of making the appeal, or suing out the, writ of error, a bond shall be given with sufficient sureties, such as the justices of the court by. whom, the judgment is given, or the keeper of the seal, to wiiorn application shall be made for such writ of error, shall approve, in, double the amount of the sum recovered, &amp;c. That section is confined exclusively to judgments obtained-in courts of common law, and is not extended by the act of' 1729 to decrees in chancery. There is, however, a practice of great antiquity grown, up in chancery, to file a bond, at the time of taking an appeal from a decree of that court, on which all proceedings are siayed pending the appeal.. This practice, is supposed to owe its origin to the act of 1713, and to have been adopted in chancery by way of analogy to the provision of the <em>second </em>section of that act, in relation to the bonds required to be given in cases of appeal from judgments rendered in courts of common law* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>which probably was the case; hut as no appeal'or writ of error will lie, except on a <em>final </em>judgment in a court of common law,, that analogy can only hold in cases of appeal from <em>final </em>decrees in chancery; and there being nothing in the, act of assembly prohibiting a stay of execution, on appeals, from chancery, without bond, ,thq question is, presented, \\vhether.if in such, a case the appeal itself does, not operate as a supersedeas, the power to suspend proceedings in chancery, pending the appeal, any where exists^ and if it does in what tribunal it abides?</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Formerly in <em>England' </em>an appeal to the House of Lords, had per se. the effect to stay proceedings in chancery, pending the appeal. That, rule has since been changed, and pow the general rule there is, that an appeal does not stay proceedings, or execution, which can only be effected by order of the. chancellor, on, application made , for that purpose, or by a special order of the House of Lords, which, applications are. made, indiscriminately to the superior or. inferior tribunal^ though most regularly to the former; and; the power, of the. House of Lords to cause a suspension^ by special bi:def, of proceedings in the court of chancery, pending- the appeal, is no where questioned, but is conceded as a necessary incident to its app\u00e9llate powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In the state of <em>Netp York, </em>the old rule in <em>England- </em>has, been adopted, and there the. appeal does in the first instance. stay proceedings on. the matter or point appealed from, and the party wishing to proceed must, before he can. do so, <em>apply to the chancellor for. leave, (tinless the court of errors should at </em>the, <em>time be in actual session, and in possession of the cause,) </em>which is. granted or not according to, the circumstances of the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The constitution and principles of the court of chancery in this state, as in. <em>New York, </em>originally emanated from the. court of chancery, in England, from which source we derive our principal stock of information in chancery jurisprudence; and. the general rules governing the court of-chancery there, so far as they are. applicable, have been, 'adopted here, and are. constantly practiced upon.. In <em>Huguenin vs. Baseley, </em>in 15 <em>Vesey, </em>182, it is said by Lord <em>Eldon, </em>(in reference to the question whether an appeal to the House of Lords stayed proceedings pending the appeal,) to be yery difficult to state positively, what the law was before the year 1807. But by a general: order of the. House of Lords made in that year, in its appellate judicial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>and not legislative character, and adopted in conformity to the practice in chancery for a very long course of years, the rale is now set tied, that an appeal has not the effect to stay proceedings; and in the same case the Lord Chancellor observed, it was \u201cmuch more expedient that the application for an order to stay proceedings should be made to the House of Lords than, to the court below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The understanding in this state, (so far as the practice of filing a bond at the time of appealing affords any evidence of it.) is, that an appeal does not of itself stay execution of the decree; which understanding may have originally been borrowed from the practice at the time, of the court of chancery in <em>England, </em>and we have now no disposition to shake it, and can perceive no sufficient reason why it should not be recognized and adopted as a fixed and settled rule for. the government of the court of chancery here. Rut it is manifestly, necessary, to the ends of justice, that there should be a power in special cases to suspend^ proceedings on the matter, appealed from; therefore in, adopting the rule, that an appeal does not stay proceedings, we adopt it with its necessary incidents, which are, that pending the appeal, proceedings may be stayed either by order of the chancellor, on application made to him for that purpose, or by a special order of this court, on such terms as the peculiar circumstances of each particular case may be found to require.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The power of the House of Lords to, slay or suspend proceedings by special order pending an appeal, is not ai^ arbitrarily assumed power, but is incidental to that body, not in its. legislative, but when sitting in its judicial character only, and it is necessarily incident to this court,' to preserve the usefulness of its appellate jurisdiction. If it were otherwise, cases might arise in which the appeal would be but as a shadow, pending which the substance might be lost. It cannot be necessary to go into a specification of cases of that description, they must present them* selves to every mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In this case, after the appeal was made, an application \u2022was preferred to the chancellor, to suspend proceedings on. the order appealed from, which was refused, perhaps without an examination by the chancellor into the extent of his powers in relation to that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">That he had the power to suspend further proceedings 9a the nutter from which the appeal w^s made, on proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>and reasonable terms, we have not the smallest doubt, an# as little, that the same power also rest's with this court, having the. right of revision, we have all the. powers necessary to the beneficial exercise of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"AR4_\">Is this then a fit case for the interposition of this court,\u00a7 The order of the chancellor is, that the appellant shall bring into court an amount exceeding 870,000, the use or interest of which sum, amounting to more than 84000 a year, would, by an' enforcement of the. order pending the appeal, be wholly lost to him,, without any benefit whatsoever to the complainants; whereas the injury to the appellant would be irreparable, since in no event of the cause could the lost interest be restored to him, or, any compensation for it be made. It is emphatically in, such a state of things, that the power of this court, to cause by special order a suspension of proceedings on the matter appealed from, should be exercised, and not lightly, or, in, every cause; but where the court sees that if the decree or orden appealed from should turn out to be wrong,- the enforcement of it, pending the appeal, would produce an irreparable.inju,ry to the party appealing, it ought and will interpose to prevent such injury, or all the purposes of its* institution, as an appellate court of chancery, will not b,e answered, But it will only interpose in such mariner,, and on such terms, as will not be prejudicial to the adverse party. Under the special circumstances, therefore, of this case, we think that the application by the appellant, for a special order to suspend proceedings in the court of chancery, on the order of the. twelfth of February 1825, pending the appeal in this court from that order, ought to be gratified, on, a bond being filed in that court by. the appellant to the complainants, with condition suited to the nature of the case, and sufficient sureties to' be approved by the chancellor,</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">The court, therefore, pass the following orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Western Shore, State of <em>Maryland,- </em>set.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">By the Court of Appeals, June term, 1825.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax7\">Whereas it appears by the record of the; proceedings of this court, that in a certain suit depending in the court of chancery for this state, in which <em>John M'Kim, </em>&amp;c. are complainants, and <em>Hugh Thompson </em>and <em>John Bell </em>are defendants, an order was passed by the chancellor, bearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Csde the 12th day of February 1825, which is in the following words, viz. [ <em>Here follows the chancellor's order J] </em>And whereas the .said <em>Hugh Thompson </em>hath appealed front the said order of the chancellor to this court, which appeal is aiow here pending. It is thereupon, this Itth day of July, in the year 1825, upon the petition of the said <em>Hugh </em>Thompson, the above named appellant, ordered by the court of appeals for the western shore, that all further proceeding:; in and upon the said order, and all process to enforce the same, be stayed and suspended in the court of chancery ulit.il the said appeal he heard and determined by this court; Provided the said <em>Hugh Thompson </em>shall file iii the court of chancery a bond to .the complainants in the .court of chancery, in the penalty of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars current money, executed by the said <em>Hugh Thompson, </em>with sufficient sureties to be approved by the chancellor, conditioned, that if the said <em>Hugh Thompson </em>shall not prosecute with effect the Appeal by him made and <em>iiow </em>depending in the court of appeals for the western shore, from an order passed by the court of chancery, on the twelftk day of February eighteen hundred and twenty -five,in a cause in that court depending, in which <em>John Mi Kim, </em>junior, &amp;c. are complainants, and <em>Hugh Thompson </em>and <em>John Bell </em>are defendants, ordering the said <em>Hugh Thompson </em>to bring into the said court, on or before the fourteenth day of April then next, the sum of thirty-nine thousand live hundred said seven dollars and eighty-five cents, being the value of \u00abfight thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine pounds five shillings and four pence, sterling, money of <em>England, </em>together with legal interest thereon from the first day of January in the year eighteen hundred and twelve; and shall not perform and fulfil the said order in case the same shall be affirmed by the court of appeals; and also shall not perform and comply with any order or decree, which shall be made on the sa.id appeal by the court of appeals, and also shall not satisfy and pay to the said complainants all costs and damages that shall.be awarded by the court of appeals, then the said bond to he and remain in full force and virtue, otherwise of no effect. And it is further ordered by this court, that a copy of this order, attested by the clerk of this court, and certified under the seal thereof, be forthwith transmitted by the clerk to the court of chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\">MOTION AND OB.DEB.
