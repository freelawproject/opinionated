The bill in this case was filed, on the 6th of September 18C4, in the name of <em>Jacob Gibson, William Ml. Calrop, Nathan Harrington, </em>and <em>Benjamin Willmott, </em>against the devisee and executor of <em>Edward Roberts. </em>On the death of <em>Gibson, </em>his executor was made one of the complainants. The facts were these: <em>John Thomas </em>was a candidate for the office of shei\u2019ilF of <em>Talbot </em>county, at the election held on the first Monday of October 1-797. On the 08th of September 1797, preceding the <em>election, 'Edward Roberts, </em>(the father of the appellant,) and his wife, conveyed to <em>John Thomas, </em>a tract of laud called <em>Farmer's Delight, </em>with a view and intention, as acknowledged by <em>Roberts, </em>the grantor, to qualify <em>Thomasp </em>according to the\u201942d article of the constitution of this state,\u2019 to hold, said office, in case he should be elected. <em>Thomas </em>failed, in the election, and <em>Edwatd Cox,' </em>having the greatest number of votes, was elected and commissioned as sheriff; but <em>Thomas </em>was returned as having tire next highest poll, to that of <em>Cox. </em>On the 29th of November 1797s <em>Thomas </em>reconveyed the land to <em>Roberts, </em>in consideration of ;S1000, (as .stated in the deed, and in the answer of the, ' defendant,).the possession of'the land having-been always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>lipid by <em>Roberts </em>from the time of his and his wife\u2019s deed of conveyance to Thomas\u201e The deed from <em>Thomas </em>to <em>Roberts </em>was acknowledged before <em>Jacob Gibson, </em>the late complainant, as a justice of the peace, on the clay of its date, and was recorded on the Sth of January 1798. In July '1798, <em>Cox </em>died, and <em>Thomas </em>was commissioned as sheriff, and gave bond according <em>to </em>\u00a1aw, on the 12th of July 1798, with <em>John Nabb </em>and <em>John Thomas, </em>of <em>Wye, </em>as his securities, and acted as sheriff till his death, in February 1802, Omitting to give a bond for his performance for the year \u00cd799, within the period prescribed by law, he gave such a bond, according to the provisions of a special act of assembly, on the 31st of December 1799, with <em>William M. Catrop </em>and <em>Nathan Harrington </em>as his securities. On the 2Pth of November 1799, he gave a bond for his performance of the office <em>for the next </em>succeeding year, (1800,) with <em>Jacob Gibson </em>and <em>Benjamin Wilknott, </em>his securities. The complainants state in their bill, that they entered into the se-. curiiyship by the bond, dated the 26th of November 1799, oo (he faith of the security, which they looked to in the land conveyed by <em>Robertas, </em>and wife, to <em>Thomas, </em>on the 28th of September 1797, and reconveycd by <em>Thomas </em>to <em>Roberts </em>on the 29th of November 1797; and they allege, that the deed from <em>Thomas </em>to <em>Roberts, </em>of the 29th of November 1797, is fraudulent, and that the property therein mentioned is liable for certain debts which they allege they have paid as securities of <em>Thomas,</em></summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The property qualification' \u2022required by the 42d article of the constitution' of this state, was not intended as a' finid to secure <em>the </em>sheriff\u2019s official creditors in addition to the bond required of him as she*\u00bb riff \u2018</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-12\">Other clauses of the \u2019 constitution jpay be resorted to 5n aid of the eon atruction of that which may * be do\u00fabtfti) or uncertain . \u2018 \u2019 \u2022 \u2019 \u00bb* \u2022</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-13\">' Where the same language is' used in different clauses of the conititu' tion, upon the same- or, similar subjects, it \u2019must receive the same construction, unless some particu - lar reason to the contrary \u2022 can Tie signed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ahn\"><em>At </em>in order to wake <em>B </em>-eligible as sheriff, in case he-should be elected, conveyed to him-certain lands, with an agreement that they should be reA conveyed, &amp;c <em>B </em>was not elected, but was returned^ as having the next highest ntimber of</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b124-16\">votes to <em>C.' </em>who was commissioned sheriff. <em>B </em>reconveyed the lands to <em>A, </em>and <em>C </em>dying \u2022within the time for which he was elected, <em>B </em>was commissioned as sheriff, according to the constitution for th\u00e9- residue of the term, and gave bond,-and busing become a defaulter, his sureties in his boiid became answerable, and paid considerable, sums of money for bun, and filed a hill against\u00bb <em>A. </em>alleging- that the deeds between <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>weie a fraud.upon the law, .and that the sukties, ns ere\u00ae diten-s of <em>B, </em>had a right to have the land sold for the - payment of their debt\u2014 <em>Held, </em>that although the transaction between <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>may be considered a fraud upon the slaw, it did not nectssaiily follow \u2019that <em>every </em>subsequent creditor of <em>B </em>could take advantage of it, that if <em>B </em>had refused to rcconvey the land to A the law never would have lent its aid to 4\u00bb who was <em>particeps crin,im$f </em>to obtain its restoration; nor would it enforce the performance of a contract made .in violation.o\u00ed its policy.

As to the merits of the case, it is to be observed, that no suits on asimilar account has been brought in this state, and therefore this must be decided on principles of equity, without the aid of any express authority. He considers the conveyance from <em>Roberts </em>and wife, to <em>Thomas, </em>and the reconveyance from <em>Thomas </em>to <em>Roberts, </em>under the bond for that purpose, to have been made by collusion, and to have been fraudulent, as against subsequent creditors, or at least against those who became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>so on account of transactions relating to the ofhce of sheriff; and also as against the public or the state, the executive of which was bound to commission <em>Thomas </em>on the return of the judges, who judged of his property from the land conveyed by <em>Roberts. </em>And the statute of 13 <em>Elizabeth, oh. 5, </em>he considered as extending to duties as well as debts. If <em>Thomas </em>had retained the land so conveyed to him, it would have been liable for his debts, and his public creditors, to whom the complainants have been, made answerable, might have resorted to it. And the. chancellor is at present of opinion, that the. complainants were, on payment of such claims, entitled by substitution to stand-in the place of the original creditors; and that the land, must be followed in equity, and made liable to their- claims, the amount of which it is necessary <em>to </em>ascertain, in order,-to ground a decree for the payment thereof, dr a sale, of the, land for that purpose.\u201d- He decreed, that the auditor state, an account. The account which the auditor stated was between <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Gibson, </em>making the former indebted to. the latter $5862 47. To this account objections were, made by the defendants, but they were overruled by the chancellor, who ratified and confirmed the auditor\u2019s report, and decreed a sale of the land, unless, the defendants, should, by a particular day, bring into cou'-t, to be paid to the complainants, the sum of $5862 47, with interest, &amp;c.

That the allegations in the bill, and the proof, did not correspond, and referred to <em>Clarke vs. Turton, </em>11 <em>Ves. </em>240. <em>Whaley vs. </em>Norton, 1 <em>Vern. </em>483. <em>Cooper\u2019s Plead. 7, </em>14, 16. <em>Hayward vs. </em>Carroll, in this court, at June term 1819.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-5\">2. That the 42d article of the constitution did not cont\u00e9mplate that the property qualification, required by that article as necessary for the sheriff to <em>make </em>him eligible as such, should be bound to all creditors, and be a fund to answer for all his defaults, and all demands upon him as sheriff, in addition to the bond required of him. It meant that there should \u2019 be \u00e1 bond with sureties, given by the sheriff, before he could act as Such, which bond was iff answer for all defaults by, and demands against the sheriff. The 5th article of the declaration of rights shows' the spirit with which the framers of the constitution were actuated as to property qualifications of persons elected to office, and having a right to vote. It was not intended afc a fund for the payment of debts, hist to narrow down the number of persons to be sclectefl for office, and as\u2019 having a light to vote; and shows that it was to restrain the popular will. They referred to the 2d, 15th, 21st, 37th, and 30th <em>articles of the constitution.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-6\">3. To show that, this case was not affected by, and did not come within the statute of 13 <em>Elizabeth, ch. 5, </em>they referred to 1 <em>Fonbl. </em>26, (note k.) <em>Doe vs. </em>Routledge, <em>Comp. </em>705. <em>Russell vs. Hammond, </em>1 <em>Atk. </em>13. <em>Walker vs. </em>Burrows, <em>Ibid </em>93, 94. <em>Newl. on Coni. </em>376, <em>377, </em>384, 386. <em>Townshend vs. Windhaw, </em>2 <em>Ves. 10.

This court cannot be called upon by a private individual to redress the wrong done to the community; and <em>Gibsori </em>cannot stand in the place of the public. Relief .is never granted where both parties are equally guilty of a breach of the law. <em>Lowry vs. </em>Bour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>dieu, </em>2 Doug. 468. 1 <em>Pow. on Cont. </em>201. 2 <em>Pow. on Cont. </em>149. These cases will explain the reason of the decision in <em>Jackinen vs. Mitchell. Gibson </em>was hot a creditor of the sheriff within the constitution.

He cannot be placed by substitution in. tlie place of the creditors. 2 <em>Eq. Ca. Ab. </em>203, 252, <em>255. 1 Eq. Ca. Ab. </em>142. 2 <em>Fonbl. </em>299, 301, 302. <em>Jackson vs. Ham, 15 Johns.

It appears by the facts that the fraud commenced with Roberts$ and whether the 42d Article of the Constitution was founded, in policy or not, it roust be carried into effect. The object of the constitution was, that the sheriff should <em>bona fide </em>possess, when elected, real and personal property of the value'of at least \u00a31000. His not being so possessed <em>bona fide </em>of real and personal property to that \"amount, biit possessed of property not <em>bona </em>fide, but belonging to another, was a fraud against which the court Vould grant relief. They cited <em>Huguenin vs. Basely, </em>14 <em>Ves. </em>273. <em>Eastabrook vs. </em>Scott, 3 <em>Ves. 456. Mawson vs. Stock, </em>6 <em>Ves. </em>300.

Although the bill of complaint purports to represent the interest of fouf complainants, three of that number, <em>Catrop, Harrington </em>and <em>Plilmot, </em>expressly disclaim all knowledge of tli\u00e9 proceedings; that' they were instituted without their consent, and have been prosecuted without their participation; arid ind\u00e9ed it is evident to the most superficial observer, that although their names have been used, rib attention has been paid to their interest. It appears from the evidence, that both <em>Catrop </em>arid <em>Harrington </em>had paid ntofiey on account Of tli\u00e9ir suretyship for <em>Thomas, </em>yet the aiiditor, in his report, takes ho notice of their claimss He ascertains the amount due to <em>Gibson </em>alone, and seems t\u00f3 cbrisider him \u00bfs th\u00e9 sol\u00e9 complainant in the cause. Th\u00e9 transaction is represented .by the evidence Very different from the statement iri the bill; indeed th\u00e9 varianc\u00e9 in detail is SO great as tb make it entirely another case. The bill states a joint cause of action, arising iiptin one bond, signed by ail the complainants! the evideric\u00e9 is, that there were two bonds, the one by <em>Catrop </em>and <em>Harrington, </em>as securities, the other by <em>Gibson </em>and <em>Wilmot, </em>and given to Secure the faithful performance of the duties of the office <em>for different years. </em>Tli\u00e9 bill represents the bond to have been executed prior to the reconveyance do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>Roberts; </em>the testimony proves it to have been nearly two-years afterwards; and to close the climax, the bill declares an entire ignorance, on the part of the complainants, of the views and intention of- <em>Thomas </em>and Roberts, wbqn tlm land was conveyed to <em>Thomas; </em>and the testimony shows, that <em>Gibson </em>knew all, and was perfectly well acquainted with the transaction. The case' presents an anomaly in judicial proceedings, and the court would-not hesitate to dismiss the bill, as containing a case totally different from the testimony in the record. Let us, for 'a moment, inquire, if <em>Gibson </em>stands on firmer ground upon the case a,s, disclosed by the evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\">In the fall of 1797, <em>Edward Cox </em>and <em>John Thomas </em>were candidates for the office of sheriff for <em>Talbot </em>county % The election took place on the first Monday in October, when <em>Cox </em>had a majority of votes, and was elected sheriff, and was duly commissioned and qualified as such, and; continued to act in the office until the following summer, when he died. <em>Thomas, </em>having the next highest number of votes <em>to Cox, </em>was on the return with him, and after hia. death was commissioned as sheriff for <em>Talbot </em>county. On, the 12th of July 1798, he entered-into an official bond as sheriff, with <em>John Nabb </em>and <em>John Thomas, {pi Wye,) </em>as, his securities. On the 31st day of December 1799, he entered into a second bond with\u2019\u2019 <em>William M. Catrop </em>and <em>Nathan Harrington </em>as securities; and on the 26th day of November 1799, into a third bond, for the due performance of his. office, with <em>Jacob Gibson </em>and <em>Benjamin, Wilmothis </em>securities, <em>Thomas, </em>not being possessed of real and personal property sufficient to make him eligible, as sheriff under the\u2019constitution, <em>Edward Roberts, </em>and his . wife, on the 28th of- September 1797, conveyed to him a tract of land called <em>Farmer's Delight, </em>in order thereby to qualify him for the office, and took from <em>Thomas </em>a bond for the reconveyance of the same.. No money consideration was paid by <em>Thomas, </em>for this land, but it was agreed between him and <em>Roberts, </em>if- <em>Thomas </em>kept the land he. was to pay <em>Roberts </em>one thousand pounds for it. <em>Thomas </em>having failed to be the first on the return at the election, on the 29th day of November 1797, reconveyed the said, land to <em>Roberts, </em>his wife, <em>Henrietta Thomas, </em>being a party grantor in the deed, which was acknowledged before <em>JacobGtibson </em>and <em>James </em>Nabb, justices of the peace, and\u2019 re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>forded in due time. <em>Gibson, </em>at the, time this acknowledge \u2022 ment was taken, explained to Mrs. <em>Thomas </em>the object of) t,he deed, that it was to reconvey certain land that had, been conveyed to <em>Thomas </em>by <em>Roberts to </em>make him eligible as sheriff. <em>\u2019Thomas, </em>when the land was conveyed to'him, and also when' it, was reconveyed to Roberts, was free from and unincumbered by debt, but died some time in the year 1802, insolvent. \u2018 <em>Gibson </em>paid considerable sums, of money as the security of <em>Thomas, </em>on account of his, official misconduct, and filed this bill to have a sale of the land called <em>Farmer's Delight, </em>considering it a fund answerable for <em>Thomas's </em>official debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\">The first question presented for the consideration of-this court, is, the true construction of the <em>forty- second </em>article of the constitution of this state, whether the property qualification required by that article was intended as a. fund to secure the sheriff\u2019s official creditors, in addition to the bond Required of him as sheriff? By that article it is declared, \u201ctljat no person shall be eligible to the office-, of sheriff for a county, but an inhabitant of said county,, above th.e age, of twenty-one years, and having real and personal property in the state above the value of one thousand pounds current money. That bond, with security, be, taken every year as usual, aqd no sheriff shall be qualified-to act, before the same is given.\u2019\u2019, IjVere we left to this, article alone, to infer the intention of the convention in passing it, much difficulty might, arise upon it, although even here, they point out the security they intend to provide for the safety of official creditors, that no act shall fije done as slier iff until that bond be given which is directed for their, protection. But we are not confined to, this article alone, to ascertain their intention. We are to take, the'whole instrument together, and collect, their views front; its general context, and inay call other clauses of the constitution to aid us in the construction of that which\" may. be doubtful or uncertain. If this were the only property qualification required by, the constitution, a reference to, other parts for instruction might be hopeless. But that is pot the case. It has required the same kind of qualifications from avariety of. persons, on whom it meant to confer a privilege or bestow an office. It is a rule in. the construction of statutes, and a <em>fortiori, </em>of the constitution, where, the same language is used, in different clause^. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>of an instrument, upon tlie same or similar subjects, it shall receive the same construction, unless some particular, reason can be assigned to take it out of the general rule, 3?y the <em>second </em>section of the constitution, a property qualification of fifty acres of land, or thirty pounds in money, is required of every person who shall vote for a delegate, to the general assembly, and that the person elected shall have real or personal property above the value of five hundred pounds current money! By the <em>fifteenth </em>article, a senator must have real and personal property above the value of one thousand pounds current money. By the <em>twenty-first </em>article, a member of the council must possess a freehold of lands and tenements above the value of one. thousand pounds. By the <em>twenty-seventh </em>article, a member of congress is required to have real and personal estate, above the value of one thousand pounds; and by the <em>thirtieth </em>article, the governor must have in the state real and personal property above the value of five thousand pounds current money, one thousand pounds whereof at feast to be of freehold estate. For what purpose was the property qualification required in the cases just enumerated? Was it intended as a fund far the security of credi-, tors? The counsel for the appellees have not contended for so wild a proposition. It was to confine the privileges, or offices bestowed, to those who had at least some property at stake in the community, and from which a certain degree of respectability and standing in society might be presumed. Since, then, the same language is used in those articles of the constitution, requiring a property qualification of the governor, members of the council, &amp;c, with that of the <em>forty-second </em>relative to the sheriff', and it is conceded, that in the first cases it was not intended as a fund to secure creditors, it is fair to give all the same construction, unless some reason can be assigned to show the convention did not so intend it. Tp?\u00ae counsel for the appellees have attempted to draw a distinction between those clauses, from the peculiar nature of the duties of the sheriff; that as he was an officer into whose hands much of the public money must be placed, it is to be inferred, the property qualification w\u00e1s required of him for a different purpose than of the other cases mentioned in the constitution. In examining that instrument, nothing is to he found to justify that position- It affords,strong evidence to the co.u<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>trary. Can it be supposed- that the convention should deem a property qualification necessary, as a fund to secure the' creditors' of <em>the </em>sheriff, because public money may be placed in his hands, and yet that no such qualification should be required of the treasurer, who is the great depositary of the public wealth? Yet we find a treasurer is <em>to </em>be appointed by the legislature, and no property, qualification,is required of him.'</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">If the property qualification was intended as a fund to secure the sheriff\u2019s official creditors, the constitution would, have given them a specific lien upon it; that, like the sheriff\u2019s bond, it shquld be reserved for their benefit, in exclusion to all other creditors; for otherwise it would be useless and nugatory. Yet, it has been admitted, that is not its legal effect; that the official creditors have no lien upon it, and that it is answerable for his private debts, before he performs one official act. He can\u2019 make a <em>bond, fide, </em>transfer of all his property, the day after he is com-,, missioned, and his official creditors have no claim upon it.. If he has one thousand pounds of real and personal property in the state, he is eligible as sheriff, although at the, time\u2019 of his election there may be judgment creditors, against him who have a lien upon his \"property, and for whose use it may be sold, to ten times the amount of that sum. How then can it he considered as a fund for the, peculiar benefit pf official creditors, unless it is presumed that the collected wisdom of the state, the framers of the Constitution, when they intended to give them this security, did not know how <em>to </em>carry it into effect?. The creditors of the sheriff, as such, having no lien upon this pro-*, jperty, and that it may be appropriated in many ways, in exclusion of their interest, is strong evidence, in addition, to that afforded by the constitution itself, that it was not intended as a fund for their security, but that the convention had different views, perhaps those before mentioned,, in requiring a property qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">It has been contended, that although the property qualification was not intended as a fund to secure the creditors of the sheriff,; yet the deeds between <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Thomas </em>were a fraud upon the law, and <em>Gibson, </em>as, a creditor of <em>Thomas, </em>has a right to have the land sold for the payment, qf his debt. Admit the position to he correct, that this, transaction may be considered a fraud upon the law, i$ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>does-not necessarily follow that every subsequent creditor \u25a0of <em>Thomas </em>can take advantage of it. If <em>Thomas </em>had refused to reconvey this land to <em>Roberts, </em>the law never would have lent its aid to <em>Roberts, </em>who was <em>particepi 'criminis, </em>to obtain its restoration; it would not enforce the performance of a contract made in violation of its policy; but if a third person; a subsequent creditor, attempts to vacate the deed of re-conveyance on account of the fraud against the public, he must show, either that it was fraudulently against creditors generally tinder the statute of 13 <em>jEliz. eh. 5, </em>or that it was a deception; of misrepresentation, practised upon him, by which he was induced to be5come the creditor of <em>Thomas, </em>and to consider the land b fund for his security.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">It would be superfluous to make any remarks on the ope-5 fation of the statute of Elizabeth, for although it is consi&gt;* derecl byr the chancellor as a strong ground to support his decree, it has been disclaimed and abandoned by the counsel for the appellees; they have admitted this case is not embraced by the statute, and therefore it is unnecessary to assign the reason's why the court concur with them in that concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Does this record then afford any evidence to show <em>Gibson </em>was in a predicament to complain of the fraud against the law? Was he an innocent creditor, deceived and defrauded by a secret agreement between the parties, of which he had no knowledge, and against which he could not guard himself? YVas any imposition or concealment practised Upon him, by which he was fraudulently induced to become the creditor of <em>Thomas, </em>and to consider this land as his property, and answerable for his debts? So far from it, it appears he was conversant with the whole transaction for more than two years before he became the .security of <em>Thomas; </em>he had a perfect knowledge of the views of the parties from the commencement to the completion of the business. He tells Mrs <em>Thomas </em>the deed to her husband was intended to make him eligible as sheriff; yet he claims relief in his bill, because he did not, know, at the time he entered into the bond with <em>Thomas, </em>there was a secret agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">But is <em>Gibson </em>himself untainted with the fraud against the public, of which he now, so loudly complains? Is he. <em>rectus in curia} </em>and entitled to relief in \u00e1 court of equity? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The degree of moral and legal gfiUt, between Him wild caramelices, and. he who aids, in' th\u00e9 consummation of \u00e1 fraud against the p\u00fabl\u00edc, knowing one is intended, is so \u25a0slight; \u00bfs t\u00f3 be almost imp\u00e9rc\u00e9ptibl\u00e9v 5Tis true it does lioi appear that <em>Gilson </em>was a party to the original fraud; biit did he not; with \u00e1 knowledge of that fraud, lend his aid to the parties to consummate it, arid practice it upon the public? By the constitution <em>Thomas </em>could not have been elected sheriff without possessing property to th\u00e9 value of one \u2022thousand pounds, arid to make hirii eligible; <em>Roberts </em>conveyed to him this land; this was a fraud upon th\u00e9 policy of the law. But had it stopped here, the fraud could have, produced no injurious effect, no creditor could have suffered by it; because <em>Thomas </em>could do no act as sheriff, until he gave a bond; with security, for th\u00e9 faithful performance of iris \u00f3ffic\u00e9; <em>Gibson </em>kn\u00e9w the fraud had been contemplated, and partly executed-. lie knew it could produc\u00e9 no teffect without a bend and security, arid yet; with'a full knowledge of All the facts; he becomes tlie security in the bond, and thereby enables the party to practice the fraud ripori the public; He was a volunteer with notice, and does not come into a court of equity with cle\u00e1ri hands, when he claims relief against \u00e1 fraudulent transaction, which could have produced no injury, without his aid to carry it into- effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The court think the decree of the chancellor is erroneous and ought to be reversed; .</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">DECREE REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
