This was an ac-tum of debt brought upon <em>John Chalmers\u2019 </em>bond as sheriff\u2019 of <em>Baltimore </em>county, dated the 28th of December 1814. By consent of parties the cause was referred without any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>other pleadings but the declaration, to <em>Henry Trapnall,' </em>who awarded that the defendants, (the appellants,) pay to the plaintiff, (the appellee,) 8330 j04 and at the foot of his award the arbitrator refers to a statement annexed, which statement shows, that to September term 1815 of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, three writs-uf <em>fieri facias </em>were levied on the property of Brown; the defendant in the said writs, (being the person at whose instance and for whose use this action was brought), leaving in the hands of the sheriff, after payment of the debts and costs for which the writs of <em>fieri facias </em>'issued, 856 41 due to <em>Brown. </em>At March term 18l6j one other writ of <em>fieri fa* cias </em>was levied on the property of <em>Brown, </em>which was sold to the amount of 8500, leaving a balance, after payment of the debt and costs, 8158 16, for which <em>the fieri facias </em>issued, together with the above .sum of g56 41 as due to <em>Brown, </em>of 8398 25. From this sum 868 21 was deducted, being the amount of a judgment against Brown, as garnishee of <em>Chalmers, </em>leaving the sum of \u00a7330 04 due, being the sum above awarded. The defendants objected to a judgment being entered on the award \u2018\u2018because a sum of money has been awarded to be paid to the plaintiff by .the defendants,, which they were not bound to pay, the bond which they had entered into not being then in force, to wit, the sum of 8500, received \u00bfor property sold on a <em>fieri facias, </em>.returnable to March term 1816, at the suit of,\u201d &amp;c. The county court gave judgment for the debt in the declaration, and costs; to be released on payment of 8330 04, by the arbitrator awarded, with interest, &amp;c. From this judgment the defendants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b103-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>If an award da^ closes the ground taken by the arbitrator <em>in </em>form\u00bb iii\u00a3 his ^ opinion, the ease b upen to the inquiry, whether he committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>a mistake in point of law</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b104-6\">The sheriff\u2019s bond is an annual bond, and the sureties of each Sear are respomi* !e for the neglects, defaults, acts and receipts, of their principal, during the time only between giving the bond passed by them, and the execution of the next year\u2019s bond</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b104-8\">If a question of law is decided by an arbitrator selected by the parties, for the purpose of finally stttling such a question between them, they are bound by the a\u25a0ward- <em>Semble-</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AZ3\">Under a general submission to arbitrators their award majr be impeached ibr an error m law '</headnotes>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b104-10\">( The cause was argued before Buchanan, Earle, and Martin, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-11\"><em>Heath, </em>for the Appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ8\">contended, 1.

This paper is to be considered a part of the award; and as it discloses the ground taken by the arbitrator; in forming his opinion of the subject, the tase is open to,the inquiry; whether he committed a mistake in point of law, in the decision he made between the parties? The 'case submitted to arbitration, is a joint suit against the appellants, as securities in a sheriff\u2019s bond, executed, on the 8th of December 1814} and th\u00e9 siim for which they are rendered liable by the award of the arbitrator, was received by the sheriff for property sold under a <em>fieri facias, </em>returned to March term; 1816, of <em>Baltimore </em>county court. It is plain,, then, that the arbitrator undertook to determine on the liability in law of the appellants for the money thus received by the sheriff) and, that he has i\u00f1 this committed an error, the court cannot entertain a doubt. Th\u00e9 sheriff\u2019s bond is an; annual bond, and the securities of each year ate responsible for tli\u00e9 neglects, defaults, acts and receipts, of their principal, during th\u00e9 tim\u00e9 only between giving the bond passed by them; arid the execution of the next year\u2019s bond by the sheriff. From the date of the process referred to, the sheriff must have remained in office in the year 1816; which he could not have don\u00e9, without executing a further sheriff\u2019s bond in the Fall of 1815. The securities in this last bond are liable for the money received under th\u00e9 <em>fieri </em>facias; if any persons ar\u00e9 liable for it, and not the appellants, who were securities in the bond executed in December 1814. The law question thus disposed of by the' arbitrator, he intended to decide according to law, but as he was not informed, and decided erroneously, his determination is not agreeable to his own wishes, and his award ought to h\u00e1ve been set aside on the motion made to the court below for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">It is to be observed, that this is not a distinct question of law, decided by an arbitrator selected by the parties, for the purpose of finally settling a law point between them. When such a case occurs, it will perhaps be the court\u2019s opinion that they are bound to abide by the award, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>be it right 61* wrong. <em>Price vs. Hollis, </em>1 Maule <em>&amp; Selw. </em>107. The parties here, referred to the arbitrator all matters in variance between them, including questions of right and fact, Witlio\u00fat the slightest intimation from any quarter, that \u00edh\u00e9 \u00bfccouht\u00e1bility of the appellants, for the receipts of the sheriff in the year 1816, was tobe considered and decided on by him: \u00ed\u00f1 \u00e1 case of general submission like tins; the authorities are clear that an award found-fed on a mistake in law of the arbitrator is for this reason impehchable. <em>Kent vs. Elstob, </em>3 <em>East, </em>18. <em>Young vs. Walter, </em>9 <em>Ves. </em>364. We therefore, disapprove of the judgment of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, and determine that it be Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00edudsm\u00edint reversed:</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
