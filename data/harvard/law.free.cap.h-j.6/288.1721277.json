This suit was fully argued by the counsel on each side. Since which the proceedings have been considered. The bill, which was filed in August 1811, states that <em>Frederick Milts, </em>having a life estate in a tract of land called <em>Oliver\u2019s Feck, </em>on which he resided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the remainder in fee being in one <em>William Conner, </em>he <em>Conner </em>in or about the year 1790, sold the reversion or remainder in fee to the said <em>Mills </em>for \u00a3150; that the whole purchase money was paid; and that <em>Mills </em>held the possession lili his death, and that re had been held since his death by his representatives. The bill further states, that part of the purchase money was paid at the time the contract was made, and a bond given for the balance of the purchase money, Which bond liad been since discharged.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b296-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Where a bill m chancery stated that R\u00ed liad a life estate in all the tract of land called <em>Oliver's Neck, </em>the remainder in fee being1 in C, and that C sold to M all his interest in the land: that the purchase money was paid by M, \u25a0who retained the iiossesdon of the and until his death, and that his representatives, the complainants. afterwards retained possession; although the testimony did not establish the complainants\u2019 claim to the extent stated m the bill, yet\u2018it proved &amp; contract between C and M ftr one fourth part of the tract* that the purchase money \\va\u00ab paid by M, and the possession of the land permitted to be retain\u00bb td by him under the <em>contract </em>\u2014 Held, that the complainants were entitled to a conveyance of the one fourth part of the tract \u2014 that permitting the possession to be retained by M, under the circumstances of the case, was equivalent to an actual delivery, and with the payment of the purchase money, took it out of the statute of frauds</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b296-15\">In equity, as at la w, the <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata </em>must, to a certain extent, agree But where the question is only the extent of relief, the complainant may be permitted to recover only part of what he claims.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b296-16\">The answer of a defendant to a bill in chancery, in a former cause, is not legal evidence in a cause \u00ab.gainst his representatives relative to the same tvanvtctions</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b296-17\">The answer of a defendant, professing a want of knowledge of the facts of the bill, cannot be considered as evidence against the fasts; <em>ip </em>only legal effect is to compel the complainant to establish .them by testimony</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The prayer of the bill is for a conveyance from the defendants, as the heirs of the said <em>Conner.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-5\">The defendants have Hied their answers, denying any knowledge of the sale alleged, and three of them, relying 'on the statute of frauds; and testimony has been taken under a commission issued for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">It was contended for the complainants, that the 'contract for sale was proved by some of the witnesses, and that the statute had no effect, the contract being in part executed by the payment. The defendant\u2019s counsel denied the proof of the contract, or any payment under if\u2014 objected to the want of dates and ces'iamty, and contested the part execution either by payment or giving' possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-7\">The contract set forth is very uncertain. The sale is said to have been made some time in or about the year 1730. It is not said what part of the purchase money was paid, or what was the balance for which the bond was given, or when that bond was paid. A bond of conveyance is spoken of, and its loss suggested, but as a matter of doubt or conjecture, and if is not shown how <em>Mills </em>had a life estate in the whole of the land. The uncertainty is increased by comparing the present bill with the bill filed 'by <em>Mills </em>himself, for an injunction in 1799, which is referred to in the proceedings, and in which the contract is stated to have been made in a different manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-8\">The evidence under the commission is contradictory, and part of it highly improbable and suspicious; and a decree founded on it would be contrary to the intent of the statute of frauds and perjuries, which was to prevent persons from swearing verbal agreements upon others, though they had never been made. There is not sufficient proof of a payment amounting to a part performance of the agreement, and the possession was merely a continuance \u00a9f that before held by <em>Mills.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>It is to be observed, that on the death of <em>Mills, </em>after the injunction on his bill filed in 1799 was dissolved, the suit abated, and it was in the power of his heirs to revive. that suit founded- on <em>Mills\u2019s </em>own statement of the contract, or to bring a new suit at their election. They chose the latter course, whereby the defendants are deprived of the benefit of the answer of <em>William Courier jin </em>that suit;'but the bill is evidence to show th\u00e9 variai\u00edc\u00e9; The note mentioned in the .bill as exhibit No. 1, and as recognising the sale, is not found among the papers; On these grounds I consider, that the court in the'exercise of its discretionary power, ought not to make a decree for a conveyance, as prayed. <em>Decreed,' </em>that the bill of the complainants be dismissed, with costs.

Although the testimony does not establish the complainants\u2019 claiia to the extent stated in the bill, it clearly\" proves a contract between <em>William Conner </em>and <em>Frederick Mills, </em>for one fourth part of <em>Oliver\u2019s Meek-, </em>that the purchase money was paid by <em>Mills., </em>and the possession of the land permitted to be retained by him, under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The bill states, that <em>Mills </em>had a life estate in all the, tract called <em>Oliv&amp;r\u2019.s Neck, </em>the remainder in fee being in <em>Conner, </em>and that <em>Conner, </em>sold to <em>Mills </em>all his interest in the said land; that the purchase money was paid by <em>Mills, </em>who retained the possession of the \u2018land until his death, and since his death the same has been held by his representatives. The answers filed to this bill deny all knowledge of the sale. The respondents rely upon an answer filed by their father, <em>William Conner, </em>to a bill against him in his life-time, and the statute of frauds, and leave the. complainants to their proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">The answer of <em>William Conner, </em>the father, is not legal evidence in this cause, and therefore no reliance has been placed on it in forming our decision, The answers of the, respondents to this bill, professing a want of knowledge of the transaction, cannot be considered as evidence against the contract; their only <em>legal </em>effect, is to cpmpel the coajr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>plainants to produce testimony to establish i,t. Three witnesses have been offered for that purpose by the complain\u00bb ants, and two have been produced,by the respondents. Some facts are established by this testimony, beyond contradiction. They all agree that <em>Mills </em>was, in possession of this tract of land; that he held three-fourths of it for life, as tenant by the curtesy. They also prove a-contract between <em>Conner </em>and <em>Mills </em>for the sale of this'land, but they <em>differ </em>as to the <em>extent </em>of that contract. The witnesses for the complainants set up a contract for the sale of the whole tract. The respondents prove a sale of one-fourth part of it..</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\">The evidence given on the part of the complainants is. \u25a0uncertain, contradictory and unsatisfactory, and as the-chancellor correctly observes, a part of it highly improbable and suspicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">But what objection can pi\u2019evail against the testimony of Mr. <em>Weems? </em>He is a witness produced and relied on by the respondents, themselves.. No attempt has been made-to impeach his character; he appears to be conversant with the whole transaction; he was called on-as a <em>common </em>friend; he received his information from, both parties, and his attention Was particularly directed to this subject. Mr. <em>Weems </em>declares, that both <em>Conner </em>and <em>Mills </em>had informed him there was a sale of one-fourth part of this land by <em>Conner </em>to <em>Mills, </em>and that <em>Mills </em>had. paid <em>all </em>the purchase money for it. This is a witness produced by the respondents, and appears to us lobe conclusive <em>upon, th cm. </em>How then could: the- chancellor decree that the complainants were entitled <em>to </em>no relief in equity? Thai they were note, entitled toa conveyance of the <em>whole </em>tract, we, concur with him in opinion; but we clearly think they were entitled' to the conveyance of the one-fourth part of it. The <em>whole </em>purchase money waspaid, and the possession, although not delivered at that time by the vendor, (which could not, be done, the vendee being <em>then </em>in possession,1) was permitted to be held and retained by <em>Mills. </em>This, under the circumstances of the case, was equivalent to an actual delivery, and with the payment o\u00ed the purchase money, took it .out of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">It is certainly a correct principle b'oth in equity and at law, that the <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata </em>must, to a certain extent, agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The parly shall not ba permitted eilber at law, or ia equity, to set up in his declaration or bill, one contract, and obtain relief on another of an entire <em>different character. </em>This would be groat injustice \u2014 -1\u2020 would take the tie, fendaut by ^surprise, and might deprive him of property, which he had no opportunity to defend. But where the question is only the <em>extent </em>of relief, innumerable cases may be produced, where the plaintiff may be permitted to recover only part of what he claims. In this case the respondents cannot complain of surprise or want of opportunity to defend, for our decree is founded on the testimony offered by them. If a doubt, however, could have been enter\u00bb tained upon this point, it is put to rest by a decision of this! court, in the case of <em>Graham &amp; wife against Yates &amp; others, (ante 229,) </em>where a bill was filed upon a supposed contract for the sale of a <em>whole square </em>of <em>Hampstead Hilt. </em>The chancellor decreed, <em>that the </em>complainants were not entitled to the <em>whole </em>square as stated in their bill, but only to a <em>part of it, </em>and decreed a conveyance of <em>that part, </em>upon the payment of the purchase money. Tisis decree was affirmed by this court at the present term.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The counsel may prepare a decree of this court,, reversing the decree of the chancellor, and decreeing a convey\" anee of one undivided fourth part of <em>Oliver\u2019s Keck, </em>by whatever name it may be called, lobe made by the appellees to the appellants, to be held by them as tenants in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">DECREE REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
