The defendant then, to corroborate the testimony of the said deponent, offered to prove by a good and competent witness, that said Kingsmore, two or three days after the birth of the child mentioned in the deposition, and before the date of the deposition, did declare the same facts stated as. he had deposed to.

And where the credibility of a witness is attacked by the opposite party, his prior declarations may be given in evidence to show his consistency. We think, therefore, that the court below erred <em>in </em>not suffering the evidence offered in this case in support of the testimony of <em>Kingsmore, </em>as contained in the deposition, to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">lUyGMENT REVERSED, AND PROCEDENDb AWARDED\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
