The appellants filed their bill against the appellees, claiming the entire' interest in two parcels of land in <em>P lince-George's </em>county, of which <em>Bladen Craycroft, </em>the ancestor of- both the appellants and the appellees, died seized, and asking qf the court to make, \u00e1 partition of these lands between the appellants. The facts set forth in the bill, and- which are admitted by the answers are, that <em>Bladen Craycroft, </em>who was the fa-J ther of the appellants, and-grandfather of the appellees^ being seized of- the lands in question, by his will, dated the 16th of December 1813, devised them to the appellants, and to his son <em>J. P. Craycroft, </em>the father of the appellees, and brother of tiie appellants, in joint tenancy. After the date of the will, and before the testator\u2019s death, <em>J. P. </em>Craycroft,'the father of-the appellees, died intestate, leaving the appellees his heirs at law. And the question was, whether they have any and- what interest in the land so devised? The county court \u00a3Johnson, Ch. J, and <em>Key, </em>A. J.] in the reasons given for their decree, stated that by the fourth section of the act of 1810, <em>ch. </em>34, it is express-; , <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ly enacted, that \u201cno devise, legacy or bequest, shall lapse or fail of taking effect by reason of the death of any devisee or legatee, but every such devise, legacy or bequest, shall have the same effect and operation in law to transfer the right, estate and interest* in the property mentioned in such devise or bequest, as if such legatee had survived the testator,\u201d language more strong, can be hardly conceived, that would more effectually have secured the interest of the defendants,-- <em>decreed, </em>that the complainants are each entitled to one equal third part of the land devised, and that the defendants* the heirs of the devisee, are entitled equally to the remaining third, pari; but inasmuch as it doth not appear to the court whether the interest of the parties will be advanced by a partition or sale, it is adjudged thatT.T. S, &amp;c. be appointed commissioners, &amp;c. From this decree the complainants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b62-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>J, </em>by bis will, \u00bfRevised his lands-to his three <em>ions' C </em>and D, iff \u00bfo\u00ednt-tenaney, in <em>fee B </em>died in the lifetime of the tos-\u2019 tator \u2014 f/e/rf, that the devise did'not lapse, bur on the death of the testator, <em>C </em>ami <em>D </em>took the whole interest by survivorship; and not being; a , lapsed devise, is yiot within the provisions of the Set of 1$ 10, <em>ch\u00bb </em>34</headnotes>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b63-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The cause was argued before Chase, Ch.

Craycroft </em>died in the life-time of the testator. In law, the devise was not thereby extinguished; it did hot lapse, but on the death of the testator, the appellants took the whole interest by survivorship. It is not then Within the provision of the act of assembly, riot being iii law a lapsed devise; and it would be straining overmuch to consti\u00fa'e that to be a lkpsed devis\u00e9; which, the law holds to be otherwise; for the purpose.of bringing it within the act. The legislature only intended to make provision for \u00e1 case\u00bb Which before was not provided for by law; by giving life an,d effect \u00ed\u00f3 \u00e1 devise br bequest which otherwise would be inoperative; aiid not to giy\u00e9 tb an bp\u00e9r\u00e1tive devise or bequest an effect different fr\u00f3ni that which the law before gave; and thus to change the legal, course Of the property, and td give t\u00ed) it a neW direction, by changing the character of the est\u00e1te created by the will; as to turn an estate in joint terianby into an estate in common] which would be the effect of so' construing the act of assembly, as in the event bf the death cf on\u00e9 of two joint devisees or legatees in the life-timfe of the \u2018testatbr, to destroy the right of survivorship, arid to give to the heirs\u2019 or representatives of the deceased devisee or legatee; one' half bf the estate, as is contended for in this' cases. But that would be to strain th\u00e9 act rather too fai;, iii otder tb apply it to \u00e1 cas\u00e9 not within th\u00e9 riiiseliief intended to b\u00e9 remedied, riot tb preserve, and giv\u00e9 life arid \u00e9ffect to a devis\u00e9 of bequest, that would otherwise be extinguished, but tb divest \u00e1 subsisting and operative devise or bequest of its legal character and effect; which was not the object of the law. It was only intended to prevent the extinguishment of \u00e1 devise or be^ quest, by reason bf the death of the devisee or l\u00e9gat\u00e9e ill the life-time of the testator, when; in the event of Suclq death; the-devise or bequest would; Without the aid of the legislature, have lapsed; of failed to take effect, and the deceased have died intestate in relation to the prbpe'rty therein mentioned, and to give to- such devise or bequest the legal effect and operation to pass the property, in the same manner as if the devisee or legatee liad survived the testator, in- order merely to prevent the intestacy of the deceased. Therefore, where the devise or bequest would not have lapsed or failed to' take effect by reason of the death of a. devisee or legated in the lifetime of the testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>tor, as in this case, it is not within the mischief intended', or required to Be remedied, and the act of assembly does hot apply, hut such devise or bequest is left to its own operation in law. But suppose that in this case, without the aid of th,e act of assembly, the devise would have lapsed or failed t\u00f3 take effect, inconsequence of the death <em>(s\u00ed John </em>P\u201e <em>Craycroft </em>in the life-time of lire testator, what would be the effect of the act? Why, not \u00ed\u00f3 alter the nature of the estate, and turn it ini\u00f3 a tenancy id common, as between the appellants and the heirs at law of <em>John P. Craycroft, </em>but to resuscitate the devise, and give to it the effect and operation to pass the estate in the same likiiner as if he had survived the testator; and if he had s\u00faridv\u00e9d the testator, but died afterwards, leaving the appellants his survivors-, they would hav\u00e9 taken the whole by survivorship^ therefore', the operation of the act being to pass the estate, as if he liad survived the testator, the right of survivorship would not be taken away from the appellants, but the property would pass to them just as if he had died after the death of the testator. In any view, then, that we are able to take of the subject-, the entire interest in the estate, devised by <em>Bladen Craycroft </em>to <em>John P. Craycroft </em>and the appellants, survived to the appellants, to the exclusion of the heirs at law of <em>John P. Craycroft.</em></p>\n<p id=\"pA-F\">DECREE REVERSED</p>\n<p id=\"AsP\">And decreedj that the county court of <em>Prince- George\u2019s </em>county proceed on the bill of complaint in the proceedings mentioned, and cause partition of the lands, in the bill mentioned, to be made between <em>C. fy G. </em>Craycroft, the Appellants, according to the prayer of their bill.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
