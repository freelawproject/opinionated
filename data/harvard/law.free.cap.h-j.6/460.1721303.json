The bill of the complainant,. (now appellee,) fil\u00e9d, against <em>William Beanes, </em>and <em>Stephen </em>and. <em>Richard W. West, </em>(the appellants,) on the 16th of September 1818, stated, that on the 9th of April 1798, <em>Hannah West, </em>deceased, being seized of a large real estate, by deed conveyed to said Beanes, his heirs ,and assigns, all her real estate, in trust for her\u2018own use during the term of! her natural life, and from and after h\u00e9r death to be equally divided between her sons, the said. <em>Stephen </em>and <em>Richard TV. West, </em>as tenants in common, in tail. That the trust so created for the benefit of <em>Stephen </em>and, <em>Richard </em>was, upon the express proviso and condition that they should, before they received any benefit thereof, or estate or interest therein, pay, or cause to be paid, or secure to be\u201dpaid, the .sum \u2022 of <em>\u00a3500 </em>current money to each of the grand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>daughters of the said <em>Hannah, </em>to wit, <em>Maria Oden, </em>and, <em>Hannah Oden, at </em>their arrival at the age of sixteen years, or day of marriage, which ever should first happen; that is, the said <em>Stephen </em>and <em>Richard </em>were to be respectively liable each to pay <em>\u00a33,50 </em>current <em>money to </em>each of the said grand\" daughters. That on the Slst of January 1812, the said <em>Hannah Oden </em>arrived at the age of sixteen years, and on the 1st of October 1812, intermarried with the complainant, w ho became entitled to receive of the said <em>Stephen </em>the said sum of \u00a3250, and of the said <em>Richai d </em>the said sum of <em>\u00a3'\u00a350; </em>the condition of the <em>estates </em>granted in tfust for their use as aforesaid being the payment of the said sums \u00a9f -money; and which estates the said <em>Stephen </em>and <em>Richard </em>agreed to accept upon that condition. That the right and interest of the complainant\u2019s wife was and became a vested, and not a contingent interest, at the execution of the said deed by the said <em>Hannah West, </em>and that no subsequent circumstances could preclude her, or her legal representatives, from claiming or receiving the same when the period of payment arrived. That o\u00edr the 8th of October 1813, Hannah, the wife of the complainant died, and thereupon, the right to the said sum of \u00bf\u00a3500 devolved upon the com ] plain ant. That in April 1815, <em>Hannah West </em>also died,, \u00bfnd <em>Stephen </em>and <em>Richard </em>thereupon took possession of the estates granted to them as aforesaid, in trust for their use, according to the form of the gift and conveyance aforesaid, and now hold and occupy the same; but neither the said <em>Stephen </em>and <em>Richard </em>then, nor when the complainant\u2019s wife arrived at the age of 16 years, nor on the day of her intermarriage aforesaid, nor since those periods, paid, or caus\u00e9 to be paid, to the complainant\u2019s wife, or to the complainant) or secured to be paid, the said sums of current money in the said indenture specified, in pursuance of the condition therein stipulated, which condition enured to the benefit of the complainant\u2019s wife during her life,, and to the complainant as'aforesaid since her death; nor hath the said <em>William Reanea </em>taken any steps, or instituted any, proceedings at law or in equity to compel the said <em>Stephen </em>\u00bfnd <em>Richard </em>to comply with and perform the condition aforesaid, by the payment of the said sums of money, with interest thereon, or by giving security to pay the same; but the said <em>Stephen </em>and <em>Richard, </em>(although thereto often requested,) and each of them, have, and hath hitherto\u2019wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>refused, &amp;c. <em>Prayer, </em>that <em>Beanes, </em>may be.enforced to ex* ecute the trust, and that <em>Stephen </em>and <em>Richard </em>may be com-, pelled to pay to the complainant the sums of. money re ? spectively due from, them and unpaid, &amp;c. The <em>subpoena </em>which issued against the defendants was served on <em>Stephen West </em>only, and on his nonappear.ance at the return day,. (April 1819,) an attachment of contempt was ordered and issued against him, and the <em>subpoena </em>renewed against the, other defendants, returnable, to the September term 1819\u00bb At that term these process were returned not executed,, and the cause was continued until the following term. At, the next term, (December 181.9,) the cause was further con-, tinued until April following. At the last mentioned term, (April 1820,) neither of the defendants appearing, the at-, tachment and <em>subpoena </em>were again renewed, returnable to, the following June term, when the sheriff returned that he. had attached <em>Stephen, </em>and summoned the other defendants\u00bb On motion of the complainant, the sheriff, was. ordered to. bring into court, at the next term, .the body; of the said, <em>Stephen, </em>and attachments of contempt were, ordered and, issued against the other defendants. At the next, term, (September 1820,) the sheriff produced the body of <em>Stephen </em>who appeared by his solicitor, and it was. ordered that he. answer the bill. No return was made of the attachments, against the other defendants, and the cause was continued, until the next term. At that term, (December 1820,) the compLainant and <em>Stephen West </em>appeared, and <em>Stephen </em>not having answered the bill, nor the sheriff returned the at-, tachments against the other defendants, the cause was. continued until the next, and in like manner to the two succeeding terms. At September term <em>1821, Beanes </em>and. <em>Richard W. West, </em>having been attached, appeared, and answered the bill. By the answer of <em>Richard W. West, </em>.he admits the facts as stated i,n tire complainant\u2019s bill, (so far at least as they relate to the dates or documents referred to in the bill,) to be true, but states that he never received any advantage from the property conveyed to his brother and himself, until after the decease of his mother, |n.l815, and that the property has not yet been divided between his brother and himself. That lie was not aware that he was in law or equity liable for the payment of the money demanded by the complainant, more especially as he, always considered the claim unfounded, either in ho-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Sui\u00fab or justice. <em>Beanes, </em>by his answer, states that he was named as the trustee in a certain deed executed by <em>Hannah West, </em>of the purport of the deed exhibited by this Complainant with his bill. That he is not interested in the event of the said suit, and as for the facts stated in the said bill, that it is incumbeut on the complainant to prove them, if disputed by the other defendants, who only are interested, he having no precise recollection of the dates referred toj and he prays he may be hence dismissed, &amp;c. The cause was then continued to the next, and to the succeeding terms, <em>Stephen West </em>still being in contempt for not an&amp;wering the bill. At April term 1822, it was on motion, ordered that <em>Stephen West </em>answer by the fourth 'day of the following term, and on the service of the order on him, and his default to answer by that time, that tlie bill as to him should be taken <em>pro confesso. </em>At the next term, (September 1822$) the defendants filed in court a copy of the will of <em>Hannah West </em>(admitted to have been 82 years of age in 1815, whdn she died,) dated the 24th of November 1813, and executed in the presence of one witness only, whereby among cither things, she gave and bequeathed to her son <em>Richard W. West, </em>\u201call tlie remaining part of all my estate and property of every nature and kind, which is not herein otherwise disposed of, of which I may die possessed or entitled to.\u201d On motion of the complainant, the court [Stephen, Ch. J. and <em>Key, </em>A. J.] passed the following decree: \u201cThe bill, answers and exhibits, in this case being considered by the court, and the bill as against <em>\u00a1Stephen West, </em>one of the defendants, being taken <em>pro confesso, </em>it is thereupon adjudged, ordered and decreed, this 9th of September 1822, by the said court, that the said <em>Stephen West </em>pay to the complainant the sum of \u00a3250 current money, with legal interest thereon from tlie 31st of January 1812, till paid; and that the said <em>Richard W. West </em>pay also unto the complainant the like sum of <em>\u00a3250 </em>current money, with the like interest thereon; and that the said <em>William Beanes </em>be hence dismissed with his reasonable costs.\u201d From this decree <em>Stephen </em>and <em>Richard W.

The deed of trust from <em>Hannah West </em>to <em>William Beanes, </em>contains a settlement of her landed estate on her family, and is tQ be expounded most favourably to promote and effectuate her intentions. It is a deed of bargain and sale, and the uses raised thereby are not operated upon by the statute of uses, further than to vest the legal estate in fee in <em>William Beanes, </em>subject to the trusts therein mentioned, which arc ail executory. The chief object of the settlement is to preserve the estate to her sons, and their children, and to transmit it to the. latter unincumbered with debts. Next to this in importance is the provision for securing the payment by her sons to her granddaughters, of portions of <em>\u00a3300 </em>\u00e9ach, payable when they shall arrive \u00e1t 16 years of age, of tearry. Both these objects are intended to be answered through the instrumentality of the trust estate^ by conveying the lands to the trustee, and his heirs, to hold the same in moieties for the use of her sons, <em>Sleph\u00e9n West </em>and <em>Richard IV. </em>West5 provided that they shall, before they receive any benefit or interest under the trust, pay, or cause to be paid, or secure to be paid, five hundred pounds current money to each of the granddaughters, <em>Maria Oden. </em>and <em>Hannah Oden, </em>at their arrival at the age of sixteen years, or day of marriage, which shall first happen. At the time of the settlement <em>Hannah W est </em>was an old woman, but having lived to a very advanced age, she unexpectedly to herself outlived her granddaughter <em>Hannah Oden, </em>who arrived at the age of 16 in the spring of 1812, married the complainant, <em>George W. Biscoe, </em>in the fall of that year, and died the succeeding fall. <em>Hannah W1st </em>departed this life in 1815, and her sons, <em>Stephen West </em>and <em>Richard W. West, </em>immediately after took possession of her landed estate, and have continually enjoyed it since, without having paid, or secured to be paid to their nieCe, <em>Hannah Oden, </em>or her representatives, the portion of \u00bf2500, or any part of it. In 1818 <em>George W. Biscoe, </em>the surviving husband, filed his bill in <em>Prince-George\u2019s </em>county court, on the equity side thereof, against <em>William Beanes, </em>the trus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>tee, and the sons <em>Stephen. West </em>and <em>Richard W. </em>West; id enforce the execution of the trust, and to compel the .said <em>Stephen West </em>and <em>Richard W. West </em>to pay to the complain\u00e1nt the portion thus given to his deceased wife. The facts of the bill are not denied by the answers of the trustee, and <em>Richard Wt West, </em>and they' are taken <em>pro confesso </em>against <em>Stephen West </em>for the want of an answer. The chancery jurisdiction beloW decreed \u00e1 dismissal of the bill as to the trustee; and a payrhent of the portion, with interest by <em>Stephen WTest </em>and <em>Richard W. West, </em>considering them under a personal obligation in equity to'pay it. This decree this court have to revise and decide upon, ahd particularly they have to decide; whether it can be sustained as an adjudication <em>in personam.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGPB\">The court have reflected maturely ort this case; and have examined all the authorities within their reach, that havfe any bearing upon it. That the portion claimed is a charge in equity upon the estate conveyed in trust, we have no question; although the grantor has not in express terms made it so, The clause directing it to be paid, or secured to be' paid, before her Sons entered upon the beneficial Use of the estate, was evidently introduced in favour of her granddaughter; to accelerate the payment to her, and strongly implies a charge \u00abport tlie estate; and particularly in the event of the sons refusing to accept it, on the ground of its .insufficiency to p\u00e1y the portion; That the clause is to be viewed in this light, is amply proved by the authorities, and more especially by the cas\u00e9 of <em>Wallis </em>vs. <em>Crimes, </em>to be found in 1 <em>Cases in Chan. </em>89; which, as to this point, may be considered a parallel case, and will therefore be circumstantially adverted to. The father of Sir <em>George Crimes </em>conveyed his estate to trustees in fee; upon the trusty that if Sir <em>'George, </em>within six months after his father\u2019s' death, secured to the trustees <em>\u00a3500 </em>for the benefit of Sir <em>George\u2019s </em>younger children, then (after such security first given to the trustees) to convey the premises to Sir <em>George </em>and his heirs; and until the time limited 'for giving the security, the trustees to stand seized to the use of Sir <em>George\u2019s </em>eldest son, (Sir <em>Thomas </em>Crimes,) for his mainlenance; and in default of such security; the trustees, at the request of Sir <em>George\u2019s </em>eldest son, to convey to him. Without giving the security, or in any way respecting the trust. Sir <em>George </em>entered upon the estate, and considering it .as, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>bis absolute property, demised it for a long term of years,\u2019 by way of mortgage, to secure the payment of a sum of money, and died. The executors of the mortgagee exhibited their bill against Sir <em>Thomas </em>Crimes, and the trustees, to enforce a redemption, or to hold discharged of equity, and the court of chancery decreed, upon a view of all the facts, including the conveyance in trust, that the executors hold and enjoy the premises as a security of the mortgage money and interest, against the defendants, and all claiming under them, <em>charged with the \u00a3500 </em>to dir <em>George Crimes's </em>younger children, from the time the plaintiff came into possession, unless the defendant, Sir <em>Thomas </em>Crimes, should pay the mortgage money and interest, by a given day. Upon a bill of review, Lord Keeper <em>Bridgemun </em>refused to reverse the decree, and declared he looked upon the condition precedent to be in the nature of a penalty, and that he would regard the intent of the trust, which was to secure the <em>\u00a3500 </em>to the younger children.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\">If the portion claimed by the surviving husband is thus a charge upon the land, is he constrained to follow it in the bands of the trustee; and is he, without remedy in equity against <em>Stephen West </em>and <em>Richard W. West, </em>on their personal obligation to pay itih</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">We have to confess, that we should-regret to find- ourselves under the necessity of answering either branch of this proposition in the affirmative, lor we verily think, the appellants are bound in conscience to fulfil the wishes of their aged parent, and to pay this portion, according to her intentions, unequivocally expressed in the settlement. \"We do not, however, feel ourselves under any such necessity, entertaining decidedly as we do the opinion, that the proceeding <em>in personam? </em>and the decree thereon, may in the particular circumstances of this case be sustained on \u2022the strictest principles of equity. The legal estate in the. lands of <em>Hannah </em>West, is by the deed vested in the trustee, who holds them for the <em>use </em>of <em>Stephen West </em>and <em>Richard W. </em>West, which use (distinguished in the trust deed by the epithets \u201cbenefit, estate, <em>interest,\") </em>they were not to enjoy under the trust, until they had paid, or secured to be paid, the portion in controversy. They nevertheless, wholly unmindful of the terms of the settlement, entered as before mentioned into the possession and enjoyment of the granted premises, and had the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>them, and the actual pernancy of the profits, for several years hefore.the bill exhibited, and from thence arises, as think, their personal responsibility to pay the portion sued for by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"AhTa\">If <em>Stephen West </em>and <em>Richard W. West </em>had refused to accept the, grant upon the terms, of the settlement, i.t would haye become the duty of the trustee to interpose, to secure the granddaughters portion, as it was perhaps his duty, to see the portion paid, or secured to be paid by them, before he permitted the enjoyment of the use. They did not, however, refuse, the grant, but on the contrary accepted it, by taking possession of the estate, and enjoying-the rise;, and they thereby admitted its adequacy to pay the portion of the granddaughter. This brings the case within the reason, of. the case of <em>The Attorney General vs. </em>Christ\u2019s <em>Hospital, </em>reported in 3 <em>Brown\u2019s Reports, </em>165, although that case should be said not t.o agree in all its facts with this'. The condition there, was to be performed, sitbse-. quent to the. acceptance of the devise, whereas it. is objected here, that the condition is precedent, and that the. interest did, not vest until the condition was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">However this'objection might, have availed, if <em>Stephen West </em>and <em>Richard W- West </em>bad refused to accept the grant upon the terms of the settlement, it can have no influence on the present decision, when it is considered, that they have bad for years the possession of the estate, and the full enjoyment of the -use, in the same manner, and precisely as if they had performed the condition by paying, or securing tobe paid, the granddaughter\u2019s portion* Instead of paying and possessing, they have chosen to possess without paying; and surely it cannot but be in accordance with the best, principles of equity jurisprudence, <em>to </em>compel them to pay. The possession of the devised property bound <em>Christ, Hospital </em>to a performance, of. the condition annexed to the devise; and in like manner, the possession and enjoyment of <em>Stephen West </em>and <em>Richard W. </em>West, of the use' designed for them, should bind them to. a performance of .the condition, which ought to have been per--, formed, precedent to their possession. The distinction between those two kinds of conditions, as to relief, is more., over trifling, if not nominal, where the ca.se lies in compensation, as this unquestionably does. See <em>Francis\u2019s </em>Maxims, 49. 1 <em>Fonbl. </em>211, 218, and the cases there cited\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>After the nay oi payment, the acceptance of compensation may be enforced, \u2018to vest the estate in the party 'not performing, and on principles of reciprocity he should be coerced to make compensation, where by his own act he becomes possessed, of, and lias the fruition of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The opinion that the appellants are under a personal obligation to pay the portion of <em>Hannah </em>Oden, to. her husband aud representative, receives strength, we think, from, other considerations, They have fully admitted the sufficiency of tire granted premises to pay the portion, but the admission does not make it so, nor does it in any mannee appear that it is so. If it is inadequate, the rents and profits must supply the deficiency, and as they have been the receivers for years, they have made themselves personally liable to pay it. These receipts are too within purview of the bill, which charges that <em>Stephen West </em>and <em>Richard </em>W,! <em>West </em>accepted the grant, and possessed themselves of the granted premises, and have, had <em>the </em>enjoyment of them, and prays that they may be compelled to pay. Again, if they had performed the condition, by <em>securing </em>the portion to be paid to <em>Hannah Oden, </em>on her arrival at the age of 1G, or day of marriage, which should first happen, they would have incurred a personal responsibility within the contemplation of the settlement; and it seeips consonant to justice, that they should be exposed to a like liability, by voluntarily placing themselves in the same situation, and taking to themselves the same enjoyments, as if they had performed the condition. The decree below we think right, aud therefore we affirm it,</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">DECREE AFFIRMED,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
