This bill was brought to compel <em>Thomas laics, </em>and his trustees, to convey to the complainants a square of ground called <em>Hampstead Hill, </em>in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>upon au alleged contract by <em>Charles Myers, </em>the father of <em>Matilda Grahame, </em>the female complainant, of whoni she is the only child and heir. The bill asserts the payment of the money, and that in pursuance of the contract, <em>Charles Myers took </em>possession of the property in <em>1797, </em>,and improved and lived upon it until his death in 1800, and that it has been in possess! on of the complainants ever since. The answers denied the contract as <em>to </em>the whole square, but admitted it as to part, viz. a part called <em>Stephen Stnard\u2019s </em>par!; and denied the payment of the purchase money, and possession in <em>Charles, </em>and the complainants, of the whole. The trustees of <em>laics, </em>anil the heirs of <em>Jacob Myers, </em>were willing to convey the admitted part, on receiving the purchase money and \u00ednteres;-. The trustees of <em>Yates </em>claimed the residue of the. square as part of <em>Yates\u2019s </em>est\u00e1te. The heirs of <em>Jacob Myers </em>claimed it as part <em>o\u00ed Jacob Myers\u2019 </em>estate. It wouldbe impracticable to give a cleay or specific view of the grounds of these pretences of title, by the respective defendants, without giving a voluminous detail of facts. The claim of the heirs of <em>Jacob Myers </em>involved the consideration, how far certain judgments and sales by <em>fieri facias, </em>and recovery in ejectment, and sales under a decree in chancery, were competent to divest the title of <em>Jacob Myers.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-12\">Kilty, Chancellor, decreed a conveyance for <em>Stephen Si,yard\u2019s </em>part only, and that on payment of the whole purchase money and interest.

Myers </em>and <em>Thomas </em>I <em>alts, </em>which the. complainants seek to have enforced, but which is denied by Fetes in bis answer, is not sustained to the extent claimed; we think too, that the payment of money, which is also denied in. the answer of <em>Yates, </em>is not sufficiently proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The decree of the Chancellor is therefore affirmed with-put costa.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
