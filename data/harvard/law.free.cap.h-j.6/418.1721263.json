This was in the winter 1817, and before the hiring of the negroes mentioned in the agreement; the price of the hands was imt limited, but <em>Key </em>was requested not to exceed $8Q each.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The defendant also proved, that <em>Heath </em>resided', at the time* of the agreement, in the neighbourhood of Baltimore, and-had* done so long before and did long after; and that <em>Heath </em>was always, up to the year 1819, generally known as aman of character and* of high pecuniary credit. That the intestate, at the time of making- the agreement, communicated to -the plaintiff that the slaves were for the use of <em>Heath, </em>and that he was authorised- by <em>Heath </em>to hire them; and. further, that <em>Heath </em>had been at <em>Chaptico, </em>in <em>Saint Mary\u2019s-. </em>county, the year before the agreement was made, and hired a good-many slaves in the said county. jHie defendant then prayed the opinion of the court to'the'jury, that the letter of <em>Key, </em>the defendant\u2019s testator, wap not evidence, in the cause, and-that said testator was acting as agent in making said agreement, and therefore was not liable in this*, action. But the.court, <em>[Plater </em>A, J.] refused to give this opinion, and. allowed, said letter to be read in evidence to the jury; and further directeddhe jury, that it was the opinion of the court, from the face of the agreement, and the other evidence, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover\u00bb The defendant excepted; and. the verdict and judgment being for the. plaintiff,-the defendant appealed to this court..</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-3\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch.

Let it for the moment be admitted, that matter <em>de hors </em>the written instrument itself may be resorted to in explanation of the meaning of the agreement of the 9th of January, yet the letter of the 12th of January cannot be received for that purpose; it is no part of the <em>res gesta </em>intended to be contained in the agreement on which this action has been instituted; it is a proceeding subsequent in point of time, relating entirely to a different subject, and being'irrelevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>to the matter in issue in the cause, is wholly, inadmissible as evidence before the jury. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">In refusing the prayer of the defendant as to the agency of the testator, and in instructing the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, this court think that the county court also erred Wherever, upon the face of an agreement, a party contracting plainly appears to be acting as , the agent of another, the stipulations of the contract are to be considered as operating solely to bind the principal; unless it manifestly appears by the terms of the instrument that the agent intended to superadd or substitute bis ownt responsibility for that of his principal. In such case, and in such case only, if acting within the scope of his powers, is he personally answerable. No such intentipp is manifested by the present agreement; it states that the negroes were hired for the use of <em>Richard K. </em>Heath, and the stipulation to pay is made, in so many terms <em>on his behalf} </em>thereby repelling any inference that might otherwise be drawn, to in.v\u00f3lve him personally on this contract. A much stronger case than the present was decided by the court of appeals, of this state at June term, 1804; reported in <em>1 Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>156, <em>M\u2018Donough vs. Templeman. </em>There, although, in the introductory part of the agreement the defendant describes himself as acting on behalf of his principal, yet when' he stipulates for the payment of the hire of the negroes, without any express reference or allusion to his principal, he binds himself in, precisely the same t\u00e9rros that he would have used had it been the intention of iha parties that lie alone, and not those for whom he contracted, was to be bound for the debt. Yet the court of appeals, looking to the intentions of the parties, as deducidle from the relative situation, in which they stood, determined that the engagements of the defendant, although by the expressions used involving himself only, were to be understood as referring to his representative character, and not as inducing any personal liability on him. In the case at bar-, the defendant\u2019s testator, in the very clause of the agreement on which this action is founded, states in express terms, that he agrees <em>on behalf </em>of his principal to pay; thereby evincing the most unequivocal intention not to-pledge his own personal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The court dissent from the opinions given by tire court, below, and therefore reverse their judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
