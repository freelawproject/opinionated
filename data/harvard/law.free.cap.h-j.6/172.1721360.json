That the same practice h\u00e9 believes prevailed before the year 1806, and as far back as' he lias any knowledge or remembrance of banking and commercial'transactions. The, only exception to this universal- practic'd*,' as far as his recollection serves him, was in the -case of one of the banks of <em>Baltimore, </em>which occasionally put into Ids hands, for protest, notes drawn by persons'residing'in <em>Washington, </em>and gave direction's, through the bank 'there, 'in' such cases, to demand payment on the third day of grace;' The instruction from ail other distant banks was to 'demand and, give notice and protest according to the practice prevailing in <em>Washington </em>county.

April 3d of the same year, and not being paid, it was protested according to custom, and now remains unpaid by either maker or end or sor. It appears also, that the., parties asked a renewal of this note on the 6th of April 1815, which the board agreed to conditionally, (by a general entry on that day, in these.words: \u201cwhen names are right, notes formal, and discounts paid,\u201d) from the.circumstance of the notes not being regularly entered up. |t is evident, that from one or other of; tlie'causes above stated, the note was protested.

The plaintiffs also examined <em>Samuel Cruise, </em>and having produced a paper containing copies of the note of the 2d of February 1815, and the 'protest thereof op the <em>7th </em>of) April 1815, stated, that the same was his hand-writing; that, at the time the same was written, and at the time of the date of said protest, he was the clerk of <em>Walter </em>Smith, the notary public, and that he recorded said protest, and-that said paper is taken from his notarial book; that he made, the demand and'protest, and gave notice to the endorsors, as. stated in the s\u00e1id paper below the note of <em>George Magruder. </em>The said witness further gaye testimony, that from the best information which was obtained at the time of tlje protest, the defendant\u2019s intestate was then living near. <em>George Town, </em>and it was usual to forward notices or. letters to him through the <em>George Town </em>post office, addressed to him near <em>George Town. </em>The defendant then, proved to the jury, that her intestate, at the time of the. execution and protest of said note, resided three or four miles from <em>Montgomery </em>court-house, and about ten miles from <em>George Town, </em>and had resided ip the same place or, near it ever since the year 1812; that said intestate, during that time, often dealt with the merchants, at <em>Montgomery </em>court-hous?, and was frequently there. That lie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>l\u00edas several years at sea before bis residence at the place aforesaid, and resided in <em>George </em>Ttontillhe was fourteen or fifteen years of age, at which time he tvent to sea, and after his return was often in <em>George Town, </em>where bib brothers, the drawer arid endorsor of this note, also resided. The plaintiffs then, for the purpose of showing that the defendant\u2019s intestate liad a knowledge of the customs of the banks in <em>George Town, </em>offered to prove, by a competent witness, that tlie defendant\u2019s intestate, before the date of this not\u00e9, and sometime -in 1812 or 1813, received an accommodation in the <em>Union Bank of George Town, </em>on a note drawn by himself, for S5000, which wa.s continued some time in that bank. The defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that \u00bfjpon this testimony the plaintiffs were not entitled t,o recover; \u00bfnd the plaintiffs prayed the court to instruct the jury,, that if they believed, from the evidence, the 'custom herein stated to have been as there stated, and to have been known to the defendant\u2019s intestate at the time of the endorsing of the note aforesaid, then it is competent for then! to presume that the intestate consented to that custom, and agreed that the demand and notice should be conformable to such custom; and that if the jury' believed from the evidence that: (lie notary public used due diligence to ascertain where the intestate lived, and where to address the notice to him, and did address the same td him accordingly, then said iiotice is sufficient; find if they also believed that the demand and notice were made and given according td the custom aforesaid of the said banks, that the plaintiffs \u00e1re entitled to recover. But the court, <em>\\_Ridgely </em>and <em>Kilgour, </em>A. J.] being equally divided in opinion, refused to give either of the instructions prayed. The defendant excepted to the refusal by the court to give the instruction prayed by her, and the plaintiffs excepted to the refusal by the court <em>io </em>give the instruction prayed bv them.

Magruder, </em>the first endorser. The note was drawn by <em>George Ma-grader, </em>on the 2d of February 1815, and made payable to the appellee\u2019s intestate, sixty days after date; and payment of it is stated in the declaration to have been demanded on the 7th of April 1815, which is the day after the usual days of grace.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">The plaintiffs produced <em>George Magruder, </em>and offered to prove by him that the note was discounted at bank, to raise money for <em>Thomas C. Magruder, </em>alleging that he was in truth the drawer, and not entitled to notice. He was objected to on the score of interest, and rejected as an incompetent witnes3 to prove the facts for which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>was produced; and from the rejection has arisen the onlj question this court has to decide on the <em>first </em>bill of excepbons. <em>George </em>Magruder, on the <em>voir dire, </em>expressed his doubts \u00f3f his interest in the event of the cause, and represented it to depend upon the solution of a question; which was not solved by the \u00f3ourt, and which perhaps from his statements they could not ailswer, if it had been their province to decide it. We do not then consider him <em>&amp; </em>witness, declaring hims\u00e9lf on oath to be interested, nor as a witness, believing himself to be so, in neither of which lights has he been contemplated by Us in the opinion wd have Formed on this subject:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Independent of the views he has himself taken of his situation, the true question is, l\u00edas he in fact such a direct interest in the event as ought to exclude him from giving testimony on behalf of the appellants? If he has such an interest, this court has been unable to discover it. A recovery against the administratrix of theendorsor, will put nothing- into his pocket; and as a judgment h\u00e1s already been obtained against him as the drawer of the note, it will not screen him from an execution, which the bank may at any moment issue against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Should the case be established on his testimony against the administratrix, and the principal, interest and costs, recovered of her, she will have her remedy against him as drawer; and it is not easy to perceive how the evidence given by him; or the verdict founded on it, could any way benefit him in the defence he may please to set up to her action. If the account he has spoken of is used in bar of her suit, it must be supported by competent testimony, wholly unconnected, with his narrative concerning the original negotiation between him and the'endorsor; and he can have no advantages in such defence which lie would not have in an action instituted against the administrabas on the same account. A recovery in this cause against the administratrix will carry the costs, and as far \u00e1s they go, will augment her demand against <em>George Magruder; </em>and in this view he may be said to be a witness swearing against his interest. Deeming him every way a competent witness, we think lie ought not to have been prevented from-giving testimony .for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">. The <em>second </em>bill of exceptions embodies all the testimony in this cause. The appellants, who were the plaintiffs ia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the court below, having by competent testimony offered to prove, among other things, that it had been the uniform and unvaried practice andyuslom, from Ihe.year 1792 to the year 1818, of the Bank of Columbia, and of all the ether banks of <em>Washington </em>and <em>George Town, </em>to demand payment of promissory notes, of the drawers thereof, on the day after the <em>last </em>day of grace, and in default of payment, to give notice on the same day to theendorsorg: and having offered, to prove that the endorsar, <em>Thomas C. </em>Magrmler, had a knowledge of this custom, and the universality of it, by showing that in the year 1813 he received an accommodation in the <em>Union Bank of </em>George-Town, on a note drawn, by himself for a considerable sum of money, which was,, continued in that bank; aud having also offered to prove, by the testimony of the clerk of the notary public, that he demanded payment of the note of the drawer, <em>George Metgnnler, </em>on tire seventh day of April 1815, which was refused, and that oa the same day he gave potice of the de<em>maud and </em>refusal to the endorsor, <em>Thomas C. Magruder, </em>in a latter put into <em>the </em>post office in <em>George Town, </em>addressed to him as residing near that place, being previously instructed, by the best information he could get, that he resided near <em>George Toum, </em>and that it was usual to forward notices or letters to. him through the medium of the <em>George Tam </em>post office, addressed to him near <em>George Town, </em>prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they believed, from the evidence the custom to have been as stated, and to have been known to the defeuilaKf\u2019s intestate at the time he endorsed the note, then it was competent to the jury to presume that the intestate consented to the said custom, and agreed that the demand and npt\\ce.shoul4,be conformable to the said custom; and that if the jury believed, from the evidence, that the notary public used due diligence to ascertain where the intestate lived, and where to address the notice to him, and did address the same to him accordingly, then the said notice is sufficient; and if the demand gud notice was made and given according to the aforesaid custom of the banks, then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover. '\u00a3his instruction was refused, and the refusal has given rise to the discussion of several points in this court, two 4tf which we shall proceed briefly to examine. One relates to the time of demand of payment of the drawer of the note, and the other to the legal sufficiency of the. ixotief? given to the endorser.</p>\n<p id=\"As3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The demand was made on the day after the three days 0f grace, and cannot create a responsibility on the endor- . sor, unless <em>it </em>was made in conformity <em>to </em>the established practice and custom of the bank, whic'h were well known and understood by him. Had the prayer been gratified by the court, these facts would have been investigated by the jury, and if established against the endorsor, they would inevitably have led to the conclusion, that he was liable to the plaintiff\u2019s action. A custom like this, brought home to the knowledge of the party dealing with the bank, enters into the essence of the contract, becomes a constituent part of it, apd must have its due weight in the exposition of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The allowance of three days of grace, in the payment of negotiable paper, from long and universal usage, has become\u2019the general law of such, contracts, but it is not such an inflexible rule as admits of no innovations upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">It may be altered and controled by the agreement o\u00ed; the parties, and what is tantamount, it may be changed by' the usage and custom of dealing perfectly known to the parties,' and to which they will be supposed to have had special reference in making their contract. If it was an established and unvaried usage of the Bank of <em>Columbia to </em>exceed the three days \u00f3f grac\u00e9, and to demand payment on the fourth day, and this was well known to <em>Thomas C. Magruder </em>at the time of the endorsement', he is to be supposed to have assented 'to it; and this dep\u00e1rture from the general, rule will be sanctioned, to give eificacy to the contract, and to establish his liability to pay the money. It gives us pleasure to know, that we'are supported in those ideas by the supreme court of the <em>United States. </em>In their late decision of the c\u00e1se of <em>Renner vs. The Bank of Columbia, </em>9 <em>Wheat. Rep. </em>581, they have fully recognized them. The opinion of the court, delivered by Judge <em>Thompson, </em>is an able exposition of the law of commercial contracts, and \"of the\" legal influence the custom and usage of particular banks may have upon them, aiid will unquestionably'be regarded by all as a commanding authority on such- subjects. We close this part of the case with a single remark, in answer to the objection taken on the argument to the declaration in the cause. It is this, that however faulty it may be, in stating the demand on the fourth day , br in omitting to, state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>the custom and the endorser's knowledge o\u00ed. d, upon neither of which points do we now undertake to decide \u2014 the objection cannot at this\u2019time be supported, if there is any thing in the allegation, advantage ought to have been taken of it on demurrer, or perhaps cn the trial, by way of exception to the admissibility of the evidence, and in neither of these forms can it at present be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\">With regard to ihe notice to the endorser oi the demand on, and refusal of p\u00bb,} ment by the drawer, it too would have been examined by the jury, if the instructions asked for on this head had been given by the court. If it had been ascertained by the jury, that the clerk of the notary public had demanded payment of the note of the drawer <em>on </em>the seventh day of April 1815, according to the nsage and custom of the bank before alluded to, and that on the same day he gave notice of the demand and refusal to the endorser, in a letter pat into <em>the </em>post office in <em>George Town, </em>addressed to him as residing near that place, having been previously instructed, by \u2019the best information he could get, that the endorser resided near <em>Georgs Town, </em>and that it was usual to forward notices or letters to him through the medium of the <em>George Tovjn </em>post office, addressed to him near <em>George </em>Town, we can have no doubt that\u2019this would have been sufficient notice to charge the endorser. When the parly to bo <em>nf-. </em>fected'by the notice resides in a different place from the holder, the rule is, that the notice may be sent through the post office to the post office nearest to the party entitled to Such notice. <em>Ireland vs. Kip, </em>11 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>231. <em>Freeman vs. Boynton, 7 Mass. Rep. </em>483. Here the rule we think has teen complied with, considering, as vve must do, the post office at <em>George Town </em>to be the post office nearest to the endorsor, in the absence of all proof that there was a post office nearer to his residence. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">We therefore dissent from the opinions expressed by the uourt below in both of the bills of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">JUDGMENT EEVEESEDj ASM rEOUEDESDO AWAEDm,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
