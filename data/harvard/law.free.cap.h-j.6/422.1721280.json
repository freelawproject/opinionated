This was a special action on the case. The declaration stated, that the defendant, , (now appellee,) on the, 19th of August 1817, was sheriff of <em>\\ Harford </em>county, and as such had sundry executions against \u25a0 the property of the plaintiff^ (now appellant,) placed in his [hands for collection., and which were issued out of <em>Harford t </em>coupty court, op sunijry judgments tliei\u2019ein rendered, against - the plain tiff, in. favour of a certain <em>Buckler Bpnd, </em>amounting &gt; in the whole to about the sum of \u00a74500, and which- executions the defendant had laid upon the plaintiff\u2019s property, <em>\u25a0 </em>and did then and there proceed to advertise the same fop. (sale at public yendue, to satisfy said executions, to wit, ; on the, said 19th of August aforesaid. And that thereupon, the plaintiff, in order to prevent his said property ; from being sacrificed and sold for less than its value, did- : then and there, at the time and place of said <em>sale, agree '\u25a0 </em>with a certain <em>John Watson, </em>to bid in said property for. :the plaintiff, and <em>tq </em>endeavour to ^btairj. from the defen-., dant, until the Monday then next following, to. pay the,, amount of the money due upon said executions. And the plaintiff averred, th^-t the said <em>Wqtson, </em>in conformity with said agreement, did at the sale afores\u00e1id, bid in the said.property for him, and upon his account,'for the sum of \u00a75000, as he understood, and then and. there verily believed. The plaintiff, further averred, that after the said sale was over, the defendant did. then and. there agree to give the plaintiff, and the said <em>Wqtson, </em>until the Monday then next following, to raise the. money and pay said executions. Yet the defendant, nef regarding his said agreement and undertaking, but intending, craftily and fraudulently, to deceive and injure the plaintiff in this particular, and to prevent the plaintiff from retaining said property, or from selling it for what it was fairly and reasonably worth, and of paying said executions out of the proceeds thereof, apd of retaining the balance for himself, but that the same might be held and retained by the said <em>Wafson, </em>by virtue of his bid, for a small part of its actual value, to the great prejudice and injury of the plaintiff, the defendant did then and there, at the county aforesaid, on the day and year last aforesaid, secretly collude with, counsel, advige and aid the said <em>Watson, </em>to hold said pro-i <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\u25a0petty by virtue of his said bid, that thereupon and thereby they the defendant and <em>Watson, </em>might sell the same for \u00e1 larger sum, to wit, for the sum of \u00a78000, which had been ^offered for it previous to said sale, upbn their own account, ai\u2018.&lt;l for their own benefit-, and share the profit thereof between them. And the plaintiff' further averred, that he did obtain the means of paying said executions to said Bond, for which the said property had been sold, by the time agreed upon with the defendant, and did apply to the defendant to receive the full payment thereof with the said <em>Bond, </em>and as he the said <em>Bond </em>had agre\u00e9d, and was willing and desirous to receive the same, and did require that the said executions should be discharged, and the property released; but the defendant then and there totally and absolutely refused to receiv\u00f3 the money for said executions, as the said <em>Bond </em>had agreed wutli the plaintiff', although thereto requested by the plaintiff and the said <em>Bond, to </em>whom the whole of the money on said executions was due, and to be paid over by the defendant? but the defendant did then and there claim said property, and hold the same for the said Watson, by virtue of his said bid at the sale aforesaid, whereby the plaintiff was deprived of the power of selling said property for a much larger sum which had been offered for it, and of benefit-ting himself with the balance thereof, after paying the executions aforesaid; but by reason thereof, he totally lost the same, land was otherwise greatly injured, and entirely broken up in his business, and rendered unable to pay his debts; and by reason thereof, was afterwards compelled to petition for the benefit of the insolvent laws of this state. And the plaintiff further averred, that the defendant after-wards did return the property sold to the said Watson, and satisfied said executions; and ihat the defendant procured himself to be made trustee of the plaintiff', for the. benefit of his creditors, and did afterwards proceed, at sundry times, to advertise all the plaintiff\u2019s right, title and interest, in and to said property, for sale, at public auction, and after the said sale to the said <em>Watson, </em>and did fraudulently cause the plaintiff\u2019s right and interest in said property to be sold for the sum of 8300. By reason of all which premises, the plaintiff had been greatly injured, and suffered great loss and damage, to wit, the sum of \u00a1So\u00fcQ\u00fc, \u00bfje, The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>t0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>which there was a general demurrer and joinder.

This is an action on the casein nature of a decei1,and is grounded on the facts alleged and prov\u00e9d, that thelands of the plaintiff were sold by the defendant, as sh\u00e9riff of <em>Harford </em>county, under sundry writs of <em>fieri facias, </em>issued on judgments obtained against him by <em>Buckler Bond, </em>and bid in \u00e1t a sum, greatly below their valu\u00e9, by ac\u00e9rtain <em>fohh Watson, </em>who, to prevent a sacrifice of his prop\u00e9rty, \u00e1nd gain time for the plaintiff, agreed with him to purchase the lands for his* benefit. That after the sale was over, the defendant agreed to give the plaintiff and <em>Watson, </em>until the Monday next following the sale, to raise the money and pay the. executions; that not regarding his agreement arid undertaking, but fraudulently intending to deceive and injure the plaintiff, he colluded with, advised and aided <em>Vatson, to </em>hold the property by virtue of his bid, that he and <em>Watson </em>might sell the same for a larger sum upon their own account, and for their own benefit, and share the profits between them; and that in execution of their fraudulent design, the defendant refused to receive the money for the executions offered to him by the plaintiff by the time agreed on, but claimed the property, and held the same for <em>Watson </em>by virtue of his bid, and afterwards returned the property sqM to Watson, and satisfied the executions.</p>\n<p id=\"AIY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The greater part of these facts were examined by th\u00ed\u00e1 court, in deciding <em>Lamborn and Watson </em>at the last term! like this case it was m form an action, founded on a deceit: <em>* </em>but was clearly intended to recover damages for a fraud, in the nonper Form anee of What may perhaps be called a fair agreement between the parties. That agreement being \u00e1 verbal one for the safe of land, was determined by the court to be within the statute of ff\u00e1uds, and by its operatioii, to be a Void contract/ and it Was 'decreed j that the attempt to recover for the fraud, subsequently conceived and practiced, in withholding an execution of the agreement/ was evasive of the statute, and could hot avail// Can this\"actioir then, growing \u00f3\u00fct of the same contract, be in law supported?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">The defendant here Was not \u00e1 contracting party .in the Agreement anterior to the sale, but he is charged with secretly Colluding with/ advising and aiding <em>Watson, </em>to hold the property by virtue of his bid, that they might sell the same for \u00e1 larger sum on their own, account, and for theii? own benefit/ and share the profits between-them, and with retaining the .property sold to <em>Watson, </em>and satisfying the executions. This is the gist of the action, and is in substance th\u00e9 s\u00e1nie facts that formed the'ground work of the suit against Watson. Notwithstanding the fraud that supervened, the nonexechtioh of the agreement by him was pronounced not to be actionable/ and his Counsellor, how-fever reprehensible we think him, Cannot be exposed toi greater liabilities. To the adviser the same l\u00e1w must be jneted as was me\u00e1sured to the advised. They are in <em>pari delicto, </em>and a higher punishment ought hot to await the one than the other, \u00e1iid if the breach of <em>Wat sorts </em>contrae^ is unsusceptible of being enforced for o\u00f1\u00e9 purpose, it should be so deemed for every purpose: Whatever abhorrence/ therefore, we may feel for the conciuct of Moore'/ as por* trayed in the record, we must decide, that the action against him is not supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">There is one particular in which, this case niaf be said to differ.from that against <em>Watson, </em>although in our opinion it does not lead to a different result. <em>Moore </em>is ch\u00e1rged\u00ed with violating his agreement, to give the plaintiff and <em>Watson </em>until the Monday following the sale to raise the money, and pay off the executions, and it was insisted.on the argument to be the foundation of this, suit But it evident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>iy cannot be so considered: .and from the complexion of the. case, is plainly an item of the deceptions conduct imputed to the defendant, as manifesting a disposition in him to aid <em>Watson </em>in defrauding the. plaintiff. If it was viewed, however, as a substantive ground of action, we cannot see how it could be made to support the plaintiff\u2019s case. It is \u00abotan undertaking to the plaintiff singly, but to him and Watson,\u25a0 and the latter at least was not for, exacting an ob - aervance of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">We concur with <em>Harford, </em>county court in the instructions given to the jury, and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">JUDGMENT AFEIKMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
