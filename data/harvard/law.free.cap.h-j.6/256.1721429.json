The making of the note, and the endorsement by the defendants, were proved. The plaintiff' also offered in evidence a record of an action brought on a note of the same date, for the same amount, &amp;c. on the 28th of April 1819, in the names of the present defendants, and endorsed for the use of <em>Jones </em>and <em>Moades, </em>against the drawer of the note; which action was, by order of the plaintiffs by their attorney, entered discontinued in March 1820/and the note, which had been filed, was taken out. The defendants then offered in evidence, that the maker of the note, at the time of the endorsement, and passing of the same by the defendants, lived near <em>Hager\u2019s-Town, </em>and that the plaintiff then was in <em>Hager\u2019\u2019s-Town, </em>and continued there for two or three weeks after, and that they endorsed the note in payment for goods purchased by them of the plaintiff; and on this evidence prayed the court to direct the jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. The court, <em>(Buchanan, </em>Ch. J. and <em>T. </em>Buchanan, A. J.] refused to give the direction. The defendants excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against them, they appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b265-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The cause was argued at June term last before Earle, Martin, Dorsey, and Stephen, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-3\"><em>Ridout, </em>for the Appellant, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad_\">i.

Johnsori, </em>for the Appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOG\">contended, that as a suit had been brought by the defendants on the 28th of April 1819, against the drawer, on the very note which no doubt was left in their hands by the plaintiff for Collection, they could not deny their having notice that the money had not been paid. They struck off their action, which was entered for the use of <em>Jones. </em>There was lio necessity, therefore, to <em>prove </em>that they had notice of the nonpayment of the note by the drawer. The prayer made to the court below, by the defendants, was general, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, which the court very properly refused to grant. There Was no evidence that the plaintiff received the not\u00e9 in payment of the goods purchased of him by the defendants. The taking a note is no evidence of payment* unless it is so expressed. <em>Whitbeck vs. Van Ness, </em>11 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>409. Whether or notit was received as payment, was a fact to be left to the jury. <em>Johnson vs. Weed, </em>9 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>310. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>118, <em>(note.) </em>Where a note is endorsed after it is due, the endorsor becomes the maker. <em>Clark vs. Young, </em>1 <em>Cranch, 1</em>92. It is fair to infer, that when the note was endorsed the payees knew that the drawer would not pay. Notice to them therefore was not n\u00e9cessary that he did not pay when called on.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-7\">Ridout, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaR\">It does not appear that the defendants had any thing to do with the suit which was brought against the drawer. It was entered for the use of <em>Jones. </em>The note too had been endorsed by them, and the action could not be supported in their names. It was the suit of <em>Jones </em>erroneously brought, and therefore his counsel dismissed it. There is no evidence that it was the same note upon which the present action is brought. There might 1&gt;e several notes of the same date, and of the same amount, &amp;c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Th\u00e9 not\u00e9 being endorsed, after it was due, makes it in one respect different from other not\u00e9s, that is, that th\u00e9 holder could not look to the endorsors without proof of th\u00e9 insolvency Of the drawer. If the endorsor is considered as drawer* h\u00e9 has not been sued ds drawer. As between the endorsor and endorsed, it stands in the same situation as dll other notes. <em>Chitty, </em>141. If as drawer, he is entitled to notice, <em>Mutford vs. </em>Walcot, 1 <em>Ld. Raym. 575. </em>Chalmers <em>vs. </em>Laniow, 1 <em>Campb. </em>383. This was the assignment of a not\u00e9 ih payment of a debt. The sanie c\u00e1r\u00e9 and attention is therefore required* to'make the assignor liable, ds in all c\u00e1s\u00e9s of promissory notes endorsed. If the not\u00e9 was accepted as- conditional payment, still the same strictness is necessary to bind th\u00e9 assignor. <em>Chitty, </em>157. T\u00e9 Show that the same d\u00e9gr\u00e9\u00e9 of diligence is necessary where a note is hot reg\u00fclarly endorsed* of is not regularly a bill of exchange, he referred to <em>Chamberlyn vs. Delarive, </em>2 <em>Wils. </em>353. <em>Moore vs. Warren, </em>1 <em>Stra. </em>415. <em>Turner vs. Mead, Ibid </em>416. <em>Ward vs. Evans, </em>2 <em>Ld.
