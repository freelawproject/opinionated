This was art action of <em>slander. </em>It is deemed unnecessary to state the slanderous words stated in the declaration. They charged the plaintiff, (who was \u00e1n unmarried woman,) with fornication. The words proved were only such from which the fornication might have been inferred tin the defendant's prayer, the court, <em>\\_Hanson, </em>A. J.] refused to direct th\u00e9 jury, that the plaintiff was not entitledto recover. The defendant excepted; and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-10\">The cause was argued before Buc\u00edia\u00fcAn; Ch\u00bb J.

'That the words charged in the declaration were not actionable, because they neither imputed a crime to the plaintiff, nor charged her with any thing which tended to exclude her from society, nor affected her in her trade or office. In other words, that to call an unmarried woman a whore, was not actionable. 2. That the words proved differ from those alleged in the declaration. On the <em>first point </em>he cited <em>Brooke vs. Coffin, 5 Johns. Rep. </em>188, and the cases there cited. <em>Thesell vs. </em>Cooper, 1 <em>Roll. Ab. </em>36. <em>Comb. </em>138. The act of 1715, <em>ch. </em>27, <em>s. </em>3. 12 <em>Mod. </em>248. On the <em>second point </em>he cited <em>Cook vs. Cox, 3 Maule &amp; Selw. </em>110; and <em>Hancock vs. Winter, 7 Taunt. </em>205.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-12\">No counsel appeared for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b256-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b256-14\">Martin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMy\">Two objections have been made to the judgment of the court below in this case, both of which, we think, are sustained upon established principles of law. The words, as proved by the witnesses, are not in them\u00bb selves actionable, and if they were actionable, the variance between them and those laid in the declaration, is fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">We do not think it necessary to enter into a minute explanation of this case. The judgment of <em>Baltimore county </em>court is reversed, with costs to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-16\">JUDGMENT reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
