The SAU seeks review of the State Board of Education\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>decision that its failure to provide pre-hearing discovery with respect to its expert witness denied McGann a meaningful right to cross-examine that witness. McGann cross-appeals, alleging numerous violations of her procedural due process rights under both the State and Federal Constitutions. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The record supports the following facts. In 2004, following the resignation of the former superintendent, McGann was selected by the SAU to serve as interim superintendent. She subsequently entered into an employment contract with the SAU for the term of July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2009. On September 3, 2008, the SAU Board notified McGann of its intention to terminate her employment. The letter identified eight issues as the basis for her termination and informed her of her right to request a hearing before the SAU Board. On October 9, 2008, the SAU notified McGann of three additional grounds for termination that had been uncovered during the SAU\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The gist of the allegations was that McGann improperly used federal grant money in the form of stipend contracts to give raises to her staff, circumvented the SAU Board by granting the raises after it had denied her request for them, failed to ensure that \u201ctime and effort\u201d requirements for the federal grants were followed, and intentionally failed to provide the SAU Board with an auditing company\u2019s management letter that raised significant concerns about accounting records and systems. McGann requested a public hearing before the SAU Board, which was held over three evenings for the evidentiary portion and an additional evening for deliberation. Both McGann and the SAU were permitted to call witnesses, present evidence, and cross-examine the other party\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">During the evidentiary portion of the hearing, the SAU called a forensic auditor, John Sullivan, whom it had hired to review its financial records. Following direct examination, McGann requested access to Sullivan\u2019s file. The SAU responded that it had never seen a file from Sullivan and thus did not have anything to turn over. The SAU further responded that it had informed McGann of exactly what Sullivan would testify about and that his direct testimony had conformed to these representations. The moderator hired to facilitate the hearing ruled that it was not within the province of the SAU Board \u201cto engage in discovery orders\u201d and declined to order the SAU to produce Sullivan\u2019s work file. On the second day of the hearing, McGann unsuccessfully renewed her request for access to Sullivan\u2019s file. Following the hearing, the SAU Board voted to terminate McGann.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">McGann appealed to the State Board of Education, asserting that the SAU Board had violated her right to due process. In addition, she argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>that she was denied the opportunity to review Sullivan\u2019s work file and was thus denied a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine him. The State Board referred the appeal to a hearing officer, who ordered the SAU to produce Sullivan\u2019s work file for McGann to review. The hearing officer thereafter issued a proposed decision allowing McGann to supplement the record with items from Sullivan\u2019s file to demonstrate prejudice from being denied access to the file. The proposed decision ruled that the State Board of Education\u2019s administrative rules required the SAU to provide McGann with Sullivan\u2019s work file. The decision rejected McGann\u2019s remaining arguments and recommended that the State Board vacate and remand the SAU Board\u2019s decision for a new hearing. Both parties objected to the proposed decision, but the State Board adopted it in its entirety. This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">We begin with the SAU\u2019s challenge to the State Board\u2019s discovery ruling. The State Board determined that by not turning over documents from the expert\u2019s file prior to the hearing before the SAU Board, the SAU violated its rules, particularly New Hampshire Administrative Rules, Ed 204.01(b)(4). In determining that the failure to turn over Sullivan\u2019s work file required a new hearing, the State Board found that the prejudice was \u201cobvious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We review the interpretation of administrative rules <em>de novo. Appeal of Murdock, </em>156 N.H. 732, 735 (2008). \u201cIn construing rules, as in construing statutes, where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We consider the rule as a whole, and not in segments. <em>Id. </em>\u2018While deference is accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulations, that deference is not total. We still must examine the agency\u2019s interpretation to determine if it is consistent with the language of the regulation and with the purpose which the regulation is intended to serve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Part 204 of the rules provides procedural requirements for certain actions by local school boards. It differentiates between \u201cProceedings at the School Board Level to Resolve Disputes Between Individuals and the School System,\u201d see N.H. Admin. RULES, Ed 204.01, and \u201cHearing Procedure For Teacher Nonrenewal,\u201d <em>see </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Ed 204.02. Even though the State Board\u2019s order refers to Rule 204.02, because these proceedings did not involve a teacher nonrenewal, only the procedures in Rule 204.01 apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Rule 204.01(b)(4) provides that \u201c[t]he local board shall provide an opportunity for a hearing if requested at which the following procedures shall apply: . . . [djuring the hearing, the school board shall allow a party, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>or a designated representative of the party, to examine any and all witnesses.\u201d N.H. ADMIN. Rules, Ed 204.01(b)(4). The State Board determined that this rule required the SAU to provide access to Sullivan\u2019s work file in order to provide McGann with a \u201cmeaningful right to cross-examine\u201d the expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"> \u201cWe will not permit an agency to add or delete requirements through the mere expedient of interpreting a rule that is clear and unambiguous on its face.\u201d <em>Doe v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Safety, </em>160 N.H. 474, 477 (2010) (quotation, brackets, and ellipsis omitted). Here, the rule requires that the school board allow a party or a representative to examine any and all witnesses. The record shows that at the hearing, McGann extensively cross-examined the SAU\u2019s expert witness. While the State Board may have believed, that access to Sullivan\u2019s file would have allowed for a more \u201cmeaningful\u201d cross-examination, nothing in the administrative rules authorized the State Board to require the SAU to provide discovery to a party prior to an administrative hearing. Because an agency may not \u201cadd . . . requirements through the mere expedient of interpreting a rule that is clear and unambiguous on its face,\u201d <em>Doe, </em>160 N.H. at 477 (quotation and brackets omitted), we reverse the State Board\u2019s ruling that pursuant to Rule 204.01(b)(4) the SAU was required to provide access to its expert\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">We next turn to McGann\u2019s arguments on cross-appeal. McGann argues that her federal and state constitutional rights to due process were violated because: (1) she was not provided with pre-hearing discovery of Sullivan\u2019s file; (2) the SAU Board terminated her based upon adverse findings that were substantially different from the grounds of which she had been given notice; (3) the SAU Board relied upon facts not in the record; and (4) she was not given an \u201copportunity to cure\u201d prior to her termination. We first address MeGann\u2019s claims under the State Constitution, citing federal opinions for guidance only. <em>See State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 233 (1983). \u201cThis court is the final arbiter of the due process requirements of the State Constitution.\u201d <em>In re Father 2006-360, </em>155 N.H. 93, 95 (2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">We begin with McGann\u2019s argument that due process required the SAU to provide access to Sullivan\u2019s file prior to the termination hearing. To determine whether particular procedures satisfy the requirements of due process, we typically employ a two-prong analysis. <em>Appeal of Town of Bethlehem, </em>154 N.H. 314, 328 (2006). Initially, we ascertain whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>legally protected interest has been implicated. <em>Id.; see also Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976). We then determine whether the procedures provided afford adequate safeguards against a wrongful deprivation of the protected interest. <em>Appeal of Town of Bethlehem, </em>154 N.H. at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">McGann argues that two legally protected interests are implicated here \u2014 a property interest in her continued employment and a liberty interest in her reputation as an educator and administrator. For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that McGann has a protected interest in her continued employment and in her reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Our next task is to decide what process was due. In the context of this case, the principal reason for requiring procedural due process is to ensure that the facts upon which the SAU Board relied in terminating McGann were correctly determined, and that its decision was otherwise reasonable. <em>See Duffley v. N.H. Interschol. Ath. Assoc., Inc., </em>122 N.H. 484, 493 (1982). Our due process analysis requires a balancing of three factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\"><em>State v. Veale, </em>158 N.H. 632, 639 (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>130 S. Ct. 748 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">We briefly review the process afforded McGann under the State Board of Education\u2019s administrative rules. At the local school board level, proceedings that resolve disputes between individuals and the school system require a number of steps. The board must \u201c[pjrovide an opportunity for a hearing when the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are threatened\u201d; \u201c[pjrovide notice of such a hearing\u201d; \u201c[cjonduct a hearing in a manner assuring due process\u201d; \u201c[ejstablish an adequate record in all contested cases\u201d; and \u201c[ijssue timely decisions and orders.\u201d N.H. Admin. RULES, Ed 204.01(a). At the hearing, formal rules of evidence are not applicable; the hearing must be either \u201cpublic or nonpublic consistent with the provisions of the [Right-to-Know law]\u201d; and during the hearing, the party, or a party\u2019s representative, must be allowed to \u201cexamine any and all witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>204.01(b)(3)-(4). The board must include a statement that it has complied with all of the requirements of the Right-to-Know law, including compliance with all the record-keeping requirements of the law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>Id. </em>204.01(c). The board must issue a written decision arrived at by a quorum of the board, which must include notice that the decision may be appealed to the state board. <em>Id. </em>204.01(d). The decision must include a description of the issue in dispute, the board\u2019s decision, and the rationale for the board\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>204.01(e). Finally, a party has the right to appeal a final decision of the board to the state board within thirty days of receipt of the written decision. <em>Id. </em>204.01(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Even assuming that McGann\u2019s private interests in this case are substantial, given the elaborate process provided to her prior to termination, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of her right to continued employment and reputation is minimal. <em>See McBride v. Utah State Bar, </em>242 P.3d 769, 777 (Utah 2010) (where petitioner made use of extensive grievance procedures available to him, there was a low risk of an erroneous deprivation). Under the Right-to-Know law, McGann was permitted access to all public records of the SAU Board and the administrative rules required the Board to certify that it had complied with all aspects of that law. <em>See </em>RSA ch. 91-A (2001 &amp; Supp. 2010); N.H. Admin. Rules, Ed 204.01(c). McGann was given notice of the charges against her as well as a description of the evidence supporting each charge. She was given a full public hearing at which she was permitted to have counsel, call witnesses, and present evidence to answer the charges. She was also permitted to cross-examine all witnesses. All findings of fact, as well as the termination decision, had to be determined by a quorum of the SAU Board. Following the decision of the board, McGann had the right to appeal the decision to the State Board of Education and then to this court. While the decision adopted by the State Board found that the prejudice to McGann\u2019s case due to the lack of discovery was \u201cobvious,\u201d a review of the record and McGann\u2019s brief fails to demonstrate any prejudice to McGann\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">McGann argues that access to Sullivan\u2019s file would have revealed notes that indicated some of the SAU employees considered their stipends to be payment for performing extra work, rather than \u201cbonuses\u201d as Sullivan testified. However, McGann presented testimony from one such employee, Ann Wright, who disputed Sullivan\u2019s testimony regarding the stipends. McGann argues that this contradiction was weaker than direct impeachment with Sullivan\u2019s own notes. Due process, however, does not require the opportunity for perfect cross-examination. <em>Cf. State v. Watson, </em>740 A.2d 832, 841 (Conn. 1999) (\u201cDue process seeks to assure a defendant a fair trial, not a perfect one.\u201d (quotation omitted)). Wright\u2019s testimony minimized any prejudice caused by lack of access to these interview notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">McGann also alleges prejudice because she did not have access to an unsigned memorandum prepared by William Tappan, the SAU\u2019s business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>administrator. McGann argues that the memo would have allowed her to more effectively cross-examine Sullivan and Tappan. With regard to cross-examining Sullivan, we find no prejudice to McGann due to her lack of access to the memo. Nothing in the memo prepared by Tappan relates to the stipend funds about which Sullivan testified and McGann has failed to show how the memo would have afforded her a more effective cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">As for her cross-examination of Tappan, McGann fails to show how the memo would have afforded her a more effective cross-examination. Indeed, her argument centers almost entirely on the cross-examination of Sullivan and includes only a passing reference to Tappan. After reviewing the memo and the testimony of Tappan, we find no prejudice resulting from McGann\u2019s lack of access to the memo during the cross-examination of Tappan.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">McGann also argues that her inability to examine Sullivan\u2019s file to determine which documents were not in the file prejudiced her case. She asserts that despite Sullivan\u2019s testimony that he interviewed Tappan and spoke extensively with the SAU\u2019s regular auditing firm, the work file contained no notes or records of any such communications. However, Sullivan\u2019s testimony included only passing references to these interviews, unrelated to his testimony regarding the stipend funds. Even if McGann had had access to his work file before the hearing, any impeachment value in the lack of interview notes was minimal at best and did not prejudice McGann\u2019s case before the SAU Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Finally, McGann argues that the lack of access to the documents resulted in a lack of an opportunity to conduct a meaningful cross-examination generally. The record does not support this argument. McGann was permitted to cross-examine all witnesses at length, and, in fact, the cross-examination of Sullivan was twice as long as the direct examination. The SAU Board did not limit McGann in either the length of the examination or the topics on which the witness could be examined. We find that McGann had an extensive opportunity to meaningfully cross-examine Sullivan.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">As for the third prong of the due process analysis, we recognize that the government has a strong interest in the integrity and accuracy of administrative hearings, <em>see Abourezk v. Reagan, </em>785 F.2d 1043, 1060-61 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (describing government interest in preserving fairness in judicial proceedings), <em>aff'd by an equally divided court, </em>484 U.S. 1 (1987), the government\u2019s interest in withholding the expert\u2019s file is low, and the burden of producing the file is minimal. Nonetheless, where, as here, a party has been provided with extensive procedural protections, and the value of the requested additional procedural safeguard is minimal, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>cannot say that due process required the SAU to provide McGann with pre-hearing access to Sullivan\u2019s file. After a thorough review of the record, we find that McGann received all the process that was due at her termination hearing. <em>Cf. Petition of Grimm, </em>138 N.H. 42, 46 (1993) (due process requirements binding administrative procedures are quite different from those binding judicial procedures).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">McGann next argues that her due process rights were violated when the SAU Board voted to terminate her employment based upon four adverse findings that substantially differed from the grounds for termination stated in pre-hearing notices. \u201cFor more than a century, the central meaning of procedural due process has been clear: Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be notified.\u201d <em>Petition of Kilton, </em>156 N.H. 632, 638 (2007) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe purpose of notice under the Due Process Clause is to apprise the affected individual of, and permit adequate preparation for, an impending \u2018hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cTo satisfy due process, the notice must be of such nature as reasonably to convey the required information and must be more than a mere gesture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and brackets omitted). \u201cDue process, however, does not require perfect notice, but only notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638-39 (quotation omitted). \u201cThus, our inquiry focuses upon whether notice was fair and reasonable under the particular facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">McGann contends that two of the SAU Board\u2019s adverse findings had not previously been disclosed to her and that two other adverse findings were materially changed from the notice she received prior to the hearing. We first address the adverse findings that McGann argues were not previously disclosed. The SAU Board\u2019s fifth adverse finding was that \u201cMs. McGann had a duty to inform the Board of the stipends being paid to various staff in the SAU and School Districts and breached that duty when she failed to inform the Board of stipends being paid to various staff in the SAU and school districts.\u201d The sixth adverse finding was that \u201cMs. McGann\u2019s payment of certain staff stipends from federal grant money . . . occurred without Board approval in contravention of Policy GDBA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">In the October 9,2008 letter to McGann, the SAU identified the following reason for termination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">c. Under her supervision, the SAU ignored the time and effort requirements for federal grants imposed by federal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Ms. McGann inappropriately used federal grant money to give so-called \u201craises\u201d to her staff members after the SAU Board refused to grant the raises she requested for her staff. She achieved these \u201craises\u201d through the use of stipend contracts. Under OMB Circular A-87, \u201c[w]here employees work on multiple activities or cost objectives, a distribution of their salaries or wages will be supported by personnel activity reports or equivalent documentation.\u201d The independent auditors have uncovered numerous instances of SAU employees receiving stipends paid for with grant money who are not documenting their time spent on the grant projects and who are apparently doing grant work during their normal work day. The independent auditors have uncovered at least one example of where an employee received a stipend payment for a pay period during which the employee did not work. These failures to comply with federal law may subject the SAU to federal investigation and/or prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The notice provided to McGann clearly informed her of the allegation that she had circumvented the board and used federal grant money to give raises to her staff members after the board had refused to grant them. Policy GBDA is an SAU policy that requires any salary increase to be approved by the SAU Board. The notice further informed McGann that she was alleged to have used stipend contracts to give raises to her staff without SAU Board approval. This conduct is the same conduct that is the subject of the SAU Board\u2019s adverse findings five and six; to wit, that by circumventing the SAU Board, she failed to inform the Board and did not obtain Board approval of the raises. While the language of the adverse findings is not identical to the notice provided in the October 9, 2008 letter, due process does not require perfect notice, and McGann cannot credibly assert that she was unaware that her duty to inform and receive approval from the SAU Board would be an issue at her termination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We next address the two adverse findings that McGann asserts differed materially from those contained in the notice provided prior to the termination hearing. The SAU Board\u2019s first adverse finding was that, \u201cMs. McGann had a duty to cause the final Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting dated December 20, 2007 <em>and </em>the information contained therein to be timely disclosed to the Northwood Board and breached that duty when she wrongfully withheld the final Report from the Northwood School District\u2019s Board.\u201d In the September 3, 2008 notice, the SAU informed McGann that her termination was based upon her \u201cfailure to provide [its] auditing company\u2019s management letter to the Northwood School District <em>or </em>to advise the Board of issues identified in the letter.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>McGann makes much of the change from the word \u201cor\u201d in the notice letter to the word \u201cand\u201d in the adverse finding. The notice letter informed McGann that she neither provided the auditing company\u2019s management letter to the Northwood School District nor advised the Board of issues identified in the letter. The SAU Board\u2019s first adverse finding reflected the Board\u2019s determination that McGann failed to both provide the auditing letter to the school board and disclose to the Board the information contained therein. The notice provided in the September 3, 2008 letter advised McGann of the charges against her in sufficient detail to permit preparation of her defense at the termination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\">The SAU Board\u2019s seventh adverse finding was that, \u201cMs. McGann was responsible for ensuring that \u2018Time and Effort\u2019 reports justified the stipends paid to staff members for federal grant work, and failed in that duty.\u201d As we noted above, the October 9, 2008 letter notified McGann that \u201c[u]nder her supervision, the SAU ignored the time and effort requirements for federal grants imposed by federal law.\u201d The notice provided to McGann informed her that the SAU Board uncovered instances of employees receiving stipends without documenting their time spent on grant projects and doing grant work during the normal work day. McGann was certainly aware that the SAU Board expected her to comply with the time and effort requirements as required by federal law. The notice provided in the October 9, 2008 letter was more than adequate and did not violate McGann\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">McGann next argues that the board erred when it failed to find that her due process rights were violated by \u201cthe SAU Board\u2019s reliance on extra-record facts.\u201d McGann asserts that \u201c[d]uring the December 2, 2009 deliberative session, several SAU Board members made factual statements apparently based on their personal recollection of specific events; some of these statements were to facts not established on the record before the SAU Board.\u201d McGann argues that the lack of notice and opportunity to be heard on the veracity of these facts constitutes a violation of her due process rights. In support of this claim, McGann cites generally two portions of the minutes of the SAU Board\u2019s deliberative session. McGann does not cite any specific instances of SAU Board members making factual statements not supported by the record and we decline the invitation to review the deliberative session minutes and the hearing transcript in an attempt to uncover any such discrepancies in factual statements. <em>See In the Matter of Thayer and Thayer, </em>146 N.H. 342, 347 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Finally, McGann argues that the SAU violated her due process rights by failing to provide her with \u201can opportunity to cure\u201d the alleged grounds for her termination. She relies upon <em>Barrows v. Boles, </em>141 N.H. 382, 389 (1996), for the proposition that \u201cevery agreement contains an implied covenant that each of the parties will deal in good faith and deal fairly with the other,\u201d and that \u201c[f]air dealing may include giving the opposing party fair notice and an opportunity to cure any significant objections before being held liable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). This statement, drawn from the Uniform Commercial Code, <em>see </em>RSA 382-A:2-605(l)(a) (Supp. 2010), applies to commercial transactions, not employment contracts. <em>See </em>RSA 382-A:l-103 (Supp. 2010). Employees are free to bargain for a prior notice and opportunity to cure requirement in their contracts, <em>see Kaniff v. Allstate Ins. Co., 121 </em>F.3d 258, 265-66 (7th Cir. 1997) (employment agreement provided a requirement for prior notice and an opportunity to cure if the employee was terminated for \u201cunsatisfactory work\u201d). Absent a specific provision in the employment contract, and absent citation of any authority supporting such a constitutional requirement in the context of employment contracts, we decline to hold that due process requires prior notice and an opportunity to cure before terminating an employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Because the Federal Constitution does not provide any greater protection than does the State Constitution with regard to McGann\u2019s due process claims, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution. <em>See Veale, </em>158 N.H. at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Having reversed the State Board\u2019s ruling that pursuant to Rule 204.01(b)(4) the SAU was required to provide access to its expert\u2019s file, we remand this case to the State Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b122-10\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, CONBOY and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
