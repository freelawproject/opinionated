We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">The trial court found the following facts. Nicholas is the son of Rebecca P. and Martin P. Jonathan P. is Martin\u2019s son from a previous relationship. In May 2007, Martin and Rebecca lived in Dover with then nine-year-old Nicholas, fifteen-year-old Jonathan, and Rebecca\u2019s teenage daughter from a previous relationship, Danielle. The couple were having marital difficulties, and on May 14, 2007, Rebecca left with Danielle for South Carolina without advance notice to the rest of the family. Rebecca left behind a note addressed to Martin, Jonathan, and Nicholas in which she promised to return in a month, but she never relocated back to New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">Martin and Nicholas briefly visited Rebecca in South Carolina in the summer of 2008, and Nicholas spent six weeks with her there the following summer. Otherwise, mother and son saw each other only briefly over the next two years. Nicholas was upset and angry, and felt abandoned. In August 2009, Martin initiated divorce proceedings against Rebecca.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">Martin died suddenly on October 13, 2009. Soon thereafter, Rebecca sought <em>ex parte </em>approval in the divorce case to take Nicholas with her to South Carolina. Her request was denied. Jonathan then petitioned for guardianship of Nicholas. A hearing on Jonathan\u2019s guardianship petition was held on June 25, 2010. A guardian ad litem (GAL) represented Nicholas\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">At the time of the hearing, Jonathan was eighteen years old. His high school record evidenced a history of \u201cskipping classes, defiance, and disrespect.\u201d He testified that Rebecca had introduced him to drug and alcohol use at age fourteen, and that he had experimented with both. However, the trial court found that \u201calmost overnight following the death of the boys\u2019 father, [Jonathan] transformed himself into a man and a parent figure for Nicholas. By all accounts, including that of Rebecca P[.], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Jonathan . . . \u2018stepped up to the plate.\u2019 \u201d Jonathan had not used drugs or alcohol since Martin\u2019s death. He was working thirty-one hours a week at a Wendy\u2019s restaurant, keeping weekends and one weekday available to take Nicholas to counseling and medical appointments. At home, he was cooking, cleaning, supervising Nicholas\u2019s studying, and enforcing reasonable rules. He and Nicholas were interacting in a \u201cgray area between parent and older sibling.\u201d In sum, the trial court found that \u201cJonathan\u2019s devotion to his brother . . . has allowed Nicholas to remain in his home environment and not just survive his many losses, but actually grow and succeed educationally, socially and emotionally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The court found that Nicholas and Rebecca love each other, but their relationship is strained. Nicholas described his relationship with his mother to the GAL: \u201cI don\u2019t know her. I have no connection to her. We rarely talk on the phone and when we do we talk for only a minute.\u201d The court found that Rebecca had not fulfilled her parental responsibilities since 2007, and that Nicolas remains \u201cterribly upset\u201d and angry about her abandonment of him. He also does not feel safe in her \u201cenvironment.\u201d Rebecca and Nicholas have not seen each other on a consistent basis since 2007. They have not spent any substantial periods of time together since Nicholas\u2019s six-week trip to South Carolina in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">While noting that, in the context of a guardianship proceeding, it was unnecessary to make a determination as to Rebecca\u2019s fitness as a parent, the trial court observed that the recent birth of Rebecca\u2019s youngest daughter was \u201csurrounded by alleged confusion over the identification of [the baby\u2019s] birth father, her mother\u2019s ongoing drug use, and the baby\u2019s safety in her mother\u2019s care.\u201d Although Rebecca completed an intensive six-month drug rehabilitation program, the trial court disbelieved her claim that she entered this program because of one \u201caberrant\u201d positive test result for marijuana during her pregnancy. Further, the trial court noted witness testimony that Rebecca was a \u201cchallenged mother\u201d before 2007 and had mistreated Jonathan, Nicholas, and Danielle. Rebecca responded to this testimony \u201cby calling the people making the accusations liars, including Jonathan and Nicholas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">At the hearing, Nicholas\u2019s sixth-grade teacher testified that he told her, \u201cI don\u2019t even know my mom. I would be scared to live with her.\u201d The teacher also testified that Nicholas has strong friendships with his Dover classmates and a \u201creally strong bond\u201d with his brother. In contrast to Jonathan being \u201cvery involved\u201d during Nicholas\u2019s sixth grade year, the teacher never heard from Rebecca. She expressed her opinion that it was in Nicholas\u2019s best interests to stay with his brother and friends. She also testified that she believed a move to South Carolina \u201cwould be damaging.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The GAL recommended that Nicholas remain in Dover with his brother: \u201cIt would be psychologically harmful to move Nicholas from his brother, friends, and Dover at this time.\u201d He observed mother and son during a joint interview and concluded that there was \u201cno connection\u201d between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Nicholas\u2019s counselor agreed that relocating to his mother\u2019s home in South Carolina would be psychologically harmful to Nicholas. She also reported that Nicholas was tearful, worried, and suffering from anxiety, sleeplessness, and headaches over the possible move. Nicholas said to her: \u201cThis is where I have been my whole life. My friends are here[,] and everyone is starting to really know me____Why should I leave where I feel safe?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">As noted by the trial court, Rebecca became Nicholas\u2019s guardian by operation of law when Martin died. RSA 463:3,1 (2004) (\u201cUpon the death of either parent, the survivor shall be the sole guardian of the person of the minor.\u201d). Jonathan\u2019s petition to be substituted as guardian is governed by RSA 463:8, 111(b) (Supp. 2010), which requires a non-parent seeking to establish guardianship over the objections of a parent to show \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the best interests of the minor require substitution or supplementation of parental care and supervision to provide for the essential physical and safety needs of the minor or to prevent specific, significant psychological harm to the minor.\u201d The trial court ruled that Jonathan had sustained his burden, and granted him sole guardianship of Nicholas. It also ordered the parties to negotiate Rebecca\u2019s parenting time with Nicholas to take place in South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">On appeal, the respondent argues that the trial court\u2019s award of guardianship of her son to a non-parent over her objections: (1) violated the guardianship of minors statute (RSA chapter 463); (2) violated her fundamental right to parent her child as guaranteed by Part I, Article 2 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (3) was a <em>de facto </em>termination of her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">At the outset, we note that the respondent did not provide a record in support of her appeal. It is the burden of the appealing party to provide this court with a record sufficient to decide her issues on appeal. <em>See Rix v. Kinderworks Corp., </em>136 N.H. 548, 553 (1992); <em>see also </em>Sup. Ct. R. 13. Absent a transcript of the hearing in the trial court, we must assume that the evidence was sufficient to support its decision. <em>See Bean v. Red Oak Prop. Mgmt., </em>151 N.H. 248, 250 (2004). We must also assume that the trial court made all findings necessary to support its decision. <em>In re Jonathan T., </em>148 N.H. 296, 304 (2002). We further note that the respondent does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>challenge the constitutionality of the guardianship statute. Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s order for legal errors only. <em>See Atwood v. Owens, </em>142 N.H. 396, 397 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Parental rights are \u201cnatural, essential, and inherent\u201d within the meaning of Part I, Article 2 of the New Hampshire Constitution. <em>In re Adam R., </em>159 N.H. 788, 792 (2010). \u201cSimilarly, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d <em>In the Matter of R.A. &amp; J.M., </em>153 N.H. 82, 90 (2005) (quotation omitted). Nevertheless, the fundamental rights of parents are not unassailable. <em>In re Adam R., </em>159 N.H. at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Resolution of this appeal requires us to interpret RSA chapter 463, which governs guardianship of minors. We review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute <em>de novo. Kenison v. Dubois, </em>152 N.H. 448, 451 (2005). We are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We first examine the language of the statute, and, where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. <em>Id. </em>When the language of a statute is clear on its face, its meaning is not subject to modification. <em>Dalton Hydro v. Town of Dalton, </em>153 N.H. 75, 78 (2005). We will neither consider what the legislature might have said nor add words that it did not see fit to include. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">As to her first claim of error \u2014 that the trial court\u2019s decision violated the guardianship statute \u2014 the respondent appears to argue, first, that RSA 463:3, I, mandates that, upon the death of one parent, the surviving parent is entitled to guardianship of the minor unless she has been declared unfit. We reject this argument. RSA 463:8 plainly provides a procedure for the substitution of a non-parent guardian for a parent; that procedure does not require a court to find the parent unfit.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The respondent next argues that the trial court violated RSA 463:8 in several ways, including: (1) failing to identify the specific, psychological harm Nicholas would suffer under his mother\u2019s guardianship; (2) using erroneous legal standards; and (3) placing the burden of proof on her, as shown by the trial court\u2019s characterization of her as a \u201ccontestant.\u201d A review of the trial court\u2019s order does not support the respondent\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The trial court identified and applied the proper statutory standard \u2014 that is, whether Jonathan showed by clear and convincing evidence that Nicholas\u2019s best interests require substitute guardianship to provide for his essential physical and safety needs or to prevent specific, significant psychological harm to him. <em>See </em>RSA 463:8, 111(b). Contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>respondent\u2019s assertions, the guardianship statute does not require the non-parent to present expert witnesses to establish psychological harm to the minor. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, assuming, without deciding, that the trial court was required to make specific findings as to potential psychological harm, the trial court made such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The trial court found that Nicholas and the respondent have not had regular, sustained contact, either in person or by telephone, since the respondent left the family in 2007. Nicholas stated that he did not know his mother and would be afraid to live with her. The trial court found that he is angry with her, does not feel safe in her \u201cenvironment,\u201d and suffers from anxiety, sleeplessness, and headaches over the possible move. The respondent does not contest that Nicholas told \u201cthe Guardian ad litem, his therapist and his teacher, consistently and repeatedly, that he does not want to move.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The trial court found that it is Jonathan who has helped Nicholas to weather the painful blows of his mother\u2019s abandonment and his father\u2019s death. Nicholas has lived in Dover all his life, has strong bonds with his brother and friends in Dover, and says he feels \u201csafe\u201d in Dover.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">We cannot agree with the respondent\u2019s contention that the trial court applied erroneous legal standards or shifted the burden of proof to her. The few phrases in the trial court\u2019s decision cited by the respondent do not support an inference that the trial court substituted its own standards for the statutory standard. For example, we interpret the trial court\u2019s use of the word \u201ccontestant\u201d to describe the respondent as referring to the fact that she was contesting Jonathan\u2019s petition for guardianship, not as an indication that the trial court had shifted the burden of proof to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The respondent\u2019s second claim of error is that the trial court\u2019s decision violated her fundamental right to parent her child as guaranteed by Part I, Article 2 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We first consider her arguments under the State Constitution, using federal cases only to aid in our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Citing <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57 (2000), the respondent argues that the trial court was required to accord special weight to her assessment of what is best for Nicholas. We do not agree that the holding in <em>Troxel </em>requires reversal in this case. That decision involved a Washington state statute that allowed \u201cany person\u201d to petition for visitation rights and allowed courts to grant such visitation whenever \u201cvisitation may serve the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 60. The United States Supreme Court concluded that the statute unconstitutionally infringed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the parent\u2019s fundamental rights because it did not accord any weight to the parent\u2019s determination of what would be in the best interests of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Our statute, however, safeguards a parent\u2019s fundamental rights by imposing a high evidentiary standard \u2014 that is, by requiring a non-parent seeking a substitute guardianship to establish the need for it by clear and convincing evidence. While there is a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children, that presumption is subsumed in the clear and convincing evidence standard. <em>See Hunter v. Hunter, </em>771 N.W.2d 694, 706 (Mich. 2009) (\u201cAlthough a fit parent is presumed to act in his or her child\u2019s best interests, a court need give the parent\u2019s decision only a \u2018presumption of validity\u2019 or \u2018some weight.\u2019 That is precisely what [the statute] does when it requires clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Because the State Constitution provides at least as much protection as the Federal Constitution under these circumstances, <em>see In re Jeffrey G., </em>153 N.H. 200, 204-05 (2006), we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Finally, the respondent argues the trial court\u2019s order had the practical effect of terminating her parental rights, and, therefore, the trial court should have applied the standard set forth in RSA 170-C:5 (Supp. 2010) (\u201cGrounds for Termination of the Parent-Child Relationship\u201d). She alleges that, given the distance between her home in South Carolina and New Hampshire, she does not have the resources to visit with Nicholas and cannot exercise the parenting time awarded by the court. The respondent cites no legal authority for the proposition that her alleged inability to exercise visitation rights amounts to a <em>de facto </em>termination of parental rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">The appointment of a guardian is not a de facto termination of parental rights, which results in a final and complete severance of the child from the parent and removes the entire bundle of parental rights.... [A] guardian is subject to removal at any time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\"><em>In re Guardianship of Elizabeth H., </em>771 N.W.2d 185, 193 (Neb. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Because, in the absence of a transcript, we review the trial court\u2019s decision for legal errors only, we do not address the respondent\u2019s argument that the GAL\u2019s report to the court is meritless. <em>See Atwood, </em>142 N.H. at 396-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b237-12\">Dalianis, C.J., and Duggan, Hicks and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
