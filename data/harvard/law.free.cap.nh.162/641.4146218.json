Krans, </em>of Dover, by brief, for the City of Dover.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b675-13\">HICKS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANL\">The petitioner, David Montenegro, appeals an order of the Superior Court <em>{Brown, </em>J.) denying his petition under the Right-to-Know Law, RSA ch. 91-A (2001 &amp; Supp. 2010), requesting disclosure of information pertaining to certain surveillance equipment and procedures under the control of the respondent, the City of Dover (City). We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">The following facts are recited in the trial court\u2019s order or are supported in the record. The petitioner filed a request with the City on January 14, 2010, seeking the disclosure of: (1) the precise locations of the City\u2019s surveillance equipment; (2) the recording capabilities for each piece of equipment; (3) the specific time periods each piece of equipment is operational; (4) the retention time for any recordings; and (5) the job titles of those who monitor the recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">On January 21, the City denied his request on the basis that \u201cit would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions.\u201d In addition, the City stated that \u201cdisclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d Nevertheless, the City represents that it disclosed to the petitioner: the general location and buildings where cameras are, or are proposed to be, sited; the number of cameras in or around each site; \u201c[t]he capability and intent of the Dover Police to monitor cameras from remote locations\u201d; the \u201cintent of the Dover Police <em>not </em>to monitor the cameras on a regular basis,\u201d but to view them as needed when it would assist in law enforcement; \u201c[t]he cost of the security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>equipment\u201d; \u201c[t]he names of the vendors installing the security equipment\u201d; \u201c[t]he contracts for installing the security equipment\u201d; and when the equipment was installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Subsequently, the petitioner filed a petition with the superior court, seeking the information he had requested from the City. On March 26, the trial court held a hearing at which the City provided the court with a <em>Vaughn </em>index describing each document withheld or redacted, and justifying the reason for nondisclosure. <em>See Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973); <em>Union Leader Corp. v. N.H. Housing Fin. Auth., </em>142 N.H. 540, 548-49 (1997) (discussing use of <em>Vaughn </em>index). The court found that the City had sustained its burden of justifying withholding the precise locations of the City\u2019s surveillance equipment, the type of recording capabilities for each piece of equipment, the specific time periods each piece of equipment is expected to be operational, and the retention time for any recordings. The court also found the job titles of those who monitor the surveillance recordings exempt from disclosure as \u201cinternal personnel practices\u201d pursuant to RSA 91-A:5, IV (Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">On appeal, the petitioner argues that: (1) the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552 <em>et seq., </em>does not control requests for governmental records pursuant to our Right-to-Know Law; (2) Part I, Article 8 of the New Hampshire Constitution and RSA chapter 91-A hold the government to a \u201chigher standard of public accountability\u201d than does the FOIA; (3) disclosure of the information requested could not reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, risk circumvention of the law, or endanger the life or physical safety of any individual; (4) the job titles of those allowed to monitor the surveillance recordings are not exempt from disclosure under RSA 91-A:5, IV; (5) people conducting then-private affairs in public buildings have the right to know how those activities are monitored; and (6) the operation of hidden cameras for routine surveillance of the public by local government violates Part I, Article 8 of our constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">\u201cResolution of this case requires us to interpret the Right-to-Know Law, which is a question of law that we review <em>de </em>novo.\u201d <em>ATV Watch v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>161 N.H. 746, 752 (2011) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). \u201cWhen interpreting a statute, we first look to- the plain meaning of the words used and will consider legislative history only if the statutory language is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We do not consider words and phrases in isolation, but rather within the context of the statute as a whole. <em>In the Matter of Scott &amp; Pierce, </em>160 N.H. 354, 360 (2010). This enables us to better discern the legislature\u2019s intent and to interpret statutory language in light of the policy or purpose sought to be advanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>by the statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe purpose of the Right-to-Know Law is to ensure both the greatest possible public access to the actions, discussions and records of all public bodies, and their accountability to the people.\u201d <em>N.H. Civil Liberties Union v. City of Manchester, </em>149 N.H. 437, 438 (2003) (quotation omitted). Thus, the Right-to-Know Law helps further our state constitutional requirement that the public\u2019s right of access to governmental proceedings and records shall not be unreasonably restricted. <em>Id.-, see </em>N.H. Const, pt. I, art. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The petitioner first argues that the trial court, erred because the FOIA \u201cdoes not control\u201d requests for New Hampshire governmental records under the Right-to-Know Law. The trial court, however, did not apply the FOIA in this case, but rather concluded that the requested information \u201cfit[] squarely within exemptions (A), (E), and (F) as laid out in <em>Murray </em>[v. <em>N.H. Div. of State Police, </em>154 N.H. 579, 582 (2006)].\u201d While the test employed in <em>Murray </em>is admittedly one we adopted from the FOIA, use of the <em>Murray </em>test does not constitute an application of federal law Rather, in interpreting and applying our own Right-to-Know Law, we \u201clook to the decisions of other jurisdictions, since other similar acts, because they are <em>in pari materia, </em>are interpretively helpful, especially in understanding the necessary accommodation of the competing interests involved.\u201d <em>Murray, </em>154 N.H. at 581 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The petitioner further' argues that the trial court erred in applying <em>Murray </em>and its predecessor, <em>Lodge v. Knowlton, </em>118 N.H. 574 (1978), because, by doing so, it \u201cappears to have treated the requested information as part of a law enforcement investigation or prosecution.\u201d He asserts that his request sought \u201cno investigatory information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In <em>Lodge, </em>we adopted \u201cthe six-prong test of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7) (Supp. 1975) <em>... for </em>the guidance of our judges who may be faced with\u201d eases dealing with \u201cpolice investigatory files.\u201d <em>Lodge, </em>118 N.H. at 577. We determined that the FOIA test \u201cprovides a good standard to effectuate the balance of interests required by RSA [chapter] 91-A with regard to\u201d such files. <em>Id. </em>At the time, the test exempted, under certain circumstances, \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">In 1986, Congress amended 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7) by deleting the word \u201cinvestigatory\u201d and inserting the words \u201cor information,\u201d so that protection is now available to all \u201crecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7) (2006); <em>see Abdelfattah v. United States Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>488 F.3d 178, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). In <em>Murray, </em>we employed this amended test, which exempts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>\u201crecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, </em>but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information (A) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, (B) would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (C) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (D) could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source, (E) would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or (F) could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><em>Murray, </em>154 N.H. at 582 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7) (2002)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The petitioner correctly points out that even though <em>Murray </em>quoted the amended FOIA test, it applied a requirement from the pre-amendment <em>Lodge </em>case; namely, that \u201c[t]he entity resisting disclosure under exemption (A) must initially show that the requested documents are: (1) investigatory; and (2) compiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d <em>Id.-, see Lodge, </em>118 N.H. at 576-77. Recitation of this apparent vestige was of no consequence in <em>Murray, </em>however, because \u201c[t]he petitioner [did] not challenge the trial court\u2019s findings that the requested documents [were] investigatory in nature and that they were [compiled] for law enforcement purposes.\u201d <em>Murray, </em>154 N.H. at 582. We now clarify that in <em>Murray, </em>we intended to adopt the amended test set out in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7) (2006). Thus, to withhold materials under the modified test adopted in <em>Murray, </em>an agency need not establish that the materials are investigatory, but need only \u201cestablish that the records at issue were compiled for law enforcement purposes, and that the material satisfies the requirements of one of the subparts of\u2019 the test. <em>Richardson v. United States Dept. of Justice, </em>730 F. Supp. 2d 225, 233 (D.D.C. 2010) (quotation omitted). Accordingly, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>accepting the petitioner\u2019s assertion that his request did not encompass investigatory files, we conclude that the trial court did not err in applying the <em>Murray </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Here, the petitioner does not challenge the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that the requested records were compiled for law enforcement purposes. <em>See Demers Nursing Home, Inc. v. R.C. Foss &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>122 N.H. 757, 761 (1982) (noting \u201cin the absence of specific findings, a court is presumed to have made all findings necessary to support its decree\u201d (quotation omitted)). Therefore, the City has satisfied the initial prong of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The petitioner challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that the information he requested was exempt from disclosure under sections (A), (E), and (F) of the <em>Murray </em>test, contending that disclosure would not interfere with enforcement proceedings, risk circumvention of the law or endanger the life or physical safety of any individual. The City counters that release of the precise locations of cameras, the type of recording capabilities for each piece of equipment, the specific time periods each piece of equipment is expected to be operational, and the retention time for any recordings \u201cwould provide a roadmap for the commission of crime.\u201d It argues that disclosure of detailed law enforcement surveillance procedures would allow suspects to draw conclusions about which monitoring techniques law enforcement routinely implements, and thus provide them with potential countermeasures to circumvent such practices. Looking again to cases construing the FOIA for guidance, <em>see Lamy v. N.H. Pub. Utils. Comm\u2019n, </em>152 N.H. 106, 108 (2005), we agree with the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In <em>Lewis-Bey v. United States Department of Justice, </em>595 F. Supp. 2d 120 (D.D.C. 2009), the court addressed whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) properly withheld under section (E) \u201cdetails of electronic surveillance techniques, specifically, the circumstances under which the techniques were used, the specific timing of their use, and the specific location where they were employed.\u201d <em>Lewis-Bey, </em>595 F. Supp. 2d at 138 (quotation and ellipsis omitted). In holding that this information was correctly withheld, the court apparently accepted ATF\u2019s assertion that disclosure \u201cwould illustrate the agency\u2019s strategy in implementing these specific techniques\u201d and thus \u201ccould lead to decreased effectiveness in future investigations by allowing potential subjects to anticipate and identify such techniques as they are being employed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">In <em>New York Civil Liberties Union v. Department of Homeland Security, </em>771 F. Supp. 2d 289 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), the plaintiff did not contest that.the information it sought regarding \u201cthe placement of surveillance cameras in Lower Manhattan\u201d by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) could be used to circumvent the law, but argued that disclosure would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>increase the risk of circumvention because NYPD\u2019s use of security cameras was already publicly known. <em>N.Y. Civil Liberties Union, </em>771 F. Supp. 2d at 290, 291. The court disagreed, noting that \u201calthough it is publicly known that... [the NYPD] uses cameras..., the specific locations of those devices are unknown, and their disclosure could unquestionably aid criminals in evading detection and thereby circumventing the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292. Similarly, the court in <em>Showing Animals Respect and Kindness v. United States Department of the Interior, </em>730 F. Supp. 2d 180 (D.D.C. 2010), noted that \u201calthough trespassers and poachers on Wildlife Refuges likely know that they are subject to surveillance, the details of the surveillance techniques are unknown to them.\u201d <em>Showing Animals Respect and Kindness, </em>730 F. Supp. 2d at 200. The court was therefore \u201csatisfied that documents which disclose the location and timing of such surveillance could be reasonably expected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">We conclude that the precise locations of the City\u2019s surveillance equipment, the recording capabilities for each piece of equipment, the specific time periods each piece of equipment is expected to be operational, and the retention time for any recordings are exempt from disclosure. This information is of such substantive detail that it could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law by providing those who wish to engage in criminal activity with the ability to adjust their behaviors in an effort to avoid detection. Accordingly, the release of such information \u201cwould disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions\u201d and \u201csuch disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\u201d <em>Murray, </em>154 N.H. at 582 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The petitioner nevertheless contends that <em>N.H. Civil Liberties Union </em>mandates disclosure of the information he seeks. He maintains that providing the information he requests is analogous to the \u201cpolice surveillance tactics [that] were considered disclosable information\u201d in that case. We disagree. In <em>N.H. Civil Liberties Union, </em>the petitioner sought access to consensual photographs of individuals stopped, but not arrested, that were taken by the Manchester Police Department. <em>N.H. Civil Liberties Union, </em>149 N.H. at 438. The \u201ctrial court explicitly exempted from disclosure photographs that.. . were part of police investigations, including pictures of victims, witnesses and suspects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441. Moreover, the issues of law raised in <em>N.H. Civil Liberties Union </em>are dissimilar to those presented in this case. <em>See id. </em>at 439-40. In an effort to withhold the photographs, the City of Manchester relied on the exemption in RSA 91-A:5, IV (2001) for records \u201cwhose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>(quotation omitted). Here, the court upheld the withholding of the requested information under exemptions (A), (E), and (F) of the <em>Murray </em>test. In light of our ruling that these records were properly withheld under section (E), we need not further analyze the applicability of the other exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The petitioner also contends that Part I, Article 8 of the New Hampshire Constitution and RSA chapter 91-A hold government to a \u201chigher standard\u201d of public accountability than does the FOIA. Part I, Article 8 provides that \u201cthe public\u2019s right of access to governmental proceedings and records shall not be <em>unreasonably </em>restricted.\u201d N.H. Const, pt. I, art. 8 (emphasis added). Because we cannot conclude that an exemption from disclosure for certain information that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law,\u201d <em>Murray, </em>154 N.H. at 582 (quotation omitted), is an <em>unreasonable </em>restriction on public access to governmental records, we find no conflict between the exemption applied here and Part I, Article 8 of the New Hampshire Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The petitioner next contends that the trial court erred by exempting from disclosure the job titles of any persons who monitor the City\u2019s surveillance equipment. The court found that the information was properly withheld under RSA 91-A:5, IV as records pertaining to \u201cinternal personnel practices.\u201d RSA 91-A:5, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">We construe provisions favoring disclosure broadly, while construing exemptions narrowly. <em>Murray, </em>154 N.H. at 581. When a public entity seeks to avoid disclosure of material under the Right-to-Know Law, that entity bears a heavy burden to shift the balance toward nondisclosure. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">We first applied the \u201cinternal personnel practices\u201d exemption of RSA 91-A:5, IV in <em>Union Leader Corp. v. Fenniman, </em>136 N.H. 624, 626 (1993). There, the defendants sought to withhold documents compiled during an internal investigation of a Dover Police Department lieutenant accused of making harassing phone calls. <em>Fenniman, </em>136 N.H. at 625-26. We concluded that such files were exempt from disclosure as \u201c[r]ecords pertaining to internal personnel practices,\u201d under RSA 91-A:5, IV. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Finding that \u201cthe plain meanings of the words \u2018internal,\u2019 \u2018personnel,\u2019 and \u2018practices\u2019 are themselves quite broad,\u201d <em>id., </em>we concluded that the investigatory files fell within the plain meaning of the statutory language: \u201cThese files plainly \u2018pertain[] to internal personnel practices\u2019 because they document procedures leading up to internal personnel discipline, a quintessential example of an internal personnel practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>Hounsell v. North Conway Water Precinct, </em>154 N.H. 1 (2006), we found that a report generated in the course of investigating claimed employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>misconduct was a record pertaining to \u201cinternal personnel practices.\u201d <em>Hounsell, </em>154 N.H. at 4 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We have not, however, had occasion to interpret RSA 91-A:5, IV outside the context of employee misconduct or discipline. Looking again to cases interpreting the FOIA for guidance, we find instructive the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent interpretation of Exemption 2 under the FOIA, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2) (2006), \u201cwhich shields from compelled disclosure documents related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d <em>Milner v. Department of Navy, </em>131 S. Ct. 1259, 1262 (2011) (quotation omitted). The Court ruled that \u201c[a]n agency\u2019s \u2018personnel rules and practices\u2019 are its rules and practices dealing with employee relations or human resources.... They concern the conditions of employment in federal agencies \u2014 such matters as hiring and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1265. -In so doing, it rejected an interpretation adopted by the D.C. Court of Appeals that \u201cExemption 2 should also cover any predominantly internal materials whose disclosure would significantly risk circumvention of agency regulations or statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1263 (quotations, citation, brackets and footnote omitted). In <em>Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>670 F.2d 1051 (D.C.Cir. 1981), <em>abrogated by Milner v. Department of the Navy, </em>131 S. Ct. 1259 (2011), the D.C. Circuit Court had \u201capproved the use of Exemption 2 to shield a manual designed to train Government agents in law enforcement surveillance techniques.\u201d <em>Milner, </em>131 S. Ct. at 1262. In <em>Milner, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the D.C. Circuit Court\u2019s interpretation and held that Exemption 2 \u201cdoes not stretch so far\u201d as to shield \u201cdata and maps used to help store explosives at a naval base in Washington State.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the job titles of persons who monitor the City\u2019s surveillance equipment are not an \u201cinternal personnel practice[]\u201d within the meaning of RSA 91-A:5, IV. They are not related to internal personnel discipline, which we found to be \u201ca quintessential example of an internal personnel practice\u201d in <em>Fenniman. Fenniman, </em>136 N.H. at 626. Nor are they akin to \u201csuch matters as hiring and firing, work rules and discipline,\u201d which, among other things, the Supreme Court noted to be matters within the contemplation of Exemption 2 of the FOIA. <em>Milner, </em>131 S. Ct. at 1265. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to the withholding of job titles of persons who monitor the City\u2019s surveillance equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The petitioner next contends, making reference to \u201cFederal constitutional law,\u201d that the City\u2019s failure to disclose the requested information implicates the privacy rights of private parties. He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">While all New Hampshire citizens have a right to know the manner in which government conducts surveillance of the public, this right is particularly compelling when private parties utilize public buildings to conduct private affairs. Examples of this include rental or lease of city facilities for use by clubs, civic groups, and similar organizations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">We need not address this argument because the petitioner does not allege that he has \u201cutilize[d] public buildings to conduct private affairs.\u201d Thus, he has not demonstrated standing to assert this claim. <em>See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Comm\u2019r, N.H. Dep\u2019t of Revenue Admin., </em>154 N.H. 457, 461 (2006) (\u201cThe general rule in New Hampshire is that a party has standing to raise a constitutional issue only when the party\u2019s- own rights have been or will be directly affected.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Finally, the petitioner appears to argue that the operation of hidden cameras for routine surveillance of the public by local government violates Part I, Article 8 of the New Hampshire Constitution. Because this claim is not supported by an adequately developed legal argument, however, we need not address it further: \u201c[N]either passing reference to constitutional claims nor offhand invocations of constitutional rights without support by legal argument or authority warrants extended consideration.\u201d <em>Petition of Lussier, </em>161 N.H. 153, 159-60 (2010) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b683-9\">Dalianis, C.J., and DUGGAN, CONBOY and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
