We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The following facts appear in the parties\u2019 joint stipulation of facts or are taken from the trial court\u2019s order. In the 1950s, the federal government established the Pease Air Force Base (Pease AFB) in Rockingham County. In 1989, the Secretary of Defense approved the recommendation of the Commission on Base Realignment and Closure to close Pease AFB. In response, the legislature enacted RSA chapter 12-G (2008 &amp; Supp. 2010), which, among other things, created PDA to accept title to the land of the Pease AFB on the State\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Before the land was deeded to PDA, the United States Air Force engaged in a series of environmental impact analyses required by federal law. Following several iterations of environmental documents and deed restrictions, PDA accepted title to the Pease'AFB land in three title transfers between 1999 and 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">Shortly thereafter, the Town began the process of designating prime wetlands within its borders, pursuant to RSA 482-A-.15 (2001), and subsequently submitted the designation of eighteen prime wetlands to DES, six of which are located on the former Pease AFB. DES initially \u201capproved\u201d the Town\u2019s request, but later clarified that it \u201cdid not purport to \u2018approve\u2019 the legality of the Town\u2019s designation of prime wetlands located within PDA boundaries, nor would the agency have statutory authority to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">Several months later, as part of a proposed construction project on PDA land to expand an existing office building, an alteration of terrain permit application was filed with DES. The Town objected, asserting that it involved fill within 100 feet of wetlands that the Town had designated as \u201cprime\u201d and, therefore, required a wetlands permit. DES disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">After the Wetlands Council dismissed its appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the Town filed a petition for declaratory and injunctive relief in superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>court. Determining that this was \u201cactually a relatively straightforward case,\u201d the trial court concluded that PDA was not required to comply with the Town\u2019s prime wetlands designations and, therefore, granted PDA and DES\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to.the non-movirig party. <em>Sabinson v. Trustees of Dartmouth College, </em>160 N.H. 452, 455 (2010). If our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The Town first .argues that the trial court erred in concluding that RSA 12-G.T3 exempts PDA from complying with the Town\u2019s prime wetlands designations. PDA and DES counter that the statute removed the Town\u2019s authority to designate prime wetlands on PDA property.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The interpretation and application of statutes present questions of law, which we review <em>de novo. Clare v. Town of Hudson, </em>160 N.H. 378, 384 (2010). We are the final arbiters of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We first examine the language of the statute, and, where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used. <em>Id. </em>\u2018We construe statutory provisions in a manner that is consistent with the spirit and objectives of the legislation as a whole.\u201d <em>City of Manchester Sch. Dist. v. City of Manchester, </em>150 N.H. 664, 669 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">RSA 12-G:13,1, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-9\">[A]ny and all land use controls of the town of Newington ... shall not apply to any of the property at Pease Air Force Base transferred, conveyed, or otherwise granted to the authority by the federal government or any agency thereof. [PDA] shall have the <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction in adopting and establishing land use controls for the property at Pease Air Force Base transferred, conveyed, or otherwise granted to the authority by the federal government or any agency thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">(Emphasis added.) The issue presented here is whether designation of prime wetlands under RSA 482-A:15 is a \u201cland use control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Pursuant to statute, \u201c \u2018[l]and use controls\u2019 means all municipal ordinances and requirements or rules of [PDA] regulating the use, development, and improvement of property, including, but not limited to, zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, site plan review regulations, and building, electric, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>plumbing, and fire codes.\u201d RSA 12-G:2, XVI. The Town asserts that \u201cthe designation of prime wetlands is a state requirement, not a municipal one.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">\u201cThe State has delegated to municipalities authority to \u2018regulate and restrict\u2019 certain land uses.\u201d <em>Lakeside Lodge v. Town of New London, </em>158 N.H. 164, 168 (2008). Under RSA 482-A:15,1, \u201c[a]ny <em>municipality ... </em>may undertake to designate, map and document prime wetlands lying within its boundaries.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The local legislative body must then follow the procedures for enacting municipal zoning ordinances, <em>see </em>RSA 675:2, :3 (2008), in deciding whether to adopt the prime wetlands designation. RSA 482-A:15, II. This process is devoid of input from the State. The only role the State plays is a passive one: accepting and maintaining for public access all prime wetlands designations filed with DES by municipalities. <em>Id. </em>That the designation of prime wetlands by a municipality occurs pursuant to legislative authority does not alter the local character of the statute. <em>See, e.g., </em>RSA 31:17-a (Supp. 2010) (establishing procedure for referendum regarding the use of fluoride in public water systems); RSA 672:1,1 (Supp. 2010) (underscoring that land use regulations \u201chave been and should continue to be the responsibility of municipal government\u201d). Similarly, the role of the State in <em>enforcing </em>the statute does not transform its municipal character.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The Town cites <em>Green Crow Corp. v. Town of New Ipswich, </em>157 N.H. 344 (2008), as requiring that <em>\u201call </em>municipal land use control [must] be exercised under the authorities included in Title [LXIV \u2014 Planning and Zoning].\u201d This case, however, is distinguishable from <em>Green Crow. </em>In <em>Green Crow, </em>we were asked, pursuant to an interlocutory appeal without ruling, <em>see </em>Sup. Ct. R. 9, whether a board of selectmen could use its authority to determine occasion for the layout or upgrade of a highway under RSA 231:28 (1993) as a vehicle for effectively conducting land use planning or zoning, and we concluded that it could not. <em>Green Crow, </em>157 N.H. at 355. Although <em>Green Crow </em>does include rather expansive language that \u201cthe legislature intended for municipal land use planning and zoning to occur within the confines of [Title LXIV],\u201d we were specifically referring to \u201caspects of the planning and zoning scheme designed by the legislature under Title LXIV,\u201d a situation inapposite to the one presented here. <em>Id. </em>Contrary to the Town\u2019s contention, <em>Green Crow </em>did not hold that Title LXIV provided the <em>exclusive </em>legislative authority for local land use regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">As the trial court determined, the designation of prime wetlands is a \u201cland use control.\u201d Thus, it cannot be applied to control development of any property owned by PDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>The Town also argues that PDA is required by the covenants in the deeds to the former Pease AFB property to abide by the Town\u2019s prime wetlands designation. In response, PDA and DES contend that the Town lacks standing to enforce the deeds\u2019 covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-3\">\u201cOne seeking to enforce a restriction in equity must have a standing entitling him to seek equitable relief.\u201d <em>Shaff v. Leyland, </em>154 N.H. 495, 497 (2006) (quotation omitted). In particular, \u201cwe construe restrictive covenants as appurtenant to an interest in land, the benefit of which is personal to the covenantee and is enforceable only by the covenantee, unless a contrary intent is expressed in the language of the covenant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">Only current beneficiaries are entitled to seek judicial enforcement of deed covenants, even if enforcement would be beneficial to persons or entities other than beneficiaries. Restatement (Third) OF Property (Servitudes) \u00a7 8.1 comment <em>b, </em>at 475 (2000). Although the Town contends that the reference in the deed to compliance with RSA chapter 482-A \u201cwas intended to create a beneficial interest in favor of the Town,\u201d it provides no authority, and we have found none, to support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Because the Town is not expressly named as a beneficiary in the deeds, any intent to benefit the Town by adopting the deeds\u2019 covenants must be implied. <em>See Gephart v. Daigneault, </em>137 N.H. 166, 171 (1993) (third-party beneficiary entitled to enforce restrictive covenant in deed). The establishment of a beneficial interest by implication, however, commonly arises under particular circumstances not present in this case. <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes) \u00a7 2.11 comment <em>b, </em>at 154 (explaining that servitude by implication arises on the basis of use made prior to severance, by references to maps and highway boundaries in descriptions of land conveyed, by conveyance of land subject to a general plan of development, or by necessity).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Moreover, the deeds themselves explicitly provide that the United States, not the Town, is responsible for enforcement of the deeds\u2019 covenants. To insure that the United States retained the power to oversee development at the former Pease AFB, the deeds contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">The failure of the United States to insist in any one or more instances upon complete performance of any of the terms, covenants, conditions, reservations, or restrictions in this Deed shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of the future performance of any such terms, covenants, conditions, reservations, or restrictions, and the obligations of the Grantee, its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>successors and assigns, with respect to such future performance shall continue in full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We therefore conclude that the reference in the deeds to RSA chapter 482-A, without more, does not confer standing upon the Town to challenge compliance with the deed restrictions. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting PDA and DES\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b782-7\">DALIANIS, C.J., and DUGGAN, HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
