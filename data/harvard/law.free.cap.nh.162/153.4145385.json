On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in finding sufficient evidence to convict him on the felony count. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">The jury could have found the following facts. Between December 2006 and September 2007, the defendant lived with the victim, L.R, her mother, H.W., and H.W.\u2019s two other young children. L.P. turned eleven that summer. During that time, L.P. enjoyed watching the television show \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model,\u201d which she described as being about \u201cregular girls that want to be models.\u201d She wanted to be a model and would pretend to be one by \u201cputting on appropriate clothes, and looking at [herself] in the mirror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">In June 2007, the defendant began using his cell phone to take photographs of L.P. Some of the photographs were benign, showing, for instance, L.P. with her cat or her siblings. Others, however, were of L.P. wearing her mother\u2019s clothing and lingerie and some were sexually suggestive. The defendant told L.P. that if she told anyone about the photographs, or if anyone found out about them, she would be taken from her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">On one occasion, the defendant asked L.P. to take off all of her clothes for a picture. L.P. believed that the defendant made this request in her bedroom, but she could not remember. When L.P. refused, the defendant went downstairs and smoked a cigarette.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">On September 20,2007, H.W. discovered some of the photographs on the defendant\u2019s cell phone and contacted the police. The police recovered 155 images from the defendant\u2019s phone and its memory cards, of which 116 were of L.P. At trial, Detective Mark Dumas of the Concord Police Department testified that out of those 116 photographs, \u201ca good percentage . . . were objectionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The defendant was tried on charges including one count of felony-endangering the welfare of a child, which alleged that he solicited L.P. \u201cto take off all her clothes for the purpose of creating a visual representation to a pornographic picture.\u201d At the close of the State\u2019s case, he moved to dismiss the felony charge for insufficient evidence. The trial court denied the motion and the jury returned a guilty verdict on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to find him guilty of felony endangering the welfare of a child. Our standard for review of the trial court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss based upon the sufficiency of the evidence is well established.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">To prevail upon his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant must prove that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. When the evidence is solely circumstantial, it must exclude all rational conclusions except guilt. Under this standard, however, we still consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the State and examine each evidentiary item in context, not in isolation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\"><em>State v. Fandozzi, </em>159 N.H. 773, 782 (2010) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The defendant was charged with the statutory variant of child endangerment set forth in RSA 639:3, III, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">[T]he solicitation by any person of a child under the age of 16 to engage in sexual activity as defined by RSA 649-A:2, III for the purpose of creating a visual representation as defined in RSA 649-A:2, IV, or to engage in sexual penetration as defined by RSA 632-A:l, V, constitutes endangering the welfare of such child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">At the time the charged act was committed, RSA 649-A:2, III defined \u201c[s]exual activity\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">human masturbation, the touching of the actor\u2019s or other person\u2019s sexual organs in the context of a sexual relationship, sexual intercourse actual or simulated, normal or perverted, whether alone or between members of the same or opposite sex or between humans and animals, any lewd exhibitions of the genitals, flagellation or torture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">RSA 649-A-.2, III (2007) (amended 2008). The specific sexual activity at issue here is a lewd exhibition of the genitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The legislature has not defined what constitutes a lewd exhibition of the genitals, nor have we directly addressed the issue. We find instructive the factors articulated in <em>United States v. Dost, </em>636 F. Supp. 828 (S.D. Cal. 1986), <em>aff'd, </em>813 F.2d 1231 (9th Cir. 1987), <em>and aff'd sub nom. United States v. Wiegand, </em>812 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1987), to \u201cdetermin[e] whether a visual depiction of a minor constitutes a lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.\u201d <em>Dost, </em>636 F. Supp. at 832 (quotation omitted). We discern no meaningful distinction between the terms \u201clewd\u201d and \u201clascivious.\u201d <em>See United States v. Wiegand, </em>812 F.2d 1239, 1243 (9th Cir. 1987) (noting that \u201c l[l]ascivious\u2019 is no different in its meaning than \u2018lewd\u2019 \u201d). We also accept the defendant\u2019s contention that a visual depiction of mere nudity of a child, without more, is not a lewd exhibition of the genitals. <em>See Tovar v. State, </em>165 S.W.3d 785, 790, 791 (Tex. App. 2005) (noting that offenses \u201crequir[ing] evidence of lewd exhibition of genitals by [a] child\u201d do \u201cnot criminalize mere nudity of minors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Under the <em>Dost </em>analysis for determining the lewdness of a visual depiction, \u201cthe trier of fact should look to the following factors, among any others that may be relevant in the particular case,\u201d <em>Dost, </em>636 F. Supp. at 832:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">1) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child\u2019s genitalia or pubic area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">2) whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">5) whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">6) whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-12\"><em>Id. </em>Not all factors must be present to reach a determination that a visual depiction is a lewd exhibition of the genitals. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">The defendant argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that the defendant solicited from L.P. a lewd exhibition of the genitals. He contends that his \u201crequest did not mention L.P.\u2019s genitals, anything specific about the proposed picture, or any direction as to posing other than a request that she be unclothed.\u201d He asserts that the evidence proved only that he \u201crequested a naked picture of L.P.\u201d Notably, he \u201cdoes not dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the sufficiency of the evidence of his purpose to create a visual representation of a lewd exhibition of L.P.\u2019s genitals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The State argues that the defendant\u2019s request for a nude picture must be viewed \u201cin the context of all his behavior toward [L.P.] and the photographs he had actually taken,\u201d and that taken in that light, \u201cthe evidence was then sufficient to show that he was soliciting her to engage in a lewd exhibition of her genitals.\u201d We agree that \u2018Viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State,\u201d <em>Fandozzi, </em>159 N.H. at 782 (quotation omitted), a rational trier of fact could have concluded that the defendant solicited L.P. for a photograph that would constitute a lewd exhibition of the genitals under the <em>Dost </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">L.P. testified about pictures taken of her by the defendant that she was not, in the prosecutor\u2019s words, \u201cokay with.\u201d She stated these pictures were taken in her bedroom or her mother\u2019s bedroom. She testified that the defendant would bring her articles of either her or her mother\u2019s clothing and tell her to put them on. He would also \u201ctell [her] to do poses.\u201d The jury saw at least seven photographs, connected to the seven misdemeanor counts, that showed L.P. in sexually suggestive poses and/or settings, wearing sexually suggestive clothing. Some of the photographs cropped out L.P.\u2019s head, while some focused on her breasts or buttocks. The jury could reasonably conclude that these visual depictions were \u201cintended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.\u201d <em>Dost, </em>636 F. Supp. at 832. L.P.\u2019s testimony affirmed that on one occasion, the defendant asked her to take all her clothes off for a picture. In the context of such evidence, a reasonable jury could infer that the defendant\u2019s solicitation of a nude photograph was a request for a picture similar to the seven photographs underlying the misdemeanor charges, and thus was a request for a picture that would satisfy most, if not all, of the <em>Dost </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The defendant argues, however, that the photographs in evidence and the defendant\u2019s other actions cannot be used to inform his request for a nude picture because L.P.\u2019s testimony did not establish the order in which the events occurred. He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">Without evidence that [his] other actions took place before his request, and therefore contributed to its meaning, these other acts do not supply a context sufficient to prove that, in asking her to remove her clothes for a picture, he communicated- a request that she submit to a photograph amounting to a lewd exhibition of her genitals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>First, we disagree that there was no evidence of an order of events. The evidence established that the solicitation took place between June and September 2007. Detective Dumas testified that the recovered images did not contain \u201caccess data,\u201d so he could not determine the specific dates on which they were taken or deleted. Nevertheless, he stated that \u201cwithin th[e] 116 [photographs of L.P.], there appeared to be clearly somewhere in a series of photographs, and then there also appeared to be, what I would describe, a progression of photographs. They were readily apparent when I looked at that 116.\u201d He further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">So there was a range of photos I was looking at. That range went from artistic-type photographs, like you\u2019d expect to see a child in a catalog with maybe colorful clothes in a funny hat, posing. They were very benign in nature. And then there were ones that, appeared to me, very sexually oriented in nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In addition, the prosecutor asked L.P. whether \u201cthere [were] ever any pictures that [the defendant] took that were just kind of silly, fun pictures,\u201d to which L.P. responded, \u201cWhen he first got the phone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u201cThe trier of fact may draw reasonable inferences from facts proved and also inferences from facts found as a result of other inferences, provided they can be reasonably drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>State v. Kelley, </em>159 N.H. 449, 455 (2009). A reasonable jury could infer from Dumas\u2019 and L.P.\u2019s testimony that there was a certain order to the photographs taken, progressing from benign to sexually suggestive. Although the evidence did not pinpoint when the solicitation of a nude photograph occurred in relation to other acts of the defendant or the suggestive pictures actually taken, the jury could draw an inference as to when, in the progression described by Dumas and L.P., and in the context of all of the photographs taken, such a request likely took place. An inference that the request would have followed at least some of the sexually suggestive clothed photographs would not be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Furthermore, we cannot say that the jury could not interpret the defendant\u2019s request for a nude photograph in light of the suggestive photographs of L.P. clothed, as well as his other acts, even if they took place after the request. The defendant\u2019s citation of a case for the proposition that prior acts can inform a request, <em>see Foster v. Com., </em>369 S.E.2d 688, 697 (Va. Ct. App. 1988), does not establish the converse proposition that <em>subsequent </em>acts may <em>not </em>supply meaning to a solicitation. We note that in <em>People v. Braddock, </em>809 N.E.2d 712, 720 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004), the court found that the meaning of words constituting a solicitation for prostitution was \u201creinforce[d]\u201d by words the defendant spoke after the solicitation. In addition, in the context of criminal threatening, some courts have ruled that subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>acts can give meaning to ambiguous words alleged to constitute the offense. Thus, for instance, in <em>People v. Martinez, </em>62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 303 (Ct. App. 1997), the court stated that the \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s activities after the threat give meaning to the words and imply that he meant serious business when he made the threat.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>62 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 309; <em>see People v. Mendoza, </em>69 Cal. Rptr. 2d 728, 732, 733 (Ct. App. 1997), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, as stated in People v. Franz, </em>106 Cal. Rptr. 2d 773 (Ct. App. 2001). We conclude that the jury was entitled to consider all of the surrounding circumstances to determine the meaning of the defendant\u2019s request for a nude photograph of L.R, particularly when that request occurred some time during a continuing series of events producing 116 photographs of L.R, many of which were sexually suggestive, over a relatively short period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The defendant next argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he solicited L.P. at all. He cites <em>Petition of State of N.H. (State v. Laporte), </em>157 N.H. 229 (2008), in which we stated that \u201c[t]he plain meaning of solicitation is \u2018to entice\u2019 or \u2018to strongly urge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Laporte, </em>157 N.H. at 232 (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2169 (unabridged ed. 2002)). He then argues that \u201c[t]hese words connote a determined entreaty through methods beyond simply making a request. Conversely, solicit does not mean \u2018to ask.\u2019 \u201d The defendant concedes that he may not have preserved this argument below, but asserts that \u201cthe trial court committed plain error in finding sufficient evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Our plain error rule requires: \u201c(1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain; (3) the error must affect substantial rights; and (4) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>State v. MacInnes, </em>151 N.H. 732, 737 (2005). We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">We need not decide whether, as the State urges, solicit does \u201cmean[] to ask,\u201d <em>People v. Pfaffle, </em>632 N.W.2d 162, 171 (Mich. Ct. App. 2001), because we agree with the State\u2019s alternative argument that the evidence in this case was sufficient to prove solicitation under the defendant\u2019s own definition of \u201cto entice.\u201d The State argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">[T]he defendant\u2019s behavior here easily met the definition of \u201cto entice.\u201d. .. [T]he evidence of the defendant\u2019s request. . . [should be viewed] in the entire context of the case, where the defendant knew of [LR.\u2019s] interest in modeling and took advantage of that interest by causing [L.P.] to pose for 116 other photographs, including many that were inoffensive, but at least seven of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>were sexually suggestive. The jury could infer that he was building up to the request at issue by progressively encouraging [L.R\u2019s] ambition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">(Citations omitted.) We agree that in light of all the evidence, a rational jury could find that the defendant enticed L.P. by playing to her ambition to be a model and that \u201chis request that she pose nude was the culmination of a sequence intended to gain her trust and confidence so that she would pose for pornography.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to prove both that the defendant engaged in \u201csolicitation\u201d within the meaning of RSA 639:3, III and that the object of the solicitation was a \u201clewd exhibition^ of the genitals\u201d within the meaning of RSA 649-A:2, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b192-7\">DALIANIS, C.J., and DUGGAN, CONBOY and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
