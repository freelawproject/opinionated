Guay, was convicted of three counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault (AFSA), <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:2 (Supp. 2010), and one count of felonious sexual assault (FSA), <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:3, III (2007 &amp; Supp. 2010). On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred by: (1) failing to grant his request for a mistrial; (2) failing to dismiss one of the three AFSA counts; and (3) denying him access to all of the victim\u2019s medical and counseling records. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The jury could have found the following facts. The victim, J.G., born on October 15,1997, is the biological daughter of the defendant and K.G. After the defendant and K.G. divorced in March 2002, J.G. spent every other weekend and Wednesdays with the defendant. The defendant remarried in 2004 to H., who had one son, J.T., from a prior marriage to Jason T. The defendant and H. had a daughter, J. The defendant and H. separated in March or April 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">During the defendant\u2019s marriage to H., he and Jason T. became friends. Over the weekend of April 25-27, 2008, the defendant and Jason T. took an overnight trip to Lincoln with the victim, J.G., and the other two children. The hotel room in which the group stayed consisted of a downstairs area, with a kitchen, bathroom, and pull-out bed, and a loft area with a single bed and a set of bunk beds. The loft area was not visible from the downstairs portion of the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">On the evening of April 25, J.G. put her half-sister, J., to bed in one of the loft bunks and then got into the single bed in the loft to watch television. The defendant, Jason T., and his son, J.T., were in the downstairs area, and the defendant and Jason T. were drinking beer. At some point, the defendant went up into the loft and told his daughter, J.G., to go to bed. J.G. later awoke to feel the defendant touching her vagina. The defendant also touched J.G.\u2019s breasts that night, and told her not to tell her mother what he had done because he would go to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">On the following night, April 26, J.G. again slept in the single loft bed. She awoke to find the defendant on top of her. J.G. realized that her pants had been removed and that the defendant\u2019s fingers were in her vagina. The defendant then put his penis in J.G.\u2019s vagina and moved his body \u201cup and down.\u201d Jason T., who had been sleeping in the downstairs area with J.T., was awakened in the night by the sound of J.G. \u201capologizing\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>defendant in the loft and asking the defendant if he was mad at her. Jason T. heard the defendant respond to J.G., \u201cNo, why would I be mad?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Shortly after the assault on the night of April 26, J.G. noted that the bed had \u201cwet stuff all over it,\u201d and that some of it was also on her body. J.G. put her pants on, went to the bathroom, and saw that she was bleeding. Jason T. saw J.G. as she came out of the bathroom and remarked that her pants were on inside out. J.G. eventually disclosed the assaults to her best friend and then to her mother, K.G., who called the police. The defendant was later charged with three counts of AFSA and two counts of FSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Prior to trial, the defendant requested that the State produce J.G.\u2019s medical and counseling records. The State objected in part, but agreed that the court could review the requested records <em>in camera </em>and determine which records should be released to counsel. After reviewing the records, the trial court issued an order releasing some of them to counsel, but concluding that the remainder should not be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">At trial, the defendant testified in his own defense. During the defendant\u2019s testimony, immediately after he stated that listening to J.G.\u2019s accusations against him was \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d J.G. shouted out from the back of the courtroom, \u201cYou\u2019re such a freakin\u2019 liar.\u201d The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial but twice issued curative instructions to the jury. The jury found the defendant guilty on all three counts of AFSA and one count of FSA. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\n<em>II. Denial of Mistrial Request</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">The defendant first argues that the trial court erred when it denied his request for a mistrial following J.G.\u2019s emotional outburst in the courtroom during his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">\u201cMistrial is the proper remedy only if the evidence or comment complained of was not merely improper, but also so prejudicial that it constituted an irreparable injustice that cannot be cured by jury instructions.\u201d <em>State v. Neeper, </em>160 N.H. 11, 15 (2010) (quotation omitted). When reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a mistrial, we \u201crecognize that the trial court is in the best position to gauge the prejudicial nature of the conduct at issue and has broad discretion to decide whether a mistrial is appropriate. We will not overturn the trial court\u2019s decision on whether a mistrial or other remedial action is necessary absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Ainsworth, </em>151 N.H. 691, 698 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">Here, the defendant argues that J.G.\u2019s outburst \u201cexposed the jury to inadmissible information that she did not, and could not, present during her direct examination\u201d \u2014 namely, that the defendant was a liar. The defendant further argues that the outburst \u201covershadowed\u201d the impact of his testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>mony, \u201cinfuse[d] sympathy\u201d for J.G. and \u201chostility\u201d for him, and that, consequently, no instruction could have cured the prejudice that the outburst caused to his case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In light of the testimony given by both J.G. and the defendant prior to J.G.\u2019s outburst, we are not persuaded that the \u201cinadmissible evidence\u201d presented by the outburst required the trial court to declare a mistrial. The jury heard J.G. testify that the defendant committed the charged sexual assaults and also heard the defendant deny the charges. Given the conflicting testimony, it could hardly have been a surprise to the jury that the victim did not believe the defendant to be testifying truthfully. Moreover, credibility issues are within the jury\u2019s province, and it could reasonably have concluded that the defendant lied during his testimony. Under these circumstances, we do not conclude that J.G.\u2019s outburst, reflecting her opinion of the defendant\u2019s credibility, was so prejudicial that it was incurable.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Further, although J.G.\u2019s outburst could have appealed to . the jury\u2019s sympathies, the trial court immediately instructed the jury to ignore it, and then dismissed the jury from the courtroom. After the jury returned to the courtroom, the trial court issued a second instruction in which it stated that the jury was \u201crequired to decide this case from the facts in evidence and the testimony under oath of the witnesses.\u201d Additionally, the trial court asked the jury collectively whether J.G.\u2019s outburst would \u201caffect [anyone\u2019s] ability to impartially decide this case,\u201d to which not one juror responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\"> Jurors are presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>See State v. Cosme, </em>157 N.H. 40, 46 (2008).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">It is, of course, true that there are cases where a witness\u2019 displays of emotion are so frequent and so intense that they produce such passion and prejudice as to justify taking a case from the jury. But whether or not they produce that result is a matter which under established case law rests largely in a trial justice\u2019s sound judicial discretion, and, except in an instance where that discretion is clearly shown to have been abused, his refusal to grant a mistrial because of a complaining witness\u2019 outbursts, outcries and the like will not be disturbed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\"><em>State v. Benoit, </em>363 A.2d 207, 213 (R.I. 1976); <em>see also Com. v. Melendez-Rodriguez, </em>856 A.2d 1278, 1287 (Pa. 2004) (upholding trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial where \u201cvictim\u2019s outburst did not add anything new to her version of the events that she had previously testified to upon direct examination\u201d); <em>Clegg v. State, </em>655 P.2d 1240, 1241-44 (Wyo. 1982) (upholding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial based in part on its determination that the \u201coutburst could redound against the victim and have the effect of discrediting her in the eyes of the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Based upon the record, we conclude that the trial court sustainably exercised its discretion by declining to declare a mistrial after J.G.\u2019s outburst.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\n<em>III. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred when, at the close of the State\u2019s case, it denied his motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence of penetration regarding the AFSA charge that alleged digital penetration during the first night at the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">As a threshold matter, the State contends the defendant failed to preserve this issue for appeal. A motion to dismiss must state the specific ground on which it is based in order to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>State v. Dodds, </em>159 N.H. 239, 243-44 (2009) (concluding that where motion to dismiss for insufficiency of the evidence was \u201ccouched in general terms\u201d and did not specify that it was based on statutory interpretation, the defendant failed to preserve the issue for appeal). Here, when the defendant moved to dismiss the subject AFSA charge at the close of the State\u2019s case, he argued that there was insufficient evidence of his guilt because J.G.\u2019s testimony was \u201cinconsistent,\u201d not that the State had failed to prove digital penetration. Accordingly, we conclude the defendant failed to preserve this issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Because the defendant failed to preserve the issue, we conduct a plain error analysis of his argument on appeal. Under the plain error rule, we may consider errors not raised before the trial court. <em>State v. Matey, </em>153 N.H. 263, 266 (2006); <em>see </em>SUP. Ct. R. 16-A. \u201cHowever, the rule should be used sparingly, its use limited to those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\u201d <em>State v. Russell, </em>159 N.H. 475, 489 (2009) (quotation omitted). To find plain error: \u201c(1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain; (3) the error must affect substantial rights; and (4) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have looked to federal plain error analysis in applying our plain error rule. <em>Id. </em>at 489-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">We note first that the State has raised a question as to whether the transcript accurately reflects J.G.\u2019s testimony at trial regarding this charge. At trial, the prosecutor asked J.G., \u201cAnd where was he touching you?\u201d The original transcription of J.G.\u2019s response was \u201con my vagina.\u201d However, the State moved to correct the record and submitted a correction from a certified transcriptionist indicating that J.G.\u2019s answer to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>question was actually \u201cmy vagina,\u201d and not <em>\u201con </em>my vagina.\u201d The defendant responded to the State\u2019s motion by indicating that \u201cwhether this Court interprets the words from the record to be \u2018on my vagina\u2019 or \u2018my vagina\u2019 does not significantly alter [his] argument on appeal.\u201d Assuming, as the State contends, that J.G.\u2019s answer was \u201cmy vagina,\u201d for the following reasons we conclude that it was plain error for the trial court not to have dismissed the charge for insufficient evidence of digital penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Turning to the first prong of the plain error test \u2014 that there was error \u2014 we review the evidence to determine whether it was, as the defendant contends, insufficient to prove penetration. We conclude that the evidence was insufficient. Our standard for review in this area is well established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">To prevail in a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant bears the burden of proving that no rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In reviewing the evidence, we examine each evidentiary item in the context of all the evidence, not in isolation. Circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to support a finding of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the trier may draw reasonable inferences from facts proved and also inferences from facts found as a result of other inferences, provided they can be reasonably drawn therefrom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\"><em>State v. Young, </em>159 N.H. 332, 338 (2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Pursuant to RSA 632-A:2, I(Z), (Supp. 2010), a person is guilty of the crime of aggravated felonious sexual assault if such person engages in sexual penetration with another person when the victim is less than thirteen years of age. \u201cSexual penetration\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]ny intrusion, however slight, of any part of the actor\u2019s body, including emissions, or any object manipulated by the actor into genital or anal openings of the victim\u2019s body.\u201d RSA 632-A:1, V(a)(5) (Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">In this ease, J.G.\u2019s testimony concerning the assault on the first night at the hotel was sufficient only to establish that the defendant touched her vagina, but not to establish that he penetrated her vagina with his fingers. J.G.\u2019s testimony about this incident was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">Q: What woke you up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">A: Him touching me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">Q: And where was he touching you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-13\">A: My lower place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-14\">Q: And what is your lower place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>A: My vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">Q: And what did you have on for clothes at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">A: Just PJ pants and a shirt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">Q: And when you woke up you said he was doing what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">A: Touching me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">Q: And where was he touching you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">A: My vagina.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">After testifying that the defendant also touched her breasts that night, J.G. testified that she rolled over and went to sleep and \u201c[tjhat\u2019s all that happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">The State argues that the response \u201cmy vagina\u201d to the question \u201cwhere was he touching you,\u201d is sufficient to establish, by reasonable inference, that the defendant penetrated J.G.\u2019s vagina with his fingers. In support of this contention, the State relies upon the reasoning in <em>State v. </em>Flynn, 151 N.H. 378, 384-85 (2004), and <em>People v. Hillier, </em>910 N.E.2d 181 (Ill. App. Ct. 2009), as well as our statutory definition of \u201cgenital openings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">We conclude that the State\u2019s reliance upon <em>Flynn </em>and <em>Hillier </em>is misplaced, as both are distinguishable. In <em>Flynn, </em>we determined there was sufficient evidence of digital penetration even where the victim gave conflicting testimony concerning the assault. The victim in <em>Flynn </em>\u201cawoke because of an uncomfortable feeling in her genital area\u201d and found she was \u201con her back with her knees tilted sideways, separated by the defendant\u2019s right hand.\u201d <em>Flynn, </em>151 N.H. at 380. At trial the victim testified that she felt pain in her genital area, but alternately described the pain as occurring \u201cin [her] vagina,\u201d and then during cross-examination, \u201clike a scratch on the outside of her vagina.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384 (brackets omitted). There was ample circumstantial evidence, however, from which a jury could have reasonably inferred that penetration occurred. The defendant\u2019s own version of events corroborated the victim\u2019s testimony that she felt his finger upon her, the victim testified that the sensation she felt occurred close to the time the defendant ejaculated, and a single sperm, belonging to the defendant, was found inside the victim\u2019s vagina. <em>Id. </em>at 381. Further, we noted that the victim\u2019s conflicting testimony did not negate the evidence tending to establish penetration and concluded that \u201cthrough examination of all the facts and circumstances of this case,\u201d one could rationally conclude that the defendant used his finger to intrude, however slightly, into the victim\u2019s vagina, thereby establishing sexual penetration. <em>Id. </em>at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">Here, the evidence of sexual contact on the first night in the hotel was limited to J.G.\u2019s testimony that the defendant touched her vagina. J.G. testified that she was wearing \u201cPJ pants\u201d and there was no testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>her pants were removed during the incident or that the defendant\u2019s hands were underneath her clothing. This stands in contrast to J.G.\u2019s later testimony concerning the assault occurring the next night. As to that assault, she testified that her pants were removed prior to the assault, that the defendant placed his fingers \u201cin\u201d her vagina, and that he placed his penis in her vagina. Thus, J.G. was obviously capable of testifying to sexual penetration. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that her testimony was sufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant penetrated her with his fingers during the first incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Nor do we find <em>Hillier </em>supportive of the State\u2019s position. In <em>Hillier, </em>a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence was unsuccessful where the defendant was charged with sexual assault and the victim\u2019s testimony, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s question \u201cwhere did [the defendant] place his finger,\u201d was \u201cmy vagina.\u201d <em>Hillier, </em>910 N.E.2d at 183-85. In concluding that this response was sufficient to prove penetration, the <em>Hillier </em>court relied on its own case law establishing that a jury may reasonably infer penetration where the defendant \u201crubbed, felt or handled the victim\u2019s vagina,\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch an inference is unreasonable only if the victim denies that penetration occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184 (quotations omitted) (citing <em>People v. Bell, </em>600 N.E.2d 902, 906-07 (111. App. Ct. 1992)). Here, there was no evidence that would support a reasonable inference that penetration occurred. Moreover, we decline to adopt a general rule establishing an inference of penetration except where the victim expressly denies penetration. To do so would arguably effect an impermissible shifting of the burden onto the defendant to disprove the charged act. It is the State\u2019s burden to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. N.H. CONST, pt. 1, art. 15. Accordingly, we decline to rely upon the reasoning in <em>Hillier.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Finally, we address the State\u2019s argument based on statutory interpretation. RSA 632-A:l, I-b defines the term \u201cgenital openings\u201d as \u201cthe internal or external genitalia including, but not limited to, the vagina, labia majora, labia minora, vulva, urethra or perineum.\u201d The State appears to argue that because the vagina is statutorily defined as a \u201cgenital opening,\u201d penetration may be proven by testimony which asserts only that a defendant touched this body part.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. State v. Kousounadis, </em>159 N.H. 413, 423 (2009). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. <em>State v. Thiel, </em>160 N.H. 462, 465 (2010). We first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Although \u201cvagina\u201d is defined by the statute as a \u201cgenital opening,\u201d that definition does not establish that touching the vagina constitutes penetration. On the contrary, the statute defines penetration as <em>\u201cintrusion . . . into </em>genital or anal openings of the victim\u2019s body.\u201d RSA 632-A:l, V(a)(5) (emphases added). Thus, the State was required to prove digital intrusion into J.G.\u2019s vagina. To interpret the statute as urged by the State would, in effect, eliminate from the statute the definition of \u201cpenetration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Our next consideration is whether the error was plain. \u201cPlain is synonymous with clear or, equivalently, obvious.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734 (1993) (quotations omitted). We conclude that the error here was plain. As discussed above, the evidence was insufficient to establish sexual penetration, an element of the charged crime, as defined by statute. <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:2. Under these circumstances, the State could not have met its burden of proof and the charge should not have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">As to the third prong of the plain error test, we conclude that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights because the trial court\u2019s failure to dismiss the charge at the close of the evidence led to his conviction on the charge. <em>See State v. Lopez, </em>156 N.H. 416, 425 (2007) (\u201c[T]o satisfy the burden of demonstrating that an error affected substantial rights, the defendant must demonstrate that the error was prejudicial, <em>ie., </em>that it affected the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Finally, because the defendant was convicted based upon insufficient evidence of guilt, to allow the defendant\u2019s conviction to stand would seriously affect the fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings. The defendant\u2019s conviction on this charge is, accordingly, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\n<em>TV. Request for In Camera Review of Records</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Finally, the defendant requests that we conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the confidential records reviewed <em>in camera </em>by the trial court. For the trial court to conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the victim\u2019s confidential records, the defendant must first show a reasonable probability that the records contain information that is material and relevant to his stated defense. <em>State v. Sargent, </em>148 N.H. 571, 573 (2002) (quotation and citation omitted). This \u201cthreshold showing ... is not unduly high.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It only requires the defendant to \u201cmeaningfully articulate how the information sought is relevant and material to his defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAt a minimum, a defendant must present some specific concern, based on more than bare conjecture, that, in reasonable probability, will be explained by the information sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the defendant makes this showing, then the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>court must review the requested information <em>in camera </em>to see if the file actually contains information that is \u201cessential and reasonably necessary to the defense at trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Here, after the trial court conducted its <em>in camera </em>review, it ordered disclosure of those portions of the records that it deemed were essential and reasonably necessary to the defense. Those portions of the records that the trial court deemed not to be essential and reasonably necessary to the defense remained sealed by the trial court and were not disclosed to counsel. The defendant now argues that the trial court may have erred in determining that the sealed records were not subject to disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We review a trial court\u2019s decisions on the management of discovery and the admissibility of evidence under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. <em>State v. Amirault, </em>149 N.H. 541, 543-44 (2003).

I join fully in the majority\u2019s thoughtful opinion in this case. I write separately, however, to address an issue that has troubled me for some time, that being our repeated use of the phrase \u201cessential and reasonably necessary\u201d as the standard for determining whether otherwise privileged materials, such as counseling records of the alleged crime victim, must be disclosed to the defense for use at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">We first used the phrase to describe the standard for disclosure of privileged materials to a criminal defendant in <em>State v. Farrow, </em>116 N.H. 731, 733 (1976). In <em>Farrow, </em>we were \u201cfaced with the question whetherf, and the extent to which,] the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation entitle[d] him to have access to and to use information which falls within the scope of [doctor/psychologist patient] privileges for the purpose of cross-examination and impeachment.\u201d <em>Farrow, </em>116 N.H. at 733. After rejecting the proposition that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308 (1974), gave the criminal defendant \u201ca right to the blanket use of privileged information,\u201d we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the defendant\u2019s right is limited to the use of such materials as are found to be <em>essential and reasonably necessary to permit counsel adequately to cross-examine for the purpose of showing unreliability or bias. </em>To prevent abuse and to protect the witnesses from unnecessary embarrassment the trial court should examine with counsel the records and other materials in question and determine what parts, if any, the defendant will be permitted to use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see State v. Thresher, </em>122 N.H. 63, 72 (1982) (holding that trial court properly refused to permit disclosure of privileged communications, in part, because \u201cuse of the privileged information was not essential to the defense\u201d); <em>State v. Kupchun, </em>117 N.H. 412, 415 (1977) (citing <em>Farrow </em>when stating \u201cthe [physician/psychologist patient] privileges are not absolute and must yield when disclosure of the information concerned is considered essential\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In <em>State v. Gagne, </em>136 N.H. 101, 104 (1992), we set forth the two distinct, yet intertwined, issues involved when a defendant desires to obtain privileged information: how the defendant can obtain <em>in camera </em>review by the trial court, and access to the information for use at trial. It is with regard to the second issue that we ascribed the \u201cessential and reasonably necessary\u201d standard developed in <em>Farrow. See Gagne, </em>136 N.H. at 104. We have since repeated the phrase \u201cessential and reasonably necessary to the defense at trial\u201d more or less routinely in numerous cases involving a defense request for another\u2019s privileged or confidential materials, including today\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., State v. Eaton, </em>162 N.H. 190, 195 (2011); <em>State v. Sargent, </em>148 N.H. 571, 573 (2002); <em>State v. McLellan, </em>146 N.H. 108, 113 (2001); <em>State v. Hoag, </em>145 N.H. 47, 50 (2000); <em>State v. Graham, </em>142 N.H. 357, 364 (1997). However, we have never elaborated upon or explained what this phrase means, perhaps because <em>post-Gagne, </em>the cases before us that related to a criminal defendant\u2019s ability to access another\u2019s privileged or confidential materials, by and large, involved the trial court\u2019s decision to deny a defense request for <em>in camera </em>review, rather than a decision on the disclosure of the information for defense use at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>But see Sargent, </em>148 N.H. at 573-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Most recently, in <em>Petition of State of New Hampshire (State v. MacDonald), </em>162 N.H. 64, 70 (2011), we held that the trial court erred by granting the State and the defense access to the alleged victim\u2019s medical and mental health records, without first conducting an <em>in camera </em>review to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>ascertain what, if any, records should be disclosed. While we referred to the burden of the party seeking disclosure to establish an \u201cessential need\u201d for the information contained in the privileged records, <em>see id. </em>(\u201cessential need\u201d relates to whether the targeted information is unavailable from another source and whether a compelling justification exists for disclosure), it is not clear whether we intended this language to describe a burden the same as, or in some way different from, the \u201cessential and reasonably necessary\u201d standard recited in <em>Farrow </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Today, I focus only on my linguistic concerns about the phrase \u201cessential and reasonably necessary to the defense at trial.\u201d An ordinary understanding of \u201cessential\u201d includes \u201cnecessary,\u201d \u201cimportant in the highest degree,\u201d and \u201csomething necessary, indispensable, or unavoidable.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S Third New International Dictionary 777 (unabridged ed. 2002). Thus, if certain information is \u201cessential\u201d to a criminal defendant\u2019s defense, then it is, by common understanding, \u201cnecessary\u201d to the defense. If this were all there was to it, I could ignore the needless use of duplicative words as a minor annoyance, perhaps attributable to the chronic affliction of lawyers (who later become judges) for frequently indulging their impulse to use multiple words when one word will do.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">But when the word \u201creasonably\u201d is thrown into the mix, the problem becomes more substantive, for this word modifies \u201cnecessary\u201d in a way that gives it a more expansive meaning than \u201cessential.\u201d Hence, while all information that is \u201cessential\u201d to the defense is also \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to the defense, the converse is not true: there may be some information that is <em>\u201creasonably </em>necessary\u201d to the defense that falls short of being \u201cessential\u201d to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">I would be open to considering adoption of either standard (essential or reasonably necessary) as the one that should govern this issue, or to distinguishing the meaning and application of each term, \u201cessential\u201d and \u201creasonably necessary,\u201d if that is appropriate. The critical point, in my view, is that we should adopt a <em>dear standard </em>for the guidance of defendants, lawyers and trial judges. Because this issue is not raised in the present case, the court\u2019s opinion understandably does not address it. However, I believe this is an area of the law that merits clarification as soon as the issue is presented in an appropriate case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> In addition to the above cited cases, <em>see generally State v.
