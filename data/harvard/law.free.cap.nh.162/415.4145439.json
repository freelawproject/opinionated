Day (Estate), Byron S. Day and Stephanie L. Day, appeal the Superior Court\u2019s <em>(Tucker, </em>J.) ruling that respondent Hanover Insurance Company\u2019s (Hanover) consent to settle a claim by the petitioners with the insurer of a third party tortfeasor did not preclude Hanover from contesting its liability to provide the Estate underinsured motorist coverage under its insurance contract with the Estate\u2019s decedent. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">The summary judgment record reveals the following pertinent facts. On September 18, 2007, June M. Day was fatally injured in a motor vehicle accident. The collision occurred on Route 1-93 in Hooksett, when a vehicle operated by Lisa Follett that was traveling north crossed the median and struck Day\u2019s vehicle that was traveling south.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">At the time of the accident, Day\u2019s vehicle was insured under an automobile liability policy and a personal umbrella policy issued by Hanover, and both policies provided underinsured motorist coverage. Specifically, Hanover was obligated to \u201cpay compensatory damages which an \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of... [a]n... \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by an \u2018insured\u2019 and caused by an accident.\u201d Follett\u2019s vehicle was insured by the Commerce Insurance Company (Commerce) under a policy that provided a bodily injury coverage limit of $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">Following the accident, the petitioners made a claim against the Commerce policy, and in November 2008 Commerce offered its policy limit. By letter dated February 17, 2009, Hanover agreed that the petitioners could accept the settlement offered by Commerce \u201cwhile reserving [Hanover\u2019s] right to continue the investigation into liability in this matter,\u201d and noting that Hanover had \u201cneither accepted nor denied liability.\u201d The petitioners accepted payment from Commerce and executed a release of Follett and Commerce from any further liability arising out of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Thereafter, the petitioners took the position that, by consenting to the settlement with Follett and Commerce, Hanover was precluded from contesting that the petitioners were \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d damages from Follett, and, when Hanover disagreed with the petitioners\u2019 position, the petitioners instituted this declaratory judgment action in superior court. Ruling on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court rejected the petitioners\u2019 position and concluded that Hanover\u2019s agreement to the settlement did not preclude it from contesting its liability to provide underinsured motorist coverage. The court therefore dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The petitioners filed an objection to the dismissal and a motion for clarification and reconsideration. In the motion, the petitioners argued that the court had \u201cmisunderstood the essence of the petition,\u201d and that they did not assert \u201cthat Hanover\u2019s consent to settlement gives the Petitioners a legal entitlement to uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d Rather, the petitioners urged that the question it had asked the court to rule upon was whether Hanover participated in good faith in the settlement process. The trial court denied the petitioners\u2019 objection and motion, ruling that it had not misunderstood the issue presented and that, even if the issue was as the petitioners reformulated it, that issue was not the proper subject for a declaratory judgment action. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>N. Sec. Ins. Co. v. Connors, </em>161 N.H. 645, 649 (2011); <em>see </em>RSA 491:8-a (2010). If our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment. <em>N. Sec. Ins. Co., </em>161 N.H. at 649. We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The petitioners argue that the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that Hanover\u2019s consent to the settlement with Commerce does not preclude Hanover from disputing its liability to provide the petitioners with underinsured motorist coverage. The only authority they cite for this position is the following statement contained in an insurance law treatise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">[W]hen the insurer providing uninsured (or underinsured) motorist insurance coverage consented to or approved a settlement by an insured with a tortfeasor or anyone else who may be legally obligated, such a settlement does not provide an insurer with a basis for denying a claim for uninsured motorist insurance benefits on the ground that an insured is not legally entitled to recover for damages caused by an uninsured motorist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>1 A.L. Widiss &amp; J.E. Thomas, Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist INSURANCE \u00a7 7.2, at 368-69 (3d ed. rev. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">However, contrary to the petitioners\u2019 argument, the above passage provides no support for the view that Hanover\u2019s consent to the settlement with Follett and Commerce precludes Hanover from contesting its liability to provide the petitioners with underinsured motorist coverage. Rather, the passage merely indicates that an underinsured motorist carrier, such as Hanover, cannot utilize its consent to a settlement with a third party tortfeasor or the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier as a ground for denying underinsured motorist coverage to its insured <em>on the basis that the insured is not legally entitled to recover damages caused by the underinsured motorist. </em>Indeed, the quoted language is found in a section of the treatise entitled \u201cFault,\u201d which begins with the statement: \u201cThe right of an insured to recover under the uninsured motorist coverage is contingent on the insured being legally entitled to recovery because the injuries were caused by the negligent operation of an uninsured highway motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363. The record here contains no indication that Hanover has attempted to deny coverage on the basis of the petitioners\u2019 settlement with Follett and Commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The Hanover policy contains the following pertinent provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-W\">PART C. Uninsured Motorists Coverage INSURING AGREEMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">A.

Either party may make a demand for arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">ADDITIONAL DUTY</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">With respect to damages an \u201cinsured\u201d is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d, a person seeking coverage must also promptly notify us in writing of a tentative settlement between the \u201cinsured\u201d and the insurer of the \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d and allow us 30 days to advance payment to that \u201cinsured\u201d in an amount equal to the tentative settlement to preserve our rights against the insurer, owner or operator of such \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">PART F \u2014 GENERAL PROVISIONS OUR RIGHT TO RECOVER PAYMENT</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-13\">A.

Fail to advance payment to the \u201cinsured\u201d in an amount equal to the tentative settlement within 30 days after receipt of notification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Under the above policy terms, which are clear and unambiguous, <em>see Matarese v. N.H. Mun. Assoc. Prop. - Liab. Ins. Trust, </em>147 N.H. 396, 403 (2002), Hanover\u2019s consent to the settlement had the effect of waiving Hanover\u2019s right to pursue a subrogation claim against Follett or Commerce. But there is nothing in these terms indicating that such consent bars Hanover from contesting whether its insured is \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d from Follett.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">In <em>Funai v. Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Co., </em>145 N.H. 642 (2000), we addressed the closely related question of whether an uninsured motorist carrier\u2019s consent to settlement with the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer required the uninsured motorist carrier to arbitrate the plaintiffs\u2019 claims rather than insisting on a trial in court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The policy at issue provided for arbitration of disputes between the uninsured motorist carrier and its insured upon the written consent of both parties. <em>See Funai, </em>145 N.H. at 645. In rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">There is no correlation between consent to settle and consent to arbitrate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">Acceptance of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that consent to settle is tantamount to consent to arbitrate would require us to find by implication a waiver by Metropolitan of its right to submit the dispute to trial. It is axiomatic that whenever a case involves contested issues of material fact, the parties are entitled to a final hearing or a trial at which they may produce evidence and submit written arguments on the law. Furthermore, if the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>alleged additional damages exceed $1,500.00, such a holding would imply waiver by Metropolitan of its constitutional right to trial by jury-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">We will not find waiver of such a right without a clear expression by a party to do so. Because we find that Metropolitan had no reason to anticipate implications regarding its right to litigate its dispute with the plaintiffs when it consented to allow the plaintiffs to settle with the underinsured motorist, we will not find Metropolitan waived its right to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 645-46 (brackets, quotations, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AMr\">Similarly, in this case we find \u201cno correlation\u201d between Hanover\u2019s consent to the settlement with Follett and Commerce and a consent to its liability to provide underinsured motorist coverage. Our conclusion is consistent with that reached by the Massachusetts Appeals Court in <em>Furukawa v. Arbella Mutual Insurance Co., </em>794 N.E.2d 1225 (Mass. App. Ct. 2003). In rejecting the very argument asserted by the petitioners here, the court in <em>Furukawa </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">There would be no sound reason to require the insurer that provides underinsured coverage to withhold its consent to a settlement with the alleged tortfeasor as a condition of being able later to contest the tortfeasor\u2019s liability in relation to its coverage of excess damages. There are many reasons why the alleged tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer might choose not to contest liability, particularly where the coverage limit is small in relation to the likely cost of a successful defense. Why should the victim\u2019s own insurer of uncovered damages be forced to oppose a settlement beneficial to its own policyholder to preserve its right to contest its own liability, with, as here, far larger exposure limits?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\"><em>Furukawa, </em>794 N.E.2d at 1228. We are in full agreement with this reasoning. To hold, as the petitioners urge, that the underinsured carrier\u2019s consent to settlement with the tortfeasor precludes that carrier from contesting the tortfeasor\u2019s liability would be to foster an unsound public policy that would discourage first party insurers such as Hanover from agreeing to settlements that inure to the benefit of their policyholders. We refuse to countenance such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">The petitioners also return to the theme they presented in their motion to clarify and reconsider the trial court\u2019s order, <em>i.e., </em>that the essence of their complaint was not that Hanover was precluded from contesting its liability, but that Hanover did not participate in good faith in the settlement process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>because it delayed in either acknowledging or disputing its liability to provide underinsured motorist coverage. The petitioners suggest that because this issue remained alive even after the trial court ruled in Hanover\u2019s favor on the summary judgment motions, the court erred in dismissing the action. The short answer to this argument is that, in ruling on the petitioners\u2019 motion for clarification or reconsideration, the trial court specifically found that the parties had agreed the only issue to be decided in this case was whether Hanover\u2019s consent to the settlement had the legal effect of precluding Hanover from contesting its liability to provide underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"> In support of this ruling, the trial court relied upon: (1) the petitioners\u2019 objection to Hanover\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, in which the petitioners represented that \u201c \u2018[t]he singular issue of law before the Court\u2019 is \u2018whether Hanover, after having consented to settlement by its insured with the underlying tortfeasor, can ultimately deny a claim for uninsured motorist coverage benefits on the ground that its insured is not legally entitled to recover damages caused by the tortfeasor\u2019 (2) the petitioners\u2019 motion to remove the case from the jury trial list, wherein they stated that there were no factual issues in dispute but only the single issue of law just recited; and (3) the petitioners\u2019 failure to dispute the order issued by the court following the summary judgment hearing in which the court again described the aforesaid legal issue as the only matter to be decided in the case. The petitioners have not provided us with then-pleadings related to items (1) and (2), and do not challenge the court\u2019s ruling on item (3). <em>See Bean v. Red Oak Prop. Mgmt., </em>151 N.H. 248, 250 (2004) (appealing party has the burden of presenting this court with a record sufficient to decide its issues on appeal). Accordingly, we must assume that the record supports the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding the litigation strategy the petitioners pursued below. <em>See id.; Atwood v. Owens, </em>142 N.H. 396, 399 (1997). In any event, insofar, as the petitioners complain that Hanover failed to exercise good faith in that it delayed investigating and processing their claim, we note that the petitioners at all times had it within their power under the terms of the policy to address this problem by demanding arbitration of its underinsured motorist claim against Hanover, or, alternatively, by filing a breach of contract action in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-7\">DALIANIS, C.J., and DUGGAN, CONBOY and HICKS, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-11\"> <em>Funai </em>is not directly on point because in that case, unlike this one, it does not appear the plaintiffs were asserting that Metropolitan was precluded from contesting its liability to provide coverage in the arbitration proceeding plaintiffs demanded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
