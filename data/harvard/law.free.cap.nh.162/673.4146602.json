We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The following facts were found by the trial court, are supported in the record, or are established as a matter of law. \u201cNHRS is a defined benefit pension trust for state and political subdivision employees.\u201d <em>Bd. of Trustees, N.H. Judicial Ret. Plan v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>161 N.H. 49, 50 (2010); <em>see </em>RSA 100-A:2 (2001), :3 (Supp. 2010) (amended 2011). \u201cIt is funded exclusively through member and employer contributions and investment income.\u201d <em>Bd. of Trustees, N.H. Judicial Ret. Plan, </em>161 N.H. at 50; <em>see </em>RSA 100-A:16 (Supp. 2010) (amended 2011). NHRS members meeting certain creditable service and other requirements, <em>see </em>RSA 100-A:5 (2001) (amended 2011), :6 (Supp. 2010) (amended 2011), become entitled, at retirement, to \u201creceive a defined lifetime \u2018retirement allowance,\u2019 consisting of \u2018the sum of the member annuity and the state annuity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Petition of Concord Teachers, </em>158 N.H. 529, 530-31 (2009) (citation omitted) (quoting RSA 100-A:5, :1, XXII (2001)); <em>see </em>RSA 100-A:1, XX, XXI (2001) (defining \u201cMember annuity\u201d and \u201cState annuity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Union Leader describes itself as \u201ca publisher of newspapers of general circulation, and other media, throughout the state of New Hampshire, and elsewhere.\u201d In February 2010, a Union Leader reporter requested, under the Right-to-Know Law, that NHRS provide \u201c[a] list of names of the 500 state retirement system members who received the highest annual pension payments from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2009. Also include the amount each of these top 500 pension earners received that year.\u201d The reporter stated that she made the \u201crequest as a reporter for the New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper for an article I will write on the state retirement system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">NHRS denied the request, but offered to provide a list, updated as of December 2009, of all state \u201cannuities ranked from highest to lowest by amount of their annual benefit.\u201d The list would \u201cidentif[y] the annuity type, member category (police, fire, teacher, employee), and whether the annuitant\u2019s last employer was either the State of NH or a political subdivision.\u201d Union Leader thereafter filed a petition with the trial court under the Right-to-Know Law for access to the information it had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>The trial court granted the petition, finding that the information was \u201csubject to mandatory disclosure\u201d under RSA 91-A:4, I-a (Supp. 2010), and was not exempt as a \u201cfile[] whose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy.\u201d RSA 91-A:5, IV (Supp. 2010). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">On appeal, NHRS argues that the trial court erred in: (1) concluding that the plain language of RSA 91-A:4, I-a required disclosure of the requested records; (2) finding RSA 91-A:4, I-a unambiguous and therefore failing to consult legislative history; (3) failing to recognize the privacy interest at stake in disclosing retirees\u2019 names and annuity amounts; and (4) failing to assess the public\u2019s interest in disclosure and balance it against NHRS\u2019s interest in nondisclosure and the retirees\u2019 privacy interests. Union Leader argues that the trial court correctly ordered disclosure, but erred in failing to award it attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Resolution of NHRS\u2019s first two arguments requires us to interpret RSA 91-A:4, I-a, \u201cwhich is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d ATV Watch v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>161 N.H. 746, 752 (2011) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">When interpreting a statute, we first look to the plain meaning of the words used and will consider legislative history only if the statutory language is ambiguous. We resolve questions regarding the Right-to[-]Know law with a view to providing the utmost information in order to best effectuate the statutory and constitutional objective of facilitating access to all public documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">RSA 91-A:4, I-a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">Records of any payment made to an employee of any public body or agency listed in RSA 91-A:l-a, VI(a)-(d), or to the employee\u2019s agent or designee, <em>upon </em>the resignation, discharge, or retirement of the employee, paid in addition to regular salary and accrued vacation, sick, or other leave, shall immediately be made available without alteration for public inspection. All records of payments shall be available for public inspection notwithstanding that the matter may have been considered or acted upon in nonpublic session pursuant to RSA 91-A:3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">RSA 91-A:4, I-a (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">The trial court found the statutory language unambiguous and concluded that it subjected to \u201cmandatory disclosure\u201d \u201cany payments made to state employees [who] have retired.\u201d NHRS challenges that conclusion, arguing that \u201c[t]he plain language of the statute does not require disclosure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>retirement payments to retirees, but rather only applies to incentive payments made to employees to bring about their retirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The trial court construed the term \u201cupon\u201d as used in the statute to mean \u201cimmediately or very soon after\u201d and concluded that the term \u201cdoes not limit the statute to one-time payments remitted at the moment of retirement, but instead contemplates payments made both immediately at the moment of retirement and during the duration of retirement.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) NHRS contends that this interpretation, covering payments made throughout retirement, \u201cstretches \u2018very soon after\u2019 far beyond the plain meaning of \u2018upon.\u2019 \u201d We agree. Although the definition cited by the trial court is an accepted meaning of the term, it does not support the court\u2019s construction of the statute. Rather, it requires the payment to be temporally proximate to the occasion of retirement, a construction more in line with that put forth by NHRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Nevertheless, Union Leader argues that the term \u201c \u2018upon\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018after\u2019 or \u2018in the event of\u2019 \u201d and, therefore, any payment made \u201cupon\u201d the retirement of a public employee includes \u201cevery single payment made by a public entity as a result of the retirement, including NHRS\u2019s payments to a retired employee as retirement allowance.\u201d We conclude that both of the above definitions of the term \u201cupon\u201d are acceptable and that both NHRS\u2019s and Union Leader\u2019s constructions of the statute are plausible. \u201cSince there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the[] statutory provision[], we conclude that the statute is ambiguous, and we look to legislative history to aid our analysis.\u201d <em>Appeal of Gamas, </em>158 N.H. 646, 649 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">RSA 91-A:4, I-a was enacted in 1997 by Laws 1997, 90:2. The provision was prefaced by the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">The general court hereby finds that it is essential to the conduct of public business that public bodies, in order to be accountable to the people, make available all records pertaining to payments made to employees of the public body <em>in connection with their leaving employment </em>that <em>are not payments associated with </em>an employee\u2019s salary and <em>accrued benefits.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Laws 1997,90:1 (emphasis added). Representative Sandra B. Keans, for the Judiciary and Family Law Committee, stated before the House of Representatives: \u201cThe committee agreed with the sponsor that when a public employee is terminated, the financial payment should be public information available under the right-to-know law. This bill does not in any way provide for disclosure of personnel issues.\u201d N.H.H.R. JOUR. 426 (1997). Before the Senate, Senator Sheila Roberge explained the impetus for the bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>This bill makes payments made in addition to regular salary and accrued vacation, sick, or other leave paid to an employee of a public body upon the employee\u2019s resignation, discharge, or retirement, subject to the right-to-know law. This bill arose out of a situation in Hampton wherein the town manager was paid one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars to vacate the position immediately. Evidently the decision may have been made in haste, and the accounting methods used to calculate the severance sum [were] not readily available. Under HB 624, concerned citizens will be able to discern what information was used to calculate the <em>severance pay.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">N.H.S. JOUR. 501 (1997) (emphasis added). The legislative history clearly supports NHRS\u2019s argument that RSA 91-A:4, I-a was intended to apply \u201conly ... to incentive payments made to employees to bring about their retirement,\u201d not to regular retirement annuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Union Leader contends that regardless of legislative history, the statute applies to retirement annuities. It argues that \u201c[t]he legislature could have drafted the amendment to be narrowly tailored to address the fact pattern at issue in the Town of Hampton,\u201d but instead \u201cchose to make \u2018any\u2019 and \u2018all\u2019 records of payments immediately available.\u201d We are not persuaded. Having found that the statutory language the legislature chose to use, as a whole, is ambiguous, we are obliged to consult legislative history. <em>See Barksdale v. Town of Epsom, </em>136 N.H. 511, 514 (1992) (noting that \u201cinherent ambiguity necessitates an investigation beyond the statute to the relevant legislative history,\u201d among other interpretive aids). Where that history plainly supports a particular construction of the statute, we will adopt that construction, since our task in interpreting statutes \u201cis to determine legislative intent.\u201d <em>Goldstein v. Town of Bedford, </em>154 N.H. 393, 395 (2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Although we have concluded that RSA 91-A:4, I-a does not compel disclosure of the records at issue, the question remains whether they are subject to disclosure under the general mandate of RSA 91-A:4 and Part I, Article 8 of the New Hampshire Constitution. Union Leader asserts that \u201cNHRS does not deny that it is a public entity, administering public funds, and that its records are subject to the Right-to-Know Law. Neither [RSA chapter] 100-A nor [RSA] 91-A:5 contains any explicit provision for confidentiality of NHRS records.\u201d NHRS, however, contends that the requested records are exempt from disclosure under RSA 91-A:5, IV because release of that information would \u201cinterfered significantly with a retiree\u2019s privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>RSA 91-A:5, IV exempts from the disclosure provisions of RSA chapter 91-A the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">Records pertaining to internal personnel practices; confidential, commercial, or financial information; test questions, scoring keys, and other examination data used to administer a licensing examination, examination for employment, or academic examinations; and personnel, medical, welfare, library user, videotape sale or rental, and other files whose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">RSA 91-A:5, TV.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">We have stated that this section \u201cmeans that financial information and personnel files and other information necessary to an individual\u2019s privacy need not be disclosed.\u201d <em>Mans v. Lebanon School Bd., </em>112 N.H. 160, 162 (1972). In determining whether the release of public records would entail an invasion of privacy under RSA 91-A:5, IV, we conduct a three-step analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">First, we evaluate whether there is a privacy interest at stake that would be invaded by the disclosure. If no privacy interest is at stake, the Right-to-Know Law mandates disclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX_\">Next, we assess the public\u2019s interest in disclosure. Disclosure of the requested information should inform the public about the conduct and activities of their government. Finally, we balance the public interest in disclosure against the government interest in nondisclosure and the individual\u2019s privacy interest in nondisclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-11\"><em>Lamy v. N.H. Pub. Utils. Comm\u2019n, </em>152 N.H. 106, 109 (2005) (citations omitted). \u2018Whether information is exempt from disclosure because it is private is judged by an objective standard and not by a party\u2019s subjective expectations ...\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">NHRS argues that the trial court erred in conducting this analysis by failing to recognize the privacy interest at stake, and failing to \u201cassess[] the minimal public interest in this matter.\u201d In other words, NHRS contends that the trial court erroneously truncated the analysis at the first factor because it \u201cerred in failing to recognize any privacy interest in a retiree\u2019s annual benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">The trial court found Union Leader\u2019s request for retirement records \u201canalogous to the petitioner\u2019s request for the names and salaries of teachers in <em>Mansi </em>It concluded that disclosure of retirees\u2019 names and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>amount of their benefits would \u201cnot invade any privacy interest\u201d and therefore ruled that disclosure was mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">In <em>Mans, </em>we addressed whether the Right-to-Know Law entitled a resident taxpayer of Lebanon to disclosure of the name and salary of each schoolteacher in the Lebanon School District. <em>Mans, </em>112 N.H. at 161. We determined that \u201c[t]he salaries of public employees . . . are not intimate details the disclosure of which might harm the individual\u201d and \u201cconclude[d] that it was the determination of the legislature that disclosure of salaries of schoolteachers is not a disclosure of those intimate details which would constitute invasion of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164 (quotations and ellipsis omitted). In so holding, we \u201cnoted that for many years in this State salaries of public officials and employees, State and municipal, have been commonly published by statute, or made available to the public or disclosed voluntarily without significant damage to individual dignity or the efficient management of the State system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163 (citation omitted); <em>see </em>RSA ch. 94 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">We followed <em>Mans </em>in <em>Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire v. Local Government Center, </em>159 N.H. 699 (2010), where we affirmed an order requiring the Local Government Center to disclose the \u201cnames and individual salary information\u201d of its employees. <em>Prof'l Firefighters, </em>159 N.H. at 710. We concluded that the private employees of the Local Government Center, a conceded governmental entity, had \u201cno greater privacy interest regarding their individual salary information than traditional public employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">NHRS acknowledges the holdings of <em>Mans </em>and <em>Professional Firefighters </em>with respect to the salaries of employees of governmental entities, but contends that neither case \u201cstands for the proposition that there is absolutely no privacy interest in such information.\u201d To a certain extent, we agree, having \u201cacknowledged^ in <em>Mans,] </em>that salary information generally constitutes private information and would be subject to the exemption at issue if we were to construe that exemption broadly.\u201d <em>Prof'l Firefighters, </em>159 N.H. at 708. Nevertheless, that does not end our inquiry. Where, as here, an \u201cexemption is claimed on privacy grounds, we examine the nature of the requested document or material and its relationship to the basic purpose of the Right-to-Know Law.\u201d <em>Union Leader Corp. v. N.H. Housing Fin. Auth., </em>142 N.H. 540, 554 (1997) (quotation omitted). NHRS argues that the information at issue here is critically different from the employees\u2019 salaries at issue in <em>Mans </em>and <em>Professional Firefighters. </em>Specifically, it argues that the trial court failed to recognize significant differences \u201cbetween employees of a governmental entity and retirees, and . . . between salaries and retirement benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>It argues, for example, that \u201c[r]etirement benefits... differ from salaries as the amount of one\u2019s retirement benefit may depend on an individual\u2019s particular and personal family and financial situation,\u201d such as the retiree\u2019s divorce, separation or disability, which the retiree \u201cha[s] a strong interest in keeping ... private.\u201d Union Leader counters that judicial orders such as divorce decrees are already public records and that it is not seeking information about any retiree\u2019s medical or disabling condition. We conclude that while the amount of a retiree\u2019s benefit may be affected by private information such as disability, disclosure of the amount does not reveal any of that private information. Thus, we are not persuaded by NHRS\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">NHRS further contends that retirees differ from the schoolteachers in <em>Mans </em>because they \u201care more likely to be elderly and specifically targeted by fraudulent solicitations and scams.\u201d We agree with Union Leader, however, that this claim is speculative at best given the meager evidence presented in its support.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">NHRS further relies on <em>Lamy, </em>in which we held that the Right-to-Know Law did not require disclosure of the names and street addresses of residential customers of Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) contained in a report filed by PSNH with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission. <em>Lamy, </em>152 N.H. at 107, 113. NHRS asserts that although <em>Lamy </em>did not involve a request for financial information, we recognized that such information \u201craises the stakes and implicates an individual\u2019s privacy interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In <em>Lamy, </em>we stated: \u2018We are cognizant that the privacy interest of residential customers in this case is weaker than in cases where names and addresses are associated with other private information, such as financial information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110. Thus, while we opined that inclusion of financial information in a Right-to-Know request would strengthen the privacy interest associated with names and addresses, we did not assess the strength of an interest in names and financial information without addresses. Indeed, the inclusion of addresses was significant in <em>Lamy, </em>as we noted that \u201cdisclosing a person\u2019s name and address implicates that person\u2019s privacy rights because the disclosure serves as a conduit into the sanctuary of the home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). Because addresses were not requested here, we find <em>Lamy </em>inapposite. Furthermore, while \u201c[w]e are cognizant... that individual names and home addresses are often publicly available,\u201d <em>id., </em>we conclude that fact adds little weight to the retirees\u2019 privacy interest. <em>See Sonoma County Employees\u2019 Retirement Ass\u2019n v. Superior Ct., </em>130 Cal. Rptr. 3d 540, 555 (Ct. App. 2011) (noting that the exclusion of addresses and other contact data from the California Public Records Act request \u201cdiminishe[d] the force\u201d of retirement association\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>argument that disclosure of retirees\u2019 and retirement benefits \u201cwill expose its retirees to annoyance and abuse\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">NHRS also argues that in finding no privacy interest at stake, the trial court failed to recognize that retirement annuities are \u201cfundamentally different from salaries which may be affected by the action of a local governing body.\u201d We find this argument more applicable to the second prong of the analysis and will address it there. In sum, we find that retirees have a privacy interest in information associating their names with the amount of their retirement benefits, but conclude that it is not appreciably different from public employees\u2019 interest in keeping the amount of their salaries private.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">NHRS next argues that the trial court erred by failing to \u201cassessQ the minimal public interest in this matter.\u201d It contends that \u201c[disclosure of names with financial information does not tell the public anything directly about what the NHRS is up to\u201d and asserts that \u201c[a]t most, the Union Leader seeks \u2018derivative use of the information.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">We have noted that disclosure of requested information is not warranted when it \u201cdoes not serve the purpose of informing the citizenry about the activities of their, government.\u201d <em>Union Leader Corp. v. City of Nashua, </em>141 N.H. 473, 477 (1996) (quotation omitted). NHRS argues that disclosing the amount of retirement benefits that named retirees receive \u201cdoes not inform the public as to the structure, duties, management, determinations or procedures of the NHRS.\u201d It cites <em>National Association of Retired Federal Employees v. Horner, </em>879 F.2d 873 (D.C. Cir. 1989), for the proposition that while aggregate annuity data \u201cmight be of public interest, identifying individual recipients did not implicate a public interest.\u201d <em>National Association of Retired Federal Employees, </em>however, did not involve a request for individual annuity amounts but rather for annuitants\u2019 names and addresses. <em>National Ass\u2019n of Retired Federal Emp., </em>879 F.2d at 874. We therefore find it inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Union Leader, on the other hand, argues that the aggregate data \u201cNHRS proposes to disclose, without its members\u2019 names, sheds absolutely no light on whether its formula for calculating retirement benefits is being followed, or whether it has been calculated correctly with respect to individual members.\u201d It is not immediately obvious, however, how disclosure of names and benefit amounts alone, sheds light upon whether NHRS is calculating benefits correctly or following its formula for calculating benefits. Thus, NHRS argues that Union Leader seeks, at most, derivative use of the requested information. We explained the concept of derivative use in <em>Lamy:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>The asserted public interest in disclosing [the requested information] stems not from the disclosure of the . . . [withheld] information itself, but rather from the hope that the petitioner, or others, may be able to use that information to obtain additional information outside the [public entity\u2019s] files. The public has an interest in the disclosure of the [requested information] solely because of how [it] can be used by the petitioner, or others, to discover additional information about the [public entity].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><em>Lamy, </em>152 N.H. at 111 (quotation, citation and brackets omitted). Where derivative use constitutes the only public interest in the information\u2019s disclosure, it is entitled to little weight. <em>Id. </em>at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Union Leader counters that it does not seek a derivative use as it is not hoping to use the information to obtain additional material from an outside source; rather, it asserts that \u201c[t]he names of the annuitants are the necessary pieces of information missing in order for the public to have effective, meaningful access to information about the activities of NHRS.\u201d At the hearing before the trial court, Union Leader\u2019s attorney explained: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>It appears, then, that Union Leader seeks to use the information to uncover potential governmental error or corruption. We cannot say that there is no public interest in such a use. <em>See Prof'l Firefighters, </em>159 N.H. at 709 (\u201cPublic scrutiny can expose corruption, incompetence, inefficiency, prejudice and favoritism.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>[W]ithout knowing the name [of the annuitant], it\u2019s impossible for anyone to know whether those payments are calculated in accordance with the formula, and the example that\u2019s coming to me is, if the person is named, then the public can know, wait, that\u2019s not right, or how can it be that he makes that much money in his retirement when he only served as a public servant for a year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">THE COURT: So, you\u2019re essentially saying that the public\u2019s right to know is the right to know information that is \u2014 assists them in making an assessment as to whether something is amiss, and that the name, given the public\u2019s perhaps other knowledge about that individual, will assist them in them saying, wait. Whereas, if they get a list [without names], they just don\u2019t know whether the fellow that\u2019s at the top is someone that they would have suspicion about because of information they\u2019d know about him separate and apart from the information contained in the list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">MS. SULLIVAN: There would be no way of knowing that. And I\u2019d submit that combining the publication of the name with the information that\u2019s out there in the public already isn\u2019t derivative use. It\u2019s very direct use. It doesn\u2019t require additional steps and research.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>As noted above, NHRS also argues that retirement annuities are \u201cfundamentally different from salaries which may be affected by the action of a local governing body. Rather, the amount of a retirement benefit is a formulaic calculation based on two variables, a member\u2019s average final compensation and a member\u2019s creditable service.\u201d In its pleadings below, NHRS used this distinction to argue that because NHRS could not alter the formula, the information sought by Union Leader reveals nothing about the operations of NHRS. Even assuming NHRS has no discretion to alter the calculation of benefits, that is not dispositive of the public\u2019s interest in knowing the amount thereof. Public employers contribute to the fund used to pay annuities. <em>See </em>RSA 100-A:16, II (regarding the State annuity accumulation fund). \u201c[K]nowing how a public body is spending taxpayer money in conducting public business is essential to the transparency of government, the very purpose underlying the Right-to-Know Law.\u201d <em>Prof'l Firefighters, </em>159 N.H. at 709. To the extent that public funds are used to pay the annuities at issue, we conclude the public has some interest in knowing the amounts and to whom they are paid. <em>See Sonoma County Employees\u2019 Retirement Ass\u2019n, </em>130 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 555 (noting that even though only twenty percent of benefits paid by retirement association came directly from contributions of public employers, \u201cthe program [the association] administers is in the end a form of deferred <em>public </em>compensation for county employees\u201d and \u201c[a]s such, the taxpaying public has substantially the same interest in its operations and payout levels as it does in the salaries of county employees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\"> Our final task is to \u201cbalance the public interest in disclosure against the government interest in nondisclosure and the individual\u2019s privacy interest in nondisclosure.\u201d <em>Lamy, </em>152 N.H. at 109. We bear in mind that \u201c[t]he party resisting disclosure bears a heavy burden to shift the balance toward nondisclosure.\u201d <em>N.H. Housing Fin. Auth., </em>142 N.H. at 554 (quotation omitted). We have determined that retirees have a privacy interest in their names and benefit amounts, but that interest is comparable to public employees\u2019 privacy interest in their names and salaries. The public has an interest both in knowing how public funds are spent and in uncovering corruption and error in the administration of NHRS. In light of these conclusions, our prior decisions compel the result: Having held that a privacy interest on par with that at issue here was outweighed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>public interest in knowing \u201cwhere and how their tax dollars are spent,\u201d we similarly conclude that the disclosure of the information sought here would not constitute an invasion of privacy under RSA 91-A:5, IV. <em>Mans, </em>112 N.H. at 163, 164; <em>see Prof'l Firefighters, </em>159 N.H. at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Finally, Union Leader seeks reversal of the trial court\u2019s denial of its attorney\u2019s fees and costs. NHRS counters that Union Leader waived that claim by failing to file a cross-appeal. We agree and will not consider the request. <em>See Appeal of Campaign for Ratepayers\u2019 Rights, </em>162 N.H. 245, 249 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b717-7\">Dalianis, C.J., and Duggan, CONBOY and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
