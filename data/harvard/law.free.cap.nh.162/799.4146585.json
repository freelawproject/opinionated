We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">At the final pre-trial conference on December 28, 2009, the defendant\u2019s attorney, Lincoln T. Soldati, sought and received a continuance of the trial until January 25, 2010, to allow him to review new evidence with the defendant. Attorney Soldati then advised the court that the defendant was concerned that Attorney Soldati\u2019s recent election as mayor of Somersworth created a conflict of interest. The following colloquy between the court and the defendant then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-8\">THE COURT:... What did you want to tell me about this Office of Mayor issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-9\">THE DEFENDANT: . . . [I]t would seem contrary to Mr. Soldati\u2019s position of mayor to try to, you know, keep the community safe, you know, if I was exonerated from these charges. You know, it seemed like, well, he got a sex offender off back into the community. You know, it seems contrary to, you know, his goal as mayor and to have the confidence of his community behind him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-10\">That only came to light \u2014 it\u2019s not like, well he \u2014 you know, he got elected mayor and now it\u2019s an issue. That is not how it is. What had come to mind is, is after he got appointed as counsel in August, it was early September he came and visited me at the prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-11\">He only came ... with this Court\u2019s file that was handed to him with the indictments. We went over like my background, like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>education, family, you know, criminal history, . . . and we only generally and briefly touched about, you know, this case. Right? And then, you know, the visit was over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">The next I hear from him, right, in any form is ... nearly four months later, [when] I\u2019m told that on the next business day I have a final pretrial conference, and then Wednesday we\u2019re picking [the jury] ----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-6\">This was unexpected. I was not given any advance notice of [a] trial schedule. I had not met with counsel to discuss the case, to go over trial strategy, any evidence that I may have, expected witness testimony, what witnesses I intend to call. Any evidence whatsoever has not been discussed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-7\">So when he informed me that we\u2019re picking a jury on Wednesday and having the two-day trial, I was befuddled to imagine how counsel would expect to go ahead believing that this case would only involve two days, not knowing who to call for witnesses, or what to even ask the witnesses that are intended to be called, or what evidence I have to bring forward. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-8\">I believe that counsel should have met with me to some degree instead of automatically assuming what the case is based solely upon information received from the prosecution. I believe that a continuance is necessary. And, Your Honor, I\u2019m not looking forward to a continuance. I want this case over and done with. I want to present my defense, argue it, and move on with my life, and then my family can move on with their life. I\u2019m only asking for a continuance just so long enough to gather my exculpatory evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-9\">After that, Your Honor, let\u2019s schedule it, let\u2019s go to trial, let\u2019s get it over and done with. I cannot go to trial with no prepared defense. And that\u2019s where I stand today before this Court, with no prepared defense. So please, Your Honor, I\u2019m only asking for a continuance just so long enough to gather my evidence, and also in which time I can review the case more thoroughly or even to... begin to review my case with counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-10\">Also, and a note that I failed to mention that gave rise to a conflict is that when Attorney Soldati informed me, oh, yeah, you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>know, we haven\u2019t discussed the case, but we\u2019re going to trial...[,] I was under the impression he was going to sink my defense because it would be ludicrous for any attorney to go forward as such. So I was thinking he was going to sink my defense, go to trial, put on an effort like he gave a representation that was adequate enough, you know, just to sink the case so he can get that conviction so he did his community a favor, and the community around here. That\u2019s what gave rise to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">THE COURT: Okay. First, with respect to what I understand to be Mr. Towle\u2019s motion to \u2014 for new counsel based on the \u2014 his alleged or perceived conflict of interest arising from defense counsel\u2019s election as Mayor of Somersworth, I\u2019m going to deny that motion to the extent that you\u2019re requesting new counsel....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">With respect to . . . Mr. Towle\u2019s motion to continue, again, Mr. Soldati has represented that he can be prepared for trial by January 25th. That\u2019s four weeks from now. It would certainly seem to be adequate time in which to prepare for trial and obtain whatever exculpatory evidence or other trial preparation is needed to be accomplished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">So to the extent that the defendant is making a motion for a further continuance beyond January 25th, that motion is denied as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">The court asked the prosecution and defense if they had anything further to discuss and hearing that neither did, concluded the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">The defendant then asked whether he could \u201cmove to correct.\u201d When the court asked what he wanted to say, the defendant stated: \u201cI was not requesting for a new appointment of counsel, Your Honor.\u201d When the court asked why the defendant argued that Attorney Soldati had a conflict of interest, if not to request that new counsel be appointed, the defendant answered: \u201cTo proceed pro se, because I don\u2019t want to be delayed with appointment of new counsel to go through all this over again, you know. So I\u2019d like to have it amended that I was not asking for appointment of new counsel.\u201d The court then said: \u2018Well, at least at this stage \u2014 that\u2019s fine. I mean, I\u2019m not removing Mr. Soldati. If there\u2019s some further motion dealing with anything, I will address it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The defendant argues that the trial court violated the Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution by failing to treat his statements as a motion to proceed <em>pro se. </em>He asserts that because he timely and unequivocally invoked his constitutional right to self-representation and \u201c[n]othing about the circumstances suggested that [he] was not making his request knowingly, intelligently, or without awareness of the dangers of self-representation,\u201d the trial court erred by not permitting him to proceed <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s arguments under the State Constitution, using federal cases only to aid our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231, 233 (1983). Both Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to self-representation and the right to counsel. <em>State v. Ayer, </em>154 N.H. 500, 516 (2006); <em>see State v. Barham, </em>126 N.H. 631, 636 (1985); <em>see also Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 807 (1975). The two rights are mutually exclusive; the exercise of one right nullifies the other. <em>Ayer, </em>154 N.H. at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Because the two rights \u201care antithetical, and the exercise of one right nullifies the other[,]... we respect a waiver of the right to counsel only if the defendant has evinced an understanding of the right and has asserted an unequivocal desire to relinquish it.\u201d <em>State v. Panzera, </em>139 N.H. 235, 238 (1994) (citation omitted). Thus, to be effective, an assertion of the right to self-representation must be: (1) timely; (2) clear and unequivocal; and (3) knowing, intelligent and voluntary. <em>Ayer, </em>154 N.H. at 516. The issue in this case is whether it was clear and unequivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">While the dissent contends that whether a request for self-representation is clear and unequivocal is a question of fact, and, therefore, we review the trial court\u2019s decision deferentially, the parties have not addressed this issue in their briefs. We need not decide the proper standard of review in this case because the defendant prevails under either a <em>de novo </em>or a deferential standard of review. <em>See People v. Marshall, </em>931 P.2d 262, 274 (Cal. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">As we said in <em>State v. Sweeney, </em>151 N.H. 666, 670 (2005), \u201cTo invoke the right to self-representation, a defendant need not recite some talismanic formula.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) An affirmative, unequivocal, timely request will suffice. Here, there is no dispute that the defendant\u2019s request was timely. Based upon this record, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s request to represent himself was also affirmative and unequivocal, even though it was conditional. It was only after the court denied his request to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>dismiss his lawyer and 'to continue the case beyond January 25 that the defendant asked to represent himself. In other words, the defendant was essentially saying that if the court would not dismiss his lawyer or grant a continuance, then he wanted to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">We adopt the approach of a number of courts, which have held that a conditional request is not equivocal. <em>Williams v. Bartlett, </em>44 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 1994) (\u201c[A] defendant is not deemed to have equivocated in his desire for self-representation merely because he expresses that view in the alternative [and] simultaneously requests the appointment of new counsel.\u201d); <em>Adams v. Carroll, </em>875 F.2d 1441, 1445 (9th Cir. 1989) (\u201c[The defendant] repeatedly indicated his desire to represent himself if the only alternative was the appointment of [the public defender]. While his requests no doubt were <em>conditional, </em>they were not equivocal.\u201d); <em>State v. Richards, </em>456 N.W.2d 260, 264 (Minn. 1990) (\u201cThe case law is clear that a request to proceed <em>pro se </em>is not equivocal merely because it is an alternative position, advanced as a fallback to a primary request for different counsel.\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)); <em>Gallego v. State, </em>23 P.3d 227, 236 (Nev. 2001) (\u201c[T]he district court erred in finding the request [to proceed <em>pro </em>se] equivocal simply because [the defendant] preferred to have new counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Although a judge may deny a request to proceed <em>pro se </em>when it is \u201cmerely a tactic for delay,\u201d <em>United States v. Mackovich, </em>209 F.3d 1227, 1237 (10th Cir. 2000), or an \u201cimpulsive response,\u201d <em>People v. Barnett, </em>954 P.2d 384, 411 (Cal. 1998) (quotation omitted), or is \u201cmade in passing anger or frustration ... or to frustrate the orderly administration of justice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 410 (quotation omitted), or is an insincere ploy to disrupt the proceedings, <em>see Marshall, </em>931 P.2d at 274-75, the record in this case does not support such a conclusion. Here, faced with a timely, unequivocal and clear request to represent himself, the trial court\u2019s failure to inquire further constituted structural error requiring automatic reversal and a new trial. <em>State v. Ayer, </em>150 N.H. 14, 25 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Because the defendant prevails on his state claims, we need not reach the federal issues. <em>See Ball, </em>124 N.H. at 237. In light of our decision, we also need not address the defendant\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b836-9\">CONBOY, J., concurred; Lynn, J., concurred specially; Dalianis, C.J., with whom HICKS, J., joined, dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b836-10\">Lynn, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXC\">concurring specially. I join Justice Duggan\u2019s opinion for the court, but write separately to address more fully the points raised by the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>The dissent asserts that there is record support for the implicit finding of the trial court that the defendant\u2019s request for self-representation was \u201cneither unequivocal nor sincere.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 818. Even if one assumes that the trial court actually made such a finding <em>sub silencio </em>\u2014 a proposition I reject \u2014 I do not agree that the record is sufficient to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In support of its position, the dissent makes three basic points. First, it characterizes as specious the defendant\u2019s claim that Attorney Soldati had a conflict of interest in representing him arising out of Soldati\u2019s election as Mayor of Somersworth. However, the dissent does not clearly articulate what bearing it believes the merits of the defendant\u2019s complaints against Soldati have on the question of whether his request for self-representation was clear and unequivocal. There are two possibilities. On the one hand, if the dissent means to suggest that the mere lack of merit of the defendant\u2019s complaints against Soldati provides a justification for the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to proceed <em>pro se, </em>such a theory is legally unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The defendant voiced two complaints about Attorney Soldati: (1) that Soldati had a conflict of interest because he was Mayor of Somersworth; and (2) that Soldati had not had sufficient meetings or communication with him and was not adequately prepared for trial. When, at the outset of the colloquy, the trial court understood the defendant to be seeking to discharge Soldati and replace him with new counsel, it was entirely appropriate for the court to assess the merits of the defendant\u2019s complaints against Soldati and to deny the request if it found, as it did, that there was no good reason to remove Soldati. This follows from the well-established principle that, while an indigent defendant has the right to constitutionally effective representation by court-appointed counsel, he has no right to insist on the appointment of any particular attorney. <em>See State v. Ayer, </em>154 N.H. 500, 517 (2006). However, once the defendant \u201ccorrected\u201d the record to indicate that he wanted to remove Soldati so he could represent himself, the situation changed significantly. <em>See State v. Flanagan, </em>978 A.2d 64, 80 (Conn. 2009) (\u201c[D]efendant\u2019s right to self-representation raises distinctly different, and more compelling, concerns than does his right to replace competent counsel....\u201d). This results from the fact that, under <em>Faretta v. California, </em>a defendant need not have a good reason for desiring to represent himself. <em>See Faretta, </em>422 U.S. 806, 884 (1975) (\u201c[Although [the defendant] may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored out of that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>id. </em>at 836 (\u201cWe need make no assessment of how well or poorly Faretta had mastered the intricacies [of the law]... [f]or his technical legal knowledge, as such, was not relevant to an assessment of his knowing exercise of the right to defend himself.\u201d); <em>Buhl v. Cooksey, </em>233 F.3d 783, 794 (3d Cir. 2000) (\u201c[Defendant\u2019s] motivation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>for waiving counsel was not the issue. . . . Once [the defendant] properly asserted his right to proceed <em>pro se </em>the trial court was obligated to undertake an appropriate inquiry under <em>Faretta </em>even though [the defendant\u2019s] request apparently rested upon nothing other than dissatisfaction with defense counsel.\u201d); <em>Williams v. Bartlett, </em>44 F.3d 95, 99 (2d Cir. 1994) (\u201cThe right of a defendant in a criminal case to act as his own lawyer is <em>unqualified </em>if invoked prior to the start of trial.\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>Commonwealth v. Spotz, </em>18 A.3d 244, 265 n.12 (Pa. 2011) (\u201c[A] court\u2019s disagreement with a defendant\u2019s reason for proceeding <em>pro se </em>does not constitute grounds for denial of this constitutional right.\u201d). Hence, once the equation changed from \u201cSoldati versus new counsel\u201d to \u201cSoldati versus self-representation,\u201d it was the defendant\u2019s determination as to whether Soldati had a conflict of interest or was unprepared \u2014 not the trial court\u2019s \u2014 that should have been controlling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cf. McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 178, 185 (1984) (emphasizing that the \u201ccore\u201d of the <em>Faretta </em>right is a defendant\u2019s entitlement to maintain actual control over his defense). Where, as here, timing was not an issue and there was no question as to the defendant\u2019s competency for self-representation, <em>see Indiana v. Edwards, </em>554 U.S. 164, 177-78 (2008), if he was prepared to make a knowing, intelligent and voluntary decision to proceed <em>pro se </em>and thereby to waive his right to counsel, <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 835, and he was not making that decision for a prohibited reason, such as delay or disruption of the proceedings, <em>see id. </em>at 834 n.46, the defendant was entitled to discharge Soldati for any reason or no reason at all. <em>See Flanagan, </em>978 A.2d at 81 (stating that <em>Faretta </em>recognizes three reasons for denying a defendant his right to self-representation: (1) the request is untimely; (2) the defendant engages in serious obstructionist misconduct; (3) the defendant has not knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">On the other hand, if the dissent means that the defendant\u2019s complaints about Soldati were so far-fetched that the trial court could have found even the defendant himself could not genuinely have believed them to have merit, I agree that under appropriate circumstances this could be a proper factor for a trial court to evaluate in ruling on a defendant\u2019s request for self-representation because it may be indicative of manipulative intent. But here the record simply does not support such an inference. Given the scorched-earth quality of much of modern-day political discourse, can we really say it is implausible that a lay person in the defendant\u2019s shoes might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>have a genuine, albeit unwarranted, concern that the elected official serving as his counsel would be affected by the prospect of criticism resulting from his representation of a person accused of committing sexual offenses against a child? Moreover, in addition to the alleged conflict of interest, the defendant expressed concern over Soldati\u2019s lack of preparation; and the record shows that this complaint had at least some validity, as evidenced by the fact that Soldati himself asked for and received a four-week continuance of the trial date so that he could review new evidence with the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Furthermore, even if the trial court could supportably have found (1) that the defendant\u2019s initial request to replace Soldati with new counsel was a manipulative effort to delay the trial and (2) that despite his suggestion that the court had misunderstood his initial request, the defendant\u2019s attempt to \u201ccorrect the record\u201d was actually a <em>change in position </em>(from wanting new counsel to wanting to represent himself), such findings would not provide a basis for the court to have regarded the defendant\u2019s request to proceed <em>pro se </em>as a further effort to delay the proceedings because, when he made this request, the defendant specifically indicated that he wanted to represent himself so as to avoid the need for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Rather than an effort to' delay the trial, what the dissent finds most objectionable is that the defendant\u2019s request to proceed <em>pro se </em>may have been motivated, at least in part, by his desire to pressure the court into revisiting its denial of the appointment of new counsel. But the reality is that such an implicit threat (\u201cIf you won\u2019t appoint new counsel for me judge, then I\u2019ll make your life more difficult by representing myself.\u201d) is present in virtually <em>all </em>requests for self-representation conditioned on the denial of a request for new counsel. Yet, courts have not generally regarded such conditional requests as equivocal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., United States v. Frazier</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number><em>El, </em>204 F.3d 553, 566-67 (4th Cir. 2000) (Murnaghan, J., dissenting) (collecting cases from various circuits); <em>State v. Blom, </em>682 N.W.2d 578, 613 (Minn. 2004) (\u201c[A] motion for self-representation is not equivocal simply because it is made as an alternative plan in case the court does not grant a defendant\u2019s motion for a different attorney.\u201d); <em>Gallego v. State, </em>23 P.3d 227, 236 (Nev. 2001) (stating that correct procedure with such conditional requests is for court to deny the appointment of substitute counsel (where warranted) and ascertain whether defendant\u2019s desire to represent himself remains extant in light of the fulfillment of the condition); <em>cf. State v. Thomas, </em>150 N.H. 327, 329 (2003) (upholding validity of defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel and election to represent himself after his request for appointment of latest successor counsel was denied); <em>State v. Davis, </em>139 N.H. 185, 190-91 (1994) (same); <em>State v. Panzera, </em>139 N.H. 235, 238-39 (1994) (rejecting claim that decision to proceed <em>pro se </em>was involuntary where trial court denied defendant\u2019s request to be represented by specific attorneys and continuance required by appointment of successor counsel would not have violated defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">For example, in <em>Adams v. Carroll, </em>875 F.2d 1441 (9th Cir. 1989), the court dealt with a factual situation that clearly presented the so-called \u201cbargaining chip\u201d scenario. The defendant first requested counsel, then asked to represent himself when he became dissatisfied with his public defender, then requested counsel again, and finally asked to represent himself again when the same public defender was reappointed as his counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 1445. Following his conviction in state court, the defendant sought habeas corpus relief in federal district court. The district court denied relief, finding that \u201cbecause [the defendant] asked to represent himself solely as a means of dispensing with [the public defender], his request for self-representation was in fact a thinly veiled motion to substitute counsel\u201d rather than \u201ca genuine request for self-representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1443. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that while the defendant\u2019s requests for self representation \u201cno doubt were <em>conditional </em>[upon the denial of his request for new counsel], they were not equivocal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1445; <em>accord Williams, </em>44 F.3d at 100 (\u201cA defendant is not deemed to have equivocated in his desire for self-representation merely because he expresses that view in the alternative, simultaneously requests the appointment of new counsel, or uses it as a threat to obtain private counsel.\u201d). As Judge Murnaghan pointedly observed in his <em>Frazier-El </em>dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">There is no reason that a conditional <em>pro se </em>request should send the district court into analytical disorientation. Rather than flatly denying a request for self-representation because the form of the request is a conditional one, the court should simply frame the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>conditional request in clear terms and make the defendant acknowledge on the record that the court has properly understood the request... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">Forcing defendants to articulate their position in such precise terms is one step toward combating the \u201creversible error\u201d scenario. The second step is even simpler. As long as the district court elicits the precise contours of a defendant\u2019s request, appellate courts will not countenance arguments by defendants on appeal that the district court improperly allowed them to proceed <em>pro se. </em>The district court need not worry about clever defendants manipulating them into \u201creversible error\u201d as long as the district court does a sufficient job of engaging the defendant on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-7\"><em>Frazier-El, </em>204 F.3d at 572-73 (Murnaghan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">As the above discussion makes clear, even if it is assumed that the trial judge in this case had some unarticulated concern that the defendant might be trying to manipulate the proceedings by, for instance, asking to proceed <em>pro se </em>merely for the purpose of securing Soldati\u2019s removal and with the intention of making a new request for counsel after Soldati had withdrawn, the court had ample tools available to prevent such abuse. As part of a <em>Faretta </em>colloquy with the defendant, the court could have made it clear that based on its finding of a lack of cause for removing Attorney Soldati, the defendant\u2019s choices were to proceed to trial with Soldati or to represent himself, that the trial would not be further continued, and that if the defendant made the decision to proceed <em>pro se </em>he would be bound by that decision and would not be able to change his mind because there would be inadequate time remaining to re-engage counsel before the start of trial. <em>See United States v. Kneeland, </em>148 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1998) (court acted properly in denying request for counsel where defendant was warned that if present counsel was dismissed he would not be provided with fourth court-appointed attorney); <em>Maynard v. Meachum, </em>545 F.2d 273, 278 (1st Cir. 1976) (district judge may give defendant \u201cchoice between proceeding with counsel already appointed or going <em>pro se\u201d). </em>In addition, the court could have appointed Soldati to act as defendant\u2019s stand-by counsel. <em>See Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 834 n.46. In my view, however, on this record, what the court could not do is simply deny the request for self-representation based on a presumption that the request was designed to delay or disrupt the proceedings. <em>See United States v. Welty, </em>674 F.2d 185, 189 (3d Cir. 1982) (\u201c[E]ven well-founded suspicions of intentional delay and manipulative tactics can provide no substitute for the inquiries necessary to protect a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>The second point relied on by the dissent to support its thesis that the defendant\u2019s request was equivocal is the fact that, after the trial court denied his request to proceed <em>pro se, </em>the defendant did not again raise the issue of self-representation before the trial court. In particular, the dissent points to the language used by the trial court in denying the request \u2014 \u201cWell, at least at this stage \u2014 that\u2019s fine. I mean, I\u2019m not removing Mr. Soldati. If there\u2019s some further motion dealing with anything, I will address it.\u201d \u2014 as signaling the court\u2019s willingness to revisit the issue, and the dissent then infers equivocation (or waiver) from the fact that the defendant did not take the court up on its supposed offer by renewing the request for self-representation at some other point before or during the trial. While I concede that this may be the dissent\u2019s strongest argument, I do not find it sufficient to carry the day. Although the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request to proceed <em>pro se </em>was not as definitive here as in some other cases where courts have found the absence of repeated requests not indicative of waiver or equivocation, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Hernandez, </em>203 F.3d 614, 622 (9th Cir. 2000) (judge\u2019s impatient resistance toward and extremely abrupt colloquy before denying self-representation request made it reasonable for defendant to believe that any further request would be pointless); <em>Williams, </em>44 F.3d at 101 (\u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s acquiescence [after the trial court\u2019s categorical denial of his request to proceed <em>pro </em>se] cannot be read to signify waiver of a constitutionally protected right\u201d); <em>People v. Dent, </em>65 P.3d 1286, 1289-90 (Cal. 2003) (same); <em>but cf. Flanagan, </em>978 A.2d at 78 n.14 (that trial court, after denying request for self-representation, thereafter <em>sua sponte </em>raised the issue again at later hearing by asking, \u201cAre you making the request to represent yourself in the remainder of this case?\u201d, was not sufficient to infer waiver from failure of defendant then or later to repeat request), it is important not to lose sight of first principles. Under <em>Faretta </em>and its progeny, a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to represent himself, which courts are required to respect by conducting an appropriate colloquy once a reasonably clear request to exercise the right has been made. It is not the responsibility of the legally untrained defendant to divine meaning at his peril from a non-responsive or otherwise ambiguous trial court reaction to his <em>pro se </em>request. Unfortunately, although undoubtedly inadvertent, that was the nature of the trial court\u2019s response in this case. Thus, even if one assumes that the court\u2019s statement that it would entertain \u201csome further motion dealing with anything\u201d displayed a willingness to revisit the self-representation issue, the court\u2019s ruling that it would not remove Attorney Soldati \u201cat this stage\u201d could well have been understood by the defendant to mean that he had to provide some further grounds for removing Soldati before the court would reconsider its ruling; and if the defendant believed he had no basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>removal beyond what he had already told the court, there would have been no reason for his raising the issue again.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Even if the defendant\u2019s request to represent himself could be regarded as equivocal \u2014 a proposition I reject \u2014 it was surely at least sufficient to require an inquiry by the trial court under our decision in <em>State v. Sweeney, </em>151 N.H. 666 (2005). Recognizing as much, the dissent offers a third rationale for its decision: it attempts to avoid the result that <em>Sweeney </em>mandates \u2014 reversal of the convictions \u2014 by recasting our holding in that case as mere dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">In <em>Sweeney, </em>during a hearing immediately before the trial was to begin, the defendant complained about his attorney\u2019s failure to make a particular argument, and then asked the judge: \u201c[D]o I have the right to fire my lawyer?\u201d Without making any inquiry, the trial court answered: \u201cAt this time, no.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669. We determined that the defendant\u2019s request could be interpreted as either a request to proceed <em>pro se </em>or as a request for substitute counsel, and held that it was incumbent upon the trial court to \u201celiminate the ambiguity the question presented. Once the defendant makes a sufficiently clear request to indicate an intention to switch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>representational gears, further judicial inquiry is necessary to clarify the nature of those changed intentions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 671 (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">One of the cases we relied on in support of our ruling in <em>Sweeney </em>was the First Circuit Court of Appeals decision in <em>United States v. Proctor, </em>166 F.3d 396 (1st Cir. 1999). Because the issue before the court in <em>Proctor </em>was the revocation of a request to proceed <em>pro se </em>and a reassertion of the right to counsel, the dissent is correct that the court\u2019s discussion wherein it wrote the following is technically dicta:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-6\">[E]ven though most circuits require \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d <em>Faretta </em>waivers, it is generally incumbent upon the courts to elicit that elevated degree of clarity through a detailed inquiry. That is, the triggering statement in a defendant\u2019s attempt to waive his right to counsel need not be punctilious; rather, the dialogue between the court and the defendant must <em>result in </em>a clear and unequivocal statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-7\"><em>Proctor, </em>166 F.3d at 402-03 (citation omitted). However, even though dicta, <em>Proctor\u2019s </em>discussion of the trial court\u2019s duty of inquiry regarding self-representation requests addressed an important issue that has generally been overlooked in the case law. While <em>Faretta </em>and its progeny plainly require that a defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to self-representation must be clear and unequivocal, most cases have not explored the question of <em>when </em>the required level of clarity is to be assessed. Since it is universally recognized that before a request to proceed <em>pro se </em>can properly be granted, the trial court must engage in a detailed colloquy with the defendant regarding waiver of the right to counsel, the dangers of self-representation, etc., there can be no doubt that <em>at the conclusion of that colloquy </em>the defendant\u2019s desire to represent himself must be absolutely clear. What <em>Proctor </em>recognized \u2014 and what we found persuasive in <em>Sweeney </em>\u2014 is that the very requirement to engage in the colloquy contemplates that at least some level of ambiguity or uncertainty is not enough to defeat the court\u2019s obligation to conduct the colloquy in the first place. <em>See Proctor, </em>166 F.3d at 403; <em>accord Flanagan, </em>978 A.2d at 77; <em>Edwards v. Com., </em>644 S.E.2d 396, 404 (Va. Ct. App. 2007) (Humphreys, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cIt is only after [a Faretta] dialogue that a trial court can determine whether the waiver is knowing and voluntary, the request for self-representation is unequivocal, and the defendant knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u201d (quotation omitted)). Indeed, if complete clarity were demanded from the outset, there would be little purpose in conducting the inquiry. <em>See Sweeney, </em>151 N.H. at 671 (\u201cOnce the defendant makes a <em>sufficiently </em>clear request to indicate an intention to shift <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>representational gears, further judicial inquiry is necessary to clarify the nature of those changed intentions.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, <em>Sweeney </em>cannot be \u201cproperly read,\u201d <em>post </em>at 822, to limit the duty of inquiry to situations in which a defendant expresses dissatisfaction with appointed counsel. While we undoubtedly relied on the above dicta from <em>Proctor </em>in support of our decision, it does not follow that the duty of inquiry we imposed in <em>Sweeney </em>can itself be regarded as dicta insofar as requests for self-representation are concerned. Quite the contrary, <em>Sweeney </em>clearly held that the duty of inquiry applied <em>regardless </em>of whether the defendant\u2019s \u201c[D]o I have the right to fire my lawyer?\u201d remark was an expression of dissatisfaction with counsel or a request to proceed <em>pro se. See Sweeney, </em>151 N.H. at 670 (\u201cWhile we agree with the State that the defendant\u2019s question did not, by itself, constitute a demand to proceed <em>pro se, </em>we <em>hold </em>that it was sufficient to trigger the court\u2019s duty to inquire further.\u201d (citations omitted; emphasis added)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Finally, I believe there can be no serious dispute that the defendant\u2019s request for self-representation in this case was <em>far clearer </em>than the request at issue in <em>Sweeney. </em>Unlike in <em>Sweeney, </em>where the defendant merely asked if he could fire his lawyer and said nothing about self-representation as an alternative, here the defendant specifically expressed his desire \u201c[t]o proceed <em>pro </em>se.\u201d Thus, while I beheve that <em>Sweeney </em>was correctly decided and did not press the duty of inquiry further than is prudent, even if the dissent does not share that view, this is hardly the case to use as the vehicle for correcting any such perceived error.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Before concluding, I also feel the need to address an institutional concern regarding the importance of our ruling in <em>Sweeney </em>in light of some of the case law from other jurisdictions. I fully support the proposition that, because of the antithetical nature of the right to counsel, on the one hand, and the right of self-representation, on the other, and because the harm to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>both the individual defendant and the justice system that results from the absence of counsel is usually more severe than that flowing from the denial of self-representation, the former should be treated as the \u201cparamount right\u201d when, <em>after efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances, </em>such ambiguity or uncertainty remains that a court cannot ascertain which right a defendant desires to invoke. <em>See Tuitt v. Fair, </em>822 F.2d 166, 177 (1st Cir. 1987); <em>Adams, </em>875 F.2d at 1444. At the same time, however, courts must be vigilant to avoid adopting procedures for invoking the right of self-representation that have the effect of relegating it to a \u201cdisfavored\u201d status in the constitutional hierarchy. <em>See Frazier-El, </em>204 F.3d at 573 (Murhaghan, J., dissenting); <em>see also Cain v. Peters, </em>972 F.2d 748, 750 (7th Cir. 1992) (rejecting idea that right to counsel is the \u201cpreferred right, so that defendants have to be especially articulate or forceful to win the right to represent themselves. The two rights are equivalent [and] the defendant is entitled to choose without a thumb on the scale; but because counsel is the normal and prudent choice, it is the default outcome.\u201d (citations omitted)). Judges well know that, in all but truly exceptional cases, a defendant\u2019s choice of self-representation will prove detrimental to his defense and will almost assuredly prolong and complicate the trial. But paternalistic instincts and/or considerations of judicial convenience must not lead us to countenance a sort of \u201cdon\u2019t ask \u2014 won\u2019t tell\u201d policy regarding self-representation, under which courts are tempted to ignore all but the clearest expressions of a desire to proceed <em>pro se </em>in the hopes that, by not asking follow-up questions, the defendant will fail to provide the court with sufficient clarification of his wishes as to require the court to grant his request of self-representation. Such an approach would seriously undermine the respect for human dignity and individual autonomy that lies at the heart of <em>Faretta.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-6\"> Although a trial court has no authority to substitute its judgment for that of the defendant regarding the merits of the reasons upon which the decision to proceed pro <em>se </em>is based, this is not to say that the court is prohibited from inquiring into those reasons insofar as they may have a bearing on whether the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel is made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. <em>See Buhl, </em>233 F.3d at 798.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-7\"> Although the record indicates that the defendant had been represented by several other attorneys before Soldati was appointed, it contains no evidence whatsoever about the circumstances under which prior counsel were appointed or discharged. In particular, there is no evidence that prior to the appointment of earlier counsel the defendant had made similar requests to proceed <em>pro se, </em>or that, having made such a request, he then changed his mind and asked for counsel again. <em>See Williams, </em>44 F.3d at 101 (\u201cOf course, when a defendant changes his mind [about self-representation] after trial begins, or does so repeatedly at any stage, a court may find that the conduct is manipulative or abusive in some other way. If so, the conduct can be considered vacillation, and a trial judge may find the request equivocal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\"> believe the dissent is wrong in suggesting that the trial court could reasonably have thought it adequately addressed the defendant\u2019s conditional request for self-representation by granting the four-week trial continuance. <em>See post </em>at 818. Unlike in <em>Jordan v. Ficco, </em>134 Fed. Appx. 452 (1st Cir. 2005), on which the dissent relies, here there is no basis for concluding that a continuance was the defendant\u2019s \u201cpreferred form of relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454. To the contrary, the defendant\u2019s preferred form of relief in this case was the replacement of Attorney Soldati with new counsel \u2014 relief which the trial court denied. That the granting of the four-week continuance did not satisfy the defendant is made clear by the fact that he raised his complaints against Soldati <em>after </em>the court had already granted the continuance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\"> The cases relied upon by the dissent as support for its assertion that the defendant\u2019s failure to press his request for self-representation after the January 25 hearing demonstrates the request\u2019s equivocal nature are distinguishable. In <em>Commonwealth v. Davido, </em>868 A.2d 431 (Pa. 2005), before trial the defendant requested the appointment of new counsel or, alternatively, to proceed <em>pro se. </em>At the next judicial event following these requests, the court had a brief colloquy with the defendant in which it denied both requests. Thereafter, on the day before trial, the court initiated a further colloquy with the defendant in which it inquired if the defendant still desired to represent himself, and <em>the defendant responded that he wished to proceed with counsel. Id. </em>at 439. Thus, although the court referred to the defendant\u2019s prior requests for counsel as a \u201cbargaining device,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 440, the court did not reject his <em>Faretta </em>claim on this basis alone. Rather, the court found that, under the totality of the circumstances \u2014 including the defendant\u2019s colloquy with the court on the day before trial \u2014 his request to proceed <em>pro se </em>was equivocal. <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 449 (Saylor, J., concurring) (rejecting view that conditional nature of defendant\u2019s request to proceed <em>pro se, </em>posed as an alternative to request for substitute counsel, rendered request equivocal, and opining that only appropriate ground for upholding denial of self-representation was defendant\u2019s affirmative abandonment of request).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">In <em>People v. Tena, </em>67 Cal. Rptr. 3d 412 (Ct. App. 2007), the trial court denied as untimely the defendant\u2019s request to appear <em>pro se </em>at his preliminary hearing, but specifically advised him that he could renew the request before trial. <em>Id. </em>at 418. Instead of taking the court up on this offer, the defendant retained private counsel who represented him at trial. The court held that the defendant\u2019s failure to renew his request after the preliminary hearing not only demonstrated that the request was equivocal, <em>id. </em>at 421, but also showed, alternatively, that the request had been abandoned, <em>id. </em>at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Finally, unlike in <em>United States v. Manthey, </em>92 Fed. Appx. 291, 295 (6th Cir. 2004), and <em>Morris v. Kikendall, </em>2009 WL 1097922, at *12-13 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 23, 2009), there is nothing in the record of this case that would support a finding that the defendant\u2019s request for self-representation constituted an \u201coff-the-cuff\u201d remark triggered by his frustration with the court\u2019s rulings. Indeed, from all that appears, the defendant at all times conducted himself calmly and respectfully throughout the January 25, 2010 hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\"> It is important to note that the remedy we implemented in <em>Sweeney </em>was reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial. This remedy was required only because of the prospect that what the defendant was asking for was to proceed <em>pro se, </em>and denial of that right is not subject to harmless error analysis. If we had regarded the duty of inquiry as applicable' only to ambiguous expressions of dissatisfaction with counsel, the appropriate remedy would have been to remand the case to the trial court to determine which right \u2014 replacement of inadequate counsel or self-representation \u2014 the defendant was attempting to assert, and, if it was the former, whether there had in fact been grounds for discharging the defendant\u2019s counsel. Had the trial court found (1) that the defendant was seeking substitute counsel rather than self-representation and (2) that there were no grounds for removing counsel who represented the defendant at trial, we then could have affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction. While such an inquiry no doubt would have inherent difficulties \u2014 with the benefit of hindsight the defendant would have an obvious incentive to assert that what he had been seeking was to proceed <em>pro se </em>\u2014 as an alternative to automatic reversal, it would have been worth the effort.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b846-5\">DALIANIS, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIb\">dissenting.

Woodard, </em>291 F.3d 95, 106, 109 (1st Cir. 2002) (right to counsel is paramount). \u201cIn ambiguous situations created by a defendant\u2019s vacillation or manipulation, we must ascribe a \u2018constitutional primacy\u2019 to the right to counsel because this right serves both the individual and collective good, as opposed to only the individual interests served by protecting the right of self-representation.\u201d <em>Frazier-El, </em>204 F.3d at 559. \u201cAt bottom, the [constitutional] right to self-representation is not absolute ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>While it \u201cexists to affirm the dignity and autonomy of the accused and to allow the presentation of what may, at least occasionally, be the accused\u2019s best possible defense[,] [t]he right does not exist... to be used as a tactic for delay, for disruption, for distortion of the system, or for manipulation of the trial process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560 (quotation and citations omitted); <em>see Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 834 n.46 (1975). \u201cA trial court must be permitted to distinguish between a manipulative effort to present particular arguments and a sincere desire to dispense with the benefits of counsel.\u201d <em>Frazier-El, </em>204 F.3d at 559; <em>see Martinez v. Court of Appeal of Cal. Fourth Appellate Dist., </em>528 U.S. 152, 162 (2000) (\u201c[T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>government\u2019s interest in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the trial at times outweighs the defendant\u2019s interest in acting as his own lawyer.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Consistent with these principles, numerous courts have ruled that a court may properly deny a defendant\u2019s request for self-representation if the request is intended to manipulate the court or delay the proceedings. <em>See United States v. Bush, </em>404 F.3d 263, 271-72 (4th Cir. 2005) (request made to manipulate court or delay proceedings is deemed not to be clear and unequivocal); <em>United States v. Mackovich, </em>209 F.3d 1227, 1237 (10th Cir. 2000) (affirming denial of request for self-representation made two weeks before scheduled trial date when evidence in record supported district court\u2019s conclusion that request was \u201cmerely a tactic for delay\u201d). <em>But cf. United States v. Welty, </em>674 F.2d 185, 189 (3d Cir. 1982) (\u201c[E]ven well-founded suspicions of intentional delay and manipulative tactics can provide no substitute for the inquiries necessary to protect a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d). Put another way, courts have ruled that it is proper to deny a request for self-representation that is insincere. <em>People v. Marshall, </em>931 P.2d 262, 271 (Cal. 1997) <em>(Faretta\u2019s </em>emphasis \u201con the defendant\u2019s knowing, voluntary, unequivocal, and competent invocation of the right suggests that an insincere request. . . may be denied.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">I find <em>United States v. Manthey, </em>92 Fed. App\u2019x 291, 295 (6th Cir. 2004), instructive. In that case, the defendant requested permission to proceed <em>pro se </em>at the end of the pretrial at which he had asked the court to release him immediately because of his previous counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. <em>Manthey, </em>92 Fed. App\u2019x at 295. When the court instead appointed new counsel, the defendant said that he wanted to defend himself so that his trial would not be delayed. <em>Id. </em>The defendant never repeated that request at later pretrials or during trial. <em>Id. </em>The appellate court ruled that the defendant\u2019s \u201csingle, off-the-cuff remark\u201d was not \u201cthe clear and unequivocal request to proceed pro se required by <em>Faretta.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Similarly, in <em>Davido, </em>868 A.2d at 439, the defendant requested that new counsel be appointed and stated that if new counsel was not appointed, the defendant would have \u201cno other alternative but to [exercise] [his] 6th amendment [right] to represent [him]self and have [the attorney] as [his] assistant.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request for a new attorney and to represent himself. <em>Id. </em>Based upon its review of \u201cthe totality of the circumstances surrounding the request,\u201d the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the defendant did not invoke his right to self-representation. <em>Id. </em>The court observed that the defendant\u2019s letter was focused upon his request for new counsel and his \u201crequest to proceed pro se was posed as his only alternative if he was not afforded new counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440. Thus, the court ruled, \u201cit was employed as a bargaining device, rather than as a clear demand for self representation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>With these tenets in mind, I now turn to whether the trial court erred when it impliedly found that the defendant\u2019s request to proceed <em>pro se </em>was neither unequivocal nor clear. <em>See State v. Silva, </em>158 N.H. 96, 102 (2008) (court assumes that trial court made all findings necessary to support its decision); <em>Marshall, </em>931 P.2d at 273-74 (\u2018We have found no case that declares that unless the trial court made a factual finding on the record explaining its reason for denying a motion for self-representation, the reviewing court must conclude that no proper basis existed for denying the motion or that the defendant\u2019s right of self-representation was infringed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The majority asserts that the defendant\u2019s request to represent himself was \u201caffirmative and unequivocal, even though it was conditional.\u201d The majority contends that \u201cthe defendant was essentially saying that if the court would not dismiss his lawyer or grant a continuance, then he wanted to represent himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Even if I were to agree, <em>arguendo, </em>\u201cthat an assertion of <em>Faretta </em>rights may be efficacious even if it is only made on the condition that another requested and preferred form of relief be deprived,... this does not mean that a conditional assertion of <em>Faretta </em>rights is <em>always </em>efficacious.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Ficco, </em>134 Fed. App\u2019x 452, 454 (1st Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). Under the majority\u2019s own analysis, the defendant conditioned his request for self-representation upon the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to dismiss his lawyer (and appoint a new one) or to grant a continuance. However, the trial court <em>granted </em>the defendant a four-week continuance until January 25th. Thus, he received the alternative relief he requested. Although the trial court interpreted the defendant\u2019s request as a motion for a continuance beyond January 25th, the defendant did not say this. Rather, he asked only \u201cfor a continuance just so long enough to gather [his] exculpatory evidence\u201d and review his case with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">When, as in this case, \u201cthe alleged assertion of <em>Faretta </em>rights is clearly conditioned on the denial of a preferred form of requested relief involving counseled representation,\u201d and when, as in this case, the trial court has granted the defendant the preferred form of relief (here, a continuance), \u201cwithout subsequent objection or renewal of the request for self representation, it would undermine the Sixth Amendment to treat the conditional assertion of <em>Faretta </em>rights as efficacious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>I am \u201cunwilling to endorse such a result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, based upon \u201call of [the] defendant\u2019s words and conduct,\u201d I believe that the trial court could reasonably have decided that the defendant did not \u201ctruly wish[] to give up the right to counsel and represent himself and that his invocation of his right to self-representation was neither unequivocal nor sincere. <em>See Marshall, </em>931 P.2d at 274, 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>The trial court reasonably could have viewed the defendant\u2019s request that Attorney Soldati be removed for cause as specious. The record demonstrates that Attorney Soldati was not the defendant\u2019s first counsel, and that before he was appointed to represent the defendant, numerous prior counsel had withdrawn. As Attorney Soldati informed the court, when asking for a continuance: \u201cI understand that there\u2019s been a series of counsel that have had this case.\u201d According to the trial court, the defendant\u2019s case had been continued \u201ca number of times, sometimes at [the defendant\u2019s] request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Additionally, the alleged \u201cconflict of interest\u201d to which the defendant pointed was hardly that. To prevail upon a motion for substitute appointed counsel, a defendant must establish that the conflict between him and his counsel \u201cwas so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Genao, </em>281 F.3d 305, 312 (1st Cir. 2002) (quotation omitted). The conflict asserted by the defendant does not come close to meeting this standard. In the defendant\u2019s view, because Attorney Soldati was soon to be mayor, he had a motive to \u201csink\u201d the defendant\u2019s case \u201cso he [could] get [a] conviction\u201d and demonstrate his commitment to keeping the community safe. The defendant\u2019s concern borders on the frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The trial court could reasonably have viewed the defendant\u2019s reference to representing himself as specious as well. The defendant told the court, in effect, that the court had misconstrued his prior complaints about Attorney Soldati. The record supports a finding that this claim was disingenuous. When Attorney Soldati first raised the issue, he said nothing about the defendant wanting to represent himself. When the court allowed the defendant to air all of his complaints about his attorney, the defendant also said nothing about wanting to represent himself. Indeed, he made it clear that he wanted to be represented by counsel; specifically, he wanted a continuance so that he could \u201creview [his] case more thoroughly or even... begin to review [his] case with counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Further, the trial court could also have reasonably viewed the defendant\u2019s asserted justification for representing himself as disingenuous. The defendant said that he wanted to represent himself because he did not want to be delayed by the appointment of new counsel, yet when he complained about Attorney Soldati, he specifically said that he wanted a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">In light of the defendant\u2019s borderline frivolous motion to have Attorney Soldati removed because of a \u201cconflict,\u201d and his disingenuous suggestion that when he complained about his attorney, he intended to assert his right to self-representation, I believe that the trial court reasonably could have viewed the defendant\u2019s reference to representing himself as a gambit, as a \u201cpolite form of blackmail\u201d to pressure the court to appoint a new attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>for him. <em>People v. Lopez, </em>172 Cal. Rptr. 374, 377 (Ct. App. 1981). \u201cAny dispassionate reading of this record reflects that this defendant was playing games with the court on this issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The defendant\u2019s failure to mention representing himself again until this appeal further supports the view that his initial request was insincere. <em>See Manthey, </em>92 Fed. App\u2019x at 295; <em>see also People v. Valdez, </em>82 P.3d 296, 317 (Cal. 2004) (\u201c[T]he fact that defendant made only a single reference to the right to self-representation . .. supports the conclusion that defendant did not make an unequivocal <em>Faretta </em>motion.\u201d); <em>Morris v. Kikendall, </em>No. 07-CV-2422 (JFB), 2009 WL 1097922, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. April 23, 2009). <em>But see People v. Dent, </em>65 P.3d 1286, 1289-90 (Cal. 2003) (when court told defendant he could not speak except through counsel, defendant\u2019s failure to renew his request to proceed <em>pro se </em>was not evidence of equivocation; defendant could well have been convinced that any further request for self-representation would be futile).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">In this case, unlike <em>Dent, </em>the trial court indicated that it <em>would </em>entertain a future motion. When it denied the request, the court said: \u2018Well, at least at this stage \u2014 that\u2019s fine. I mean, I\u2019m not removing Mr. Soldati. If there\u2019s some further motion dealing with anything, I will address it.\u201d I interpret this statement to mean that the court would entertain a future motion by the defendant to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Regardless, after hearing this statement, the defendant could not reasonably have believed that the trial court had conclusively foreclosed the option of self-representation. <em>See People v. Tena, </em>67 Cal. Rptr. 3d 412, 422 (Ct. App. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Given the totality of the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s request, I would conclude, like the <em>Manthey </em>court, that the defendant\u2019s \u201csingle, off-the-cuff\u2019 reference to representing himself did not constitute an unequivocal request for self-representation as required by <em>Faretta. </em>The defendant\u2019s statements \u201cdo not constitute an unequivocal invocation of the right of self-representation simply... because the trial court failed to make an express finding on the record that the request was equivocal\u201d or otherwise explain its reasoning for denying the request. <em>Marshall, </em>931 P.2d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Even if I were to agree with the defendant\u2019s interpretation of his request, because I view the alternative interpretation described above as reasonable, I would be constrained to find his request ambiguous. <em>See Burton v. Collins, </em>937 F.2d 131, 134 (5th Cir. 1991). \u201cThe fact that there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the dialog between [the defendant] and the trial judge is, in a sense, the best evidence that [the defendant] did not clearly and unequivocally assert his right to self-representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOur task ... is not to evaluate whether these competing interpretations [of the defendant\u2019s words] are evenly balanced or assess which is more reasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>Our obligation, like the [trial] court\u2019s, is to indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver of the right to counsel. Therefore, in the face of ambiguity, I must credit the position most protective of that most important right.\u201d <em>United States v. Proctor, </em>166 F.3d 396, 405 (1st Cir. 1999) (quotation and citation omitted). \u201cIn [the] absence of a clear indication by [the defendant] of his desire to waive his fundamental constitutional right to counsel, we are unwilling to infer from an ambiguous record that such a waiver existed.\u201d <em>Burton, </em>937 F.2d at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Alternatively, the defendant contends that even if his request to proceed <em>pro se </em>was ambiguous, it was incumbent upon the trial court to resolve the ambiguity his words created. He relies upon our decision in <em>Sweeney </em>to support this argument; I find his reliance misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">In <em>Sweeney, </em>while complaining that his attorney refused to make a particular argument on his behalf, the defendant asked the trial court if he \u201cha[d] the right to fire [his lawyer].\u201d <em>Sweeney, </em>151 N.H. at 668, 669 (quotation and emphasis omitted). Rather than inquire further, the trial court answered, \u201cAt this point in time, no.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669 (quotation and emphasis omitted). We ruled that the defendant\u2019s request could be interpreted either as a request to proceed <em>pro se </em>or as a request for substitute counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 671. We held that it was incumbent upon the trial court to resolve the ambiguity that the defendant\u2019s question presented. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">In <em>Sweeney, </em>we relied upon dicta from <em>Proctor, </em>166 F.3d at 403. <em>See Sweeney, </em>151 N.H. at 670. <em>Proctor, </em>however, was distinguishable from <em>Sweeney, </em>and is distinguishable from the instant matter, because it did not involve a waiver of the right to counsel; it involved the <em>revocation </em>of such a waiver. <em>See Proctor, </em>166 F.3d at 397, 402-03. In my opinion, our reliance in <em>Sweeney </em>upon the dicta from <em>Proctor </em>was, thus, misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\"><em>Sweeney </em>can be interpreted as conflating a court\u2019s duty when faced with a defendant\u2019s expressed dissatisfaction with appointed counsel with its duty when faced with a defendant\u2019s ambiguous request to proceed <em>pro se. </em>In the former situation, the court has an affirmative duty to inquire further. <em>See United States v. Prochilo, </em>187 F.3d 221, 225 (1st Cir. 1999) (\u2018Where the accused voices objections to appointed counsel, the trial court should inquire into the reasons for the dissatisfaction.\u201d (quotation and ellipsis omitted)). In the latter, the court\u2019s duty to inquire is not triggered because the defendant\u2019s request for self-representation was not clear and unambiguous. <em>See Raulerson v. Wainwright, </em>469 U.S. 966, 970-71 (1984) (Marshall, J., dissenting from denial of petition for writ of certiorari) (\u201cIf a request [for self-representation] is ambiguous, the trial judge need not respond, because there has been no clear indication of a desire to waive a right to counsel. If the request is clear <em>..., a Faretta </em>hearing must follow, to assure that the defendant is not required to proceed with the unwanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>assistance of counsel.\u201d); <em>Cromer, </em>389 F.3d at 682 <em>(\u201cFaretta </em>procedures are only required when a defendant has clearly and unequivocally asserted his right to proceed <em>pro </em>se.\u201d); <em>Winstead v. Com., </em>283 S.W.3d 678, 683 (Ky. 2009) (same); <em>Gill v. Mecusker, </em>633 F.3d 1272, 1293 (11th Cir. 2011) (\u201c[A] trial court\u2019s obligation to conduct a <em>Faretta </em>hearing, at which a defendant is made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, is triggered by the defendant\u2019s clear and unequivocal assertion of a desire to represent himself.\u201d (quotations and brackets omitted)); <em>see also Tuitt, </em>822 F.2d at 176-77; <em>State v. Barham, </em>126 N.H. 631, 637 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">A requirement that a trial court inquire further when faced with a request for self-representation that is neither clear nor unambiguous \u201ccreates an undesirable counterweight which may lead to a defendant\u2019s making a choice which is ordinarily not in his interest.\u201d <em>Com. v. Myers, </em>748 N.E.2d 471, 476 (Mass. App. Ct. 2001). Because the right to represent oneself necessarily involves a waiver of the right to counsel, and because the right to counsel is paramount, the judge\u2019s role in this strategic decision would be problematic; to the extent the judge appeared to urge the defendant to exercise his right to self-representation, the judge would appear to urge him to waive the right to counsel. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Properly read, therefore, I view our holding in <em>Sweeney </em>regarding the court\u2019s duty to inquire further as limited to the duty to inquire when a defendant expresses dissatisfaction with appointed counsel. To the extent that <em>Sweeney </em>can be interpreted to require a trial court to inquire further of a defendant when the defendant has not clearly and unambiguously asserted the right to proceed <em>pro se, </em>I view this language as dicta and not controlling in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Here, the defendant does not argue, nor could he, that the trial court failed to inquire sufficiently as to his reasons for his dissatisfaction with Attorney Soldati. Faced with an ambiguous request to proceed <em>pro se, </em>and having explored sufficiently the defendant\u2019s reasons for being dissatisfied with his attorney, I would conclude that the trial court had no constitutional obligation to inquire further.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">For all the above reasons, therefore, I would hold that the trial court did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to represent himself because the defendant\u2019s request for self-representation was neither clear nor unequivocal. Because the New Hampshire Constitution is at least as protective as the Federal Constitution under these circumstances, <em>see State v. Thomas, </em>150 N.H. 327, 330 (2003); <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 807, I would necessarily reach the same conclusion under both constitutions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b854-9\">HICKS, J., joins in the dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
