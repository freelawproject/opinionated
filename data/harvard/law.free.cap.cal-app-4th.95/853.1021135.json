Accordingly, the lawyer\u2019s special motion to strike the broker\u2019s complaint against him as a meritless lawsuit brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of his constitutional rights should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">Geoffrey Scott Paul, a securities broker, brought this lawsuit against 11 former brokerage clients and their lawyer, Michael E. Friedman. The lawsuit arose from acts that occurred prior to and during an arbitration in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Paul\u2019s former clients sought $31 million in compensatory damages from Paul and his employer, CIBC Oppenheimer. In the arbitration, the claimants alleged Paul violated securities laws, committed fraud, breached his fiduciary duties, was negligent and made unsuitable investment recommendations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The arbitration resulted in complete vindication for Paul and Oppenheimer, and in sanctions against Friedman and the claimants for $700,000 \u201cfor the filing of a frivolous claim for which there was no factual foundation, and that the claims were intended to harass\u201d Paul and CIBC Oppenheimer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Paul then filed this lawsuit against Friedman and his clients, asserting causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, libel and slander,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> invasion of privacy, tortious interference with economic relationships, malicious prosecution, and breach of a confidentiality agreement. Paul also sought an injunction against further breaches of the confidentiality agreement. As relevant to this appeal, the complaint alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">\u2014Before and during the arbitration, Friedman, the claimants and/or their agents conducted an \u201cinvestigation\u201d of Paul that far exceeded the scope of permissible discovery or investigation in the arbitration and was unreasonably intrusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">\u2014In conducting the investigation, Friedman made public disclosures of embarrassing private facts about Paul to clients and prospective clients, including his financial affairs, spending habits, taxes and tax liabilities, relations with his clients, and close personal relationship with another individual (as well as the allegations made in the arbitration).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>\u2014Friedman or Ms agents intruded into private places and private affairs, including entry into property owned by Paul, covert surveillance of Paul, seeking private financial, credit, tax and occupational information, and questioning individuals with no possible knowledge of the claims made in the arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\">\u2014Friedman procured a client list and other internal documents of CISC Oppenheimer containing trade secrets by improper means, used those documents to identify Paul\u2019s clients, and made false accusations and/or embarrassing disclosures about Paul to those clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">\u2014After commencement of the arbitration and at the outset of an unsuccessful mediation of the dispute, Paul and Friedman entered into a written confidentiality agreement. In breach of that agreement, Friedman (a) sent a written communication to a legal periodical disclosing information and statements communicated <em>to the </em>mediator, and (b) filed written declarations in a civil proceeding describing statements and evaluations made by the mediator in the course of the mediation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Friedman filed a special motion to strike Paul\u2019s first amended complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, the anti-SLAPP statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Friedman\u2019s motion claimed Paul\u2019s complaint was based on Ms efforts as claimants\u2019 counsel to diligently pursue their right to petition an adjudicatory body for redress of wrongs. Friedman\u2019s affidavit in support of his motion explained that in the arbitration, Ms argument in support of the claims was that Paul\u2019s judgment was impaired during the time he served as the claimants\u2019 investment advisor. Therefore, issues about Paul\u2019s financial condition and drag and alcohol use were relevant to prove whether he acted negligently or breached Ms fiduciary duties to the claimants. Friedman pointed to (a) Paul\u2019s stipulation, in connection with a discovery dispute that, despite earning millions of dollars each year, Paul was under financial pressure and borrowed thousands of dollars to buy and renovate a house and an inn and to purchase antiques; and (b) the arbitrators\u2019 admission of evidence of Paul\u2019s guilty plea to a driving under the influence charge, and Paul\u2019s and Ms companion\u2019s drug and alcohol use, to prove that Paul had impaired judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>and was distracted from his duties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Friedman declared he had no reason to believe the investigators he hired engaged in any unlawful conduct in their investigation of Paul.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Paul\u2019s affidavits in opposition to the motion to strike asserted that Friedman\u2019s investigation involved inquiry into facts and allegations unrelated to the claims made in the arbitration and unnecessary to achieve the objects of the arbitration. An affidavit from Neal Robb, Paul\u2019s counsel in the arbitration, pointed out the arbitrators sustained objections to Friedman\u2019s discovery requests for documents showing \u201ctreatment for alcohol, drug, substance abuse, psychological or psychiatric conditions,\u201d \u201citems owned by any foundation or partnership in which Paul has an ownership interest,\u201d \u201cexpense reports\u201d for business trips taken by Paul, and \u201cany complaint of [any other] customer\u201d of Paul or CIBC about MedPartners. The Robb affidavit also pointed out it was customary in private securities arbitrations for arbitrators to hear most evidence proffered, and it was clear the arbitrators had no interest in the questions or answers relating to personal relationships, drunk-driving arrests, real estate holdings, tax obligations, personal spending habits, antiques buying and alcohol or drug use, to which Paul\u2019s counsel repeatedly lodged objections. Paul also presented affidavits to support his claim Friedman used deceptive and harassing tactics during his investigation of the arbitration case against Paul,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and asked an attorney for a subpoenaed witness in the arbitration to inquire of his client as to Paul\u2019s alleged drug and alcohol abuse. Other affidavits described activities of Friedman\u2019s investigators. An affidavit from Bernard Belonsky, one of Paul\u2019s clients, asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>an investigator hired by Friedman misrepresented himself to gain access to Belonsky, and told Belonsky that Paul was financially irresponsible, misappropriated client funds, and lost tens of millions of dollars for clients. The investigator also told Belonsky that other individuals reported Paul and Belonsky\u2019s son were high on drugs at a party at Paul\u2019s condominium and Paul sent Belonsky\u2019s son out to buy drugs. The investigator told Belonsky Paul was impaired and not capable of doing his job because of drugs, had convictions for drunk driving, had been fired from Merrill Lynch and left under a cloud, had liens on his condominium and was financially out of control.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">While Friedman\u2019s special motion to strike was pending, Paul filed a motion to conduct specified discovery and to stay or continue the hearing on the motion to strike.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Paul argued that if the court believed the anti-SLAPP statute applied, he should be permitted to conduct limited discovery to develop sufficient evidence to demonstrate a probability he would prevail on his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">A hearing on the motions was conducted on June 15, 2000. Following argument, the trial court (a) denied Paul\u2019s motion to conduct specified discovery;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (b) granted Friedman\u2019s motion to strike the causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of the right to privacy, interference with economic advantage and malicious prosecution; (c) denied Friedman\u2019s motion to strike the causes of action claiming breach of the confidentiality agreement and seeking injunctive relief; and (d) denied Friedman\u2019s request for attorney fees and costs. The court concluded that the activity attributed to Friedman and his investigators \u201call seems to be related to investigating Mr. Paul with respect to these claims,\u201d and therefore within the ambit of the anti-SLAPP statute,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cand then beyond that I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s shown that Mr. Friedman or the investigator did anything such that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>you\u2019ve got a prima facie showing.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> An order reflecting those rulings was filed on July 5, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Paul appeals from the order insofar as it granted Friedman\u2019s special motion to strike and denied his discovery request, and Friedman cross-appeals from the denial of his motion to strike the remaining causes of action and his request for attorney fees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">We conclude that Friedman\u2019s special motion to strike Paul\u2019s first amended complaint should have been denied as to Paul\u2019s claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and tortious interference with economic relationships, because Friedman did not make a prima facie showing that those claims fell within the ambit of the anti-SLAPP statute. A lawsuit seeking redress for a harassing investigation of topics unrelated to those under consideration in an official proceeding is not the type of \u201cabuse of the judicial process\u201d that the Legislature sought to prevent when it enacted the anti-SLAPP statute. In reaching this conclusion, we express no opinion on the probable merits of any of Paul\u2019s claims. We merely conclude that his lawsuit should proceed like any other, and is not subject to anti-SLAPP procedures clearly intended to expose and dismiss abusive lawsuits that chill free speech, but not actions seeking redress for improper investigation of frivolous claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">We begin with a review of the anti-SLAPP statute and the reasons for its existence, and then proceed to an analysis of the inapplicability of the statute in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">\n<em>The statute and its background.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">The legal principles governing anti-SLAPP motions, and the reasons for the enactment of the anti-SLAPP statute, have been described in a number of cases,  A SLAPP suit is a meritless lawsuit \u201cfiled primarily to chill the defendant\u2019s exercise of First Amendment rights.\u201d <em>(Wilcox </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 809, 815, fn. 2 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 446].) The <em>Wilcox </em>court explained: \u201cThe paradigm SLAPP is a suit filed by a large land developer against environmental activists or a neighborhood association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>intended to chill the defendants\u2019 continued political or legal opposition to the developers\u2019 plans.\u201d <em>(Wilcox v. Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 815.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[W]hile SLAPP suits \u2018masquerade as ordinary lawsuits\u2019 the conceptual features which reveal them as SLAPP\u2019s are that they are generally meritless suits brought by large private interests to deter common citizens from exercising their political or legal rights or to punish them for doing so.\u201d <em>(Wilcox v. Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 816-817, citing Pring, <em>SLAPPs: Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation </em>(1989) 7 Pace Envtl. L.Rev. 3, 5-6, 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The Legislature responded to a \u201cdisturbing increase\u201d in SLAPP suits by enacting section 425.16 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The legislation explicitly declared that participation in matters of public significance \u201cshould not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section 425.16 is a procedural remedy designed to eliminate SLAPP\u2019s in the early stages of litigation. It permits a special motion to strike a cause of action against a person \u201carising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech ... in connection with a public issue . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b)(1).)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The statute defines an \u201cact in furtherance of a person\u2019s right of petition or free speech ... in connection with a public issue\u201d to include four types of conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">Any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, judicial or other official proceeding (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(1));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Any written or oral statement or writing \u201cmade in connection with an issue under consideration or review\u201d by a legislative, executive, or judicial body or other official proceeding (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(2));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">Any written or oral statement or writing made in a public place in connection with an issue of public interest (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(3)); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">Any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the rights of petition or free speech \u201cin connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(4).)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">To succeed on a motion to strike, the moving defendant must make a prima facie showing that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action arises from an act in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s First Amendment rights, that is, from any one of the four types of conduct listed above. <em>(Wilcox v. Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 820.) If the defendant does so, the motion to strike will be granted \u201cunless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Since the enactment of the anti-SLAPP statute in 1992, its scope has expanded beyond the type of lawsuit described in <em>Wilcox\u2019 </em>s paradigm SLAPP. In response to cases narrowly construing the statute, section 425.16 was amended in 1997 to clarify the Legislature\u2019s intent that its provisions be construed broadly.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In 1999, the Supreme Court resolved conflicts among the courts of appeal by holding that any statement or writing \u201cmade in, or in connection with an issue under consideration or review by, an official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>proceeding or body\u201d is protected by section 425.16, whether or not it involves a public issue. <em>(Briggs </em>v. <em>Eden Council for Hope &amp; Opportunity, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1106, 1113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Since <em>Briggs, </em>courts have applied the anti-SLAPP statute in a number of different factual contexts. (See, e.g., <em>Sipple v. Foundation for Nat. Progress </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 226, 240 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 677] [media defendants in libel actions are among the prime beneficiaries of \u00a7 425.16; the anti-SLAPP statute is not limited to suits by the powerful and wealthy against the impecunious, citing <em>Lafayette Morehouse, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chronicle Publishing Co. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 855, 863 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 46]]; <em>DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 562, 568-569 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 755] [class action claims brought against a drug company for alleged false statements before a regulatory agency were subject to special motion to strike; case remanded for determination whether plaintiffs could establish probability of prevailing on their claims].) The scope of the statute is not without limits, as demonstrated in other cases finding lawsuits were not within its protection. <em>(Paul for Council </em>v. <em>Hanyecz </em>(2001) 85 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1365 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 864] [suit alleging interference with a councilman\u2019s candidacy by admittedly illegal campaign contributions was not subject to a motion to strike because campaign money laundering \u201cwas not a <em>valid </em>activity undertaken by defendants in furtherance of\u2019 their free speech rights]; <em>People ex rel. 20th Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Building Permit Consultants, Inc. </em>(2000) 86 Cal.App.4th 280, 284 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 71] [defendants failed to make a prima facie showing that a lawsuit was brought to chill their First Amendment rights].)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">\n<em>Application of the statute to this case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In his motion to strike and on appeal, Friedman\u2019s position is that all the acts alleged in Paul\u2019s complaint arose \u201cin connection with the investigation or prosecution of the underlying arbitration,\u201d and therefore fell within the ambit of the anti-SLAPP statute. We conclude Friedman misreads the statute.  While we are required to construe the statute broadly, we must also adhere to its express words and remain mindful of its purpose.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Friedman was required to make a prima facie showing that Paul\u2019s lawsuit arose from acts implicating Friedman\u2019s First Amendment speech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>or petition rights as described in one of the four categories stated in the statute.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(l)-(4); <em>Dowling v. Zimmerman </em>(2001) 85 Cal.App.4th 1400, 1418 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 174].) None of those categories encompasses, as Friedman asserts, any and all conduct \u201cin connection with [the] securities arbitration proceeding.\u201d So far as private arbitration proceedings are concerned, the statute covers, as the Supreme Court observed in <em>Briggs, </em>any statement or writing \u201cmade in, or in connection with an issue under consideration or review by, an official proceeding or body.\u201d <em>(Briggs </em>v. <em>Eden Council for Hope &amp; Opportunity, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1113.) Paul\u2019s tort causes of action plainly did not seek redress for any statements of Friedman\u2019s \u201cmade in\u201d the arbitration or \u201cbefore\u201d the arbitrators <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(1).) Paul sought redress for a harassing investigation and disclosures made outside the arbitration. Thus, since the suit does not arise from statements \u201cmade before\u201d the arbitral body, Friedman had to show the suit arose from oral statements or writings \u201cmade in connection with an issue under consideration or review\u201d in the arbitration. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e)(2).) A review of Paul\u2019s complaint and Friedman\u2019s motion to strike makes it clear that Friedman made no such showing <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>In essence, Paul\u2019s lawsuit alleged Friedman conducted a harassing investigation that extended far beyond the scope of the issues subject to arbitration. The investigation was allegedly directed to personal matters bearing no relationship to the claims asserted in the arbitration. In the course of the investigation, Friedman or his agents allegedly made disclosures to clients and others about Paul\u2019s personal life that likewise had nothing to do with the claims under consideration in the arbitration. Fairly read, the complaint alleges Paul was injured by acts of Friedman\u2019s that had no connection to the issues under review in the arbitration.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Friedman\u2019s motion to strike, however, rested principally on the ground that <em>any </em>conduct in connection with an official proceeding is protected by the statute. As we have already observed, that view is erroneous. The statute does not accord anti-SLAPP protection to suits arising from any act having any connection, however remote, with an official proceeding. The statements or writings in question must occur in connection with \u201can issue under consideration or review\u201d in the proceeding. The necessity of a connection to an issue under review in a proceeding, and not merely to a proceeding, is illustrated in <em>People ex rel. 20th Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Building Permit Consultants, Inc., supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In <em>20th Century Insurance, </em>an insurance company\u2019s lawsuit alleged a defendant prepared and used false and fraudulent damage reports and repair estimates for clients submitting claims to the insurer for earthquake damage. Defendant moved to strike the suit, arguing those allegations implicated its right to petition. The defendant\u2019s declaration in support of the motion stated the reports were prepared for submission to clients and their legal counsel, the majority of them were prepared in anticipation of litigation, and they often became the subject of discovery requests in pending lawsuits. The court concluded the defendant failed to make a prima facie showing the lawsuit was brought to chill their First Amendment rights, even though \u201csome of the reports eventually were used in official proceedings or litigation,\u201d because they were not created in connection with an issue then under consideration or review in an official proceeding. (86 Cal.App.4th at pp. 284-285.) The court said: \u201c[T]he damage reports were sent to 20th Century Insurance to demand performance on the insurance contract. At the time defendants created and submitted their reports and claims, there was no \u2018issue under consideration\u2019 pending before any official proceeding. If we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>protect the reports and claims under section 425.16 because they eventually could be used in connection with an official proceeding, we would effectively be providing immunity for any kind of criminal fraud so long as the defrauding party was willing to take its cause to court. Defendants have cited nothing to us that demonstrates the anti-SLAPP law embraces such actions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The circumstances in this case are analogous. The reports in <em>20th Century Insurance </em>were avowedly prepared in anticipation of litigation, and indeed in some cases were actually used in litigation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The litigation nexus alone, however, was not sufficient to establish that the reports were \u201cin connection with an issue under consideration\u201d in an official proceeding. In <em>20th Century Insurance, </em>an issue actually addressed by the reports was not, at the time, under consideration in an official proceeding. In this case, the intrusive prehearing investigation of and disclosures concerning Paul\u2019s personal life\u2014 the subject of the lawsuit\u2014were unrelated to any issue under consideration in the arbitration. In short, it is insufficient to assert that the acts alleged were \u201cin connection with\u201d an official proceeding. There must be a connection with an issue under review in that proceeding. In <em>20th Century Insurance, </em>there was a connection to an issue but no pending proceeding; here, there is a pending proceeding, but no connection to an issue before the tribunal.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Friedman contends that during the arbitration (a) he argued that Paul\u2019s judgment was impaired, and (b) the panel permitted testimony about Paul\u2019s conviction for driving under the influence and other \u201cdistractions\u201d in Paul\u2019s personal life.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> However, a lawyer\u2019s attempt to inject an issue into a proceeding does not render the issue relevant, nor can the attempted injection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>an irrelevant matter transform it into an issue \u201cunder consideration or review\u201d in the proceeding. By definition, irrelevant matters have no tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact of consequence to the determination of a matter, and are specifically excluded from consideration.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Irrelevant matters thus are not \u201cunder consideration or review\u201d in an official proceeding. Nor does the arbitration panel\u2019s willingness to listen to irrelevant matters bear on whether those matters were \u201cunder consideration or review\u201d by the arbitrators. The arbitrators were not bound by the rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\">Accordingly, we conclude the evidence Friedman presented with his motion to strike did not amount to a prima facie showing that his allegedly harassing investigation and related personal disclosures were in connection with or related to \u201can issue under consideration or review\u201d by the arbitrators. Indeed, all the evidence was to the contrary. The issues actually under review by the arbitrators bore no relationship to the allegations in Paul\u2019s lawsuit. The statement of claim in the arbitration makes no allegations of \u201cimpaired judgment\u201d or \u201cdistractions\u201d causing damage to the claimants.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The arbitral decision is likewise barren of any mention of any such claims or arguments, either in the statement of \u201cissues for resolution\u201d or elsewhere. Indeed, the decision explicitly determined that even the claims under consideration were \u201cfrivolous,\u201d had \u201cno factual foundation,\u201d and \u201cwere intended to harass\u201d Paul and CIBC Oppenheimer.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">It would be ironic indeed if activity remotely connected to a frivolous arbitration proceeding were protected by a statute specifically enacted to prevent the chilling of First Amendment rights through abuses of the judicial process. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).) Fortunately, there is no such irony in this case, because Friedman did not make the necessary prima facie showing his activity came within the protection of the statute.

We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In the proceeding Paul brought to confirm the arbitration award, Friedman filed opposing declarations. Those declarations breached a confidentiality agreement by revealing a mediator\u2019s evaluation of the arbitration claims. Friedman does not contend an absence of a breach. Instead, he argues the statements made in the declarations he submitted were covered by the litigation privilege. They were not. <em>(ITT Telecom Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Dooley </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 307, 320, 319 [262 Cal.Rptr. 773] [defendant was not privileged under Civ.

Paul claims in his reply brief that Friedman had no standing to bring a motion to strike on that ground, citing <em>Shekhter v.

In <em>Shekhter, </em>however, the court did not address the issue whether a special motion to strike could have been brought by the lawyers based on the exercise of the right to petition as counsel.
