His sole contention is that he was entitled to dismissal because he was kept in custody beyond his original commitment without a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">We disagree. When defendant first raised this issue in the trial court, by making a motion to dismiss, the trial court immediately made a preliminary finding of probable cause and ordered that defendant continue to be kept in custody. We will hold that the Legislature did not intend the trial court\u2019s failure to make this determination three days earlier, when defendant\u2019s original term expired, to be grounds for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">In 1985, defendant was convicted of committing lewd and lascivious acts, many of them by force, upon two girls not related to him (as well as upon his nephew and his own son). He was sentenced to prison. He was scheduled to be released in April 1997. However, in March 1997, the People filed a petition to commit him as a sexually violent predator. On October 2, 1997, he was found to be a sexually violent predator, and he was committed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>two years. Thus, his original commitment was due to end on October 2, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">On August 18, 1999, the People filed a petition to extend defendant\u2019s commitment. A probable cause hearing was set for October 5, 1999. On that date, defendant moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that his commitment had expired before a probable cause hearing had been held. The trial court set a hearing on the motion for October 28, 1999. It indicated that it would conduct the probable cause hearing, if at all, after it ruled on the motion. Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 6601.5, however, it found that the petition supported a finding of probable cause. It therefore ordered that defendant remain detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">On October 28, 1999, after a further hearing, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss. It set the probable cause hearing for November 8, 1999. Although there was a hearing on November 8, 1999, it appears that the probable cause hearing was either continued or taken off calendar; indeed, it does not appear that a probable cause hearing was ever held. In this appeal, however, defendant does not assert that this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">On September 11, 2000, defendant waived a probable cause hearing as well as a jury trial. On November 17, 2000, the trial court found that he was still a sexually violent predator. It therefore committed him for another two years, beginning retroactively on October 2, 1999, and ending on October 2, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">Statutory Background</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">The Sexually Violent Predators Act (the Act) (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.) provides for a two-year involuntary commitment of a \u201csexually violent predator,\u201d which is generally defined as a person who has been convicted of violent sex crimes against multiple victims and who, by reason of a diagnosed mental disorder, is likely to engage in sexually violent criminal behavior so as to constitute a danger to the health and safety of others. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">A. <em>Initial Commitment Procedures.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">If the Department of Corrections determines, based on a standardized screening, that a prisoner in its custody may be a sexually violent predator, it may refer that person for evaluation. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601, subds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>(a)(1), (b).) In most cases, the referral should be made at least six months before the prisoner\u2019s scheduled release date. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601, subd. (a)(1).) However, if necessary for the completion of a full evaluation, the Board of Prison Terms may keep the prisoner in custody for up to 45 days beyond his or her scheduled release date. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">If two psychologists or psychiatrists both agree, based on a standardized assessment protocol, that the prisoner is a sexually violent predator, the district attorney may file an initial commitment petition. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601, subds. (c), (d), (h), (i).) The Act provides that the defendant must be in custody when the initial petition is filed. However, it also provides that \u201c[a] petition shall not be dismissed on the basis of a later judicial or administrative determination that the individual\u2019s custody was unlawful, if the unlawful custody was the result of a good faith mistake of fact or law.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601, subd. (a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">A probable cause hearing must be held. This is a full adversarial evidentiary hearing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 421, 432-435 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 357], cert. den. (1999) 528 U.S. 865 [120 S.Ct. 160, 145 L.Ed.2d 136]; <em>In re Parker </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1453, 1466-1470 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 167].) At the end of the hearing, the trial court must determine, as a factual matter, whether there is probable cause to believe that the defendant is likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior upon release. Once the probable cause hearing has begun, the defendant must remain in custody until it is over. If the trial court determines that there is probable cause, it must order that a trial be held; it also must order that the defendant remain in custody until the trial is over. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6602, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Under Welfare and Institutions Code section 6601.5, as it stood in 1999, if the defendant\u2019s parole was about to expire before a probable cause hearing could be held, the People could request an \u201curgency review.\u201d The trial court then had to determine whether the petition, on its face, would support a finding of probable cause to believe that the defendant was likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior upon release. If the trial court made this preliminary finding of probable cause, it had to order the defendant detained until a probable cause hearing could be held; in that event, the probable cause hearing had to begin not more than 10 days later. (Former Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601.5, Stats. 1998, ch. 19, \u00a7 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 6601.5, as it now stands, is essentially identical, except that it allows the People to request such a review in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>all cases, not just when the defendant\u2019s parole is about to expire. It therefore refers to it as a \u201creview,\u201d rather than an \u201curgency review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Finally, at the trial, a jury (or the trial court, if neither side demands a jury) must determine whether the defendant is a sexually violent predator. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6603, subds. (a), (b), (d), 6604.) If so, he or she must be committed to the custody of the State Department of Mental Health for two years. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6604.) The Act provides that the defendant \u201cshall not be kept in actual custody longer than two years unless a subsequent extended commitment is obtained from the court incident to the filing of a petition for extended commitment. . . .\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">B. <em>Extended Commitment Procedures.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">The Act is not particularly explicit regarding the procedures to be followed in connection with an extended commitment proceeding. The courts, however, have held that the procedures for an initial commitment also apply to an extended commitment\u2014at least to the extent possible. <em>(People v. Superior Court (Gary) </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 207, 214 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 874]; <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 845, 849 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 350]; <em>Butler v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1180-1181 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 468].) Thus, in an extended commitment proceeding, the defendant is entitled to a probable cause hearing. <em>(Cooley v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 785, 791-792 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 724].) Also, the People may request a preliminary review of the petition for probable cause. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601.5.) The term of an extended commitment is two years from the end of the previous commitment. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6604.1, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">In 2000, the Legislature amended Welfare and Institutions Code section 6604.1, subdivision (b) so as to provide expressly that \u201c[t]he rights, requirements, and procedures set forth in [Welfare and Institutions Code s]ection 6603 shall apply to extended commitment proceedings.\u201d (Stats. 2000, ch. 420, \u00a7 4.) This amendment, however, was not intended to change the existing law that <em>all </em>procedures for an initial commitment\u2014not just those set forth in Welfare and Institutions Code section 6603\u2014also apply to an extended commitment. <em>(Cooley v. Superior Court, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.4th at pp. 787-792.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">III, IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The Expiration of Defendant\u2019s Term Prior to the Probable Cause Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">As already noted, defendant contends the trial court erred by refusing to dismiss the extended commitment petition, even though his original commitment had expired and a probable cause hearing had not yet begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">The Act explicitly requires that the defendant be in custody, pursuant to either a determinate prison term, a parole revocation term, or a 45-day evaluation hold, when the initial petition is filed. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601, subd. (a)(2).) Because the procedures for an extended commitment parallel those for an initial commitment, we believe the Act equally requires that the defendant be in custody, pursuant to the prior commitment, when an extended commitment petition is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">The Act further provides that an initial petition cannot be dismissed based on a later determination that the defendant\u2019s custody was unlawful, provided the unlawful custody was the result of a good faith mistake. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601, subd. (a)(2).) This necessarily implies that the petition <em>should </em>be dismissed if the unlawful custody was <em>not </em>the result of a good faith mistake. And, once again, we believe this requirement also applies to an extended commitment petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Here, however, when the extended commitment petition was filed, on August 18, 1999, defendant <em>was </em>in lawful custody. He therefore contends that the Act <em>also </em>requires that a defendant be in lawful custody (or, at least, in unlawful custody as the result of a good faith mistake) when <em>the probable cause hearing </em>begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">The Act does not explicitly require this. Defendant infers such a requirement from \u201cthe structure of the . . . Act itself. . . .\u201d In particular, he points to the fact that the trial court must make a preliminary determination of probable cause before it can order the defendant kept in custody until the probable cause hearing and also the fact that the probable cause hearing must begin within 10 days after the trial court makes such a determination. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601.5.) We would also note that, once the probable cause hearing does begin, the trial court must order the defendant kept in custody until the hearing is over. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6602, subd. (a).) Finally, if it finds probable cause, it must order the defendant kept in custody until the trial is over. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">This statutory scheme does indeed suggest that the Legislature intended the defendant to be in custody, not only when the petition is filed, but at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>every subsequent step in the process. But why? In other contexts, a person who is not in custody can be involuntarily committed. Indeed, often the very point of an involuntary commitment (or a similar involuntary detention) is to move a person off the streets and into protective custody. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 300 et seq., 5150 et seq., 6500 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The evident reason here is to protect the public\u2014to ensure that an alleged violent sexual predator is not loosed upon the world. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kirkland </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 891, 913 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 863] [mentally disordered prisoners]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Curtis </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 982, 989 [223 Cal.Rptr. 397] [mentally disordered sex offenders].) When the Act was first passed, the Legislature declared: \u201cThese persons are not safe to be at large and if released represent a danger to the health and safety of others .... [I]t is in the interest of society to identify these individuals prior to the expiration of their terms of imprisonment.\u201d (Stats. 1995, ch. 763, \u00a7 l.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1999, the Legislature amended the Act so as to expressly require that the defendant be in custody when the petition is filed. (Stats. 1999, ch. 136, \u00a7 1.) However, it added that this amendment was declarative of existing law. (Stats. 1999, ch. 136, \u00a7 3.) The legislative history explained: \u201cThe purpose behind requiring that a SVP petition be filed while an inmate is in custody is twofold: public protection and ensuring treatment to the dangerous mentally ill . . . .\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 11 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 6, 1999, p. 4.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">At the same time, the Legislature placed conditions on any pretrial extension of a defendant\u2019s custody, including successive findings of probable cause. Obviously, it did so to protect defendants. This ensures that they cannot be kept in custody beyond their release dates without some showing of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Here, defendant was kept in custody beyond his release date without any prior showing of good cause. Defendant concludes that he was entitled to be released. During the three days that he was unlawfully confined, however, he did not file a habeas corpus petition or otherwise seek release. The first time he turned to the trial court for help was on October 5, when he moved to dismiss the petition. Rather than dismiss, the trial court complied\u2014albeit belatedly\u2014with Welfare and Institutions Code section 6601.5; it made a preliminary determination of probable cause, and it ordered defendant detained pending the probable cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">\u201cTraditionally, the question of whether a public official\u2019s failure to comply with a statutory procedure should have the effect of invalidating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>subsequent governmental action has been characterized as a question of whether the statute should be accorded \u2018mandatory\u2019 or \u2018directory\u2019 effect. If the failure is determined to have an invalidating effect, the statute is said to be mandatory; if the failure is determined not to invalidate subsequent action, the statute is said to be directory. . . . [I]n evaluating whether a provision is to be accorded mandatory or directory effect, courts look to the purpose of the procedural requirement to determine whether invalidation is necessary to promote the statutory design.\u201d <em>(People v. McGee </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 948, 958 [140 Cal.Rptr. 657, 568 P.2d 382].)</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">In light of the Legislature\u2019s evident purposes, we do not believe it intended an alleged sexually violent predator to be released <em>solely </em>because the trial court fails to make a finding of probable cause before the defendant\u2019s term expires. Here, the trial court did make the requisite preliminary probable cause finding, albeit three days too late. Defendant cannot claim he was prejudiced by the three-day delay. It is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that, if the trial court had reviewed the petition on October 2 instead of October 5, it would still have made the same preliminary probable cause finding. Thus, defendant would still have remained in custody beyond his release date. In sum the trial court properly accommodated the Legislature\u2019s concern that a defendant not be kept in custody beyond his or her release date without a showing of good cause; at the same time, it also properly accommodated the Legislature\u2019s concern that potentially dangerous sexually violent predators not be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">We conclude that, under the circumstances, the trial court correctly refused to dismiss the petition or to release defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">McKinster, Acting P.
