J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab64\">Jerry P. has been a dependent child of the juvenile court since shortly after his birth when both he and his mother tested positive for cocaine in their bloodstreams. The court initially found appellant, J.R., to be Jerry\u2019s \u201cpresumed father\u201d and ordered father and son be provided family reunification services which eventually could lead to J.R.\u2019s custody of Jerry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon rehearing, however, the court determined J.R. could not be Jerry\u2019s \u201cpresumed father\u201d because he never received Jerry \u201cinto his home\u201d as required by Family Code section 7611, subdivision (d). The court did not address respondent\u2019s additional argument J.R. could not be the \u201cpresumed father\u201d because DNA tests showed he is not the biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">J.R. appeals from the court\u2019s order denying him reunification services because he is not Jerry\u2019s statutorily \u201cpresumed father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">We reverse,  We hold presumed fatherhood status, for purposes of dependency proceedings, is not necessarily negated by evidence the presumed father is not the biological father. We further hold <em>Adoption of Kelsey S.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>applies to dependency proceedings and therefore Family Code section 7611 and the related dependency scheme violate the constitutional rights of a man seeking presumed father status to the extent they permit a mother or third person to unilaterally deny him that status by preventing him from receiving the child into his home. Finally, we hold the constitutional protection afforded biological fathers under <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>extends to men who are not biological fathers but who meet the other criteria for presumed father status under the <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">J.R. and Jerry\u2019s mother, Kiz, had a relationship for approximately a year. Jerry was conceived during this period. When J.R. learned Kiz was pregnant he assumed the baby was his and told others Kiz was pregnant with his child. J.R. eventually broke off his relationship with Kiz because she refused to stop using drugs despite J.R.\u2019s warnings she was harming the baby. Notwithstanding their breakup, J.R. continued to provide support to Kiz. He supplied her with vitamin supplements and bus fare to go to the doctor, helped with prenatal care and paid for her medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Kiz called J.R. from the hospital and informed him she had commenced labor. Jerry was bom the next day, and J.R. went to the hospital to visit him. He identified himself to hospital staff as Jerry\u2019s father and he was allowed to hold Jerry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When J.R. returned the following day, Kiz had left the hospital but Jerry remained because he had tested positive for cocaine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> J.R. visited and held Jerry at the hospital every day for a week. When Jerry was a week old the hospital moved him to a different unit where J.R. could view him only through a window. Two days later, Jerry was gone. The hospital told J.R. only that Jerry had been placed with his mother\u2019s family. For four months J.R. tried unsuccessfully to find Jerry. He was unaware Jerry had been placed in a foster home and dependency proceedings initiated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">J.R. testified he first learned of Jerry\u2019s whereabouts four months later when a social worker from the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) contacted him, informed him the baby was in foster care and told him the date of the next scheduled dependency hearing was June 1, 1999. J.R. asked to visit Jerry and the social worker told him she would check and get back to him. Three months later the social worker gave J.R. the name and telephone number of Jerry\u2019s foster parents. J.R. immediately attempted to arrange visits with Jerry. The foster parents referred him back to the social worker and no visits were arranged prior to the next dependency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The June 1st hearing was a selection and implementation hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26. J.R. appeared at the hearing and was appointed counsel. The court continued the hearing and ordered DCFS to explore J.R.\u2019s presumed father status. The court subsequently ordered a paternity test to determine if J.R. was Jerry\u2019s biological father and continued the hearing on the matter. The matter was continued several more times and in the interim J.R. filed a petition requesting that he be given \u201cpresumed father status\u201d and provided reunification services with Jerry with the intention of obtaining Jerry\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">On the issue of whether J.R. should be found to be Jerry\u2019s \u201cpresumed father\u201d and afforded family reunification services, the court received the following evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Since the June 1st hearing J.R. consistently visited with Jerry. The visits began as monitored, once a week, at the foster family agency or the DCFS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>office. After two weeks J.R. was allowed to visit Jerry at the foster parents\u2019 home once a week for two to four hours. When he came for visits, J.R. brought diapers, food and toys. He played with Jerry, talked to him and told him how much he loved him. J.R. also called the foster mother twice a week to check on Jerry\u2019s well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Eventually J.R., Jerry and the foster mother would go on outings to a shopping mall or the park. The foster mother testified she was always present on these outings but she would allow J.R. and Jerry to go off on their own for awhile. When J.R. returned with Jerry the boy always appeared well cared for. Recalling the trips to the mall, the foster mother testified: \u201c[J.R.] buys the baby something every minute of the day if you would let him. But [J.R.] goes every place and buys him something and the baby would have things under each arm.\u201d According to the foster mother, J.R. \u201cis extremely dedicated to this child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The social worker\u2019s report acknowledged: \u201cJerry has been having weeldy visits with J.R. at the foster parents\u2019 home. According to the foster parent, these visits have been consistent since July 1999. Jerry appears to be in the elementary stages of bonding with <em>his father </em>and is secure and comfortable in <em>his father\u2019s </em>care.\u201d (Italics added.) The court also heard evidence that \u201cat the beginning of each visit, [Jerry\u2019s] face brightens when [J.R.] arrives, and the minor appears happy during those visits [and] he cries at the end of each visit.\u201d Jerry calls J.R. \u201cDaddy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">By April 2000, J.R. had completed classes in parenting and CPR. He had also completed the training for a foster care license but could not obtain one because he did not have his own residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The evidence showed during these proceedings J.R. for the most part resided at the Midnight Mission in Los Angeles where he was employed full time. The Midnight Mission facility where J.R. lived did not accept children as residents. However, it had another facility, near the home of the foster parents, which did accept families. J.R. had recently obtained private employment and was earning approximately $280 per week. His plan for accommodating Jerry, should he be awarded custody, was to retain Jerry in the child care program he was currently attending. The foster mother had agreed to assist J.R. with child care and J.R.\u2019s mother was also available to assist if necessary. He would move to the Midnight Mission facility which accepts children or to private housing. J.R. acknowledged to the social worker Jerry had a bond with his foster parents and would have some difficulty coming to live with him. He stated \u201che was open to any services that would help.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>J.R. told the court: \u201cI am fully committed to the welfare of [Jerry]. I want what is best for him and will do whatever is necessary to ensure his emotional, physical and financial heath and safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">DNA tests showed J.R. is not the biological father of Jerry.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">A juvenile court referee conducted the initial hearing on presumed father status. The court heard argument from counsel for J.R., Jerry, and the foster parents, all of whom supported granting J.R. presumed father status. Only DCFS opposed presumed father status. It urged the court to rule against J.R. on the grounds he had not taken Jerry into his \u201chome\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and was not the biological father. The court rejected the DCFS arguments. It ruled J.R. was the \u201cpresumed father\u201d of Jerry and ordered family reunification services. The court gave the following explanation for its decision. \u201cThe code requires the father to receive the child into his home and openly hold out the child as his natural [child]. ... He has visited regularly [and] clearly held himself out to be the father. . . . Regarding receiving the child into his home, I think that by going to the hospital every day on a daily basis was [sic] the equivalent of receiving the child into his home. . . . And it would seem to me that you should be able to reach the presumed [father] level without being a biological father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">DCFS immediately petitioned for a rehearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 252. The petition was granted and the matter was heard de novo before a judge of the juvenile court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">At the rehearing, the court took judicial notice of the contents of the file including the evidence and argument from the previous hearing. The court also accepted an offer of proof from J.R. which essentially summarized his evidence from the previous hearing. The court then heard argument from the parties on J.R.\u2019s status as Jerry\u2019s presumed father. Each party took the same position it took in the original hearing with counsel for Jerry and the foster parents supporting J.R.\u2019s presumed father status and DCFS opposing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">This time, however, the court reached a different result. Finding J.R. had \u201cnot ever received the child into his home\u201d the court denied J.R. presumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>father status \u201cfor that reason alone.\u201d Having found J.R. did not meet a necessary requirement for presumed father status the court did not reach the question whether proof J.R. was not the biological father prevented him from being the \u201cpresumed father.\u201d The court remarked, however, \u201cI think a hard and fast rule like that could lead to inappropriate results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The court entered an order finding J.R. was not Jerry\u2019s presumed father and denying J.R.\u2019s motion for family reunification services. The court set a new date for the selection and implementation hearing. J.R. filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">I. <em>Statutory Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">In dependency proceedings, fathers are divided into four categories: de facto fathers, alleged fathers, natural fathers and presumed fathers. A man, such as a stepfather, who has assumed the role of parent, is a \u201cde facto father.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A man who may be the father of the dependent child but has not been established to be the natural or presumed father is an \u201calleged father.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A man who has been established to be the biological father is a \u201cnatural father.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A man who has held the child out as Ms own and received the child into Ms home is a \u201cpresumed father.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A \u201cnatural father\u201d can be, but is not necessarily, a \u201cpresumed father\u201d and a \u201cpresumed father\u201d can be, but is not necessarily, a \u201cnatural father.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Presumed father status ranks highest. Only a \u201cstatutorily presumed father\u201d is entitled to reunification services under Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.5, subdivision (a) and custody of Ms child under Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.2.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Presumed fatherhood, for purposes of dependency proceedings, denotes one who \u201cpromptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his paternal responsibilities\u2014emotional, financial, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>otherwise[.]\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As one court put it: \u201cThe purpose of reunification services is to \u2018reunite the family in a situation where the best interests of all concerned, the child, the parent and society as a whole, are well served.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, \u201c[w]e doubt, in light of the statutory purpose, that the Legislature intended to mandate reunification services solely based on the status of being the biological father. For example, we think it highly unlikely the Legislature intended to give a right of reunification services to a rapist or an anonymous sperm donor simply because the man is the biological father of the child.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">To identify fathers who, by reason of their parenting relationship, are entitled to seek reunification services and custody the Legislature borrowed the categories of men who are \u201cpresumed to be the natural father[s]\u201d of children under Family Code section 7611,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> hence the term \u201cpresumed father.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Section 7611 sets out a number of ways a father can obtain \u201cpresumed father\u201d status.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He can marry or attempt to marry the child\u2019s mother, he and the mother can execute a declaration of paternity or he can \u201creceived the child into his home and openly hold[] out the child as his natural child.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In the present case, J.R. attempted to qualify as a presumed father under the latter provision but the attempt failed because he could not prove he had <em>\u201cphysically </em>[brought] the child into his home.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">J.R. contends the scheme for determining presumed father status in dependency proceedings is unconstitutional insofar as it permits the mother or a third party unilaterally to preclude a man from becoming a presumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>father by preventing him from receiving the child into his home despite his demonstration of a full commitment to his parental responsibilities\u2014emotional and financial and otherwise\u2014before and after the child\u2019s birth. For the reasons explained below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">II. <em>Presumed Fatherhood Status Is Not Necessarily Rebutted by Evidence the \u201cPresumed Father\u201d Is Not the \u201cNatural Father. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Before addressing J.R.\u2019s constitutional arguments we address a DCFS argument which, if correct, would render J.R.\u2019s constitutional argument moot. DCFS contends even if J.R. initially could have been found to satisfy the requirements for \u201cpresumed father\u201d status under section 7611 or its equivalent under <em>Kelsey S. </em>discussed in part III below, his presumed father status was negated by a subsequent blood test conclusively showing he is not Jerry\u2019s natural, i.e., biological, father.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">DCFS relies on <em>In re Olivia H. </em>which held \u201cpresumed father\u201d status in dependency proceedings can be negated by a blood test showing the \u201cpresumed father\u201d is not the \u201cnatural father.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The court held blood tests establishing nonpaternity constituted \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d rebutting presumed fatherhood status under section 7612, subdivisions (a) and (c), (formerly Civ. Code, \u00a7 7004, subd. (b)) which state the presumption under section 7611 a man is a natural father \u201c \u2018is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018by a court decree establishing paternity of the child by another man.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">We decline to follow the holding in <em>In re Olivia H. </em>for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">First, we disagree with the proposition lack of a biological relationship to the child <em>automatically </em>defeats presumed father status. As previously noted, section 7612, subdivision (a) states a presumption under section 7611 <em>\u201cmay </em>be rebutted <em>in an appropriate action </em>only by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Italics added.) In <em>In re Kiana A.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court interpreted this language as giving the trial court discretion to decide whether proof the \u201cpresumed father\u201d is not the biological father is sufficient to rebut the presumption. The court explained: \u201c[Although the results of genetic testing constitute clear and convincing evidence, it does not follow that such evidence will rebut the presumption in every case. Rather, the statute seeks to protect presumptions of paternity, once they have arisen, from being set aside except upon clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>and convincing evidence and only in an appropriate case.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, in a case involving two men who met the statutory requirements for being a presumptive father, the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to award presumptive father status to the man who had played a significant parenting role in the child\u2019s life as opposed to the man who was the child\u2019s biological father but had never played a part in her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Furthermore, we do not agree a finding that a man is not the biological father of the child is equivalent to \u201ca judgment establishing paternity of the child by another man.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In our view, section 7612, subdivision (c) contemplates a situation in which a man of flesh and blood, as opposed to a mere hypothetical man, is put forward as the father of the child. Otherwise, a child could be precluded from having a loving, nurturing relationship with a committed father by a man the child may never even have met, who may be totally uninterested in the child and who cannot obtain presumed father status in his own right. We do not believe the Legislature intended to create such a dog-in-the-manger rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Finally, we question whether, in the dependency context, the courts should even treat \u201cpresumed fatherhood\u201d as an evidentiary presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The primary purpose of section 7611, a part of the Uniform Parentage Act, is to establish a child\u2019s paternity through a series of rebuttable presumptions.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In dependency proceedings, however, the purpose of section 7611 is not to establish paternity. Rather, as discussed above, the purpose is to determine whether the alleged father has demonstrated a sufficient commitment to his parental responsibilities to be afforded rights <em>not </em>afforded to natural fathers\u2014the rights to reunification services and custody of the child. Therefore, in dependency proceedings the term \u201cpresumed father\u201d does not denote a presumption of fatherhood in the evidentiary sense and presumed father status is not rebutted by evidence someone else is the natural father. The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>and <em>In re Zacharia D. </em>and the statutory scheme itself support our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Our Supreme Court has observed on several occasions presumed father status, when used to connote a father with financial and social ties to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>child, is unrelated to natural father status. In <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>the court stated: \u201cA man\u2019s parentage of a child may be undisputed and legally proven, but he may nevertheless fail to be a \u2018presumed father\u2019. . . . Conversely, even if paternity is denied <em>and legally disproved, </em>a man may be deemed, under some circumstances, to be a \u2018presumed father.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Although <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>was an adoption case, it relied on the same categories in section 7611 for determining presumed father status as are used in dependency cases. Moreover, in <em>In re Zacharia D., </em>which was a dependency case, the court noted \u201cit is possible for a man to achieve presumed father status, with its attendant rights and duties, without being the biological father.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The court\u2019s observations suggest in the dependency context the term \u201cpresumed father\u201d is not an evidentiary term but a term of convenience used to identify a preferred class of fathers by reference to the familial bonds described in section 7611 which the Legislature has determined reasonably approximates the class of fathers it wishes to benefit.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The conclusion presumptive fatherhood is not an evidentiary presumption in the dependency context is also clear from the fact that in dependency proceedings a \u201cpresumed father\u201d has greater rights than a \u201cnatural father.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It would not make sense to use the categories in section 7611 simply to establish an evidentiary presumption a man is a \u201cnatural father\u201d when being a \u201cnatural father\u201d is a step <em>below </em>being a \u201cpresumed father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Moreover, if the role of section 7611 in a dependency proceeding was merely to establish an evidentiary presumption a man was the child\u2019s natural father, a man who was already established to be the child\u2019s natural father before dependency proceedings commenced could never become a \u201cpresumed father\u201d because a presumption under the statute would be unnecessary.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We fail to see the rationality in a system which would confer more rights on a father when his biological tie to the child is unknown than when it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>III. <em>Section 7611 and the Related Dependency Scheme Violate the Guarantees of Due Process and Equal Protection to the Extent They Allow a Mother or Third Person Unilaterally to Preclude a Father from Becoming a \u201cPresumed Father. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">A. <em>J.R. Satisfied the Requirement of Holding the Child Out as His Own.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">As previously noted, to qualify as a presumed father under section 7611, subdivision (d), a man must satisfy two requirements. He must hold out the child as his own and he must receive the child into his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In <em>Kelsey S. </em>the court recognized a man attempting to satisfy the \u201cholding out\u201d requirement for presumed father status \u201cmay have been restricted, both legally and as a practical matter, in his ability to act fully as a father.\u201d Nevertheless, the court stated, \u201cthe trial court must consider whether petitioner has done all that he could reasonably do <em>under the </em>circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> This means \u201c[o]nce the father knows or reasonably should know of the pregnancy, he must promptly attempt to assume his parental responsibilities as fully as the mother will allow and his circumstances permit.\u201d In particular, \u201cthe father must demonstrate \u2018a willingness himself to assume full custody of the child\u2014not merely to block adoption by others.\u2019 . . .\u201d The trial court should also consider \u201cthe father\u2019s public acknowledgement of paternity, payment of pregnancy and birth expenses commensurate with his ability to do so, and prompt legal action to seek custody of the child.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The evidence in this case leaves no doubt J.R. established a father-son relationship with Jerry before his birth and that this relationship continued through the hearing on J.R.\u2019s presumed father status.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">From the beginning, J.R. held himself out as Jerry\u2019s father. J.R. believed the child was his and told others the mother was pregnant with his child. Even after he broke up with Jerry\u2019s mother because of her drug use J.R. supplied her with vitamin supplements, bus fare for doctor visits, helped with prenatal care and paid for the mother\u2019s medications. He was at the hospital when Jerry was born and identified himself to hospital staff as the father. He visited and held Jerry daily in the hospital. When Jerry was taken from the hospital without J.R.\u2019s knowledge he spent months looking for him among the mother\u2019s relatives. Once he reestablished his connection with Jerry, J.R. never missed a visit, went with him on outings to the shopping mall and the park, provided him with food, diapers and toys and developed a bond with the child, who refers to him as \u201cDaddy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Without question, J.R. promptly came forward and demonstrated a full commitment to Jerry\u2019s welfare\u2014emotional, financial and otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">B. <em>J.R. Was Thwarted by the Mother and Third Parties in His Attempt to Satisfy the Requirement of Taking the Child into His Home.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>and <em>In re Zacharia D. </em>the Supreme Court recognized under section 7611, subdivision (d) a father who would become a \u201cpresumed father\u201d does not have exclusive control over the means to achieve that status. No matter how loving, caring, giving and nurturing he is, control over a man\u2019s presumed father status ultimately rests with the mother,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> or in some cases a third party.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This is because the mother cannot be forced to allow the father to take the child into his home.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In addition, there will be cases where the father cannot physically take the child into his home because, for example, the DCFS has taken custody of the child or the child, due to illness or birth defect, must remain in the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\"><em>Adoption of Kelsey S., </em>an adoption case, addressed the constitutional problems which arise when a mother or third party unilaterally can prevent a man from attaining presumed father status. In adoption proceedings, like dependency proceedings, a man with presumed father status has rights superior to those of a man with mere natural father status. A natural father\u2019s consent to an adoption of his child by third parties is not required unless the father shows retention of his parental rights is in the child\u2019s best interest. Consent, however, <em>is </em>required from a mother and a presumed father regardless of the child\u2019s best interest, unless it is shown the mother or presumed father is unfit.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> As a practical matter, the court noted, natural fathers almost never win out over the would-be adoptive parents. If the natural father is to have any realistic chance of retaining his relationship with his child he needs to qualify as a presumed father.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">In <em>Adoption of Kelsey S., </em>the mother, Kari, gave birth to Kelsey whose undisputed natural father was Rickie M. Kari and Rickie never married and Rickie never physically took Kelsey into his home. Two days after Kelsey was born, Rickie filed a petition to establish his parental relationship with Kelsey and to obtain custody. About this same time Kari placed Kelsey with prospective adoptive parents. The trial court issued a temporary restraining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>order awarding care, custody and control of Kelsey to Rickie. Rickie never took custody of Kelsey, however, because the prospective adoptive parents secretly removed him from their home. The issue of Rickie\u2019s temporary custody of Kelsey became moot a few days later when the court ordered Kelsey into the custody of his mother and prohibited visitation by either the prospective adoptive parents or Rickie. The court later amended its order to allow Rickie to visit Kelsey at the women\u2019s shelter where he was living with his mother.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In the subsequent adoption proceeding, the trial court ruled Rickie was not a presumed father because he had never taken Kelsey into his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The Supreme Court granted review to decide \u201cwhether a natural father\u2019s federal constitutional rights are violated if his child\u2019s mother is allowed to unilaterally preclude him from obtaining the same legal right as a presumed father to withhold his consent to his child\u2019s adoption by third parties.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The court held the statutory scheme for determining presumed father status \u201cviolates the federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process for unwed fathers <em>to the extent that </em>the statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child\u2019s biological father from becoming a presumed father[.]\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The court viewed the adoption scheme as discriminating between biological mothers and biological fathers. Biological mothers had an absolute right to withhold consent to adoption. Biological fathers only had an absolute right to withhold consent to adoption if they were also presumed fathers. A mother, however, could preclude a father from attaining presumed father status by preventing him from taking the child into his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The court framed the issue in <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>as whether \u201cthe state\u2019s important interest in the well being of a child born out of wedlock [is] substantially furthered by allowing the mother to deny the child\u2019s biological father an opportunity to form a relationship with the child that would give the father the same statutory rights as the mother (or a presumed father) in deciding whether the child will be adopted by third parties?\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The court concluded there was a \u201clack of any substantial relationship between the state\u2019s interest in protecting a child and allowing the mother sole control over its destiny [by preventing] the father from obtaining presumed status[.]\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">In reaching this conclusion the court first pointed out there were only two ways a father could achieve presumed father status: through marriage to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>mother or through receiving the child into his home and holding it out as his own. Either method was ultimately in the control of the mother. She could refuse to marry the father and she could deny him the right to take the child into his home.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The court noted a would-be presumed father, thwarted in his efforts by the mother, could resort to the courts for a custody order. But because such an order was discretionary and could be frustrated by the mother or third parties, the court held its availability did not equalize the father\u2019s ability to refuse consent to adoption with the mother\u2019s ability to do so.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">\u201cThe anomalies under this statutory scheme [are] readily apparent,\u201d the court stated. \u201cA father who is undisputably ready, willing, and able to exercise the full measure of his parental responsibilities can have his rights terminated merely on a showing that his child\u2019s best interest would be served by adoption. If the child\u2019s mother, however, were equally of the opposite character\u2014unready, unwilling, and unable\u2014her rights in the child could nevertheless be terminated only under the much more protective standards [of showing unfitness by clear and convincing evidence]. Such a distinction bears no substantial relationship to protecting the well-being of children. Indeed, it has little rationality.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The court also asserted the system leads to \u201cirrational distinctions\u201d between fathers.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> \u201cBased solely on the mother\u2019s wishes, a model father can be denied presumed father status, whereas a father of dubious ability and intent can achieve such status by the fortuitous circumstance of the mother allowing him to come into her home, even if only briefly\u2014perhaps a single day. . . . Under the statutory scheme, two fathers who are by all accounts equal in their ability and commitment to fulfill their parental missions can be treated differently based solely on the mothers\u2019 decisions whether to allow the father to become a presumed father.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Finally, the court found the statutory scheme \u201clargely ignore[s]\u201d the child\u2019s best interest. \u201cA child may have a wholly acceptable father who wants to nurture it, but whose parental rights can be terminated . . . because the mother has precluded the father from attaining presumed father status. Conversely, if a presumed father is highly questionable in every respect, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>is nevertheless allowed to withhold consent absent proof by clear and convincing evidence that he is unfit.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The Supreme Court remanded the matter to the trial court to determine whether Rickie had \u201cdemonstrated a sufficient commitment to his parental responsibilities\u201d to satisfy the \u201cholding out\u201d element of presumed fatherhood and, if so, to permit him to withhold his consent to Kelsey\u2019s adoption unless the trial court found him an unfit parent.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In <em>In re Zacharia D. </em>the court noted extending <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>to dependency proceedings would allow a father who is precluded from attaining presumed father status by the mother or a third party \u201cto participate as a \u2018parent\u2019 in, or end the need for, the dependency proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Given the facts in <em>In re Zacharia D., </em>however, the court stopped short of applying <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>to a dependency proceeding.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\"><em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>was subsequently extended to dependency proceedings by the Court of Appeal in <em>In re Julia U.</em><footnotemark><em>53</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, the appellate court reversed the trial court\u2019s orders denying a father reunification services and terminating his parental rights. The facts showed the would-be presumed father did not receive Julia into his home because by the time he learned he might be the child\u2019s father a dependency petition had been filed and Julia was already in DCFS custody. Nevertheless, the appellate court concluded from the evidence that once on notice father demonstrated a full commitment to his parental responsibilities as defined in <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>and therefore \u201chis federal constitutional right to due process prohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Although <em>In re Julia U. </em>undoubtedly reached the correct result the opinion does not explain why the constitutional analysis in <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>should apply to dependency cases. We believe a brief explanation is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Important similarities exist between the adoption procedures at issue in <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>and the dependency procedures at issue in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>case. Paternal rights may be terminated in both proceedings and in both proceedings the mother or a third party may preclude the father from obtaining presumed fatherhood status.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Furthermore, the important governmental interest in both proceedings is the well-being of the child.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The constitutional issues in both proceedings also are similar. In the adoption scheme at issue in <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>only mothers and presumed fathers had the right to withhold consent to adoption.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> In the dependency scheme at issue in the present case, only mothers and presumed fathers have the right to reunification services.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> In both adoption and dependency proceedings, the issue is whether the state\u2019s important interest in the well-being of the child is substantially furthered by the practice of allowing the mother or a third party to deny a committed father the opportunity to become a \u201cpresumed father\u201d with the same statutory rights as the mother.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> We find this practice no more rational in the dependency context than it was in the adoption context.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Like the facts in <em>Adoption of Kelsey S., </em>the facts in this case demonstrate a man who has established a loving, nurturing parental relationship with a child can be denied presumed father status because, through no fault of his own, he cannot physically bring the child into his home either because the mother, the DCFS, the hospital or a combination of all three have made it impossible for him to do so.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> We recognize there is a possible way around a mother\u2019s roadblock. The father may be able to obtain a foster care license and then petition the court to place his child in his foster home thereby satisfying the statutory requirement of receiving the child \u201cinto his home.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>This circuitous route to presumptive fatherhood, however, does not cure the constitutional defect in the statutory scheme. A foster care license may be denied for reasons which have nothing to do with the father\u2019s commitment to his parental responsibilities.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Even if the father obtains a foster care license he has no right to have the child placed with him. And further, requiring some fathers to obtain foster care licenses in order to gain presumed father status places a burden on them not borne by mothers or by fathers who have not been prevented from taking their children into their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Again, as in <em>Adoption of Kelsey S., </em>\u201cthe anomalies under this statutory scheme are readily apparent.\u201d A father like J.R. who is undisputably ready, willing and able to exercise his parental responsibilities is denied the right to family reunification services leading to eventual termination of the dependency proceedings and custody of his child while a mother who is unready, unwilling and <em>unable </em>to exercise her parental responsibilities in most cases has a statutory right to those services.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> We fail to see how such a distinction bears any rational relationship to the government\u2019s interest in the child\u2019s well-being.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">For these reasons it is plain to us that at least with respect to biological fathers section 7611 and the related dependency scheme violate the federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process to the extent they allow a mother or third person unilaterally to preclude the father from becoming a \u201cpresumed father\u201d where he promptly comes forward and demonstrates as well as he can under the circumstances a full commitment to his parental responsibilities\u2014emotional, financial and otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>J.R. is not Jerry\u2019s biological father, however. He is what might best be described as an \u201cequitable father.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Thus, we turn to the question whether the constitutional rights of biological fathers recognized in <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>should extend to equitable fathers such as J.R..</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">IV. <em>J.R. Has a Constitutionally Protected Interest in Maintaining His Parental Relationship with Jerry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">DCFS argues <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>protection should not extend beyond biological fathers but offers no reasons or case authority to support its position. Nevertheless, we recognize a colorable argument can be made in defense of this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Such an argument would begin by pointing out the <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>opinion itself contains numerous references to the right of a biological father to form a relationship with his child. For example, the court cites the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lehr v. Robertson</em><footnotemark><em>65</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as \u201crecognizing] the uniqueness of the biological connection between parent and child.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The court then quotes Lehr's statement, \u201c '[t]he significance of the biological connection is that it offers the natural father an opportunity that no other male possesses to develop a relationship with his offspring,\u2019 \u201d arguably implying only biological fathers are entitled to the constitutional protection afforded by its opinion.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> In discussing the best interest of the child, the court again emphasizes the importance of the biological connection between father and child. \u201cThe child has a genetic bond with its natural parents that is unique among all relationships the child will have throughout its life.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> In its holding the court also refers to the biological connection between father and child, stating the adoption scheme at issue is unconstitutional to the extent \u201cthe statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>biological father from becoming a presumed father . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> One could argue, therefore, it is not invidious discrimination to provide reunification services to a biological father who has never lived with his child but deny those services to an otherwise similarly situated nonbiological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\"><em>Troxel v. Granville</em><footnotemark><em>70</em></footnotemark><em> </em>also lends some support to the DCFS\u2019s argument. In Troxel, the court struck down on due process grounds a Washington statute which allowed \u201c \u2018any person [to] petition the court for visitation rights at any time.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Under the statute, Granville, a single mother, was required to permit her children\u2019s paternal grandparents to visit the children on a schedule imposed by the trial court. The Supreme Court held the visitation order made pursuant to the statute, \u201cwas an unconstitutional infringement on Granville\u2019s fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control of her two daughters.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> It could be argued if a mother\u2019s fundamental right to make decisions about the custody and control of her child trumps any interest the biological grandparents have in developing a relationship with the child it certainly trumps any interest an unrelated individual has in developing a parental relationship with the child. In some cases the mother may have a perfectly good reason for not allowing the would-be presumed father to take the child into his home\u2014the home may be a crack house or the man may have been convicted or suspected of child molestation, or the mother simply may not want the man to establish a relationship with the child when she knows he is not the biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Finally, it is always possible to argue complex political, practical and social considerations, such as the rights of nonbiological \u201cfathers,\u201d should be left to the Legislature.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">We find these arguments unpersuasive for the reasons given below.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">While <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>and <em>Lehr v. Robertson </em>contain references to the importance of the biological relationship between a father and his child we do not find those references determinative. Both cases <em>involved </em>biological fathers and so it was only natural the courts would discuss that biological connection in explaining the reasons for their decisions.  As the <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>opinion itself reminds us, \u201c \u2018 \u201cIt is the general rule that the language of an opinion must be construed with reference to the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>presented by the case, and the positive authority of a decision is coextensive only with such facts.\u201d \u2019 . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Neither <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>nor <em>Lehr </em>addressed the interests of a nonbiological \u201cfather\u201d in developing or maintaining a relationship with the child nor did they compare those interests to the interests of a biological father. Neither case, therefore, provides authority for limiting <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>protections to biological fathers.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">On the other hand, in <em>Smith v. Organization of Foster Families </em>the United States Supreme Court observed: \u201cNo one would seriously dispute that a deeply loving and interdependent relationship between an adult and a child in his or her care may exist even in the absence of blood relationship.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> For this reason, the court concluded, a foster parent has at least a \u201climited constitutional \u2018liberty\u2019 [interest]\u201d in maintaining her relationship with the foster child.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> If a foster parent has a liberty interest in maintaining his or her relationship with a foster child, a fortiori a man who has made the kind of parental commitment to a child J.R. has made also has a liberty interest in maintaining his relationship with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\"><em>Troxel v. Granville </em>does not call into question J.R.\u2019s liberty interest in maintaining his relationship with Jerry. The court in <em>Troxel </em>noted \u201cthere is no allegation that Granville ever sought to cut off [the grandparents\u2019] visitation entirely.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> In contrast, the statutory scheme at issue here allows not only mothers but other third parties to cut off reunification and custody entirely. Furthermore, as the court explained in <em>Adoption of Kelsey S., </em>whatever the reason behind the mother\u2019s decision to prevent the man in question from becoming a presumed father it \u201cdoes not provide a <em>legal </em>basis on which to determine\u201d the father\u2019s rights.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> We are confident the juvenile court will not permit visitation or custody with a presumed father who is a convicted child molester or lives in a crack house.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The argument complex political, practical and social issues should be left to the Legislature was answered in <em>Dawn D. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>where Justice Werdegar explained: \u201c[I]f the judiciary is to fulfill its role in our tripartite system of government as the final arbiter of constitutional issues, it cannot hope to escape the tension between legislative policy determinations and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>challenges raised by those who would seek exceptions thereto. We can, however, while entertaining such challenges, seek to hold the tension in check by always presuming the constitutional validity of legislative acts and resolving doubts in favor of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Here, our Supreme Court has already made the decision the statutory scheme for determining presumed father status is constitutionally flawed \u201cto the extent that the statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child\u2019s biological father from becoming a presumed father . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Our task is limited to determining whether the holding in <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>should apply to men who are not biological fathers. The issue is one of standing: does a nonbiological father have a constitutionally sufficient interest in his relationship with the child to be entitled to reunification services on the same basis as a <em>\u201cKelsey S. </em>father\u201d? The issue is not whether nonbiological fathers who have never lived with their children are invidiously discriminated against in the provision of reunification services vis-\u00e0-vis biological fathers who have never lived with their children. J.R. does not contend <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>itself creates an unconstitutional classification. Rather, the issue is whether a nonbiological father may have a sufficient liberty interest in his relationship with the child to have standing to challenge the \u201cirrational\u201d statutory scheme identified in <em>Adoption of Kelsey S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we hold <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>protection should extend to men such as J.R. who have demonstrated their commitment to parental responsibility by meeting the conditions set forth in that opinion, none of which depends on biology.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">In explaining the reasons for our holding, it bears repeating there is no requirement in section 7611, subdivision (d) the presumed father be the biological father. The statute simply states a man becomes a presumed father if he \u201creceives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.\u201d Thus, there are possibly hundreds if not thousands of nonbiological presumed fathers carrying out parental responsibilities today.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">More importantly, the conditions for protection under <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>do not depend on biology. Rather, a man is entitled to protection from invidious discrimination in attempting to attain presumed father status if (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>once he \u201cknows or reasonably should know of the pregnancy, he . . . promptly attempt[s] to assume his parental responsibilities as fully as the mother will allow and his circumstances permit,\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> and (2) \u201cis indisputably ready, willing, and able to exercise the full measure of his parental responsibilities . . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . emotional, financial, and otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> As discussed above, J.R. clearly meets these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We are also mindful of the legislative command we consider \u201cthe best interests of the minor in all deliberations\u201d under the dependency law.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> In our view, it is decidedly <em>not </em>in the best interest of the child to deny a man who has been part of the child\u2019s life since before birth and who meets all the other requirements stated above the opportunity \u201cenjoy the blessings of the parent-child relationship and make uniquely valuable contributions to the child\u2019s development\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> simply because more than a year after birth a blood test shows the man is not the child\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">As adults we must not forget what every child knows\u2014the parent-child relationship is not spun from DNA.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Rather, it stems from the emotional attachments which derive from the intimacy of contact between the parent and child\u2014\u201c \u2018the countless gestures, large and small, that repeatedly reaffirm: I see you, I love you; I am yours, you are mine.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The order denying J.R. reunification services is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Woods, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\">As we discuss more fully below, in dependency cases a man has \u201cpresumed father status\u201d if he falls within one of the categories described in Family Code section 7611. Under subdivision (d) of the statute a man is a \u201cpresumed father\u201d if \u201c[h]e receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.\u201d A \u201cpresumed father,\u201d unlike a mere biological father, is entitled to reunification services with the dependent child and may be awarded custody.

Such an argument fails for two reasons. J.R. was not homeless. He resided at the Midnight Mission in Los Angeles and, although Jerry could not reside at the Mission with him, the statute does not require the child to reside in the father\u2019s home but only be \u201creceived\u201d into the home. Compare <em>Adoption of Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pages 847-848, suggesting even a brief visit to the father\u2019s home would be enough to satisfy the statutory requirement of receiving the child into his home. There is no evidence J.R. could not have brought Jerry to his home for visits had the DCFS allowed him to do so. Indeed, counsel for DCFS went to great pains at the hearing on J.R.\u2019s presumed father status to elicit evidence J.R. could not have snuck off with Jerry to the Mission during one of his monitored visits and thereby attained statutory presumed father status. Furthermore, the foster mother told the trial court if necessary she would offer her home to J.R. so he could have a place to live with Jerry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Some might refer to J.R. as a \u201cHorton father\u201d after the hero of Dr. Seuss\u2019s Horton Hatches The Egg (1940).

Horton, it will be recalled, sat on an egg in a nest for nearly a year while the baby bird\u2019s mother enjoyed herself in Palm Beach. Horton protects the egg from frost, rain, and human interference. He comes to think of the egg as his. Just as the egg is about to hatch, the mother bird returns. She demands Horton give the egg back but \u201cat that very instant, the egg burst apart.\u201d To everyone\u2019s amazement, the baby bird has ears, a tail and a trunk. The crowd of bystanders unanimously agrees the baby is Horton\u2019s, reasoning \u201cit should be, it should be, it Should be like that! Because Horton was faithful! He sat and he sat!\u201d Horton, we note, did not receive the egg into his home but sat on it in the nest in the tree where the mother bird left it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\"><em>Lehr </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 248 [103 S.Ct. 2985, 77 L.Ed.2d 614].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b649-11\"><em>Adoption of Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at page 837.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b649-12\"><em> Adoption of Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at page 837, quoting <em>Lehr </em>v. <em>Robertson, supra, </em>463 U.S. at page 262 [103 S.Ct. at page 2993].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b649-13\"><em>Adoption of Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at page 848.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\"><em>Adoption of Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at page 849.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"70\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\"><em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 57 [120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b650-11\"><em>Troxel v.

(Cf. <em>In re Jessica K. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1313 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 798].) We do not know why J.R. did not seek to stay proceedings in the trial court or appeal the termination order. We do know determinations of presumed fatherhood are common in dependency proceedings yet, as the procedural history of this case shows, capable of evading review. Furthermore, the public policy behind uniting families and giving a child a father even if he is not the biological father make this case a case of great public importance. We also note DCFS did not raise the mootness issue until after it lost the appeal. In its request for dismissal DCFS is cagey about when it learned of the termination order, saying only it was \u201crecently informed\u201d of the order.

However, in denying J.R.\u2019s request for reunification services, the juvenile court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>that J.R., although aware of the pending dependency case, failed to come forward promptly: The court specifically found J.R. had received appropriate notice for the disposition hearing held on February 2, 1999, but did not appear in court until the June 1, 1999 hearing pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26, some four months later. In concluding that J.R. significantly delayed his appearance in the dependency proceedings, the juvenile court necessarily found the factual predicate for applying <em>Kelsey S. </em>was absent,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> even assuming it could be extended to this type of case under appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">2. <em>The juvenile court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The juvenile court\u2019s findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>(In re Tanis H. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1218, 1226-1227 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 380].) Those findings cannot be disturbed if there is any solid, credible evidence in favor of the ruling, giving benefit to every reasonable inference in favor of the prevailing party and resolving all conflicts in support of the court\u2019s ruling. <em>(Ibid)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">\u201c \u2018In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, our review requires that all reasonable inferences be given to support the findings and orders of the juvenile court and the record must be viewed in the light most favorable to those orders. [Citation.] Those findings and orders may not be disturbed if they are supported by substantial evidence. [Citations.] As stated: \u201cIssues of fact and credibility are questions [of fact] for the trial court, not this court. [Citation.] \u2018The rule is clear that the power of the appellate courts begins and ends with the determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the conclusion reached by the trier of fact.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Tania S. </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 728, 733-734 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 60].)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Under this deferential standard, the findings underlying the juvenile court\u2019s denial of reunification services to J.R. should be affirmed. Those findings are supported not only by the evidence of J.R.\u2019s four-month delay in appearing in the dependency proceedings, emphasized in the juvenile court\u2019s ruling, but also by evidence before the court that J.R. had initially refused to cooperate in the dependency case by providing his residence address to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>DCFS, failed to attend or cancel a scheduled visit with Jerry in December 1998 and in January 1999, following telephone contact with DCFS, failed to keep an appointment with the social worker to discuss Jerry\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">3. <em>In light of the juvenile court\u2019s findings, it is unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue raised by J.R.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Because I would affirm the juvenile court\u2019s orders based on its factual determinations, I need not resolve the difficult constitutional issue at the core of the majority opinion: Whether an individual who is neither the child\u2019s biological father nor a statutorily presumed father but who has nonetheless demonstrated a strong commitment to parenting the child has a constitutional right to reunification services even though the Legislature has declined to provide for such services.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Were I to consider that question, however, I would want to address at least the following issues, not all of which are fully discussed in the majority\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">(1) In light of the Legislature\u2019s creation of a <em>statutory </em>category of \u201cpresumed fathers\u201d in Family Code section 7611, subdivision (d) that does not require a direct genetic relationship with the child, what is the significance, if any, of such a relationship to the required <em>constitutional </em>analysis? Is it arbitrary or irrational to provide reunification services to a biological father who has demonstrated his commitment to parenting but has never lived with his child while denying such services to an otherwise similarly situated nonbiological \u201cfather\u201d? In this regard, I would necessarily consider the language from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lehr v. Robertson </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 248, 262 [103 S.Ct. 2985, 2993, 77 L.Ed.2d 614], referred to in the majority\u2019s opinion, that \u201cThe significance of the biological connection is that it offers the natural father an opportunity that no other male possesses to develop a relationship with his offspring.\u201d (See also <em>Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 844 [\u201ca biological father has a constitutionally cognizable opportunity interest in developing a relationship with his child\u201d].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">(2) The statutory scheme considered constitutionally impermissible in <em>Kelsey S. </em>was one that differentiated between the rights of a child\u2019s biological <em>father </em>and his or her biological <em>mother </em>regarding termination of parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>rights. <em>(Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 849 [the statutory scheme at issue \u201cviolates the federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process for unwed fathers <em>to the extent that </em>the statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child\u2019s biological father from becoming a presumed father and thereby allowing the state to terminate his parental rights on nothing more than a showing of the child\u2019s best interest\u201d].) Even assuming an \u201cequitable father\u201d has some cognizable constitutional interest in developing a relationship with the child (cf. <em>Smith v. Organization of Foster Families </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 816, 846 [97 S.Ct. 2094, 2110-2111, 53 L.Ed.2d 14] [recognizing foster parent has a limited constitutional interest in his or her relationship with a foster child]), how does <em>Kelsey S.\u2019s </em>finding of invidious discrimination between the rights of a biological father and those of a biological mother affect the definition, extent and limits of the \u201cequitable father\u2019s\u201d rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">(3) If the conditions for protection under <em>Kelsey S. </em>do not depend on a direct genetic relationship, is there any more justification for them to depend on the man\u2019s \u201copenly holding] out the child as his <em>natural </em>child,\u201d rather than simply recognizing the child openly as his \u201cdaughter\u201d or \u201cson\u201d? If the answer to that question is \u201cno,\u201d then does the constitutional reach of <em>Kelsey S. </em>inevitably extend to stepparents, de facto parents<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and other nongenetically related individuals (e.g., foster parents) who want to parent the child? Is it within our purview to so expand the scope of mandatory reunification services, or is that a matter for the Legislature?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">I recognize, as does the majority, that the constitutional issue raised by J.R. is of great significance to possibly hundreds, if not thousands, of men actively carrying out parental responsibilities. Nonetheless, I feel constrained to wait for what I consider a factually appropriate case before offering my own views as to the proper resolution of these questions. (Cf. <em>In re Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 451 [deferring decision whether <em>Kelsey S. </em>should be extended to dependency proceedings because father failed to satisfy <em>Kelsey S. </em>criteria].)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 27, 2002, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-9\">This issue is currently pending before our Supreme Court in <em>In re Nicholas H. </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 86 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 126], review granted November 14, 2001, S100490.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-10\">The majority holds in part III, as did Division Six of our court in <em>In re Julia U. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 532 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 920], that a <em>Kelsey S. </em>father has a constitutional right to reunification services. Subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pages 447-451, which considered but did not decide that issue, the Legislature amended Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.5, subdivision (a), to authorize the juvenile court to provide reunification services for a biological father who is not a statutorily presumed father, including a <em>Kelsey S. </em>father, \u201cif the court determines the services will benefit the child.\u201d (Stats. 1997, ch. 793, \u00a7 17.) For the reasons discussed in the text, I do not believe this is an appropriate case in which to address whether the Legislature\u2019s distinction between a statutorily presumed father\u2019s unconditional right to services (subject to exceptions listed in Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, section 361.5, subd. (b)) and a <em>Kelsey S. </em>father\u2019s right to request such services in the best interests of the child offends either the federal or state Constitutions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b655-9\">The <em>Kelsey S./In re Zacharia D. </em>requirement that the father promptly come forward in dependency proceedings and J.R.\u2019s failure to do so were expressly argued by counsel for Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) at the initial hearing before the referee as a ground for denying reunification services. Judge Nash, who heard the matter de novo following the grant of the rehearing petition, read the transcript of the prior hearing and took judicial notice of its contents. In addition, Jerry\u2019s counsel urged at the de novo hearing that the court order family reunification services under an expanded application of <em>Kelsey S.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b656-11\">Even if such an \u201cequitable father\u201d has no constitutional right to reunification services, he may nonetheless have a constitutionally cognizable interest sufficient to require notice of the dependency proceedings and the right to be represented and to present evidence at hearings at which the status of the dependent child is at issue. (Compare Cal.
