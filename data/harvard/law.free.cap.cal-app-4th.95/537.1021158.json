Ross appeals from an order of dismissal after the trial court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of Universal Studios Credit Union on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction. Ross\u2019s complaint alleged causes of action for malicious prosecution and abuse of process based on Universal\u2019s filing a complaint in the United States Bankruptcy Court to bar Ross\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy. Because Ross\u2019s claims arise from a federal bankruptcy proceeding, federal law preempts them. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">Factual and Procedural Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">For the purpose of determining the merits of a demurrer, the material facts alleged in the complaint are deemed admitted. <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241, 41 A.L.R.3d 1187].)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Ross alleged that on May 3, 1994, Universal had a judgment entered in its favor and against him for money due on a note. In September 1994, Ross filed for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. Universal filed a complaint in the bankruptcy proceedings requesting a determination that its 1994 judgment against Ross be declared nondischargeable pursuant to 11 United States Code section 523(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Universal\u2019s complaint was tried in 1996. The bankruptcy court granted judgment in favor of Ross and declined to declare Universal\u2019s claim nondischargeable. Universal appealed to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and the United States Court of Appeal, Ninth Circuit, failing in both appeals to obtain a reversal of the bankruptcy court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Ross filed the present action in the state court against Universal alleging causes of action for malicious prosecution and abuse of process predicated on the final judgment of the bankruptcy court declaring that Universal\u2019s judgment is dischargeable. The complaint also includes the requisite allegations of malice and lack of probable cause and abuse of the \u201cprocesses of the Bankruptcy Court, Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and Ninth Circuit.\u201d Universal filed a demurrer on the grounds that the court has no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the cause of action and \u201cThe bankruptcy court has exclusive jurisdiction of the case.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (a).) The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and granted Universal\u2019s oral motion to dismiss. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">As Ross candidly admits, the present matter is on all fours with <em>Pauletto </em>v. <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 597 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 334]. In <em>Pauletto, </em>the appellants filed voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court. Their sureties filed an adversary proceeding pursuant to section 523(a)(2) for a determination that the Paulettos\u2019 $5 million indebtedness to them was not dischargeable. The bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of the Paulettos, declaring the debt was dischargeable. Thereafter, the Paulettos filed an action in the state court for malicious prosecution and abuse of process against their sureties and their attorneys based on the favorable determination they obtained in the bankruptcy court. The defendants demurred on the grounds that the superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Paulettos\u2019 causes of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>because federal bankruptcy law preempts them. The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend. The Court of Appeal affirmed in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">\u201cApplying the reasoning of <em>Gonzales </em>[v. <em>Parks </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 830 F.2d 1033, 1035], this court in <em>Gene R. Smith Corp. </em>v. <em>Terry\u2019s Tractor, Inc. </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 951, 952-953 [257 Cal.Rptr. 598], held that federal law preempted a debtor\u2019s state court action for abuse of process and malicious prosecution based on the creditor-defendants\u2019 allegedly malicious prosecution of an involuntary bankruptcy petition. The court in <em>Gene R. Smith Corp. </em>noted that section 303(i) \u2018permits the bankruptcy court on dismissal of a petition to award a debtor costs, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and any damages proximately caused by the taking of the debtor\u2019s property. If the involuntary petition is filed in bad faith the bankruptcy court has the additional power to award damages proximately caused by such filing and punitive damages, [\u00b6] This provision reflects Congress\u2019s intent that the case-by-case development of law relating to \u201cbad faith\u201d in this context should be accomplished in federal courts and not in state courts. The parties make no effort to distinguish the difference, if any, between conduct constituting \u201cbad faith\u201d and \u201cmalicious prosecution\u201d treating both as virtually identical. On that assumption, it would indeed be anomalous and, to say the least, inconsistent with this legislative intent for state courts to develop a different, more liberal definition of \u201cbad faith\u201d for malicious prosecution purposes than that developed in the federal system. Different standards defining identical conduct adds an unnecessary and confusing component to the uniform law to be applied in bankruptcy proceedings. The additional risk that substantial damage awards in state courts would create a material disincentive to those seeking to use the bankruptcy laws only exacerbates the problem. The determination of damages in state courts should not determine the potential cost of entry into the federal bankruptcy system.\u2019 <em>(Gene R. Smith Corp., supra, </em>at pp. 954-955.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\u201cIn <em>Idell </em>v. <em>Goodman </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 262, 265-266 [273 Cal.Rptr. 605], the plaintiff filed a voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding. After the plaintiff\u2019s creditors brought an unsuccessful adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court under section 727(a), alleging the plaintiff\u2019s debts should not be discharged, the plaintiff sued defendants in state court for malicious prosecution. <em>(Idell, supra, </em>at pp. 265-266.) One of the defendants demurred to the complaint on the grounds (1) a malicious prosecution claim cannot be based on a section 727 adversary proceeding because the proceeding is purely defensive and (2) the plaintiff\u2019s claim was preempted by federal bankruptcy law. The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on the ground a section 727 proceeding is defensive in nature and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>therefore cannot form the basis for an action for malicious prosecution. <em>(Idell, supra, </em>at p. 268.) The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment on both grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-4\">\u201cRegarding federal preemption, <em>Idell </em>concluded that <em>Gene R. Smith Corp.'s </em>reasoning applies equally where \u2018a debtor who has filed a bankruptcy petition claims that his or her creditors improperly objected to a discharge of the debtor\u2019s fiscal obligations.\u2019 <em>(Idell </em>v. <em>Goodman, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 270.) <em>Idell </em>noted that although Congress has not provided a specific statutory remedy for the bad faith filing of a section 727 adversary proceeding, a federal remedy for such a bad faith filing is available in the form of sanctions under the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, rule 9011 (11 U.S.C.) and title 28 of the United States Code, section 1927. <em>(Idell, supra, </em>at p. 270.) Thus, <em>Idell </em>concluded the malicious prosecution action was preempted by federal law because \u2018. . . the filing of a section 727 adversary proceeding to block the discharge of debts in bankruptcy is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts, and because sanctions are available to debtors when section 727 proceedings are filed in bad faith . . . .\u2019 <em>(Idell, supra, </em>at p. 271.) <em>Idell </em>added: \u2018In this respect, the reasoning of <em>Gonzales </em>bears repeating. The existence of federal sanctions for the filing of frivolous and malicious bankruptcy pleadings must be read as an implicit rejection of state court remedies. The mere possibility of being sued in tort in state court, with the potential for substantial damage awards, could deter persons from exercising their rights in bankruptcy. Thus, it is for Congress and the federal courts, not state courts, to decide what incentives and penalties shall be utilized in the bankruptcy process.\u2019 <em>(Ibid.)'' (Pauletto v. Reliance Ins. Co., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at pp. 601-602, fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">There is simply no doubt that federal bankruptcy law preempts Ross\u2019s claims. In <em>Saks </em>v. <em>Parilla, Hubbard &amp; Militzok </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 565 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 120], an individual was sued in the bankruptcy court by a chapter 11 debtor to recover a claim for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. The individual prevailed and then sued the debtor, its general partners and their attorneys for malicious prosecution and abuse process in state court. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Affirming, the Court of Appeal drove home the point that malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims premised on a prior bankruptcy proceeding are preempted by federal bankruptcy law. \u201cThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals spoke to the issue again in <em>MSR Exploration, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Meridian Oil, Inc. </em>[(9th Cir. 1996)] 74 F.3d 910. The debtor\u2019s state tort cause of action for malicious prosecution was asserted in the federal district court, based on the creditor\u2019s disallowed objections in a bankruptcy proceeding. The district court found it lacked jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>hear the matter. Affirming, the reviewing court held, \u2018MSR\u2019s malicious prosecution action against [the creditors] is completely preempted by the structure and purpose of the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, MSR\u2019s purported action must, in fact, be a federal claim. That claim, however should have been brought in the bankruptcy court itself, and not as a separate action in the district court.\u2019 [\u00b6] Explaining that the \u2018major issue in this case is <em>whether state malicious prosecution actions for events taking place within the bankruptcy court proceedings are completely preempted by federal law,\u2019\u2019 . . . </em>the court reasoned bankruptcy matters must remain in the federal forum for several reasons: (1) Congress \u2018plac[ed] bankruptcy jurisdiction exclusively in the district courts as an initial matter\u2019 . . . ; (2) Congress, by enacting the bankruptcy Code, \u2018 create [d] a whole system under federal control . . . designed to bring together and adjust all of the rights and duties of creditors and embarrassed debtors alike\u2019 . . . ; (3) bankruptcy law, \u2018 \u201cintimately connected with the regulation of commerce,\u201d \u2019 requires uniformity; and (4) there are a myriad of remedies within the bankruptcy laws[] designed by Congress \u2018to preclude the misuse of the bankruptcy process.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Saks, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th at p. 570, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Ross contends that <em>Pauletto </em>is \u201csimply wrong.\u201d The premise for this assertion is that Pauletto relied on <em>Idell v. Goodman, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d 262, coupled with the bald assertion that the <em>Idell </em>court\u2019s analysis is \u201cquite weak and not compelling.\u201d It is worth noting that Ross\u2019s criticism of <em>Idell v. Goodman </em>is not shared. In <em>MSR Exploration, Ltd. v. Meridian Oil, Inc., supra, </em>74 F.3d 910, 914, Judge Fernandez, writing for a unanimous panel, included the <em>Idell </em>case among the \u201cpossibilities [that] might gravely affect the already complicated processes of the bankruptcy court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In substance, the preemption of state court claims rests upon the premise that the Bankruptcy Code provides adequate remedies for the resolution of any abuse that may occur in such proceeding and that the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court would otherwise be undercut. This is demonstrated in the context of the complained of acts in the present matter. Ross\u2019s claim turns on the fact that he prevailed against Universal\u2019s complaint for a determination of nondischargeability. It is his contention that he cannot be denied a jury trial and the opportunity to recover damages according to state law. He is wrong. Because his remedy is limited to such satisfaction afforded to him in the bankruptcy court, he is not entitled to a jury. <em>(Gene R. Smith Corp. v. Terry\u2019s Tractor, Inc., supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d 951, 955-956.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ross chose not to invoke the remedies available to him in the bankruptcy court and he may not circumvent them by filing a malicious prosecution action in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The judgment (order of dismissal) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A7q\">Epstein, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter, section and rule references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 United States Code sections 101-1330 and to the Bankruptcy Rules and Official Forms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Ross\u2019s remedies include Federal Rules of Bankruptcy, rule 9011 (11 U.S.C.), which prohibits frivolous and harassing filings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
