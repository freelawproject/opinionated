Code, \u00a7 11351.5) and possession of marijuana for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359). On appeal, he contends there was insufficient evidence to support those convictions. He also complains the court erred in denying, without hearing, the second of his three <em>Marsden </em>motions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44]. Finally, defendant contends the trial court committed various instructional errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">In the published portion of our opinion, we discuss defendant\u2019s claim that CALJIC No. 1.00 improperly instructs a jury \u201cin a way that prohibit[s] jury nullification.\u201d Because jurors are restricted to the determination of factual questions and may not themselves decide what the law is or what it should be, we reject that contention. In the unpublished portion of the opinion we reject defendant\u2019s remaining claims.
