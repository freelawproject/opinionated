On a postjudgment motion, the trial court ruled that (1) plaintiff was entitled to relief from defendants\u2019 requests for admission that were deemed admitted, (2) without the deemed admissions, summary judgment for defendant Allis-Chalmers Corporation Product Liability Trust (Allis Trust) was no longer appropriate, and (3) defendant Siemens Energy &amp; Automation, Inc. (Siemens) remained entitled to summary judgment because it was not a successor in interest of Allis-Chalmers Corporation (Allis-Chalmers). All parties appeal. We conclude plaintiff should be relieved of the admissions, Allis Trust is not entitled to summary judgment, and the summary judgment in favor of Siemens must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"AUy\">I. <em>The Accident and Claims Asserted</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">On March 27, 1996, Norval Fisher was working as a substation maintenance electrician for Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) and investigated a problem with a load tap changer on a type AFR 12,000-volt, 3-phase voltage regulator (AFR Regulator) manufactured in approximately 1966 by Allis-Chalmers. Norval Fisher was fatally injured when hot or burning oil was expelled through the tap load changer\u2019s pressure release valve and struck him while he was standing at the AFR Regulator\u2019s control panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Norval Fisher\u2019s widow, Marianna Fisher (Fisher), sued Allis Trust and Siemens (collectively defendants) alleging a products liability claim on the grounds the AFR Regulator was defective because (1) the pressure release value was positioned in such a manner that oil expelled from the load tap changer compartment would hit individuals standing at the control panel; and (2) the internal components of the load tap changer became pitted, which resulted in the ignition of the oil expelled from the compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">A. <em>Defendants\u2019 Defense on the Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Allis Trust and Siemens defend the action on the basis that the accident was not caused by either a design or manufacturing defect in the AFR Regulator and that the sole cause of the accident that resulted in Mr. Fisher\u2019s death was PG&amp;E\u2019s negligent maintenance, repair and inspection of the AFR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>Regulator. Defendants contend (1) pitting, and the resulting electrical arcing, is a normal consequence of nearly 30 years of use; and (2) PG&amp;E modified the load tap changer compartment by permanently sealing and capping its upper breather opening, thereby preventing the escape of air and gases from the compartment. Defendants contend the ignition of the oil expelled by the compartment was most likely caused by the buildup of combustible gases due to the plugging of the upper breather opening. In addition, Siemens contends it is not a successor in interest of Allis-Chalmers and, therefore, is not liable for claims related to the AFR Regulator.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">B., C. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">II., III.*</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">I., II.*</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">III. <em>Siemens as Successor in Interest of Allis-Chalmers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">Fisher appeals the December 6, 1999, judgment in favor of Siemens and the underlying order granting Siemens\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In ruling on Fisher\u2019s postjudgment motion, the trial court held the judgment in favor of Siemens would not be vacated because it was based on the finding that Siemens was not a successor in interest to Allis-Chalmers and did not rely on the deemed admissions that the trial court set aside. Fisher argues Siemens\u2019s motion for summary judgment was improperly granted because it did not contain a sufficient basis for eliminating any of the five theories of successor in interest liability recognized under California case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">Siemens\u2019s existence as a corporation began on July 14, 1972, when it was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with the name \u201cAllis-Chalmers Electric, Inc.\u201d This corporation was used by Allis-Chalmers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, a German corporation, as the business entity for their joint venture to manufacture and sell certain electrical products in the United States. The joint venture apparently took form in 1977 when the corporation\u2019s name was changed to \u201cSiemens-Allis, Inc.\u201d and a \u201cShareholder Agreement between Allis-Chalmers Corporation and Siemens Aktiengesellschaft establishing Siemens-Allis, Inc.\u201d dated July 10, 1977 (Shareholder Agreement), was signed. The management and ownership of the joint venture was controlled in part by provisions of the Shareholder Agreement concerning corporate governance (article 9) and restrictions on transfers of the stock (article 10). Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Allis-Chalmers became the only two holders of common stock of Siemens-Allis, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The joint venture acquired a business when assets of the Allis-Chalmers Electrical Products Group (EPG) were transferred<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from Allis-Chalmers to Siemen-Allis, Inc., in accordance with a \u201cTransfer Agreement\u201d effective as of January 1, 1978, between Allis-Chalmers and Siemens (Transfer Agreement). As consideration, Allis-Chalmers received 80 shares of common stock of Siemens-Allis, Inc. Siemens Aktiengesellschaft received the right to acquire 20 shares of common stock of Siemens-Allis, Inc. in exchange for cash. Wendell F. Bueche, executive vice-president of the EPG, was asked to become president of the joint venture corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The Transfer Agreement also addressed the extent to which Siemens assumed responsibility for product liability claims arising out of the conduct of the business of the EPG. Specifically, the provisions of subparagraph 2.01C of the Transfer Agreement stated that Siemens shall \u201cassume . . . any and all claims ... or liabilities of any kind or nature now in existence or hereafter arising from or relating to the conduct of the business of the Electrical Products Group by Allis-Chalmers or its Subsidiaries including <em>but not limited to </em>(i) . . . ; (ii) . . . ; (iii) . . . and (iv) . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Subparagraph 2.01C also contained a proviso stating Siemens \u201cwill not be responsible for\u201d specific types of claims or circumstances described in clauses (a) through (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">In January 1986, after the joint venture had operated approximately eight years, a Siemens Aktiengesellschaft entity purchased Allis-Chalmers\u2019s ownership interest in the joint venture corporation. <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. v. Siemens Energy Automation </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1996) 948 F.Supp. 1227, 1229, fn. 3 [relying on a deposition of Linda U. Feuss] <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund v. Siemens).) </em>On January 31, 1986, the name of the joint venture corporation was changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>from \u201cSiemens-Allis, Inc.\u201d to \u201cSiemens Energy &amp; Automation, Inc.\u201d This purchase of the stock owned by Allis-Chalmers occurred about 17 months before Allis-Chalmers and 17 affiliated entities filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 29, 1987. The record on appeal does not reflect the economic impact on Allis-Chalmers of the transfer of the assets of the EPG. Defendants have not shown what consideration Allis-Chalmers received for the stock or the amount of cash generated by the joint venture and paid to Allis-Chalmers from the date of transfer of the assets until the sale of its ownership interest in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">After Allis-Chalmers\u2019s bankruptcy filing, the \u201cFirst Amended and Restated Plan of Reorganization of Allis-Chalmers Corporation,\u201d was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on October 31, 1988, and created the Allis Trust. Although a copy of the confirmed plan is not contained in the record on appeal, the declaration of Margaret B. Bruemmer, trustee of the Allis Trust, stated that the Allis \u201cTrust was created to provide for an orderly disposition of existing and future product liability claims arising out of the operations of Allis-Chalmers.\u201d However, the orderliness of this disposition is subject to question. The court in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund v. Siemens, supra, </em>948 F.Supp. at page 1230 stated, \u201cThe Plan\u2019s treatment of present and future product liability claims left a number of potential issues unresolved.\u201d Whether Fisher\u2019s claim would be affected by any of those potential issues cannot be determined on the record before us. Also, the record does not contain any information regarding how many cents on the dollar, if any, are being paid under the confirmed plan on product liability claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">In support of its motion for summary judgment, Siemens claims it \u201cdid not use or exploit the name \u2018Allis-Chalmers\u2019 in connection with its products.\u201d Fisher asserts the joint venture corporation exploited the name \u201cAllis\u201d at least until its name was changed from \u201cSiemens-Allis, Inc.\u201d to \u201cSiemens Energy &amp; Automation, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Siemens also asserts it did not continue the Allis-Chalmers product Une of type AFR Regulators and that Allis-Chalmers discontinued this specific product line six years prior to the transfer of the EPG assets to Siemens. In contrast, the declaration of Gary Barton, a maintenance supervisor with PG&amp;E, states \u201cRegulators of the same type as this regulator are currently being manufactured by Siemens and are virtually identical except for some minor items unrelated to [the] facts and circumstances surrounding this accident.\u201d The Barton declaration also asserts Siemens has continued to use the design of the AFR Regulator.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>B. <em>Potential Successor in Interest Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">The general rule of successor nonliability provides that where a corporation purchases, or otherwise acquires by transfer, the assets of another corporation, the acquiring corporation does not assume the selling corporation\u2019s debts and liabilities. <em>(Ray v. Alad Corp. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 22, 28 [136 Cal.Rptr. 574, 560 P.2d 3] <em>(Ray v. Alad).) </em>This general rule does not apply if \u201c(1) there is an express or implied agreement of assumption, (2) the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the two corporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller, or (4) the transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the seller\u2019s debts.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>A fifth exception to the general rule of successor nonliability was created by the Supreme Court in <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Alad, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 22, and has become known as the \u201cproduct line successor\u201d rule because, in certain limited situations, a person injured by the predecessor\u2019s product is given a remedy against the successor corporation. (See <em>Chaknova v. Wilbur-Ellis Co. </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 962, 969 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 871].)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">To establish that it is entitled to summary judgment, Siemens must show the exceptions that create successor liability do not apply in this case. Those issues are \u201cextremely fact sensitive.\u201d (O\u2019Neill, <em>Advanced Issues in Strategic Alliances </em>(2000) 1193 PLI/Corp. 351, 391 [discusses the joint venture\u2019s liability for venturer A\u2019s obligations prior to the joint venture\u2019s acquisition of venturer A\u2019s business].) Eliminating the exceptions requires disproving at least one element of each exception or showing that at least one such element cannot be established. (See <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 95, 100 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 820].)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">1. <em>Siemens\u2019s agreement to assume Allis-Chalmers\u2019s tort liabilities</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">There is no legitimate dispute that Siemens agreed to assume some of the product liability claims against Allis-Chalmers arising from the business of the EPG. In this case, the issue is whether the contractual assumption includes Fisher\u2019s product liability claims. The extent of Siemens\u2019s contractual assumption raises questions involving the interpretation of the Transfer Agreement. These questions are not unique because the interpretation of the Transfer Agreement as it relates to product liability claims was addressed in a published decision of the United States District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>Court for the Southern District of New York.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund v. Siemens, supra, </em>948 F.Supp. 1227.) Defendants and Fisher failed to cite this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">In <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>v. <em>Siemens, </em>the court held Siemens agreed to be responsible for the settlement, costs and expenses of the two product liability cases arising from the business of the EPG; Siemens\u2019s liability was $1,409,484.56. Also, in <em>FFIC and Allis v. Siemens, </em>Allis-Chalmers and its insurance company sued Siemens to recover costs incurred by them in defending and settling two products liability cases brought against Allis-Chalmers. The claim of the insurance company and Allis-Chalmers was based upon indemnification language contained in both the Transfer Agreement and the Settlement Agreement. The same language in the Transfer Agreement is relevant in this case because Siemens agreed to \u201cassume\u201d the same liabilities that it agreed to indemnify Allis-Chalmers against. <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>v. <em>Siemens, supra, </em>948 F.Supp. at p. 1229 [quoting portions of subpar. 2.01C].).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">The provisions of subparagraph 2.01C of the Transfer Agreement at issue in this case, as well as in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund v. Siemens, </em>provide that Siemens shall \u201cassume . . . any and all claims ... or liabilities of any kind or nature now in existence or hereafter arising from or relating to the conduct of the business of the Electrical Products Group by Allis-Chalmers or its Subsidiaries including <em>but not limited to </em>(i) ... ; (ii) . . . ; (iii) . . . and (iv) . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">The foregoing provisions of subparagraph 2.01C of the Transfer Agreement are not ambiguous on their face. The phrases \u201cany and all\u201d and \u201cof any kind or nature\u201d do not exclude Fisher\u2019s theory of product liability from Siemens\u2019s assumption. Fisher\u2019s lawsuit clearly presents a \u201cclaim.\u201d That claim arose after the January 1, 1978, effective date of the Transfer Agreement and it arose from or related to \u201cthe conduct of the [EPG] by Allis-Chalmers.\u201d Furthermore, a literal interpretation of the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d as it relates to clauses (i) through (iv) means those provisions do not limit the general language of assumption contained in subparagraph 2.01C. Consequently, under a literal reading of subparagraph 2.01C, Siemens agreed to assume the liability represented by the Fisher lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Siemens\u2019s \u201cAmended and Augmented Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>(1) did not address this literal reading of the assumption language in subparagraph 2.01C of the Transfer Agreement; (2) did not attempt to show the assumption language was actually ambiguous; and (3) did not address the next step of setting forth uncontradicted extrinsic evidence showing the \u201cambiguous\u201d assumption language could only be construed to mean the parties did not intend for Siemens to assume the liability represented by the Fisher products liability claim. Therefore, Siemens was not entitled to summary judgment because it failed to establish its agreement to assume liabilities excluded the Fisher products liability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Siemens did address Fisher\u2019s assertion that Siemens contractually assumed the liability represented by her product liability claim in its appellate brief, but gave it short shrift. Siemens\u2019s appellate brief stated, \u201cin her effort to create a triable issue of material fact, Fisher attempts to pick and choose among certain so-called indemnity provisions of the transfer agreement relating to the joint venture.\u201d Siemens\u2019s only argument supporting this statement is that the creation of the Allis Trust \u201cclearly establishes that, in fact, there was no intent by the parties to the joint venture transfer agreement that Siemens Energy would assume any liability for discontinued products, especially those it never manufactured.\u201d Siemens infers this conclusion regarding mutual intent from the assertion that if such an intent existed, there would have been no need to create the Allis Trust. While the creation of the Allis Trust over 10 years after Allis-Chalmers and Siemens signed the Transfer Agreement may shed some light on the mutual intention expressed in the Transfer Agreement, Siemens\u2019s logic is fatally flawed because there is no evidence that the Allis Trust only handled product liability claims related to the business of the EPG. Reported cases show the breadth of claims handled by the Allis Trust goes beyond those claims arising from the conduct of the business of the EPG. (See, e.g., <em>Moore v. Cardinal Packaging Inc. </em>(2000) 136 Ohio App.3d 101, 103, fn. 2 [735 N.E.2d 990, 992] [the Allis Trust is a defendant in litigation related to a forklift manufactured by Allis-Chalmers].) Accordingly, the creation of the Allis Trust had an obvious purpose even if all claims relating to the EPG were assumed by Siemens.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s cursory response to Fisher\u2019s argument that Siemens contractually assumed the liability represented by her claim and the weakness of their inference about the mutual intent of Siemens and Allis-Chalmers drawn from the existence of the Allis Trust only elevates the concern raised by defense counsel\u2019s failure to refer to published cases interpreting subparagraph 2.01C of the Transfer Agreement. Specifically, Siemens did not mention either <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund v. Siemens, supra, </em>948 F.Supp. 1227, or <em>Strausberg v. Siemens Energy &amp; Automation, Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>Oct. 20, 1994, No. 93 Civ. 5734) 1994 WL 577008, <em>affirmed without opinion </em>(2d Cir. 1995) 54 F.3d 765, cert. denied 516 U.S. 964 (Strausberg), to the trial court or in its appellate brief, much less distinguish Fisher\u2019s product liability claim from the three product liability claims those cases held were Siemens\u2019s responsibility. Whether these omissions were an attempt to mislead the trial judge and this court about the meaning of the Transfer Agreement and whether Fisher\u2019s claim is legitimately distinguished from the other three claims are matters we leave to the trial court. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6068, subd. (d); Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 5-200(B); <em>Ainsworth v. State Bar </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1218, 1234 [252 Cal.Rptr. 267, 762 P.2d 431, 86 A.L.R.4th 1053] [attorney\u2019s wrongful acts included intentionally misleading a judicial officer].) We do note that Linda U. Feuss, inside counsel and the secretary of Siemens whose declaration authenticated the Transfer Agreement, knew of the prior litigation because she was involved in it. That she chose not to inform Haight, Brown &amp; Bonesteel, LLP, about the published cases and that defense counsel\u2019s own research failed to uncover the cases, under the current state of the record, strains credulity.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">On remand, the literal reading of the assumption language might prevail. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that Siemens may attack the broad assumption language contained in subparagraph 2.01C of the Transfer Agreement by proving one of the exceptions contained in clauses (a) through (d) of subparagraph 2.01C applies to the facts of this case. Also, Siemens might argue that the language of subparagraph 2.01C is ambiguous and clauses (i) through (iv) were in fact intended to limit the scope of the broad assumption language in a manner relevant to this case. If extrinsic evidence is offered to support this view, its <em>admissibility </em>is an issue to be determined on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Clauses (a) through (d) of subparagraph 2.01C of the Transfer Agreement set forth the specific type of claims or circumstances that Siemens \u201cwill not be responsible for.\u201d These clauses, unlike clauses (i) through (iv), expressly restrict the extent to which, under subparagraph 2.01C, Siemens assumed \u201cany and all claims ... or liabilities of any kind or nature now in existence or hereafter arising from or relating to the conduct of the business of the Electrical Products Group by Allis-Chalmers or its Subsidiaries . . . .\u201d None of these clauses appear to apply based on the record on appeal. Clause (a) excludes certain claims relating to transformers. Because the item of equipment involved in the accident in this case was a regulator, it appears clause (a) does not apply. Clause (b) excludes accidents arising before January 1, 1978, that are covered by insurance. Clause (c) excludes claims arising out of the collections of receivables. Clause (d) excludes amounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>exceeding a formula, one element of which is certain of Siemens\u2019s expenditures within five years of the closing date. The existence of these exceptions show the drafters knew how to exclude matters from the assumption and indemnification language, which strengthens the view that the drafters intended the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d to mean what it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">On remand, to show the assumption language is ambiguous, Siemens must present parol evidence regarding the meaning of the provisions of subparagraph 2.01C of the Transfer Agreement. (See <em>Winet v. Price </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1165-1166 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554] [setting forth the two-step process used to decide whether to <em>admit </em>parol evidence].) Credible parol evidence of the intent of the parties to the Transfer Agreement concerning the scope of Siemens\u2019s assumption of liability may exist within the pleadings filed and the transcripts of depositions taken in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund v. Siemens, supra, </em>948 F.Supp. 1227, and <em>Strausberg, supra, </em>1994 WL 577008, because in those cases Allis Trust and Siemens were in conflict over the meaning of their agreements defining Siemens\u2019s responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">We observe that extrinsic evidence exists that conflicts with the interpretation of the Transfer Agreement Siemens has advocated in this case. For example, in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund v. Siemens, supra, </em>948 F.Supp. at pages 1230 and 1234, Siemens took the position that it agreed to responsibility for class 8 claims, i.e., claims that included \u201cproduct liability claims arising from events or occurrences on or after January 1, 1986.\u201d In its statement of undisputed facts filed in this case, Siemens states claims such as Fisher\u2019s \u201care treated as Class 8 general unsecured creditors in the Allis-Chalmers Bankruptcy.\u201d Accordingly, Siemens\u2019s 1996 statement that it agreed to responsibility for class 8 claims supports the interpretation it assumed the liability represented by Fisher\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Parol evidence of \u201csubsequent acts and conduct of the parties\u201d may be relevant to contract interpretation because it manifests the mutual intention of the parties about how their contract should be applied. (See <em>City of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 473-474 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 329].) Consequently, evidence of other product liability cases in which Siemens did, or did not, assume or indemnify Allis-Chalmers or Allis Trust would be relevant, as well as any oral or written agreement or understanding in the present case regarding defendants\u2019 respective responsibilities for liability to the plaintiff and the costs, expenses and attorney fees related to defense. Some such cases may be included in the list of pending cases Linda Feuss provided to Allis-Chalmers on August 22, 1989. (See <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund v. Siemens, supra, </em>948 F.Supp. at p. 1231.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>In summary, the record currently shows that Siemens agreed to assume the liabilities arising from or relating to the conduct of the business of the EPG and does not show that the claim of Fisher is excluded from the assumption.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">2., 3.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">The December 6, 1999, judgment in favor of Siemens is reversed; the trial court is directed to vacate the December 3, 1999, order granting the motions for summary judgment of defendants and enter a new order denying the motions.
