Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)), one count of forcible lewd conduct on a child (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b)) and one count of attempted forcible rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2), 664). He was committed to state prison for a term of eight years. On appeal, he claims that his due process rights were violated by the trial court\u2019s exclusion of (1) evidence that the victim had made a prior false allegation of molest, (2) testimony by a defense psychiatrist regarding the victim\u2019s credibility and (3) testimony by the victim\u2019s foster mother regarding the victim\u2019s credibility. He also asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of force or duress as to the forcible lewd conduct count or the attempted forcible rape count. In an accompanying petition for writ of habeas corpus, defendant asserts that he is entitled to a new trial because he has recently discovered evidence which undermines the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">We conclude: (1) defendant never proffered evidence that the victim\u2019s prior accusation was false, (2) the proffered expert psychiatric evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>inadmissible and its exclusion did not violate defendant\u2019s due process rights, (3) Welfare and Institutions Code section 827 did not justify exclusion of the foster mother\u2019s testimony but its exclusion was not a violation of defendant\u2019s right to due process and did not prejudice him, (4) there was insufficient evidence of duress and (5) his petition is meritless. We therefore modify and affirm the judgment and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">In early April 1999, defendant and his father drove to Nebraska from California and picked up defendant\u2019s three daughters L., J. and A. and their elder half sister M. from their mother to bring the girls to live with him in Salinas. L. and J. wanted to come live with defendant because they \u201cmissed him.\u201d Defendant had promised to take them to Disneyland and Knott\u2019s Berry Farm. Their half sister M. went to live with a friend initially and then with defendant\u2019s sister. M. did not live with defendant because defendant had molested M. three times between 1988 and 1990. When M.\u2019s mother had confronted defendant about M.\u2019s allegations at the time, defendant said he had molested her because she \u201cwas not his.\u201d Defendant had been prosecuted and convicted of molesting M. When he came to pick up the girls in April 1999, defendant got on his knees, cried and asked their mother to forgive him for molesting M. Defendant claimed that he had \u201cchanged,\u201d that he was attending church and that he \u201cwould never do that again.\u201d Before defendant left Nebraska with the girls, their mother told him that L. had been molested by L.\u2019s uncle in Nebraska. Defendant had no reaction to this disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">L. knew that defendant had molested M., but M. never spoke to L. about the molestations. In April 1999, L. was 12 years old and in special education classes at school. She was \u201ca loner\u201d even amongst her sisters. L. was not as \u201cbright\u201d as her sisters and often had trouble concentrating. The girls arrived in Salinas with defendant on April 10. L. started school in Salinas on Thursday, April 15. Defendant\u2019s sister noticed when defendant brought the girls to visit her that L. \u201cseemed to stay away\u201d from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">L. and her sisters shared a bedroom in defendant\u2019s apartment, but her sisters often slept in defendant\u2019s bedroom.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> L. never slept in defendant\u2019s bedroom. When L. was sleeping in her bedroom alone, defendant would come into the room in the wee hours of the morning when it was very dark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>and molest her. Defendant molested her on five occasions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On at least one occasion defendant turned on the lights before he molested her. On four occasions, defendant sat on the bed, pulled her pants down and rubbed her breasts and vagina underneath her clothes with his hands. This rubbing \u201cfelt uncomfortable\u201d to L. but not painful. L. was \u201ctoo scared to do anything\u201d when defendant was molesting her. She was \u201c[v]ery scared\u201d and \u201cfrightened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Because L. was afraid that defendant \u201cwould come and do something\u201d if she reported the molests, she was reluctant to report them to an adult. On Friday, April 23, 1999, while at school, L. told her two young friends Norma and Veronica that defendant had been molesting her. She told them that defendant was coming into her room about 3:00 a.m. and touching her private parts. Her friends urged her to report the molests, but she told them she was \u201cscared\u201d that defendant \u201cwould do something to her if she would go and tell.\u201d L. told Veronica that she was \u201cscared\u201d of defendant and \u201cscared to go home.\u201d She asked Veronica if she could go live with her. Veronica said she would ask her mom. L. told her friends that she would think over the weekend about reporting the molests.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The fifth and final molestation occurred in the early morning hours on April 25 or 26. On this occasion, he not only rubbed her body but he also put his tongue in her mouth, licked her vagina and tried to put his penis in her vagina.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> L. could feel \u201c[something going in me.\u201d L. \u201cmoved\u201d to prevent defendant\u2019s penis from going inside her. She felt something wet on her sheets. Defendant then apologized and asked her to forgive him. L. said nothing. Afterwards, L. saw \u201c[s]ome liquid stuff\u2019 on her sheets. L. got up and looked at a clock, and it was between 2:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m. When defendant returned from work that morning to take the girls to school as he usually did, he removed the sheets from L.\u2019s bed and washed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">On Monday, April 26, L.\u2019s friends reiterated their concerns and L. reluctantly agreed to report the molests. L. then reported the molests to a school counselor. The police and child protective services were notified, and a police officer and social worker Michelle O\u2019Brien came to the school. L. spoke to both the police officer and O\u2019Brien and told them that defendant had molested her five times in the last two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>The school contacted defendant\u2019s sister, and she came to the school. While defendant\u2019s sister was at the school, defendant paged her. She telephoned him. Defendant told his sister that L. had made a child molest allegation and he believed the molest had happened in Nebraska. Defendant asked his sister to come pick up L.\u2019s sister A. from his apartment because \u201che had things he needed to do.\u201d Defendant\u2019s sister went to his apartment. Defendant was packing L.\u2019s and her sisters\u2019 clothing. It looked as if the clothes had been freshly laundered. Defendant\u2019s sister observed that there was no bedding on the girls\u2019 bed. It was just a bare mattress. Defendant told her that he \u201cthought it was best that they stay with me until things mulled over.\u201d He said that he had gone to pick up L. and J. from school and had been told that J. would not be coming home with him. He was asked to wait a minute, but he left the school immediately. Defendant also told her that \u201cyou know, mom and Mary warned me about this; you know, that this would happen if I brought the girls here. I should have listened to them.\u201d Defendant\u2019s sister took A. and the packed clothing away from defendant\u2019s apartment, and defendant said he would send along the rest of the girls\u2019 possessions later. Defendant told his sister that he \u201cwas just going to sit there and wait.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">L. was transported to the child advocacy center where she was interviewed by Susan Gleason. A transcript of Gleason\u2019s interview with L. was admitted at trial. L. told Gleason that she had previously been molested by her uncle. She said that her uncle had touched her private parts \u201cthe same that my dad did.\u201d It had taken her \u201ca long time\u201d to report the uncle\u2019s molestations, but the molestations ended when she reported them. L. told Gleason that her sisters did not believe her about the Nebraska molestations.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">L. stated that defendant had begun molesting her \u201cin the middle of like last week, I think.\u201d L. also reported that defendant had begun molesting her on the third or fourth day that she attended school after moving in with defendant. He molested her five or six times in a period of less than two weeks. The events did not occur every night. L. said that defendant usually went to work at 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. and then returned to take her and her sisters to school. Defendant\u2019s molestations of her generally occurred before he went to work on mornings when L.\u2019s sisters were sleeping in defendant\u2019s bedroom rather than in the bedroom L. otherwise shared with her sisters. When the first molest occurred, she awoke to find defendant lying or sitting on her bed touching her arms, legs and private parts. L. was \u201creally scared\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to do\u201d so she \u201cjust stayed there\u201d and defendant \u201ckept on touching\u201d her. Defendant had not removed her clothing but instead had pulled up her nightshirt, pulled down her underwear and slipped his hand inside her bra.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>Defendant only spoke to her during one of the molests. He said \u201cDo you still love me\u201d and then repeatedly said \u201cPlease love me\u201d and possibly cried. She initially reported that the most recent event had occurred \u201clast night\u201d when defendant \u201ctried to put his thing in me.\u201d When defendant did this, it hurt L. After he did this, L. noticed a wet substance on her clothing and on the sheets. A little later in the interview, L. stated that this most recent event had not happened \u201cthis morning\u201d but \u201cyesterday morning.\u201d L. told Gleason that she was \u201cvery worried about her own safety in going home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">L. was unwilling to consent to an internal examination of her genitalia by a physician, but she did consent to a \u201cvisual exam\u201d so long as no instruments were placed inside of her. The physician found no physical evidence of molestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">A police officer attempted to make contact with defendant at defendant\u2019s apartment on April 26 and April 27. None of defendant\u2019s vehicles were parked in the vicinity, and the officer was unable to locate defendant. The officer also checked at defendant\u2019s place of employment but had no luck in locating defendant there. The officer \u201cmade out a BOL broadcast\u201d asking other officers to be on the lookout for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Defendant\u2019s sister returned to defendant\u2019s apartment on Saturday, May 1 and retrieved the rest of the girls\u2019 possessions. Defendant was at the apartment at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Defendant was arrested on May 27, 1999 and charged by information with four counts of lewd conduct on a child (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)), one count of forcible lewd conduct on a child (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b)) and one count of attempted forcible rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2), 664).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">The girls stayed with defendant\u2019s sister for three months and then were placed in foster care. L. never spoke to defendant\u2019s sister about the molestations. Defendant\u2019s sister was \u201chaving some difficulty\u201d with L. and \u201cat the back of her mind\u201d was a concern that her son or husband might be accused of sexual misconduct with her. This concern arose from defendant\u2019s sister\u2019s uncertainty about how to help L. deal with \u201csome issues.\u201d She also felt that she could not give the girls \u201cthe love and the attention that they needed.\u201d Defendant\u2019s sister did not believe that L. would \u201c[m]ake things up\u201d or \u201ctry to draw attention\u201d to herself any more than defendant\u2019s sister\u2019s own children.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">In December 1999, the prosecution filed a motion seeking permission to have L. testify by closed circuit television. Because this motion was based on L.\u2019s psychiatric condition, L.\u2019s medical and psychiatric records were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>released to the defense. In January 2000, defendant waived his right to a jury trial in exchange for an agreement that, if convicted, he would be sentenced to no more than eight years in state prison. The court trial was scheduled for February 7, 2000. The prosecutor made an in limine motion to exclude possible defense evidence under Evidence Code section 352 that it argued might be used as part of an \u201cattempt to \u2018trash\u2019 \u201d L. The prosecutor also sought exclusion of any evidence of L.\u2019s \u201csexual acting out\u201d under Evidence Code sections 352, 765, subdivision (b) and 782. In addition, an in limine ruling was requested by the prosecutor on the admissibility of evidence of L.\u2019s \u201cpsychological disorder\u201d of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as \u201ccorroboration\u201d of the molestations. During discussion of the prosecution\u2019s in limine motions, defendant\u2019s trial counsel disavowed any intent to introduce evidence of L.\u2019s \u201csexual conduct\u201d unless it was relevant to a social worker\u2019s opinion. He also stated that he did not intend to cross-examine L. about her prior allegation of molest against her uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Defendant\u2019s sister testified at trial that defendant had molested her from when she was five years old until she was 11 or 12 years old. These molestations occurred about three times a week. Most of these molests involved defendant touching his sister\u2019s private parts and masturbating himself. On at least one occasion, he orally copulated her. She had not disclosed these molests to her mother until she was 14 years old. Defendant\u2019s sister also testified that she had seen defendant molesting two of his cousins.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel was allowed to question J. at trial about J.\u2019s opinion of L.\u2019s truthfulness. J. testified \u201cI think she was telling the truth\u201d about being molested by defendant. J. admitted that she had not believed L. about the Nebraska molestations because \u201cshe made up a lot of stories\u201d which \u201ckind of made me not believe her.\u201d On redirect, J. clarified that L. had told her of the Nebraska molestations in \u201cdifferent pieces\u201d rather than telling her \u201cthe whole thing at once\u201d which caused J. to disbelieve L. regarding those molestations. J. no longer disbelieved L. about the Nebraska molestations.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Notwithstanding his earlier disavowal, shortly before the prosecution rested, defendant\u2019s trial counsel filed a motion seeking admission of evidence of L.\u2019s \u201csexual conduct\u201d and asserting that such evidence would be relevant to L.\u2019s credibility. This motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Defendant testified on his own behalf at trial and presented the testimony of his mother and the two cousins his sister had testified he had molested. His two cousins denied that he had molested them. His mother testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>she had spoken with L. by telephone on the morning of Saturday, April 24, and L. said she was fine and wanted to stay with defendant even though her sisters wanted to go back to their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Defendant testified on direct examination that L.\u2019s mother had told him of the Nebraska molestation a month or two before he picked up the girls in April 1999. He admitted that the girls slept in his room on two to four occasions during the first week they lived with him, but he claimed that L. was one of those sleeping in his room on some of those occasions and that this activity ended after the first week, when he installed a lock on his bedroom door and told the girls to sleep in their own room. Defendant also testified that his girlfriend Lola Lujan,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> whom he considered his wife, had lived with him before he went to retrieve the girls, but he told Lujan she would have to move out if she was going to continue to use drugs. She moved out before the girls arrived, but she visited defendant a couple of days after the girls arrived. Defendant claimed that Lujan returned to his apartment on the evening of Sunday, April 25 and spent the night with him in his bedroom that night. A few days later, Lujan returned to live with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Defendant categorically denied molesting L. He asserted that on April 26, when he went to pick up L. and J. from school, he was told by someone at the school \u201cthat there was some allegations made and something to do with CPS.\u201d No additional information was provided, and he left and went back to his apartment with A. He claimed that he had only learned that L. had accused him of molesting her when his sister called him back in response to his page. It was only after she disclosed that information that he asked her to come pick up A.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Defendant admitted that he had done some laundry on the morning of April 26, but he denied having removed any bedding from any beds or washing any bedding. He claimed that the girls\u2019 bed still had its bedding on April 26. Defendant also denied fleeing or secreting himself, and maintained that he was either at his apartment or out working the rest of the day on April 26 and on the following days.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">On cross-examination, defendant said that he had not learned that L. had accused him of molesting her until his sister arrived at his apartment to pick up A. He then changed his answer and said his sister might have mentioned it on the telephone but he could not recall. Defendant conceded that <em>he </em>\u201cmight have\u201d told his sister that L. had reported a molest at school that had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>actually occurred in Nebraska. He also testified that he had not learned the source of the allegations while he was at the school waiting for L. and J. but only that J. did not want to come home with him. Instead, he <em>assumed </em>it was L. making the allegations because of his knowledge of the Nebraska molestation allegations she had made. He also assumed that the molestation she was reporting was the Nebraska molestation by her uncle. He claimed that he did not learn that L. was accusing <em>him </em>of molesting her until he talked to his mother <em>after his sister left with </em>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Defendant testified that he had never known L. to be dishonest in the past, and he believed her accusation regarding her uncle. He could not come up with any reason why L. would falsely accuse him of molesting her other than his speculation that his failure to speedily provide a dog for the girls had disappointed them. However, the failed attempt to get a dog happened on the weekend <em>after </em>L. reported the molestations to her two young friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Defendant admitted that he had molested his sister, but he claimed that the molestations involved only fondling and ended when he was 12 years old and she was 4 years old. He denied molesting M., but he admitted that he had been convicted of molesting M. Defendant also admitted that he had lied under penalty of perjury in various documents by stating that Lujan was his wife and by claiming that he was supporting the girls after they had gone to live with his sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">On redirect, defendant claimed that he thought L. was dishonest because her mother had told him that she was rebellious and did not like school and her sisters had told him that L. talked back and caused problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">The court found all of the counts and allegations true, and it made an extensive statement of its findings and reasoning. \u201cThis case, like many others with similar allegations, comes down to a question of assessing the credibility of the complaining witness, L[.j, against the credibility of, in this case, the defendant, who testified, and all the other defense evidence that was offered. [\u00b6]In examining L[.]\u2019s credibility, her demeanor as she testified was, in my view, appropriate. [\u00b6] Her attitude towards the action was\u2014 towards the lawsuit was appropriate. She was serious. It was clear to me that she understood the importance of the proceedings and she understood the oath that she had taken to tell the truth. [\u00b6] In looking at her capacity to perceive or to communicate or to recollect, her capacity to perceive events, in my view, was not impaired. And I\u2019m saying this, recognizing that she is a special education student, that she clearly was somewhat afraid of simply being in the courtroom and testifying.\u201d The court noted that L. had an \u201cimperfect ability to communicate\u201d but concluded that she was able to distinguish fact from fantasy.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>\u201cIn reviewing her credibility I keep coming back to what, if anything, would have caused her to make a false accusation against her father, what bias might she have had, what motive, particularly, might she have had for falsifying an accusation of this nature. [\u00b6] Based on all the evidence I cannot find that she had any motive to lie.\u201d \u201cThere was no benefit to be gained by L[.] in telling a false story and making up a false accusation that her father molested her. She had gone through part of the process in Nebraska, having made the accusation about her uncle, she was required to go to the hospital and have a physical exam, which she refused. She must have understood the consequences that making an allegation against her father, the same process, or somewhat of the same process, would occur, there would be another medical exam, more unpleasantness. Despite that, she made the disclosures that she did. [\u00b6] She clearly wasn\u2019t making them to gain attention, in my mind.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t appear to me to be exaggerating when she testified in court. Her world crumbled when she made these disclosures. And all of that supports her credibility.\u201d The court found that L.\u2019s testimony was strongly corroborated by (1) the fact that she described defendant apologizing and seeking forgiveness much as he had apologized and sought forgiveness for his molestation of M. and (2) his molestations of his sister and M. Defendant\u2019s lies under penalty of perjury showed that \u201che is not a truthful person, and that he is willing to lie. And I did not believe his testimony in this trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Defendant was committed to state prison for the upper term of eight years on one of the Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a) counts, concurrent upper terms of eight years for each of the remaining Penal Code section 288 counts, including the Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b) count, and a concurrent upper term of four years for the attempted rape count. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Axiv\">I. <em>Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">A. <em>Exclusion of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Defendant asserts that his due process rights were violated by the trial court\u2019s exclusion of (1) evidence that L. had falsely accused her uncle of molesting her, (2) proposed testimony by a defense psychiatrist and (3) proposed testimony by L.\u2019s foster mother regarding L.\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">1. <em>L.\u2019sprior accusation</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0T\">a. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s trial brief and witness list did not include any mention of testimony by the alleged perpetrator of any prior molestation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>L. During in limine discussions, defendant\u2019s trial counsel disavowed any intent to introduce evidence of L.\u2019s \u201csexual conduct\u201d or to cross-examine L. about her prior allegation of molest against her uncle. A Nebraska sheriff\u2019s department report regarding L.\u2019s allegation against her uncle Jaime Murillo, which the prosecutor had provided to the defense, indicated that her uncle had been molesting her for two years at the time she reported his molestations of her. The report also stated that Murillo had admitted to the police that he had fondled L.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">During trial, defendant\u2019s trial counsel disclosed that he had recently received a note from the attorney who had represented Murillo indicating that the case had been dismissed because L. had refused to come to court to testify. This attorney had also told defendant\u2019s trial counsel that the alleged molestation had been a one-time event rather than a two-year-long series of molestations. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel stated that his receipt of this information was \u201clikely\u201d to change his position with regard to the admission of evidence of L.\u2019s sexual conduct under Evidence Code section 782. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel sought a continuance. The prosecutor opposed this request. She argued that defendant\u2019s trial counsel had been well aware of the Nebraska incident long before trial. The court denied the continuance request.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">During his cross-examination of L., defendant\u2019s trial counsel asked her if she had accused someone of molesting her in Nebraska \u201ctwo years ago.\u201d L. responded \u201cYes,\u201d and the prosecutor objected on the ground that this questioning was beyond the scope of direct and improper because there had been no motion under Evidence Code section 782. The court overruled the objections. L. then testified that the person she had accused was her uncle and that she had never been asked to go to court regarding that accusation and therefore had never \u201crefused\u201d to go to court. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel also elicited L.\u2019s testimony that she was concerned that her sisters would not believe her about defendant\u2019s molestation of her because they had not believed her about her uncle\u2019s molestation of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">On direct examination of L.\u2019s mother, the prosecutor elicited her testimony that she had told defendant, before he left Nebraska with the girls, that L. had been molested by L.\u2019s uncle in Nebraska. L.\u2019s mother also testified that it had taken L. a long time to disclose the molestation by her uncle. On cross-examination, defendant\u2019s trial counsel elicited L.\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony that L. had refused to consent to a medical examination after she reported the molestation by her uncle. L.\u2019s mother also testified on cross-examination that she, not L., had told the Nebraska prosecutor that she did not want the uncle prosecuted. She also testified that L. had disclosed the Nebraska <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>molestation to her sisters first and then to her aunt, Murillo\u2019s wife. L.\u2019s mother learned of the molestations from the aunt, L\u2019s mother\u2019s sister. On redirect, L.\u2019s mother confirmed that she had asked the Nebraska prosecutor to dismiss the charges against the uncle because the aunt had asked her to do so. During his cross-examination of M., defendant\u2019s trial counsel elicited her testimony that L. had reported the Nebraska molestation to her in January 1998. L. told M. that their uncle had molested her early that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">On February 22, shortly before the prosecution rested, defendant\u2019s trial counsel filed a motion under Evidence Code sections 780 and 782 seeking admission of evidence of L.\u2019s \u201csexual conduct\u201d and asserting that this evidence would be relevant to her credibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The motion sought admission of evidence of various incidents of alleged sexual acting out behavior of L. (all supported by a declaration by defendant\u2019s trial counsel on information and belief) and asserted that defense psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Greene would testify essentially that L.\u2019s sexual acting out behavior showed that she had been a victim of long-term sexual abuse that had destroyed her ability to distinguish between fact and fantasy and the past and present making her \u201can unreliable reporter\u201d of sexual abuse. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s declaration in support of the motion also mentioned the Nebraska allegation and stated \u201cI have been informed and therefore believe that Jaime Murillo denied the allegation made by [L.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">In arguing his motion, defendant\u2019s trial counsel first asserted \u201cI don\u2019t wish to retry [the Nebraska case].\u201d However, he stated that he was \u201cwilling\u201d to present testimony by the prosecutor in that case that the case was dismissed because the prosecutor had been told by someone else that L.\u2019s mother and L. \u201cmade it very clear\u201d that they did not want to come to court. Although he initially claimed that it was \u201c[a] very important fact\u201d that the police officers who had spoken with Murillo in Nebraska had not spoken Spanish and Murillo did not speak English, moments later he characterized this fact as \u201ccollateral\u201d and disclaimed any intent to present evidence on that point. \u201c[Murillo] was prepared to come to court and say that he did not make any such confession that night or any other time, and he was never questioned in Spanish by anybody. That gets to be somewhat collateral, and I don\u2019t really wish to try that because that does not\u2014whether he speaks Spanish or not doesn\u2019t go to the truthfulness of this witness. I admit that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to stay away from, retrying that case, but but [sic] I think her sexual acting out behaviors over a period of time [justifies admission of Greene\u2019s testimony].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b998-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>In opposition to the motion, the prosecutor argued that evidence of the Nebraska molestation accusation was not admissible because there was no evidence that L.\u2019s accusation was <em>false. </em>She also argued that the Nebraska accusation was not similar to the allegations against defendant because the allegations against defendant were corroborated. Because the defense claimed that the Nebraska allegation was a false accusation, the court concluded that this evidence was not a proper subject for a motion under Evidence Code section 782. The court determined that the other alleged incidents of sexual acting out behavior were not relevant to L.\u2019s credibility and therefore were not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">In his closing argument, defendant\u2019s trial counsel conceded that the evidence that had been presented showed that the Nebraska allegation had been truthful. He asserted that the Nebraska molestations had caused L. to suffer from PTSD or some more severe mental disorder that caused her to have \u201ca flashback\u201d in Salinas that led her to accuse defendant of molesting her. He suggested that L. was \u201cmixing up the incidences.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel also argued that it did not matter whether the Nebraska allegation was true or false \u201c[b]ecause it works either way.\u201d \u201cIf on the one hand she made a false allegation there, that is an important factor in this Court\u2019s determining her credibility in this instance. If in fact it did happen, with the evidence we have about [PTSD] and her severe depression, it does have an impact on this Court\u2019s determination. However you look at it, whatever happened in Nebraska actually does have something to do with this Court\u2019s determining her credibility. [\u00b6] We may never be able to determine the truth or falsity of the accusation there, even if we had a trial on that issue. And I don\u2019t wish to do that. I don\u2019t wish to go to Nebraska to do it, and I don\u2019t wish those people to come here to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel also argued that L.\u2019s initial reluctance to come to court and testify suggested that she was not telling the truth and was trying to avoid lying under oath. He repeatedly complained about not having been allowed to present further psychiatric evidence. He even asked the court to reopen the case and allow him to present such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">At the sentencing hearing, defendant\u2019s trial counsel complained that he had not been permitted to present evidence at trial that would have shown that the Nebraska allegation was false. He claimed that evidence of the alleged timing of the molestation would have demonstrated that it could not have been committed since the uncle was at work at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">b. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">Defendant\u2019s appellate argument on this issue is specious. He concedes that the court correctly ruled that evidence that L. had made a prior false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>accusation was not admissible under Evidence Code section 782, yet he argues that the trial court abused its discretion in so ruling. He asserts that the trial court prevented him from presenting \u201cadditional evidence\u201d that L. had falsely accused her uncle of molesting her in Nebraska, but he does not explicitly detail the nature of the excluded evidence in his opening brief or cite to any ruling excluding such proffered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">It is only in his reply brief that defendant finally clarifies that he is arguing on appeal that the trial court precluded him from presenting Murillo as a witness to deny L.\u2019s allegations and therefore support a contention that she had made a prior false accusation. The problem with this contention is that defendant never offered such evidence below and repeatedly disclaimed any intent to present evidence regarding the truth of L.\u2019s Nebraska allegation. In his opening brief, defendant states that his trial counsel told the court that \u201cMurillo had denied the allegation and that the defense was willing to subpoena him from out of state if necessary.\u201d Defendant supports this statement with citations to two pages of the reporter\u2019s transcript. These citations provide no support for the statement. On one of the two cited pages, defendant\u2019s trial counsel was responding to the prosecutor\u2019s opposition to his Evidence Code section 782 motion by asserting that L.\u2019s allegations <em>against defendant </em>were uncorroborated. On the other cited page, defendant\u2019s trial counsel was maintaining his willingness to subpoena <em>Miguel Suarez </em>from out of state to testify about an alleged instance of sexual acting out behavior by L. Neither citation demonstrates that defendant\u2019s trial counsel offered to present testimony by Murillo that he had not molested L.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Our own careful examination of the record discloses no indication that defendant\u2019s trial counsel ever actually proffered Murillo\u2019s testimony. More importantly, the record discloses no ruling by the trial court excluding Murillo\u2019s testimony. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel merely stated on information and belief in his declaration in support of his Evidence Code section 782 motion that Murillo had denied the allegation. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel later asserted during an argument to the court that Murillo had been willing to go to court to disclaim his confession. The context of the latter remark made it clear that Murillo had been willing to \u201cgo to court\u201d <em>in Nebraska </em>if the charges against him had not been dismissed, <em>not </em>that Murillo had offered to testify in the proceedings in California against defendant. The fact that this remark was accompanied by defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s repeated statements that he did <em>not </em>wish to \u201ctry\u201d or \u201cretry\u201d the Nebraska allegations was a further indication that this statement by defendant\u2019s trial counsel was not a proffer of Murillo\u2019s testimony. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the trial court treated this statement as proffer of such testimony or that the court at any point made a ruling excluding Murillo\u2019s testimony particularly in light of the trial court\u2019s explicit statement, when it denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>Evidence Code section 782 motion, that \u201c[o]bviously, a false allegation of abuse would be relevant on the issue of credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">As the record does not disclose that defendant\u2019s trial counsel ever sought to introduce Murillo\u2019s testimony or that the trial court excluded it, defendant\u2019s contention lacks merit. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 354.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">2. <em>Testimony of Defense Expert</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Defendant claims that the trial court denied him due process by refusing to admit the proffered testimony of defense expert psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Greene on the subject of L.\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">a. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s pretrial witness list included Dr. Joseph Greene, but provided no explanation as to the subject matter of Greene\u2019s proposed testimony. The prosecution made an in limine motion to exclude Greene\u2019s testimony on the ground that the defense had provided no discovery regarding Greene. At the hearing on the in limine motions on February 9, the prosecutor noted that she \u201cstill\u201d had \u201cno offer of proof on one Doctor Joseph Green[e], and I need discovery.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel agreed to provide the prosecutor with a copy of his \u201cnotes of a discussion I had with Doctor Green[e]. He has not written any reports.\u201d The prosecutor made a written motion seeking an in limine ruling on the admissibility of evidence of L.\u2019s \u201cpsychological disorder\u201d of PTSD as \u201ccorroboration\u201d of the molest. The trial court did not make an in limine ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">On February 10, the prosecution called Dr. Ronald Blustein to testify \u201cout of order.\u201d Blustein testified on direct that he had seen L. a single time on December 1, 1999, for about an hour. At that time, he found her \u201cclinically depressed,\u201d and she reported \u201csuicidal thoughts.\u201d The \u201cprincipal\u201d stress that L. was experiencing was \u201cher coming to court to testify.\u201d The history Blustein was given regarding L. was that she had previously been diagnosed as suffering from PTSD secondary to sexual abuse and dysthymic disorder, \u201ca chronic lower grade depression.\u201d He did not independently verify this history nor did he diagnose L. with PTSD. Blustein ordered L. hospitalized in December 1999 because he believed that there was a significant risk that she would harm herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">On February 14, the court and counsel discussed defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s request for L.\u2019s psychiatric records after December 16, 1999. The prosecutor asserted that these records were not discoverable because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>would only have been pertinent to a motion for L. to testify by closed circuit television, and the prosecution had not proceeded on such a motion. The prosecutor asserted that Blustein\u2019s testimony had been taken \u201cout of order\u201d because he was going to be unavailable thereafter and his testimony needed to be preserved \u201con the narrow issue of the child\u2019s fears and her depression stemming from this molest.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued that the prosecutor had placed L.\u2019s mental condition in issue by presenting Blustein\u2019s testimony. He contended that L.\u2019s mental condition was relevant impeachment evidence regarding (1) L\u2019s competency to testify, (2) \u201cwhether she\u2019s delusional\u201d and (3) L\u2019s reliability. The trial court, while noting that it did not \u201cquite understand the relevance\u201d of Blustein\u2019s testimony, ruled that \u201cthe door has been opened\u201d and defendant\u2019s trial counsel could review L.\u2019s psychiatric records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">When L. testified at trial, she had noticeable difficulties. The court noted that there were longer and longer pauses between her answers as her testimony wore on. She often testified that she could not remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">In the course of defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of L.\u2019s mother, he attempted to inquire about whether L. had been a discipline problem at school. Relevance objections were sustained to these questions, and defendant\u2019s trial counsel asked to make an offer of proof. His offer of proof was that the symptoms that had been identified as arising from PTSD actually were not caused by PTSD but by something else that predated the alleged molestations and was \u201cdirectly related\u201d to L.\u2019s \u201creliability to recall events.\u201d He asserted that he would present testimony from \u201ca doctor\u201d that L. was not suffering from PTSD but instead responding to various \u201cstressors\u201d in her home environment. The trial court reiterated that it had found Blustein\u2019s testimony \u201cof marginal relevance,\u201d and it would \u201csustain a 352 objection to delving into every possible reason for either the post traumatic stress disorder diagnosis or the depression diagnosis that was made.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel moved on to other inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">The prosecution subsequently moved to strike Blustein\u2019s testimony on the ground that it was irrelevant because it would only have been relevant to a motion for L. to testify by closed circuit television. In its motion to strike, the prosecution disavowed any intent to present testimony about PTSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">On February 17, during defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of M., he inquired whether L. had recently spoken to M. of suicide. The prosecutor\u2019s objections on relevance grounds were overruled. The court noted that the prosecutor had a motion pending to strike Blustein\u2019s testimony, but that L.\u2019s state of mind had been addressed at trial and could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>relevant to her credibility. A little later, defendant\u2019s trial counsel noted that he had \u201ca good number of other questions having to with [L.\u2019s] mental state.\u201d He asked the court if it was the court\u2019s position that L.\u2019s mental state as it bore on her credibility \u201cis an area that I cannot go into?\u201d The court stated that \u201cthe victim\u2019s state of mind is certainly relevant as to her credibility at the time she disclosed or made a report of molestation, at and about that time. . . . and I would include the time leading up to the report. ... I don\u2019t feel that her state of mind in December, six months later, has relevance. So I will limit your questioning to the month of April.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued that evidence of L.\u2019s state of mind at other times was relevant because \u201cthe entire disease or abnormality can not be diagnosed\u201d in the absence of such evidence, and such evidence was relevant to L.\u2019s credibility regarding the event in April. The prosecution again disclaimed any intent to present evidence that L. suffered from PTSD and argued that Blustein had not presented such evidence but simply referred to someone else\u2019s past diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued that he could present evidence that L.\u2019s \u201cacting out behavior\u201d could not have resulted from the alleged April molestations but instead had to have arisen from some earlier \u201cmuch longer term type of abuse or stimuli.\u201d He argued that such prior abuse would make L.\u2019s \u201creliability . . . highly questionable in that that person would not be able to differentiate between incidents.\u201d He asserted that evidence of her post-April state of mind would show that \u201cwhatever occurred and is causing this, occurred long before anything [defendant] is alleged to have done.\u201d The court asked for an offer of proof regarding some pre-April event \u201cthat is causing this behavior to occur.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s only response was that \u201cwe have incidents of some fairly severe abhorrent behavior, which indicates this was something likely going on long before [defendant] allegedly did anything, such that it would put in great question whether or not the report of this incident was a correct report or not.\u201d The court found no basis to disturb its ruling. \u201cThe ruling stands. It strikes me as speculative, at best.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel made no attempt to make a further offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">On February 22, the court considered the prosecution\u2019s motion to strike Blustein\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor argued that Blustein\u2019s testimony \u201cwas only relevant\u201d if the prosecution had decided to proceed on its motion for L. to testify by closed circuit television. Since that had not been necessary, Blustein\u2019s testimony should be stricken because it was \u201cnot relevant to any material issue on the case.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued that L.\u2019s mental state was in issue and therefore Blustein\u2019s relevant testimony on that issue should not be stricken. He argued that L.\u2019s reasons for initially being unwilling to testify in court were relevant to her credibility. He specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>maintained that Blustein\u2019s testimony \u201cwill become even more relevant when we call to the witness stand Doctor Green[e] to testify about her mental condition in his opinion.\u201d He noted that Greene still had not provided him with a report. This argument led to a discussion of Greene\u2019s potential testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel asserted that Greene would testify that L.\u2019s \u201csexual acting out behavior ... is of such magnitude that it must, in his expertise, [be] related to a long series of events that must, by reason of the records [of this behavior], precede the April 1999 incident here. How long it precedes, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s prepared to testify to . . . .\u201d He claimed that Greene would relate this \u201cto his feeling of her reliability as a witness.\u201d Greene would testify that \u201cthe records show it is not [PTSD] but a much longer term series of stressors of a sexual nature that have caused the present condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The court repeated that it found Blustein\u2019s testimony about L.\u2019s depression in December 1999 to be \u201cof minimal, if any, relevance\u201d and it discounted his mention of PTSD as merely repeating someone else\u2019s diagnosis. \u201cA lot of Doctor Blustein\u2019s opinions about [PTSD] were elicited, but I really don\u2019t find them to have any weight in this individual case, because he didn\u2019t examine L[.] earlier .... There were some remarks or some answers that Doctor Blustein gave in his cross-examination that may have some relevance as to L[.]\u2019s credibility, and that\u2019s the bottom line here. It seems to be overlooked that the issue isn\u2019t her state of mind. In my view, the issue is her credibility now when she\u2019s testified, as well as back when she made the original report of the molest.\u201d The court refused to strike Blustein\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s February 22 motion to admit evidence of L.\u2019s sexual acting out behavior under Evidence Code sections 780 and 782 asserted on information and belief that Greene would testify that (1) this degree of sexual acting out behavior could not have been caused by defendant\u2019s molestation of L., (2) this sexual acting out behavior must have been caused by \u201ctrauma of a sexual nature occurring over a long period of time,\u201d (3) such long term trauma \u201cwould destroy [L.\u2019s] ability to distinguish between her sexual wishes and fears and her ability to accurately assess sexual issues\u201d and (4) long term sexual trauma causing such sexual acting out behavior makes a child \u201can unreliable reporter of sexual events because they tend to confuse the past with the present and fact with fantasy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Late in the afternoon on February 22, defendant\u2019s trial counsel finally provided the prosecutor with a report from Greene. This report stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>Greene would not only give the testimony set forth in defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s declaration in support of the motion to admit evidence of sexual acting out behavior but would also testify that (1) L. did not suffer from PTSD, (2) L.\u2019s testimony at trial was confusing and contradictory, (3) L.\u2019s failure to discuss the alleged molestations with more people was inconsistent with the truth of her allegations and (4) although L. may have convinced herself that the molestations occurred, she was not a reliable witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The prosecutor objected to Greene\u2019s proposed testimony. She claimed Greene\u2019s proposed testimony should be excluded because (1) it was not the proper subject of expert testimony, (2) it could not be used to impeach L.\u2019s testimony and (3) it had such little probative value that its relevance was substantially outweighed by the prejudice and time consumption it would involve and therefore it should be excluded under Evidence Code section 352. She also made a <em>Kelly-Frye </em>objection <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 24 [130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240]; <em>Frye v. United States </em>(D.C. Cir. 1923) 293 Fed. 1013) to Greene\u2019s proposed testimony and claimed that his proposed testimony was just \u201ca back door way of getting information in [sic] that is forbidden under 782.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel premised the admissibility of Greene\u2019s testimony on Evidence Code section 782. The trial court noted the seeming inconsistency between defendant\u2019s assertion that the Nebraska accusation was false and his assertion that Greene would testify that L.\u2019s behavior arose from L. being molested by someone for a long period of time. The court inquired further about the nature of the proposed testimony: \u201cBased on what he reviewed he would have an opinion, I take it and his opinion would be that the testimony of L[.] is unreliable?\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel stated that Greene would testify that he had reviewed the records and a person with L.\u2019s symptoms \u201chas got some very serious emotional problems which may distort their ability to, one, perceive an event. . . and/or, two, to be able to testify accurately today.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued that Greene\u2019s testimony would be \u201cvery relevant for the Court to determine whether a person with the various psychological makeups and conditions that this witness has is believable in this situation. . . . We\u2019re trying to present evidence to the Court which is relevant and meaningful which will help the Court make a determination in this case as to whether or not you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that an offense has occurred.\u201d He repeatedly emphasized that Greene would testify only about hypotheticals based on L.\u2019s records rather than about L. specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">The court first ruled on defendant\u2019s motion under Evidence Code section 782 to admit evidence of L.\u2019s alleged sexual acting out behavior. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>the defense claimed that the Nebraska allegation was a false accusation, the court noted that evidence regarding the Nebraska allegation would not be admissible under Evidence Code section 782. The court found that the proffered evidence of sexual acting out behavior was not relevant to any of the factors under Evidence Code section 780 and therefore was not admissible under Evidence Code section 782. The court also ruled that none of this evidence bore on L.\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The court then considered whether to admit Greene\u2019s proposed testimony, and it decided to exclude Greene\u2019s testimony under Evidence Code section 352. \u201cIn my view, the question is simply whether or not, under 352 analysis, his testimony would be so probative as to outweigh any undue consumption of time, and in attempting to evaluate the probative value of his testimony, it appears to me, based on the offer of proof provided by Mr. Siegel [defendant\u2019s trial counsel], that Doctor Green[e] would be speculating about a long term' molestation. Mr. Siegel has indicated to the Court, I believe in my questions to him yesterday, that he would, in fact, seek to prove that the Nebraska molestation of L[.] by her uncle did not occur and, of course, is seeking to prove that the molestation of L[.] by her father didn\u2019t occur. So Doctor Green[e], as I understand his testimony, would offer an opinion that, in fact, L[.] was the victim of molestation by someone else over a long period of time, and the Court has not heard any evidence that would identify any other possible accused molester; nor is there any such evidence suggested in the offer of proof. It seems to me that Doctor Green[e] would be speculating based on his review of the records of L[.] in this case. [\u00b6] This Court has had the opportunity, of course, to observe her testimony closely, and it seems to me that this Court has the ability to form its own conclusions based on the observations of her testimony along with the other evidence. I cannot find that the probative value of Doctor Green[e]\u2019s proffered testimony is strong. It appears to me to be weak. In this setting, court trials as opposed to a jury trial, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a danger necessarily of confusing issues. I don\u2019t think it could be said that the state as a party would be prejudiced by this testimony, but I am concerned about the undue consumption of time it would take for Doctor Green[e] to testify and then for the [P]eople to rebut or attempt to rebut his testimony. It would require the calling of other numerous witnesses in rebuttal. So based on this weighing of the factors under 352, the Court is going to exclude the testimony of Doctor Green[e].\u201d The court offered to strike Blustein\u2019s testimony if defendant\u2019s trial counsel so wished, but defendant\u2019s trial counsel declined the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">b. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Trial courts have the discretion to exclude evidence pursuant to Evidence Code section 352 \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bittaker </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1046, 1097 [259 Cal.Rptr. 630, 774 P.2d 659]; <em>People v. Bothuel </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 581, 594-595 [252 Cal.Rptr. 596].)  A ruling excluding evidence under Evidence Code section 352 will be overturned on appeal only if the trial court \u201cexercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>(People v. Rodrigues </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 885 P.2d 1].)  The question before us is whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the \u201cweak\u201d probative value of Greene\u2019s proposed testimony was substantially outweighed by the \u201cundue consumption of time it would take for Doctor Green[e] to testify and then for the People to rebut or attempt to rebut his testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Defendant premises his appellate argument on <em>People v. Russel </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 187 [70 Cal.Rptr. 210, 443 P.2d 794]. Prior to <em>Russel, </em>the California Supreme Court had ruled, in the absence of any legislative authority, that a trial court had the discretion to order a psychiatric examination of the complaining witness in a sex offense case if the defendant presented a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d establishing the necessity of such an examination. <em>(Ballard v. Superior Court </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 159, 176 [49 Cal.Rptr. 302, 410 P.2d 838, 18 A.L.R.3d 1416].) Such necessity could only be shown if the allegations had \u201clittle or no corroboration\u201d and the defense asserted that there was a connection between the complaining witness\u2019s \u201cmental or emotional condition\u201d and her veracity. <em>(Ballard, </em>at p. 177.) <em>Ballard </em>recognized that expert psychiatric testimony regarding the mental or emotional condition of a witness was generally inadmissible for impeachment purposes, but it recognized an exception to this rule based on a general distrust of complaining witnesses in sex offense cases. <em>(Ballard, </em>at pp. 171-175.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">In <em>Russel, </em>a judge ordered a psychiatric examination of a complaining witness in a sex offense case, but the trial judge refused, without adequate explanation, to allow the admission of testimony by the psychiatrist who had performed the exam. The California Supreme Court reversed. It concluded that the trial judge had abused his discretion in categorically excluding such evidence. \u201c[I]t must be determined from the offer of proof and, if necessary, from <em>voir dire </em>examination, if the evidence sought to be introduced bears upon the matter at issue, to wit, the <em>credibility </em>of the complaining witness\u2014by showing the effect of a particular mental or emotional condition upon her ability to tell the truth. In addition, the evidence offered must be examined with a view to ensuring that the knowledge which it represents can be effectively communicated to the jury .... Further, the court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>make a determination as to whether the examination which is the basis of the evidence utilized techniques of general scientific acceptance and was sufficiently thorough to facilitate a reliable opinion. Finally, the evidence should be examined with a view to preserving the integrity of the jury as the finder of facts: expert opinion is admitted in this area in order to inform the jury of the effect of a certain medical condition upon the ability of the witness to tell the truth\u2014not in order to decide for the jury whether the witness was or was not telling the truth on a particular occasion. . . . [\u00b6] It is to be emphasized, however, that the considerations above suggested can be undertaken only in the course of a thorough review of the evidence sought to be introduced as it is set forth in the offer of proof. Further, we are of the view that the reasoning underlying the court\u2019s conclusion as to the admission of such evidence should appear to some degree in the record in order that appellate review of that conclusion, which reaches only to abuses of the court\u2019s discretion . . . , may be facilitated.\u201d <em>(People v. Russel, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at pp. 196-197, citations and fn. omitted.) The <em>Russel </em>court opined that \u201cthe legal discretion of the judge should be exercised liberally in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>(Russel, </em>at p. 198.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The distrust of complaining witnesses in sex offense cases that formed the foundation for <em>Ballard </em>and <em>Russel </em>was based on antiquated beliefs that have since been disproved and discarded. Both the Legislature and the California Supreme Court have modernized the law\u2019s treatment of sex offense victims. A trial court\u2019s discretion to order a psychiatric examination of a complaining witness in a sex offense case was eliminated by the Legislature in 1980. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 390, 397 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 839].) Subsequently, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110], the California Supreme Court declared that \u201c[t]he [1980] amendment of section 261, subdivision (2) [deleting the resistance requirement], acknowledges that previous expectational disparities, which singled out the credibility of rape complainants as suspect, have no place in a modem system of jurisprudence.\u201d <em>(Barnes, </em>at p. 302.) More recently, the California Supreme Court has recognized that the 1980 legislative prohibition on psychiatric examinations of complaining witnesses in sex crime cases \u201coverruled\u201d the \u201cline of authority\u201d established by <em>Ballard </em>and <em>Russel. </em>\u201cAs defendant notes, earlier cases indicated a trial court should grant a defense motion for a psychiatric examination of the complaining witness in a sex-crime case where psychiatric evidence appeared necessary to assist the trier of fact in assessing the witness\u2019s <em>credibility. </em>(E.g., <em>People v. Russell[, supra,] 69 </em>Cal.2d 187, 193 . . . ; <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Superior Court[, supra,] </em>64 Cal.2d 159, 171-177 . . . <em>(Ballard) </em>[noting, however, the general rule against impeachment by psychiatric evidence]; <em>People v. Duncan </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 418, 426-427 [171 Cal.Rptr. 406] [finding no abuse of discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>in denial of defense motion].) But the Legislature overruled this line of authority in 1980 by adopting Penal Code section 1112, which forbids courts from ordering psychiatric examinations of victims or complaining witnesses in sex-crime cases in order to assess their credibility.\u201d <em>(People v. Anderson </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 543, 575 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 575, 22 P.3d 347].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Defendant argues in essence that the portion of <em>Russel </em>authorizing the admission of expert psychiatric evidence regarding the credibility of a sex crime victim survived the 1980 legislative change. We cannot agree. As the California Supreme Court recognized in <em>Anderson, </em>the Legislature\u2019s 1980 actions overruled not only <em>Ballard </em>but also <em>Russel. </em>In the absence of <em>Russel, </em>there is no authority for distinguishing between complaining witnesses in sex offense cases and witnesses in other criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Defendant proposed to introduce testimony by a psychiatrist who had never examined L. that L. did not suffer from any mental illness diagnosed by any of the psychiatrists who had actually examined her but from some other unspecified emotional problem that had been caused by unspecified long-term sexual abuse. The defense offered no evidence that L. had been subjected to long-term sexual abuse, but instead asserted that she had not been abused either by defendant or by her uncle in Nebraska. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the proffered evidence was speculative and therefore had little probative value is supported by the record. In light of the fact that the proffered evidence was generally inadmissible, highly disfavored and of little probative value, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the substantial amount of time that introduction of this evidence would entail was unjustified. Nor did the trial court prevent defendant from presenting a defense and thereby deny him due process. \u201cAs a general matter, the \u2018[application of the ordinary rules of evidence . . . does not impermissibly infringe on a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Fudge </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1075, 1102-1103 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 321, 875 P.2d 36].) Greene\u2019s proffered testimony was excluded under the \u201cordinary rules of evidence\u201d and thus did not deny defendant his right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">3. <em>Testimony of L. \u2019s Foster Mother</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMQ\">a. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">A defense investigator interviewed L\u2019s foster mother (whom we will refer to as FM) in February 2000. FM was L.\u2019s foster mother from June through at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>least December 1999.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> FM told the defense investigator that she \u201cwas not able to trust\u201d L. because L. \u201cwas not honest\u201d and \u201ctold a lot of lies.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In his trial brief, defendant\u2019s trial counsel indicated that he intended to present the testimony of FM that L. \u201ccontinually lied and told half truths, untruths and omitted to provide information necessary to effective care of herself by her foster mother.\u201d During in limine discussions, the prosecutor noted that it would object to the admission of any testimony by FM on the ground that FM \u201chad agreed to confidentiality about all aspects of the childrens\u2019 lives and her care for the children.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel asserted that FM would simply be testifying to \u201cher perceptions through various things she\u2019s seen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The department of social services (hereafter the Department) filed a brief objecting to the potential testimony of FM. The Department argued that such testimony could not be received unless there was compliance with Welfare and Institutions Code section 827. The Department acknowledged that there was no authority for the proposition that Welfare and Institutions Code section 827 applied to the proposed testimony of the foster mother, but it asserted that \u201cthe same policy considerations\u201d would support applying the statute to the proposed testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">The trial court addressed this issue in the midst of trial. The Department argued that \u201cinformation in the hands of the foster parent or provided by the foster parent would be protected by 827, which means that the foster parent could not release that information in the form of testimony unless the juvenile court judge says, after an in camera hearing, that it rules that the relevance and pertinence of the information would supersede the child\u2019s right to privacy.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued that the child\u2019s privacy rights had been waived by her complaint and testimony. He also contended that no records were at issue since FM would not be disclosing records but testifying to her perceptions. The trial judge decided to refer the issue to the juvenile court to determine whether FM\u2019s proposed testimony was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">The juvenile court heard this matter on February 23. The juvenile court judge ruled that FM\u2019s proposed testimony was not admissible. The trial court was informed of this ruling, and defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not further pursue the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>b. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Defendant maintains that the trial court prejudicially erred in excluding FM\u2019s proposed testimony. The only basis offered below for exclusion of FM\u2019s proposed testimony was the juvenile court\u2019s ruling under Welfare and Institutions Code section 827 (hereafter section 827). The initial question we must resolve is whether section 827 was even applicable to FM\u2019s proposed testimony. We conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Section 827 restricts those who may \u201cinspect\u201d a \u201cjuvenile case file.\u201d It provides that, \u201c[f]or purposes of this section, a \u2018juvenile case file\u2019 means a petition filed in any juvenile court proceeding, reports of the probation officer, and all other documents filed in that case or made available to the probation officer in making his or her report, or to the judge, referee, or other hearing officer, and thereafter retained by the probation officer, judge, referee, or other hearing officer.\u201d (\u00a7 827, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Subdivision (a)(1) of section 827 sets forth a list of those who are permitted to inspect juvenile case files, but subdivision (a)(3) requires those authorized in subdivision (a)(1) to petition the juvenile court for access to all or a portion of a juvenile <em>dependency </em>case file or to \u201cinformation relating to the contents of\u2019 a juvenile <em>dependency </em>case file. Those authorized in subdivision (a)(1) include \u201c[c]ourt personnel,\u201d \u201c[t]he attorneys for the parties, and judges, referees, other hearing officers, probation officers and law enforcement officers who are actively participating in criminal or juvenile proceedings involving the minor,\u201d the minor\u2019s parents and \u201c[a]ny other person who may be designated by court order of the judge of the juvenile court upon filing a petition.\u201d (\u00a7 827, subd. (a)(1)(A), (D), (E), (M).) Consequently, <em>if the </em>presentation of FM\u2019s proposed testimony amounted to inspection of a \u201cjuvenile [dependency] case file\u201d or \u201cinformation relating to the contents\u201d of a juvenile dependency case file, then the proposed testimony could not be presented without a juvenile court order authorizing its disclosure. The juvenile court may order disclosure of a file or information relating to the contents of a file after a noticed hearing \u201cif disclosure is not detrimental to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of a child.\u201d (\u00a7 827, subd. (a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">FM\u2019s proposed testimony was <em>not </em>a juvenile court petition, probation report or any other document and therefore was not a \u201cjuvenile case file\u201d as that term is defined in section 827. Nor was FM\u2019s proposed testimony \u201cinformation relating to the contents of\u2019 a juvenile case file. FM\u2019s proposed testimony was based on FM\u2019s personal observations acquired from her one-on-one interaction with L. while she served as L.\u2019s foster parent. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>was no indication that FM had had any access to L.\u2019s juvenile dependency case file or that her testimony would be based on any information related to that file. Based solely on the statutory language, which is unambiguous, FM\u2019s proposed testimony would not have amounted to the disclosure of a \u201cjuvenile [dependency] case file\u201d or of \u201cinformation related to the contents of\u2019 a juvenile dependency case file and therefore did not come within section 827, subdivision (a)(3)\u2019s requirement of a court order authorizing disclosure of such a file or information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The Department has filed an amicus curiae brief in which it asserts that section 827 did apply to FM\u2019s proposed testimony. It argues that the \u201cinformation\u201d a foster parent \u201cobtains\u201d concerning a foster child \u201cshould have the same confidentiality protections\u201d as the documents in a juvenile dependency case file and information relating to those documents. The Department acknowledges that no case has yet held that section 827 applies to a foster parent\u2019s testimony about his or her interactions with a foster child. Yet the Department argues that cases holding that child protective services (CPS) records and police records are within the ambit of section 827 support extending section 827 to foster parent observations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">The Department relies on three cases. None of them support the Department\u2019s argument. In <em>Lorenza P. v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 607 [242 Cal.Rptr. 877], a criminal defendant charged with the murder of her daughter subpoenaed CPS documentary \u201crecords\u201d relating to herself, her daughter and her son. At the commencement of its discussion of the appropriate procedures under section 827, the Court of Appeal noted that section 827 applied to \u201cagency records relating to juvenile contacts as well as police reports.\u201d <em>(Lorenza P., </em>at p. 610.) The court did not discuss any issues regarding the scope of section 827, nor did it suggest that section 827 applied to anything other than CPS records and police reports regarding juveniles. In <em>T.N.G. v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 767 [94 Cal.Rptr. 813, 484 P.2d 981], the California Supreme Court held that police and probation department records of detentions of juveniles were juvenile court records within the meaning of section 827 that could not be revealed to \u201cthird parties\u201d without a juvenile court order. <em>(T.N.G., </em>at p. 780.) In <em>Wescott v. County of Yuba </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 103 [163 Cal.Rptr. 385], the court, relying on <em>T.N.G., </em>held that a police report regarding several juveniles who were not detained was subject to section 827 and therefore could not be released in its totality to the parent of one of the juveniles without a juvenile court order. <em>(Wescott, </em>at pp. 105-110.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">None of these cases provide the slightest support for the Department\u2019s position. The mere fact that police records of juvenile detentions and juvenile contacts are considered juvenile court records for purposes of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>827 does not establish or even suggest that the percipient observations of a foster mother are part of a \u201cjuvenile case file\u201d or \u201cinformation related to\u201d such a file within the meaning of section 827. The Department\u2019s desire to expand the scope of section 827 should be addressed to the Legislature since we lack the power to rewrite section 827 to include foster parent observations within its scope. It follows that the trial court erred in referring the issue of the admissibility of the proposed testimony to the juvenile court, and the juvenile court erred in ruling that the proposed testimony could not be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">The Attorney General appears to argue that any error under section 827 is immaterial because the trial court \u201ccould have (and most probably would have)\u201d excluded FM\u2019s proposed testimony under Evidence Code section 352 if it had not referred the issue to the juvenile court. He cites no case authority for the proposition that a trial court\u2019s erroneous <em>nondiscretionary </em>exclusion of evidence may be justified by appellate speculation about whether the court could have, or \u201cprobably would have,\u201d made a <em>discretionary </em>decision to exclude the evidence if a different objection to its admission had been interposed. In any event, the record before us provides no basis for us to infer that the trial court \u201cmost probably would have\u201d excluded this evidence had the prosecution interposed an Evidence Code section 352 objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">Both the Department and the Attorney General concede that this evidence was relevant otherwise admissible evidence if section 827 did not bar its admission. Had an Evidence Code section 352 objection been interposed, the trial court would have been required to admit the evidence unless the probative value of the evidence was \u201csubstantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352.) The Attorney General does not intimate how the admission of this evidence would have unduly consumed time or created a danger of undue prejudice or confusion of the issues. Since there was no jury, we may presume that the Attorney General is not relying on the potential for the trial court to be somehow misled by the admission of evidence regarding the credibility of the complaining witness. As L.\u2019s credibility was central to this case, it also does not appear that the admission of this fairly straightforward testimony would have consumed an <em>undue </em>amount of time or confused the issues. While the relationship between L. and FM might have been prejudiced by FM\u2019s testimony if L. learned of this testimony, the potential for such prejudice did not necessarily substantially outweigh the probative value of evidence of L.\u2019s lack of credibility particularly in light of indications that FM\u2019s foster parent relationship with L. either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>was over or was soon to end and did not appear to be a relationship of trust. We cannot justify the trial court\u2019s nondiscretionary exclusion of FM\u2019s proposed testimony by assuming that it would have made a discretionary decision to exclude it under Evidence Code section 352 where the record before us does not contain a strong basis for excluding this testimony under Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">What remains is for us to determine whether the erroneous exclusion of FM\u2019s proposed testimony merits reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment. Defendant and the Attorney General do not agree on the appropriate standard of review that we should apply to this error. Defendant argues that the exclusion of this evidence requires reversal unless its absence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because its exclusion violated his federal constitutional right to due process by depriving him of the opportunity to \u201cpresent critical evidence in his defense.\u201d He asserts that the prejudice arising from the exclusion of FM\u2019s proposed testimony regarding L.\u2019s credibility was substantial because \u201cthis case rested almost entirely on the relative credibility\u201d of L. and defendant. The Attorney General, on the other hand, maintains that the error is properly reviewed under <em>People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818 [299 P.2d 243] and requires reversal only if it is reasonably probable that the court would have believed defendant rather than L. if only this evidence had been admitted. The Attorney General urges that the excluded evidence was unlikely to influence the trial court\u2019s decision and therefore its erroneous exclusion does not merit reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">\u2022(5) Where a \u201ctrial court\u2019s ruling did not constitute a refusal to allow defendant to present a defense, but merely rejected certain evidence concerning the defense,\u201d the ruling does not constitute a violation of due process and the appropriate standard of review is whether it is reasonably probable that the admission of the evidence would have resulted in a verdict more favorable to defendant. <em>(People v. Bradford </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1229, 1325 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 145, 939 P.2d 259]; <em>People v. Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 836.) Although the trial court\u2019s error did result in the exclusion of evidence that L. repeatedly lied to her foster mother about her homework, fighting at school and being placed on detention at school, we are not convinced that this evidence was \u201ccritical\u201d to defendant\u2019s defense or that its exclusion amounted to the exclusion of a defense rather than evidence concerning a defense. The evidence adduced by the defense at trial included other similar evidence aimed at attacking L.\u2019s credibility. L.\u2019s sister J. testified that she did not initially believe L. about the Nebraska molestation because L. \u201cmade up a lot of stories.\u201d Defendant\u2019s sister, who, like FM, had served as a caretaker for L., testified that she was concerned that L. might falsely accuse her son or husband of sexual molestation. Defendant testified that he believed L. was dishonest because he had been told by L.\u2019s mother that L. was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>rebellious and did not like school and her sisters had told him that L. talked back and caused problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">In the context of this other evidence, FM\u2019s proposed testimony that L. had lied to FM about homework and misbehavior at school was not critical and its erroneous exclusion did not preclude defendant from presenting his defense based on L.\u2019s lack of credibility. Therefore, we are persuaded that the appropriate standard of review is <em>Watson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">This was a court trial in which the court was well aware of FM\u2019s proposed testimony even though it excluded this evidence. The court also made explicit findings regarding L.\u2019s credibility that unambiguously credited her testimony and rejected all of defendant\u2019s attempts to demonstrate that L. was not telling the truth about his molestation of her. The trial court also explicitly rejected defendant\u2019s testimony as not credible. Defendant\u2019s conduct on April 26 provided significant corroboration for L.\u2019s allegations. Defendant\u2019s sister confirmed L.\u2019s report that the bedding had been removed from her bed and laundered after the final molestation. At trial, defendant attempted to explain his actions on April 26 by giving several different stories about how he had learned that L. had accused him of molesting her, but his various explanations were facially inconsistent and ultimately inculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s other attempts at attacking L.\u2019s credibility, was aware of the excluded evidence and found defendant\u2019s testimony not credible and L.\u2019s very credible. Defendant\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony about the bedding and defendant\u2019s inconsistent explanations for his apparent assumption that L. had accused him of molesting her provided corroboration for L.\u2019s allegations. Defendant presented no evidence of any rational motivation for L. to fabricate her allegations. FM\u2019s proposed testimony would only have shown that L. lied under circumstances where her motivation for doing so was obvious. In this context, it is not reasonably probable that the admission of FM\u2019s proposed testimony would have resulted in a verdict more favorable to defendant. Hence, the error in excluding FM\u2019s proposed testimony does not merit reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">B. <em>Insufficient Evidence of Duress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">The elements of a Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b) violation differ from the elements of a Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a) violation in only one respect. A Penal Code section 288, subdivision <em>(b) </em>violation occurs only where the lewd <em>act is accomplished \u201cby </em>use of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>another person . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b).) Similarly, an element of forcible rape is that the act of sexual intercourse was accomplished \u201cby means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2).)  An element of an attempt to commit forcible rape is that the perpetrator specifically intended to accomplish intercourse with the victim by such means. (Cf. <em>People v. Miller </em>(1935) 2 Cal.2d 527, 530 [42 P.2d 308, 98 A.L.R. 913].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">There was no evidence presented at trial that defendant used or intended to use force, violence, menace or fear of immediate bodily injury in his commission of any of his offenses against L., and the prosecutor expressly premised both the Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b) count and the attempted rape count solely on \u201cduress.\u201d She based this argument on <em>People </em>v. <em>Schulz </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 999 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 799]. The prosecutor claimed that \u201cthe evidence would support a finding of duress with respect to all five instances of molest,\u201d but only two of the counts required such a finding. She pointed out that (1) defendant was older than L., (2) defendant was much larger than L., (3) L. had not lived with defendant for many years, (4) he was her natural father and (5) she was scared of him. The prosecutor argued that L. had been \u201cparalyzed\u201d by her fear of defendant. She maintained that defendant physically and psychologically dominated L. thereby committing the acts by duress. The court explicitly relied on <em>Schulz </em>and found that defendant had committed these two counts by duress. It found that duress was supported by L.\u2019s dependence on defendant, the size and age disparities, her limited intellectual level and her fear of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">We begin with <em>Schulz </em>since it was the basis for the trial court\u2019s decision and is a decision of this court. In <em>Schulz, </em>the defendant lived with his nine-year-old niece. One night, he woke her up \u201cby grabbing her arm, cornered her while she cried, held her arm, and touched her breasts and vaginal area.\u201d <em>(People v. Schulz, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 1004.) He had molested her on a number of occasions previously. This court held that defendant had accomplished this lewd act by duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">\u201cPhysical control can create \u2018duress\u2019 without constituting \u2018force.\u2019 \u2018Duress\u2019 would be redundant in the cited statutes if its meaning were no different than \u2018force,\u2019 \u2018violence,\u2019 \u2018menace,\u2019 or \u2018fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury.\u2019 . . . \u2018Duress\u2019 has been defined as \u2018a direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, hardship or retribution sufficient to coerce a reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to (1) perform an act which otherwise would not have been performed or, (2) acquiesce in an act to which one otherwise would not have submitted.\u2019 . . . [D]uress involves psychological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>coercion. Duress can arise from various circumstances, including the relationship between the defendant and the victim and their relative ages and sizes. . . . \u2018Where the defendant is a family member and the victim is young, ... the position of dominance and authority of the defendant and his continuous exploitation of the victim\u2019 [are] relevant to the existence of duress.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schulz, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 1005, citations omitted.) In <em>Schulz, </em>this court assessed the defendant\u2019s offense against this standard. \u201cIn our view duress was involved in this \u2018nightmare\u2019 incident. The victim, then nine years old, was crying while defendant, her adult uncle, restrained and fondled her. On this occasion he took advantage not only of his psychological dominance as an adult authority figure, but also of his physical dominance to overcome her resistance to molestation. This qualifies as duress.\u201d <em>(Schulz, </em>at p. 1005.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">We agree with this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Schulz </em>that, where the defendant grabbed and restrained the nine-year-old distraught victim, cornered her and used his physical dominance in conjunction with his psychological dominance to overcome her resistance, the lewd act was accomplished by duress. However, the evidence before us is substantially different. Defendant did not grab, restrain or comer L. during the final incident out of which the Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b) count and the attempted rape count arose. L. did not cry, and she offered no resistance. Instead, defendant simply lewdly touched and attempted intercourse with a victim who made no oral or physical response to his acts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">None of the other cases cited by the parties supports a conclusion that these acts were accomplished by duress. In <em>People v. Superior Court (Kneip) </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 235 [268 Cal.Rptr. 1], this court concluded that evidence that the defendant had explicitly threatened the victim with humiliation was sufficient to support a \u201cbindover\u201d of the defendant for trial. <em>(Kneip, </em>at p. 239.) In <em>People v. Senior </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 765 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 14], during the initial molestation the defendant threatened to hit his daughter if she resisted. During later molestations, he restrained her. This court found sufficient evidence of duress as to the later molests in the prior threat and the later restraint. <em>(Senior, </em>at pp. 775-776.) In <em>People v. Sanchez </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 721 [256 Cal.Rptr. 446], the defendant physically pulled the victim to require her to perform the acts and threatened that the victim\u2019s mother would hit the victim if the victim told about the molestations. The court found that this constituted substantial evidence that the acts were accomplished by duress. <em>(Sanchez, </em>at p. 748.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>In <em>People v. Hecker </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1238 [268 Cal.Rptr. 884], the defendant had anal and vaginal intercourse with his 13-year-old stepdaughter. She testified that during a previous molestation she had unsuccessfully tried to resist, but she did not resist on this occasion. The sex acts \u201churt.\u201d (Hecker, at p. 1241.) She suffered both vaginal and anal injuries from these acts. The defendant warned her not to reveal the molestations because it would hurt his marriage and his career. (Hecker, at p. 1242.) She testified that she felt psychological pressure and was afraid. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Hecker </em>court found insufficient evidence of duress. \u201c \u2018Psychological coercion\u2019 without more does not establish duress. At a minimum there must be an implied threat of \u2018force, violence, danger, hardship or retribution.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hecker, </em>at pp. 1250-1251.) \u201cBy enacting subdivision (a) of section 288 and providing the serious penalties it imposes, the Legislature has recognized that all sex crimes with children are inherently coercive. . . . We are merely giving recognition to the Legislature\u2019s determination in enacting subdivision (b) that defendants who compound their commission of such acts by the use of violence or threats of violence should be singled out for more particularized deterrence.\u201d <em>(Hecker, </em>at p. 1251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">The only way that we could say that defendant\u2019s lewd act on L. and attempt at intercourse with L. were accomplished by duress is if the mere fact that he was L.\u2019s father and larger than her combined with her fear and limited intellectual level were sufficient to establish that the acts were accomplished by duress. What is missing here is the \u201c \u2018direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, hardship or retribution sufficient to coerce a reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to (1) perform an act which otherwise would not have been performed or, (2) acquiesce in an act to which one otherwise would not have submitted.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Wilkerson </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1571, 1578-1579 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 392].) Duress cannot be established unless there is evidence that \u201cthe victim[\u2019s] participation was impelled, at least partly, by an implied threat . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1580.) No evidence was adduced that defendant\u2019s lewd act and attempt at intercourse were accompanied by any \u201cdirect or implied threat\u201d of any kind. While it was clear that L. was afraid of defendant, no evidence was introduced to show that this fear was based on anything defendant had done other than to continue to molest her. It would be circular reasoning to find that her fear of molestation established that the molestation was accomplished by duress based on an implied threat of molestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">We find no evidence in the record that defendant utilized any direct or implied threat in accomplishing these acts on L. Consequently, the Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b) conviction must be reduced to reflect a conviction of the lesser included offense of violating Penal Code section</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>288, subdivision (a). <em>(People v. Kelly </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 528 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 677, 822 P.2d 385].) As there are no lesser included offenses of attempted forcible rape that are supported by the evidence here, the attempted rape count must be stricken for insufficiency of the evidence. Because neither of these counts affected defendant\u2019s sentence, there is no need for resentencing, and we will simply order the trial court to amend the abstract of judgment to reflect these changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">II. <em>Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Defendant petitions for a writ of habeas corpus based on allegations that he has \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence that his girlfriend, Lola Lujan, spent the night at his apartment on April 25, 1999. He claims that this evidence \u201ccompletely undermines\u201d L.\u2019s credibility, and therefore he is entitled to a new trial. In support of his petition, he offers a declaration by Lujan that she was at defendant\u2019s apartment beginning in the afternoon on April 25. She declares that she was there when the girls had dinner, and she spent the night in defendant\u2019s bedroom with him. Lujan also declares that she recalls defendant taking the girls to school the next morning. Defendant also offers a declaration by Lujan\u2019s friend that defendant picked Lujan up at the friend\u2019s home on some afternoon in April 1999, and Lujan later told the friend that defendant had been charged with a molestation that had allegedly occurred that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">\u201c[N]ewly discovered evidence is a basis for [habeas corpus] relief only if it undermines the prosecution\u2019s entire case. It is not sufficient that the evidence might have weakened the prosecution case or presented a more difficult question for the judge or jury. . . . \u2018[A] criminal judgment may be collaterally attacked on the basis of \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence only if the \u201cnew\u201d evidence casts fundamental doubt on the accuracy and reliability of the proceedings. At the guilt phase, such evidence, if credited, must undermine the entire prosecution case and point unerringly to innocence or reduced culpability.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 750, 766 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 855 P.2d 729], citations omitted.) \u201c[E]vidence which is uncertain, questionable or directly in conflict with other testimony does not afford a ground for relief upon habeas corpus.\u201d <em>(In re Lindley </em>(1947) 29 Cal.2d 709, 722 [177 P.2d 918].) \u201c[N]ewly discovered evidence does not justify relief unless it is of such character as will completely undermine the entire structure of the case upon which the prosecution was based.\u201d <em>(Lindley, </em>at p. 723.) \u201cIn contrast with ineffective assistance claims, \u2018[t]he high standard for newly discovered evidence claims presupposes that all the essential elements of a presumptively accurate and fair proceeding were present in the proceeding whose result is challenged.\u201d <em>(People v. Gonzalez </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1179, 1246 [275 Cal.Rptr. 729, 800 P.2d 1159], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>An examination of the evidence presented at trial reveals that defendant has failed to make out a prima facie case that meets this \u201chigh standard.\u201d When L. was interviewed on April 26 by Gleason, L. initially stated that the most recent molestation had occurred \u201clast night\u201d when defendant \u201ctried to put his thing in me.\u201d A little later in the interview, L. stated that this most recent event had not happened \u201cthis morning\u201d but \u201cyesterday morning.\u201d A transcript of this interview was introduced at trial. Just before trial, in defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s trial brief, he stated that he intended to call Lujan to testify at trial but had lost contact with her and was still looking for her. At trial, L. testified that she could not recall when the final molestation occurred, but she did indicate on both direct examination and cross-examination that it had happened on a school day. On cross-examination, she seemed to testify at one point that no molestations had occurred between the time she first told Veronica about the molestations at noon on Friday, April 23 and the time she reported the molestations to a counselor on the morning of Monday, April 26. However, she also stated that she could not remember when the final molestation occurred or whether the final molestation happened on a weekday or a weekend. L. affirmed that she had remembered the event better when she was interviewed by Gleason on April 26. L. and her sister J. both testified at trial that J. and A. frequently spent the night in defendant\u2019s bedroom, and L. testified that the molestations occurred on nights when her sisters were sleeping in defendant\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Defendant admitted at trial that the girls slept in his room on two to four occasions during the first week they lived with him, but he claimed that L. was one of those sleeping in his room on some of those occasions and that this activity ended after the first week when he installed a lock on his bedroom door and told the girls to sleep in their own room. Defendant also testified that Lujan had come to his apartment on the evening of Sunday, April 25 \u201c[ajfter the girls were asleep, approximately between 10:00 and 11:00\u201d p.m. and spent the night with him in his bedroom that night. On cross-examination, defendant testified ambiguously that Lujan \u201cwas there Saturday night, Sunday night.\u201d At the end of the defense case, defendant\u2019s trial counsel explained that he wanted to present Lujan\u2019s testimony, but he had been unable to find her. The prosecutor stipulated that the defense had made diligent though unsuccessful efforts to find Lujan. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel noted that Lujan had been in local custody, but she had been transported elsewhere and could not be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Defendant\u2019s purported \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence is not of such a character that it would completely undermine the prosecution\u2019s case nor does it unerringly point to innocence. At most, Lujan\u2019s testimony would have provided some corroboration for defendant\u2019s trial testimony that Lujan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>spent the night of April 25 with him in his bedroom. The record before us reflects that Lujan is a drug-addicted incarcerated felon who is obviously biased in defendant\u2019s favor yet chose to disappear at the time of trial, and her declaration conflicts with defendant\u2019s trial testimony regarding the length of her stay at his apartment on April 25. Under these circumstances, it certainly cannot be said that her testimony that she was at defendant\u2019s apartment on the evening of April 25 would have completely undermined the prosecution\u2019s case or demonstrated defendant\u2019s innocence. Instead, this evidence would merely have weakly corroborated defendant\u2019s less than credible testimony on this point, which was in conflict with other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Defendant has failed to make out a prima facie case in support of his petition and therefore it must be summarily denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">The judgment is hereby modified in the following particulars. The Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b) conviction shall be modified to reflect a conviction of the lesser included offense of violating Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a) due to the insufficiency of the evidence of duress. The attempted rape conviction is stricken due to the insufficiency of the evidence of duress. The trial court is ordered to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting these modifications and to forward a copy of this abstract to the Department of Corrections. The modified judgment is affirmed. The petition for a writ of habeas corpus is summarily denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">Premo, Acting P.

When defendant\u2019s trial counsel asked if defendant did \u201c[a]nything else,\u201d L. said \u201cNo.\u201d However, later in cross-examination, she described defendant\u2019s attempt to have intercourse with her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b993-9\">The appellate record indicates that defendant\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s name was Lola Lujon or Lola Ancira, but her declaration in support of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus reflects that her name is Lola Lujan.
