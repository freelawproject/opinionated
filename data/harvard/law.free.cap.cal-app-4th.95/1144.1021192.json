To hold otherwise would allow him to take advantage of his own wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">In November 1959, Gail and Jeffrey Sachs were married. They had three children. On April 7, 1977, the marriage was dissolved by way of \u201cFindings and Judgment\u201d entered in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of Westchester.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">Jeffrey was ordered to pay Gail spousal support of $1,950 per month and child support of $216.66 per month for each child. Upon the sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>family residence, the child support payments increased to $541.66 per month for each child. Jeffrey was also responsible for paying the educational expenses of each child up to the age of 25, including private elementary and secondary schools, undergraduate college, graduate school, and professional school. In addition, Jeffrey was to pay all medical and dental costs of the children until they became emancipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">On June 24, 1991, the Findings and Judgment were modified by a stipulation between the parties entered in the Superior Court of the State of Connecticut for the Judicial District of Stamford/Norwalk. The stipulation reflected that, as of June 24, 1991, Jeffrey was $96,427 in arrears on child support, spousal support, and the children\u2019s educational and medical expenses. The stipulation required Jeffrey to extinguish the arrearages over time, to make payments for certain educational expenses, and, except as otherwise provided, to continue making payments in accordance with the Findings and Judgment of the New York court.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">At some point, Jeffrey moved to California. On April 8, 1994, Gail served Jeffrey in California with an \u201cOrder to Show Cause and Declaration for Contempt.\u201d Apparently, she did not pursue the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">On January 19, 1996, Gail registered the modified Findings and Judgment in the State of California, filing a statement for registration of foreign support order in the trial court. The statement indicated that the amount of unpaid support, as of December 31, 1995, was $244,467.62, consisting of $182,425 in principal and $62,042.62 in interest. The statement further disclosed that Jeffrey was a resident of California and Gail resided in New York.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Meanwhile, on May 21, 1977, Jeffrey married his second wife, Sally. They had two children. Their marriage was dissolved by way of a judgment entered on June 20, 1988, in the Superior Court of the State of Connecticut for the Judicial District of Stamford/Norwalk. The judgment mandated child and spousal support. As of December 1, 1994, unpaid support totaled $35,000, plus interest. On January 13, 1995, Sally registered the judgment in California <em>(Sachs v. Sachs </em>(Super. Ct. L.A. County, 1995, No. BL020459)). At the time, Sally lived in Canada and Jeffrey lived in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">In 1992, Jeffrey married his third wife, Karen. Five years later, they separated. Eventually, their marriage was dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>In 1996, after filing the statement of registration of foreign support order in California, Gail garnished Jeffrey\u2019s wages. In July 1998, she obtained a writ of execution and levied on Jeffrey\u2019s bank account. In August 1998, she levied on Karen\u2019s bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">On August 13, 1998, Gail filed and subsequently served Karen with an \u201cApplication and Order for Appearance and Examination\u201d and a subpoena duces tecum, setting the examination for October 14, 1998. Karen appeared for the examination, answered the questions put to her, and produced the documents in her possession. She testified that, in 1993, after marrying Jeffrey, he \u201cgifted\u201d two companies to her. The companies operated out of the same office, which Jeffrey and Karen both occupied. While Karen owned the companies, she employed Jeffrey as an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d and paid him $1,000 per week, making checks payable to his corporation, Sachs Enterprises, Inc. In 1997, the year that Jeffrey and Karen separated, she transferred the companies back to him, for which he paid $120,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">On August 13, 1998, Gail obtained and thereafter served Jeffrey with an order to appear at a judgment debtor examination. She also served him with a subpoena duces tecum. On October 14, 1998, Jeffrey appeared for the examination but refused to answer the very first question and did not produce any documents, invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Jeffrey claimed that the disclosure of information about his financial status might tend to incriminate him if Gail or Sally ever initiated contempt proceedings against him for failing to pay support.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Upon Jeffrey\u2019s refusal to answer questions, the parties sought a ruling from the trial court, which established a briefing schedule and set the matter for hearing. The parties filed points and authorities. On November 30, 1998, the trial court heard argument and ruled that, although the Fifth Amendment applies to judgment debtor examinations, Jeffrey could not assert a blanket objection to the examination but had to assert the privilege on a question-by-question basis. The trial court continued the examination to February 1, 1999. Gail subsequently took it off calendar.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">On May 26, 2000, Gail obtained and thereafter served Jeffrey with a second order to appear at a judgment debtor examination. She also served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>him with a subpoena duces tecum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The examination took place on two days, July 10 and July 26, 2000. Gail\u2019s counsel asked a lengthy series of questions, and Jeffrey invoked the Fifth Amendment as to each question he thought objectionable. He also refused to produce any documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">On August 29, 2000, Gail filed a motion to compel Jeffrey to answer questions and produce documents at the judgment debtor examination. Gail agreed not to pursue contempt charges if the trial court overruled Jeffrey\u2019s Fifth Amendment objections and compelled him to provide information.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Jeffrey filed opposition to the motion. At the trial court\u2019s request, the parties filed supplemental papers on the question of whether Jeffrey was subject to contempt proceedings in New York, Connecticut, and California. By order dated November 1, 2000, the trial court denied Gail\u2019s motion to compel and sustained Jeffrey\u2019s objections. Gail filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">In this case, we must balance competing interests: Jeffrey\u2019s interest in avoiding self-incrimination and Gail\u2019s interest in the disclosure of information that could enable her to collect the support that Jeffrey owes her and the children. We begin our analysis with a general discussion about the privilege against self-incrimination. We then discuss the application of the privilege in the context of contempt proceedings. Finally, we balance the parties\u2019 respective interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">A. <em>The Privilege Against Self-incrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\u201d The same right is guaranteed under the California Constitution (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15) and by state statute (Evid. Code, \u00a7 940).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">\u201cThe privilege against self-incrimination applies in judgment debtor proceedings.\u201d <em>(Troy </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1006, 1010 [231 Cal.Rptr. 108].) \u201cBut this protection must be confined to instances where the witness has reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer. ... To sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\u201d <em>(Hoffman v. United States </em>(1951) 341 U.S. 479, 486-487 [71 S.Ct. 814, 818, 95 L.Ed. 1118]; accord, <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 414, 427 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 204].)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">\u201cThe trial judge in appraising the claim [of privilege] \u2018must be governed as much by his personal perception of the peculiarities of the case as by the facts actually in evidence.\u2019 . . .\u201d <em>(Hoffman v. United States, supra, </em>341 U.S. at p. 487 [71 S.Ct. at p. 818].) On appeal, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>(Troy v. Superior Court, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.3d at p. 1011.)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">\u201cTo invoke the privilege, a witness need not be guilty of any offense; rather, the privilege is properly invoked whenever the witness\u2019s answers \u2018would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute\u2019 the witness for a criminal offense. ... [A] trial court may compel the witness to answer only if it \u2018clearly appears to the court\u2019 that the proposed testimony \u2018cannot possibly have a tendency to incriminate the person claiming the privilege.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Cudjo </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 585, 617 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 863 P.2d 635].) \u201cThe privilege \u2018can be asserted in any proceeding, civil or criminal, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Segretti v. State Bar </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 878, 886 [126 Cal.Rptr. 793, 544 P.2d 929].)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">\u201c \u2018A party is not entitled to decide for himself whether he is protected by the fifth amendment privilege. . . . [T]his question is for the court to decide after conducting \u201ca particularized inquiry, deciding, in connection with each specific area that the questioning party seeks to explore, whether or not the privilege is well-founded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">\u201c. . . [A] blanket refusal to testify is unacceptable; a person claiming the Fifth Amendment privilege must do so with specific reference to particular questions asked or other evidence sought. . . . [O]nce this is done, the trial court must undertake a particularized inquiry with respect to each specific claim of privilege to determine whether the claimant has . . . established] that the testimony or other evidence sought might tend to incriminate him.\u201d <em>(Warford v. Medeiros </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 1035, 1045 [207 Cal.Rptr. 94], citations and italics omitted; accord, <em>Fisher v. Gibson </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 275, 286 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 145].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he burden is on the party or witness [invoking the privilege] to show that the testimony or other evidence could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>tend to incriminate him or her.\u201d (Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2001) [\u00b6] 8:139, p. 8C-24.2; accord, <em>Warford v. Medeiros, supra, </em>160 Cal.App.3d at p. 1045; Evid. Code, \u00a7 404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">B. <em>Contempt for Failure to Pay Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Jeffrey argues that the testimony and documents sought at the judgment debtor examination could provide evidence tending to incriminate him on contempt charges arising out of his alleged failure to comply with the support orders entered in New York, Connecticut, and California. Jeffrey believes that he may remain silent about his financial affairs so as to avoid a finding of contempt. Yet, in contempt proceedings, Jeffrey would be found guilty <em>if he remained silent. </em>That is the law in all three states.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">As a preliminary matter, we do not know the exact amount of Jeffrey\u2019s arrearages. After Gail filed the January 19, 1996 statement for registration of foreign support order\u2014which indicated arrearages of $244,467.62\u2014she levied on the bank accounts of Jeffrey and Karen and garnished Jeffrey\u2019s wages, receiving amounts that have not been identified. In her motion to compel, Gail stated that the arrearages exceeded $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Nor do we know the breakdown of the arrearages by category, namely, child support, spousal support, educational expenses, and medical costs, respectively. While the parties\u2019 1991 stipulation used those four categories to describe Jeffrey\u2019s arrearages, the present proceedings are based on an undifferentiated sum. For purposes of discussion, we will assume that the arrearages include both child and spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">1. <em>Contempt Under California Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">In <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 396 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 215, 950 P.2d 59] <em>(Moss), </em>our Supreme Court held that the \u201c[a]bility to comply with a support order is not an element of the contempt which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the petitioner. Inability to comply is an affirmative defense which must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence by the alleged contemner.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 425.) \u201c[A]bility to pay has traditionally been considered an affirmative defense in contempt proceedings.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 426.) \u201c[T]he elements of. . . contempt are only a valid court order, the alleged contemner\u2019s knowledge of the order, and noncompliance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>If the petitioner proves those elements beyond a reasonable doubt the violation is established. He or she need go no farther. To prevail on the affirmative defense of inability to comply with the support order, the contemner must prove such inability by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 428.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">This is so for two reasons, as explained in <em>Moss, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 396. First, \u201c[t]he ability of the parent to pay the amount of support ordered has [already] been determined by the court that made the order.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 428.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Second, like the rule of convenience applicable to many defenses, \u201c \u2018[t]he contemner is the person in the best position to know whether inability to pay is even a consideration in the proceeding and also has the best access to evidence on the issue, particularly in cases of self-employment. Considerations of policy and convenience have led courts to sanction placement of the burden of establishing a defense on defendants under similar circumstances <em>(Moss, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 427.) \u201cCommon sense dictates that the contemner raise inability to pay.\u201d <em>(In re Feiock </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 141, 146 [263 Cal.Rptr. 437], overruled on another point in <em>Moss, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 428.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">With regard to child support in California, section 1209.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: \u201cWhen a court of competent jurisdiction makes an order compelling a parent to furnish support or necessary food, clothing, shelter, medical attendance, or other remedial care for his or her child, proof that the order was made, filed, and served on the parent or proof that the parent was present in court at the time the order was pronounced and proof that the parent did not comply with the order is prima facie evidence of a contempt of court.\u201d (Hereafter section 1209.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Section 1209.5, as construed by the courts, means: \u201c \u2018[P]roof of the [existence of the support] order, knowledge of it, and noncompliance \u201cshall be prima facie evidence of a contempt of court.\u201d ... In other words, proof of these basic facts <em>proves the entire contempt. </em>Once the contempt is proved any excuse or justification, such as ability to pay, is a matter of defense. . . \u201d <em>(Moss, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 427, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Although section 1209.5 governs <em>child </em>support orders, California law with respect to spousal support is the same. Over 90 years ago, in <em>In re McCarty </em>(1908) 154 Cal. 534 [98 P. 540] <em>(McCarty), </em>the Supreme Court stated: \u201cIt is not necessary for a wife on the hearing of a contempt proceeding for nonpayment of alimony to prove anything more than the making of the order and disobedience of it by her husband in refusing to pay the amounts which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>the court found he had the ability to do when it made the order. She makes a <em>prima facie </em>case at the hearing by producing the original order, and by proof of the refusal of her husband to make payment according to its terms .... [I]f [the husband\u2019s] excuse is that since the making of the original order he has become unable to pay the alimony required by it, it is incumbent upon him to prove that fact.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 537.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Just two years ago, in <em>Moss, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 396, the high court cited <em>McCarty </em>with approval for the proposition that \u201c \u2018[f]or many years in California ability to pay has been considered, without much analysis, to be a matter of defense in contempt proceedings. . . . [\u00b6] This approach is consistent with [the] legislative intent [of section 1209.5], constitutional law, and common sense. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Moss, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">And as more recently stated by Division Five of this court: \u201cIt may be argued that. . . section 1209.5 expressly refers only to child support orders and therefore ability to pay must be an element of other similar family law orders. We are not persuaded by this argument. . . . Nothing suggests that the intent of the Legislature in enacting . . . section 1209.5 was to abrogate the general case authority holding that ability to pay is not an element of contempt of family law orders in which ability to pay has already been determined. . . . [T]he holding of <em>McCarty </em>was supported by the broad language of <em>Moss[, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 396,] relegating inability to pay in family law contempt proceedings to an affirmative defense.\u201d <em>(In re Ivey </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 793, 801-802 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 447], fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Finally, we note that a spouse who is experiencing financial difficulty in making support payments can avoid the possibility of contempt by filing an application to reduce support and demonstrating a material change in circumstances. (See Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law (The Rutter Group 2001) \u00b6\u00b6 17:25 to 17:64.5, 17:135 to 17:232, 17:360 to 17:410, pp. 17-8 to 17-17, 17-32.3 to 17-56.1, 17-82 to 17-90.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">2. <em>Contempt Under New York Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">In New York, \u201c[a] prima facie case of willful violation [of a support order] [is] established by the proof that the father ha[s] not paid court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>ordered child support.... At that point, the burden of proving inability to pay shift[s] to the father . . . .\u201d <em>(Ahrem v. Cattell </em>(1998) 254 A.D.2d 352 [678 N.Y.S.2d 296]; accord, <em>Fallon </em>v. <em>Fallon </em>(2001) 286 A.D.2d 389 [728 N.Y.S.2d 725]; see N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act \u00a7 454(3)(a).) Similarly, a failure to pay spousal support requires the supporting spouse to prove inability to pay. <em>(Rosenberg v. Rosenberg </em>(1963) 19 A.D.2d 873 [244 N.Y.S.2d 117]; see N.Y. Jud. Law \u00a7 770 (McKinney 1992).)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Under New York law, \u201c[a] respondent is prima facie presumed ... to have sufficient means to support his or her spouse and children under the age of 21 . . . . [M]oreover, failure to pay support as ordered itself constitutes \u2018prima facie evidence of a willful violation\u2019 .... Thus, proof that respondent has failed to pay support as ordered alone establishes petitioner\u2019s direct case of willful violation, shifting to respondent the burden of going forward . . . .\u201d <em>(Powers </em>v. <em>Powers </em>(1995) 86 N.Y.2d 63, 68-70 [629 N.Y.S.2d 984, 653 N.E.2d 1154, 1157].)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">3. <em>Contempt Under Connecticut Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">The same rules apply in Connecticut. \u201c[T]he inability to comply [with a support order] is a good defense to a claim of contempt. . . . The contemnor must establish that he cannot comply, or was unable to do so.\u201d <em>(Bunche v. Bunche </em>(1994) 36 Conn.App. 322, 325-326 [650 A.2d 917, 919], citation omitted.) \u201cOnce the existence of a payment order and the absence of payments has been proved, the lack of any basis or explanation for nonpayment reasonably allows the conclusion that the contemnor has the ability to comply with the order. [\u00b6] However, once non-compliance with an existing order has been proved, the burden shifts to the responding party to prove that his or her non-compliance was not willful.\u201d (8 Rutkin et al., Connecticut Practice Series: Family Law and Practice (2d ed. 2000) \u00a7 34.12, p. 117, fn. omitted; accord, <em>Eldridge v.

A party or witness in a civil proceeding \u2018may be required either to waive the privilege or accept the civil consequences of silence if he or she does exercise it. . Courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>recognize the dilemma faced by a defendant who must choose between defending the civil litigation by providing testimony that may be incriminating on the one hand, and losing the case by asserting the constitutional right and remaining silent, on the other hand. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">\u201cAt the same time, courts must also consider the interests of the plaintiff in civil litigation where the defendant is exposed to parallel criminal prosecution. . . . \u2018[T]he fact that a man is indicted cannot give him a blank check to block all civil litigation on the same or related underlying subject matter. Justice is meted out in both civil and criminal litigation . . . .\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">\u201cAdded to the mix, of course, is the interest of the courts in fairly and expeditiously disposing of civil cases, and in efficiently utilizing judicial resources. . . . [C]ourts are guided by the strong principle that any elapsed time other than that reasonably required for pleadings and discovery \u2018is unacceptable and should be eliminated.\u2019 . . . Courts must control the pace of litigation, reduce delay, and maintain a current docket so as to enable the just, expeditious, and efficient resolution of cases. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">\u201c. . . Courts that are confronted with a civil defendant who is exposed to criminal prosecution arising from the same facts \u2018weigh the parties\u2019 competing interests with a view toward accommodating the interests of both parties, if possible.\u2019 . . . Courts have broad discretion in controlling the course of discovery. . . . Hence, in a discovery dispute [involving the privilege against self-incrimination] . . . , the trial court must exercise its discretion in assessing and balancing \u2018the nature and substantiality of the injustices claimed\u2019 on all sides.\u201d <em>(Fuller </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 299, 305-307 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 525], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">\u201cWhenever the Court is confronted with the question of a compelled disclosure that has an incriminating potential, the judicial scrutiny is invariably a close one. Tension between the State\u2019s demand for disclosures and the protection of the right against self-incrimination is likely to give rise to serious questions. Inevitably these must be resolved in terms of balancing the public need on the one hand, and the individual claim to constitutional protections on the other; neither interest can be treated lightly.\u201d <em>(California v. Byers </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 424, 427 [91 S.Ct. 1535, 1537, 29 L.Ed.2d 9] (plur. opn. of Burger, C. J.); accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 867, 885 [120 Cal.Rptr. 384, 533 P.2d 1024].)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">\u201cA party may claim the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination where to disclose financial information might lead to prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>under [certain] statutes. This issue frequently arises in divorce cases, either in the context of initial financial determinations incident to the divorce or in subsequent proceedings such as proceedings to modify alimony or child support orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">\u201cThe successful invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination by a party, however, may present insurmountable obstacles to litigation of matrimonial disputes. That is, if a party asserts the privilege and succeeds in excluding tax returns and other financial information, the court\u2019s ability to assess the relative financial positions of the parties and make appropriate property and support provisions in a marital dispute may be severely undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">\u201cThus, courts have struggled to find ways to preserve both the claimant\u2019s constitutional privilege and the integrity of the trial process.\u201d (Feldman &amp; Reed, <em>Silences in the Storm: Testimonial Privileges in Matrimonial Disputes </em>(1987) 21 Fam. L.Q. 189, 228-229, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">For example, in a New York case involving spousal support, the trial court ordered the husband to answer questions about information contained in his tax return. In response, he invoked the Fifth Amendment. The trial court described the parties\u2019 competing interests, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-8\">\u201cIn the judicial determination of whether silence is indeed justified, each case must be controlled by its own facts ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-9\">\u201cIn this, as in all difficult matrimonial disputes, the wife has a right to inquire into the financial status of her husband. While it is quite true that the husband has an absolute Constitutional right to assert the privilege against self-incrimination, his declaration of said assertion does not preclude any further inquiry. The difficulties that arise in these touchy matters are obvious; that is, if further inquiry were permitted to be pursued, the very matter that the Constitution seeks to protect would be divulged. Conversely, if the bald assertion of the privilege were accepted at face value, the substantive rights of the wife in this instance could be severely prejudiced. On balance, it would appear that the interests of justice would best be served if this examination were permitted to continue . . . under the close scrutiny and supervision of this court, toward the full protection of both the substantive rights of the wife and the Constitutional privileges of the husband.\u201d <em>(Slater </em>v. <em>Slater </em>(1974) 78 Misc.2d 13, 15-16 [355 N.Y.S.2d 943, 946], citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">We, too, acknowledge the importance of both the Fifth Amendment and the obligation of a former spouse to make support payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>The Fifth Amendment is fundamental to our system of criminal justice. \u201c[It] is a right that was hard-earned by our forefathers. The reasons for its inclusion in the Constitution\u2014and the necessities for its preservation\u2014are to be found in the lessons of history. As early as 1650, remembrance of the horror of Star Chamber proceedings a decade before had firmly established the privilege in the common law of England. Transplanted to this country as part of our legal heritage, it soon made its way into various state constitutions and ultimately in 1791 into the federal Bill of Rights. The privilege, this Court has stated, \u2018was generally regarded then, as now, as a privilege of great value, ... a safeguard against heedless, unfounded, or tyrannical prosecutions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Quinn </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1955) 349 U.S. 155, 161-162 [75 S.Ct. 668, 673, 99 L.Ed. 964, 51 A.L.R.2d 1157], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">\u201c[T]he American system of criminal prosecution is accusatorial, not inquisitorial, and ... the Fifth Amendment privilege is its essential mainstay. . . . Governments, state and federal, are thus constitutionally compelled to establish guilt by evidence independently and freely secured, and may not by coercion prove a charge against an accused out of his own mouth.\u201d <em>(Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 1, 7-8 [84 S.Ct. 1489, 1493, 12 L.Ed.2d 653], citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">At the same time, the importance of child support cannot be overstated. \u201cChildren are dependent on their parents for the necessities of life and it is essential to the public welfare that parents provide support with which to care for their needs.\u201d <em>(Moss, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">As the statewide uniform guideline for determining child support indicates: (1) \u201c[a] parent\u2019s first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent\u2019s circumstances and station in life\u201d; (2) \u201c[b]oth parents are mutually responsible for the support of their children\u201d; (3) \u201c[t]he guideline seeks to place the interests of children as the state\u2019s top priority\u201d; (4) \u201c[c]hildren should share in the standard of living of both parents\u201d; and (5) \u201c[c]hild support orders must ensure that children actually receive fair, timely, and sufficient support reflecting the state\u2019s high standard of living and high costs of raising children compared to other states.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4053, subds. (a), (b), (e), (f) &amp; (/); all further statutory references are to the Family Code unless designated otherwise.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">In balancing the parties\u2019 interests, we cannot help but point out that Jeffrey\u2019s argument is as counterintuitive as they come. Under his theory, a spouse ordered to pay child support could refuse to comply with the order at the outset. Having defied the order, the spouse could then invoke the Fifth Amendment in perpetuity, relying on the refusal to pay support as grounds for shielding his or her income from discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>Jeffrey also argues that, because he has refused to pay support for such a long period of time, resulting in substantial arrearages, his protection under the Fifth Amendment is all the more necessary. And he emphasizes that he is also in arrears with respect to his second wife, Sally, who can initiate contempt proceedings regardless of whether or not Gail does.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In short, as Jeffrey would have it, the higher the amount of arrearages and the greater the number of spouses and children entitled to support, the stronger the argument for applying the Fifth Amendment. Yet, common sense dictates that a spouse should not be able to take advantage of his or her own wrongdoing in this manner. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 3517.) A spouse\u2019s refusal to pay support should not be rewarded with a lifetime of protection for his or her income.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">\u201c \u2018[I]t is the duty of the court, while it protects the witness in the due exercise of the privilege, to take care that he does not, under the pretense of defending himself, screen others from justice . . . <em>(Coleman </em>v. <em>Galvin </em>(1947) 78 Cal.App.2d 313, 321 [177 P.2d 606].) \u201cWere we to accept [Jeffrey\u2019s] argument, ... \u2018a defrauder who makes it big [could] always be cloaked and immune from a subsequent judgment debtor examination because there\u2019s always, quote, somebody out there who can come around and initiate a prosecution.\u2019 \u201d (Troy v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.3d at p. 1013.) Here, that somebody is Gail or Sally.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Keele </em>(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1090 [233 Cal.Rptr. 850], the parties engaged in settlement negotiations after a money judgment had been entered for the plaintiffs. They tentatively reached an accord, but the defendants reneged on the agreement. Later, during a judgment debtor examination, the individual defendant refused to answer questions about his sources of income, relying on Evidence Code sections 1152 and 1154. Those statutes generally preclude the admissibility of settlement offers and communications. The trial court overruled the objection, and the Court of Appeal affirmed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-9\">\u201c[The defendant\u2019s] argument that the public policy consideration behind Evidence Code sections 1152 and 1154 precludes the questions in issue is illogical. These sections were enacted to encourage settlements in order to ease the court\u2019s heavy <em>trial </em>caseload. . . . [T]he [judgment debtor] examination is intended to be summary and factual, according the widest scope for inquiry concerning property and business affairs of the debtor; the object of the proceedings being to compel the judgment debtor to give information concerning his property. . . . Public policy does not support a judgment debtor\u2019s attempt to be less than candid about his [income] and ability to pay the judgment . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>\u201cJudgment creditors make an interesting observation in their brief; they state that if [the defendant\u2019s] argument is accepted it would be a convenient format for a judgment debtor to engage in settlement negotiations before an examination and then decline to answer questions on the basis that they were related to the settlement negotiations. We agree.\u201d <em>(Young </em>v. <em>Keele, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1093-1094.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Like the judgment debtor in <em>Young, </em>Jeffrey is attempting to distort the law. Under his view, the Fifth Amendment would provide safe harbor for spouses seeking to thwart court-ordered support. \u201c \u2018[But] ... the court . . . may prevent the mantle of protection from being turned into a cloak for fraud and trickery.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Coleman </em>v. <em>Galvin, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.2d at p. 320.)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Nevertheless, given that the Fifth Amendment applies to judgment debtor examinations (see <em>Hooser v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 997, 1002-1003 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 341]; <em>Troy v. Superior Court, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.3d at p. 1010), Gail\u2019s right to support payments must accommodate Jeffrey\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">In the 1977 Findings and Judgment, which dissolved their marriage, Jeffrey and Gail agreed to \u201ccooperate and confer with each other on all major matters pertaining to the Children\u2019s health, welfare, education, training and upbringing, in order to arrive at a mutual agreement on a harmonious policy calculated to promote the best interests of the Children.\u201d They also agreed that \u201c[e]ach of the parties hereto, without cost to the other, shall at any time and from time to time hereafter execute and deliver any and all further instruments and assurances and perform any acts that the other party may reasonably request for the purpose of giving full force and effect to the provisions of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The purpose of those contractual terms is reflected in the provisions of the California Family Code. Section 3552 states: \u201cIn a proceeding involving child, family, or spousal support, no party to the proceeding may refuse to submit copies of the party\u2019s state and federal income tax returns to the court, whether individual or joint.\u201d (\u00a7 3552, subd. (a).) Section 3552 also states: \u201cThe tax returns may be examined by the other party and are discoverable by the other party. A party also may be examined by the other party as to the contents of a tax return . . . .\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (b).) And \u201c[i]f the court finds that it is relevant to the case to retain the tax return, the tax return shall be sealed and maintained as a confidential record of the court.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Jeffrey would have us ignore the terms of the Findings and Judgment and declare section 3552 unconstitutional. We shall do neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>In providing that a spouse can obtain the other spouse\u2019s income tax returns and \u201cexamine\u201d the other spouse with respect to the contents of the returns, the Legislature\u2014by enacting section 3552\u2014has struck an appropriate balance between the conflicting interests of the supported spouse and the supporting spouse. Thus, the supported spouse can obtain information about the income of the supporting spouse, and the tax returns of the supporting spouse must remain confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">We therefore hold that Gail may conduct a judgment debtor examination (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7708.110-708.205) in conjunction with section 3552, that is, she may obtain a copy of Jeffrey\u2019s income tax returns and examine him about their contents, subject to the statutory requirement of confidentiality. (See Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law, <em>supra, \u00b6\u00b6 </em>6:480 to 6:485, 6:886, pp. 6-194.5 to 6-194.6, 6-317 to 6-318 (rev. # 1, 2001) [discussing \u00a7 3552].)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Further, section 3552 is not the only provision in the Family Code that mandates the confidentiality of tax returns. Indeed, the Law Revision Commission comment to section 3552 includes a cross-reference to section 3665. (See Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29D West\u2019s Ann. Fam. Code (1994 ed.) foll. \u00a7 3552, pp. 357-358.) Section 3665, in turn, expressly refers back to section 3552 (see \u00a7 3665, subd. (c)), and states in part that \u201c[a] party shall not disclose the contents or provide copies of the other party\u2019s tax returns to anyone except the court, the party\u2019s attorney, the party\u2019s accountant, or other financial consultant assisting with matters relating to the proceeding, or any other person permitted by the court.\u201d (\u00a7 3665, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">\u201cThe two statutes[, sections 3552 and 3665,] were clearly intended to function together as an integrated scheme, as is evidenced by the cross-references . . . .\u201d <em>(Keh v. Walters </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1535 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 42].) In combination, those statutes ensure that Jeffrey\u2019s tax returns will be used only in the present proceeding and that information about his taxes will not be disclosed to third persons. And the trial court can take additional steps, if appropriate, to protect Jeffrey\u2019s and Gail\u2019s interests. (See, e.g., <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 307 [trial courts can adopt \u201cvarious procedural solutions designed to fairly balance the interests of the parties and the judicial system\u201d]; Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal.

If an individual must disclose ill-gotten gains to the government, the Fifth Amendment notwithstanding, surely he or she can be required to provide a former spouse with income tax returns in a proceeding to collect support arrearages, at least where the information is compelled by statute and is subject to confidentiality safeguards set by the Legislature.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">D. <em>Remaining Contentions</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">That portion of the order denying appellant\u2019s motion to compel responses to questions at the judgment debtor examination is reversed.
