J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adp\">In this eminent domain action brought by the People of the State of California, acting by and through the Department of Transportation (Caltrans) as plaintiff, Caltrans appeals a judgment after jury trial favoring defendant The Clauser/Wells Partnership, doing business as Manchester Auto Salvage, Inc. (Manchester) on Manchester\u2019s claim for compensation for condemned business inventory. Caltrans asserts prejudicial evidentiary error. Caltrans also appeals a postjudgment order awarding Manchester litigation expenses and costs. We reverse the judgment and the order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">Manchester operated an automobile salvage business engaged in selling auto parts on real property condemned by Caltrans to widen a freeway. By the time of trial in Caltrans\u2019s eminent domain action, the only remaining matter for litigation was the valuation of Manchester\u2019s business inventory. Under the Eminent Domain Law, the proper measure of compensation was the fair market value of Manchester\u2019s business inventory taken by Caltrans. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1263.310.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties stipulated that Caltrans was to compensate Manchester for the fair market value of its business inventory as of December 1, 1996, the date of valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Caltrans\u2019s inventory appraiser Donahue opined that Manchester\u2019s inventory\u2019s fair market value was $439,220. At a pretrial foundational hearing under Evidence Code section 402, Donahue testified that in forming his opinion he followed Caltrans\u2019s counsel\u2019s legal instructions to value the inventory as a bulk sale rather than individual sales and to base the fair market value on the inventory\u2019s wholesale value by removing the \u201cfuture consideration\u201d of profit. Donahue also testified he arrived at his opinion of fair market value by taking the inventory items\u2019 retail value, removing a 50 percent profit markup to reach wholesale value, deducting for the percentage of items that would not sell, applying a liquidation value to those items, and then adding such liquidation value to the downward adjusted wholesale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>value. The court excluded Donahue\u2019s testimony as based upon incorrect legal instructions and lacking sufficient evidentiary foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">At trial, Manchester\u2019s inventory appraiser Crockett testified the inventory\u2019s fair market value was $2,178,390 based essentially upon the aggregated retail sale values of all inventory items in saleable condition. The jury returned a verdict favoring Manchester in the amount of Crockett\u2019s valuation opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Caltrans contends the court reversibly erred in excluding the testimony of its inventory appraiser Donahue. Concluding Donahue\u2019s valuation opinion was based upon a proper legal standard and supported by sufficient evidentiary foundation to be heard by the jury, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Founded in 1950, Manchester\u2019s auto salvage business specialized in the niche market of Ford, Chrysler and Mitsubishi auto parts products. Manchester\u2019s business consisted of acquiring salvageable auto bodies and then dismantling, inventorying, testing, repairing/replacing, rebuilding, cleaning and painting the refurbished and reconditioned parts as needed to make those items saleable to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">Manchester kept thousands of parts in inventory. Each of those parts was inventoried, handled and labeled. Manchester gauged its supply by consumer demand and reviewed its inventory regularly to dispose of nonsaleable items.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">Manchester opened its store to the public and sold its products to anyone who came to the store for over-the-counter purchases. Manchester also had business customers, including insurance companies, garages, body shops and auto dealerships. Manchester\u2019s prices were the same regardless who was the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">In May 1996 Caltrans filed its complaint in eminent domain. Since Manchester\u2019s attempts to find a relocation site for its business did not succeed, Caltrans took by condemnation each component of the entirety of Manchester\u2019s business, including real estate, improvements, fixtures, equipment, goodwill and business inventory. On the stipulated date of valuation, Manchester vacated the property and transferred its entire business, including all its business inventory, to Caltrans. The eminent domain case then proceeded through various pretrial conferences and hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>In March 1998, after an unreported hearing on the issue of the definition of fair market value as applied to Manchester\u2019s inventory taken by Caltrans, Judge Thomas issued a minute order providing: The jury would be instructed with section 1263.320\u2019s definition of fair market value;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the wholesale valuation standard for retail inventory set forth in <em>McMahan\u2019s of Santa Monica </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 683 [194 Cal.Rptr. 582] (McMahan\u2019s) was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d to Manchester\u2019s factual circumstances;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Manchester could introduce evidence of \u201csale value to the public.\u201d In June 1998 Judge Thomas issued a written \u201cclarification\u201d of his earlier minute order by reaffirming section 1263.320\u2019s definition of fair market value and distinguishing the facts here from those in <em>McMahan\u2019s.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">In January 1999 when the matter came on for trial, the court (Judge Selna) stated that, as Judge Thomas had earlier held, the jury would be instructed to decide the valuation issue on the basis of fair market value as statutorily defined and Manchester could introduce the retail price of its inventory items as evidence of fair market value. However, Judge Selna also noted that Judge Thomas\u2019s initial minute order and the subsequent clarification did not indicate that evidence of the inventory\u2019s wholesale value would be excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>as a matter of law. Accordingly, Judge Selna conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine whether there was sufficient foundation for Caltrans\u2019s inventory appraiser Donahue to present to the jury his opinion on the inventory\u2019s fair market value based in part on consideration of wholesale value. At that hearing, Donahue testified he followed Caltrans\u2019s counsel\u2019s legal instructions to value the inventory as a bulk sale and at wholesale. Donahue also testified about the methodology he used to arrive at his valuation opinion. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court excluded Donahue\u2019s proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Since the parties had reached agreement on each of Manchester\u2019s other claims for just compensation, trial then began on the sole issue of the fair market value of Manchester\u2019s business inventory as of the date of valuation. At trial, Caltrans did not present any expert evidence on the inventory\u2019s fair market value. However, inventory appraiser Crockett testified for Manchester. The jury returned a verdict in the amount of Crockett\u2019s valuation opinion. The court entered judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict favoring Manchester and later awarded Manchester litigation expenses and costs. Caltrans appeals the judgment and the order awarding litigation expenses and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Seeking reversal of the judgment and remand for a new trial, Caltrans contends the court denied it a fair trial by excluding Donahue\u2019s opinion testimony on the fair market value of Manchester\u2019s business inventory. On this record we conclude the court prejudicially erred in excluding Donahue\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">\u201cThe constitutional requirement of just compensation applies to both eminent domain and inverse condemnation actions. [Citation.] The usual measure of just compensation is the fair market value of the property taken.\u201d <em>(McMahan\u2019s, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d at p. 700.) \u201cA condemnation trial is a sober inquiry into values, designed to strike a just balance between the economic interests of the public and those of the landowner.\u201d <em>(Sacramento, etc. Drainage Dist. ex rel. State Reclamation Bd. v. Reed </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 60, 69 [29 Cal.Rptr. 847].) The goal of the eminent domain trial was \u201cto determine just compensation,\u201d to wit, to put Manchester in \u201cas good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>a position\u201d as if its business inventory had \u201cnot been taken.\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Leslie </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 918, 923 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 252].) However, Manchester was only \u201centitled to be reimbursed for the actual value of what [it] lost\u2014no more and no less.\u201d <em>(Redevelopment Agency v. Tobriner </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1087, 1098 [264 Cal.Rptr. 481].)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In reviewing Caltrans\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in excluding Donahue\u2019s testimony, we apply \u201can abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>(Korsak v. Atlas Hotels, Inc. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1516, 1522 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 833].) \u201c \u2018 \u201cIn condemnation proceedings, the trial court is vested with considerable judicial discretion in admitting or rejecting evidence of value.[]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(County Sanitation Dist. </em>v. <em>Watson Land Co. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1282 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 117]; accord, <em>Korsak, </em>at p. 1523 [\u201cA trial court enjoys broad discretion in ruling on foundational matters on which expert testimony is to be based\u201d].) \u201cHowever, the discretion to admit or exclude evidence is not unlimited. \u2018The discretion of a trial judge is not a whimsical, uncontrolled power, but a legal discretion, which is subject to the limitations of legal principles governing the subject of its action, and to reversal on appeal where no reasonable basis for the action is shown. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Korsak, </em>at p. 1523.)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">\n<em>Donahue\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">We state the relevant portions of Donahue\u2019s testimony proffered at the foundational evidentiary hearing and excluded by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Caltrans assigned Donahue to appraise the fair market value of Manchester\u2019s business inventory as of the date of valuation. Specifically, Donahue was to determine the highest fair market value between a willing buyer and a willing seller. In forming his valuation opinion, Donahue followed a legal instruction from Caltrans\u2019s attorney to value Manchester\u2019s inventory at wholesale cost, characterized by Donahue as reflecting \u201cthe removal of profit, which is a future consideration.\u201d Donahue\u2019s assignment also included Caltrans\u2019s counsel\u2019s legal instruction to value the inventory as a bulk sale rather than individual sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">To help him appraise Manchester\u2019s auto parts inventory, Donahue hired three subcontractors (Fiskin, Schulberg and Schulberg\u2019s son) who were familiar with the auto salvage industry and, in particular, with Manchester\u2019s business. On two occasions in November 1996, Donahue and Fiskin went to the site of Manchester\u2019s business, conversed with Manchester\u2019s principals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>and counted, described, photographed and videotaped each item of inventory except for the front end parts that were listed as a group rather than individually upon being described by Donahue\u2019s subcontractors as having only salvage value.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Since Donahue was unaware of any methodology on how to assign a fair market value to auto parts inventory, he sought to determine a methodology \u201cright from the start.\u201d Donahue\u2019s object was to \u201ccome up with the price or the contributory value of the inventory\u201d to Manchester\u2019s business. Thus, after listing Manchester\u2019s inventory items, Donahue and his subcontractors began researching \u201cthe fair market value, or the contributory fair market value of the inventory to the business.\u201d In doing so, Donahue enlisted his subcontractors\u2019 assistance in establishing both the \u201cretail\u201d and \u201ccost\u201d of Manchester\u2019s inventory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Eventually, Donahue developed a specific methodology for appraising Manchester\u2019s business inventory. Donahue\u2019s fair market value for the inventory was based not on \u201cretail,\u201d but instead on the inventory\u2019s \u201cwholesale costs,\u201d \u201cwholesale price\u201d or \u201cwholesale value.\u201d Based upon books, courses and conversations with business valuation appraisers and brokers about how inventory is transferred, Donahue believed the typical way \u201cbusinesses are bought and sold, the way that the inventory is bought and sold on the open market is wholesale cost\u201d that is \u201c[s]ometimes\u201d adjusted \u201cdownward\u201d to \u201ccover for older stock, or stock that\u2019s out of date, or damaged stock. But, certainly wholesale cost is someplace to start.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">However, with respect to valuing Manchester\u2019s auto parts inventory, wholesale value was \u201cdifficult\u201d to ascertain because an appraiser could not \u201ccall around and find out\u201d the wholesale cost of an auto part. Further, since the nature of the business typically involved items dismantled from cars, there was \u201cno set cost.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence, Donahue and his subcontractors first arrived at a \u201cretail price\u201d on their \u201centire list of inventory.\u201d Donahue started at \u201cretail\u201d because it was \u201csomething\u201d that an appraiser could \u201cget a price on\u201d since computer systems had \u201cretail\u201d and other dealers had \u201cretail.\u201d Included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>in such \u201cretail price\u201d were \u201ccosts\u201d consisting of all material and labor costs to acquire/tow/dismantle each vehicle, process Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork, prepare/clean/recondition each part, prepare a written inventory and place the part in stock. After two of Donahue\u2019s subcontractors provided the cost of each inventory item, Donahue and his subcontractors decided which cost to use, \u201cusually\u201d the \u201chighest one.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">After reaching the \u201cretail price,\u201d Donahue removed from such price a \u201ckeystone markup\u201d of 50 percent as the assumed profit. Donahue did so based upon conversations with \u201csix or eight different distributors and dealers\u201d about the \u201ctypical markup\u201d and as consistent with teachings, in business school. In essence, Donahue \u201ctook retail and removed the markup to come up with a wholesale price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">From such \u201cwholesale price,\u201d Donahue then deducted for the percentage of items that his subcontractors opined would not sell in an orderly fashion. Donahue calculated such percentage of inventory items that \u201cwere not going to sell\u201d or \u201clikely\u201d would not sell on a line-item basis. Although Donahue\u2019s subcontractors were unable to tell how long Manchester would hold any particular item of inventory before selling it, Donahue used the \u201cnumber that benefited\u201d Manchester in \u201cvirtually\u201d every instance, to wit, \u201cthe highest possible percent that would sell.\u201d The adjustment for inventory items that would not sell was warranted by the presence of \u201ca lot of inventory\u201d unlikely ever \u201cto sell,\u201d a problem encountered in valuing a \u201ctremendous amount of inventory at an auto salvage yard.\u201d Further, a buyer of the entire business \u201cwould not be willing to pay wholesale price on every asset in that yard, because that buyer isn\u2019t going to sell every asset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">After determining the amount of Manchester\u2019s inventory that would not sell at retail, Donahue calculated the portion of such inventory that would sell at liquidation value. Donahue \u201capplied an orderly liquidation value to the items that were unlikely to sell, which is basically what the business would have to liquidate those items for.\u201d Finally, Donahue arrived at the fair market value of the inventory by adding the liquidation value to the wholesale value that had been reduced based upon the percentage of possible sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>In sum, Donahue took the \u201cretail price\u201d of Manchester\u2019s inventory items, including all costs incurred by Manchester in preparing the items for sale, removed the profit from such price to reach the wholesale value, deducted for the percentage of items that would not sell, applied a liquidation price to those items, and then added the liquidation price to the downward adjusted wholesale price to reach a fair market value reflecting market value on the open market.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, consistent with the legal instructions of Caltrans\u2019s counsel, Donahue\u2019s opinion of the overall fair market value of Manchester\u2019s inventory contemplated a theoretical bulk sale of the entirety of Manchester\u2019s business, including its inventory, to a theoretical buyer who would need a cushion to make a profit on resale of such inventory and would thus refuse to pay retail.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">\n<em>Trial Court Ruling Excluding Donahue\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">In excluding Donahue\u2019s testimony, the court stated: \u201cI do not believe that the instruction that he was given correctly states the duty of an expert who\u2019s asked to make a fair-market valuation for purposes of an eminent domain proceeding. I think that is stated in the statute. And clearly an instruction that he was given varies from it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">The court also stated there was \u201ca second issue that would require me to exclude the testimony. Even if the instruction were legally accurate, I do not believe that factual testimony was offered to support the . . . position that with respect to this business and its unique inventory, that one would value the inventory in the manner which the witness did value it. [\u00b6] He testified that typically in businesses, there is a keystone, a hundred-percent markup. In other words, wholesale would be 50 percent. And he gave as an example clothes at a clothing store. His basis did not relate to the specifics of this industry. Indeed his example is very similar to the example in <em>[McMahan\u2019s, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d 683]. I think that, as a factual matter, he did not present a factual basis for supporting an opinion that one makes a 50-percent reduction. [\u00b6] He indicated he talked to six or eight distributors and dealers with regard to removing the [retail] markup. Didn\u2019t identify who those were. Didn\u2019t identify what industries those were. And there\u2019s no basis to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>that those individuals or those industries are applicable in this record to the salvage business that\u2019s in question here, [\u00b6] In short, I do not believe that there\u2019s a basis upon which he can express to a jury that a willing buyer and willing seller would strike a transaction on the basis that he testified.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Caltrans contends the court abused its discretion in excluding from the jury\u2019s consideration Donahue\u2019s appraisal method and resulting valuation opinion as based upon an improper legal standard and lacking foundation. On this record the court should have permitted Donahue to testify to the jury at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">\n<em>Applicable Legal Standard for Determining Fair Market Value</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">Asserting its counsel properly instructed inventory appraiser Donahue to value Manchester\u2019s business inventory as a bulk sale and at wholesale, Caltrans contends the court erred in excluding Donahue\u2019s testimony based upon the ground that counsel\u2019s instructions to Donahue incorrectly stated the standard for determining fair market value. We conclude the court should have found that Caltrans\u2019s counsel\u2019s instructions to Donahue were not inconsistent with California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">\n<em>Court\u2019s Pretrial Rulings on Valuation Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">Preliminarily, Caltrans contends the court erred to the extent that Judge Thomas\u2019s initial rulings and Judge Selna\u2019s interpretation of those rulings purported to bar any consideration of the wholesale value of Manchester\u2019s inventory. However, the record reveals that despite Judge Thomas\u2019s rulings, Judge Selna permitted Caltrans to attempt to establish through Donahue\u2019s proffered testimony that wholesale value could properly be considered in determining Manchester\u2019s inventory\u2019s fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>As noted, Judge Thomas\u2019s initial minute order stated that the jury would be instructed with the statutory definition of fair market value (\u00a7 1263.320); the wholesale limit placed on the fair market standard in <em>McMahan\u2019s, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d 683, was not appropriate to Manchester\u2019s circumstances; and Manchester could introduce evidence of the sale value to the public. In later clarifying his initial minute order, Judge Thomas reaffirmed section 1263.320\u2019s definition of fair market value and distinguished <em>McMahan\u2019s </em>facts from those here.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Eventually, when the matter came on for trial, Judge Selna concurred with Judge Thomas that the jury should be given the statutory definition of fair market value and that Manchester could introduce its inventory items\u2019 retail price as evidence of fair market value. However, although observing that Judge Thomas\u2019s initial minute order and later clarification did not exclude evidence of wholesale value as a matter of law, Judge Selna noted that Judge Thomas had seemed to do so in his colloquy with counsel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Judge Selna also noted the difference between using the wholesale value as the sole measure of fair market value as a matter of law and considering evidence of wholesale value as a component of an \u201coverall analysis\u201d to reach fair market value. With respect to whether the jury could hear evidence of \u201csome lesser value than full retail, assuming that there\u2019s competent evidence supporting [such lesser value] as a potential indicator of what a willing buyer, willing seller would negotiate,\u201d Judge Selna stated it was not clear \u201cas a matter of law\u201d that Caltrans \u201cwould be unable to show that there is competent evidence that... a fair market transaction might take place at some price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>other than 100 percent retail.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Judge Selna also expressed his reluctance to preclude Caltrans from putting on such evidence and \u201cattempting to make a showing that it constitutes what a willing buyer or willing seller would negotiate.\u201d Similarly, Judge Selna stated Caltrans should \u201chave a chance to prove that wholesale, however it\u2019s defined, is a price at which the market would entertain a transaction between a willing buyer, and a willing seller. . . . Once I\u2019ve heard the proof, it may be unsustainable opinion. . . . But, at this point I\u2019m not willing to basically preclude their expert entirely.\u201d Although expressing his concern whether Donahue could \u201clay the foundation,\u201d Judge Selna stated he was \u201cwilling to give him a chance. And I guess I\u2019m persuaded probably the better way to do that is to have a 402 hearing. And I think we ought to do that at the outset.\u201d Judge Selna also stated he wanted to give Donahue \u201chis shot, and I\u2019m prepared to do that out of the presence of the jury.\u201d Finally, Judge Selna stated: If Donahue \u201ccan present evidence going back to the standard under which the jury has to be instructed, that\u2019s competent, . . . I\u2019ll let him present that to the jury. [\u00b6] But my focus is, I don\u2019t care what methodology you adopt, it\u2019s got to be tied back in order to go to the jury in a credible fashion, the issue of what would a willing buyer and a willing seller do. [\u00b6] Methodologies, formulas in the abstract I don\u2019t think really get to that issue. You\u2019ve got to link to what the willing buyer and willing seller would do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Judge Selna then proceeded to conduct a hearing on whether there was a sufficient evidentiary foundation for Caltrans\u2019s inventory appraiser Donahue to present to the jury his opinion of the fair market value of Manchester\u2019s inventory reached through considering the inventory\u2019s wholesale value. At the outset of the foundational hearing, Judge Selna told Caltrans: \u201cAll I want you to do is to put on your prima facie valuation case. And you can do it in abbreviated fashion.\u201d Further, although stating he was bound by Judge Thomas\u2019s prior ruling and found it supported by the evidence presented, Judge Selna characterized such ruling as \u201csimply\u201d that \u201cthe wholesale value may not be used as a limiting factor, or a cap.\u201d Finally, Judge Selna stated he was \u201cstruggling with\u201d an issue he hoped would be addressed in Donahue\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>examination, to wit, \u201cwhether there is any basis for accepting testimony that a willing buyer and a willing seller would settle on wholesale, as a function of the marketplace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Caltrans contends the rationale of <em>McMahan\u2019s, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d 683\u2014that the proper measure of fair market value of a retailer\u2019s inventory damaged by a governmental entity is its wholesale value on the date of taking\u2014was applicable to this case even though Manchester\u2019s inventory consisted of recycled and refurbished auto parts rather than model stock furniture.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Caltrans contends that in assertedly barring consideration of wholesale value, Judge Thomas\u2019s initial minute order and later clarification erroneously concluded the retailer\u2019s business in <em>McMahan\u2019s </em>was distinguishable factually from Manchester\u2019s auto parts business. Caltrans notes that, like the retailer in <em>McMahan\u2019s, </em>Manchester relied upon a continuous source of supply and provided an end-product for sale at retail prices to the public. Further, asserting Manchester\u2019s inventory consisted of nonunique auto parts similar to the \u201cmodel stock\u201d carried by the retailer in <em>McMahan\u2019s, </em>Caltrans contends that at a minimum the question was for the jury whether Manchester\u2019s auto parts were truly unique and not readily replaceable. Caltrans thus concludes Judge Thomas\u2019s asserted factual and legal errors contributed to Judge Selna\u2019s exclusion of Donahue\u2019s valuation opinion at the foundational evidentiary hearing. Moreover, in any event, regardless whether the facts in <em>McMahan\u2019s </em>were essentially similar to those here, Caltrans contends Donahue properly considered as a component of Manchester\u2019s inventory items their \u201cretail price,\u201d including all costs of readying those items for sale, and correctly declined under <em>McMahan\u2019s </em>to include in the inventory\u2019s fair market value Manchester\u2019s profit or \u201cmarkup\u201d of such retail price above Manchester\u2019s costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">However, Judge Thomas\u2019s pretrial rulings were superseded insofar as Judge Selna made his own interpretations of those rulings as well as rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>of his own. As discussed, to the extent Judge Thomas\u2019s initial minute order and later clarification could have been interpreted as precluding as a matter of law any evidence of the wholesale value of Manchester\u2019s business inventory, the record reveals that Judge Selna did not proceed under that interpretation. Instead, Judge Selna deferred any ruling on the admissibility of evidence of wholesale value until Caltrans\u2019s inventory appraiser Donahue had the opportunity to present evidence indicating a willing buyer and a willing seller would agree to a market transaction at wholesale value. In sum, although concurring in some of Judge Thomas\u2019s findings, Judge Selna did not preclude as a matter of law all evidence of wholesale valuation. Indeed, on several occasions in the trial court, Manchester\u2019s counsel argued to Judge Selna that Judge Thomas\u2019s rulings were not being given sufficient deference. Specifically, Manchester\u2019s counsel argued that Judge Thomas had stated that Caltrans could not \u201cfactor\u201d into its opinion \u201cthe wholesale value of this inventory. It\u2019s a direct erosion of Judge Thomas\u2019 ruling.\u201d Manchester\u2019s counsel also told Judge Selna: \u201cI know Your Honor has tentatively ruled on the wholesale issue. I guess I have a discomfort level as to how that squares with what Judge Thomas ruled, and how wholesale, by any market definition, can be fair market value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">In sum, contrary to Caltrans\u2019s contentions, Judge Selna did not rule as a matter of law that evidence of Manchester\u2019s inventory\u2019s wholesale value was inadmissible for any purpose or that the inventory\u2019s retail value was the only proper measure of fair market value. However, as we shall explain, although properly permitting Donahue to attempt to establish his wholesale value methodology as an appropriate measure of the fair market value of Manchester\u2019s inventory, Judge Selna erred in concluding that Donahue\u2019s reliance on Caltrans\u2019s counsel\u2019s assertedly incorrect instructions to value the inventory as a bulk sale and at wholesale rendered Donahue\u2019s testimony excludable as based on a method inconsistent with the legal standard for determining fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">\n<em>Donahue\u2019s Opinion Testimony was Consistent with Legal Valuation Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">\u201cValuation methods differ with the nature of the business and the purpose for which the evaluation is conducted.\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v. Leslie, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 923.) The Eminent Domain Law provides: \u201cCompensation shall be awarded for the property taken.

The Eminent Domain Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>also provides: \u201cThe fair market value of property taken for which there is no relevant, comparable market is its value on the date of valuation as determined by any method of valuation that is just and equitable.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1263.320, subd. (b).) Similarly, Evidence Code section 823 provides: \u201c[T]he value of property for which there is no relevant, comparable market may be determined by any method of valuation that is just and equitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Donahue testified he was assigned to determine the highest fair market value between a willing buyer and a willing seller of Manchester\u2019s business inventory as of the date of valuation; such assignment included a legal instruction to value the inventory as a bulk sale rather than individual sales; and the assignment also included a legal instruction to determine a fair market value based on the inventory\u2019s wholesale cost or price through removal of the \u201cfuture consideration\u201d of profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">In <em>McMahan\u2019s, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d 683, the appellate court approved a standard for evaluating the fair market value of retail inventory using wholesale value based upon replacement cost. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 701.) At the foundational hearing here, Donahue testified that since he was unaware of any precise methodology on how to assign a fair market value to auto parts inventory, he developed a specific methodology for appraising Manchester\u2019s business inventory based on its \u201cwholesale costs,\u201d \u201cwholesale price,\u201d or \u201cwholesale value.\u201d From books, courses and conversations with business valuation appraisers and brokers about how inventory is valued, Donahue believed that with respect to the sale and purchase of a business, wholesale cost was the way inventory was bought and sold on the open market. Donahue also believed it was difficult to ascertain the wholesale value of auto parts inventory such as Manchester\u2019s because an appraiser could not simply \u201ccall around\u201d to find the wholesale cost of an auto part since such items were typically dismantled from cars and there was \u201cno set cost.\u201d Similarly, Manchester\u2019s appraiser Crockett ultimately testified at trial that there was \u201cno such thing as a wholesale price\u201d throughout the \u201cindustry.\u201d Further, Donahue\u2019s methodology of determining a inventory item\u2019s retail price, including Manchester\u2019s costs of acquisition/preparation for resale, and then deducting a profit markup to reach a wholesale price, was not inconsistent with California law as set forth in <em>McMahan\u2019s. </em>Hence, we cannot say that Donahue\u2019s method was facially unjust or inequitable. <em>(People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v. Leslie, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 923; Code Civ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1263.310, 1263.320, subd.

Watson Land Co., supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 1282.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Moreover, since by stipulation Manchester had been compensated for all other components of the business taken in its entirety by Caltrans, Donahue\u2019s determination of the bulk fair market value of Manchester\u2019s inventory in the context of a sale of the entire business by a willing seller to a willing buyer was not facially unjust, inequitable or otherwise proscribed by law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, Manchester\u2019s inventory appraiser Crockett ultimately testified at trial that if a buyer went into Manchester\u2019s business and said he was willing to buy the entire inventory, such buyer \u201cprobably would not\u201d pay retail prices to a willing seller.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, whether the specific circumstances of Manchester\u2019s business warranted application of Donahue\u2019s methodology was a factual question for the jury. However, although any \u201cjust and equitable\u201d method could be proper, the jury would remain \u201cfree to accept or reject\u201d Donahue\u2019s valuation. <em>(People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v. Leslie, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 923.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">In sum, in assigning Donahue to appraise the fair market value of Manchester\u2019s business inventory as of the date of valuation, Caltrans properly told Donahue to determine the highest fair market value between a willing buyer and a willing seller. Further, Caltrans\u2019s counsel also properly instructed Donahue to value the inventory as a bulk sale and at wholesale. Caltrans\u2019s counsel\u2019s instruction to Donahue was consistent with California law. Although based upon facts differing in some respects from those here, <em>McMahan\u2019s, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d 683, established that valuing retail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>inventory at wholesale in the context of a bulk sale was within the bounds of proper appraisal methodology. Caltrans\u2019s instruction to Donahue was also consistent with the eventual trial testimony of Manchester\u2019s inventory appraiser Crockett that a willing buyer of the entirety of Manchester\u2019s inventory would likely pay a price less than retail. Moreover, although the record suggests Judge Selna was primarily concerned that Caltrans might have instructed Donahue to come to a conclusion he would not have otherwise reached, Donahue\u2019s own testimony indicated the contrary. Specifically, Donahue testified to his own belief based upon sources independent of Caltrans that inventory was typically bought and sold at wholesale cost when an entire business was transferred. Hence, since Caltrans\u2019s counsel\u2019s legal instructions to Donahue were not erroneous and Donahue did not use a valuation methodology proscribed by law, we conclude Judge Selna abused his discretion to the extent he excluded the entirety of Donahue\u2019s testimony as based upon those legal instructions.

Atlas Hotels, Inc., supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1522-1523.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">As discussed, Donahue testified he arrived at his valuation opinion by determining the retail value of the inventory items based in part upon Manchester\u2019s costs with respect to those items, removing a 50 percent profit markup from such retail value to reach the wholesale value, deducting for the percentage of items that would not sell, applying a liquidation price to those items, and then adding that liquidation value to the downward adjusted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>wholesale value to get to the fair market value. In excluding Donahue\u2019s testimony, the court stated there was an insufficient evidentiary foundation for Donahue\u2019s valuation opinion, particularly with respect to removing from the inventory items\u2019 retail price a 50 percent markup based upon conversations with unidentified distributors and dealers about practices in unidentified industries. However, Donahue\u2019s testimony at the foundational evidentiary hearing provided an adequate foundation for his opinion of the fair market value of Manchester\u2019s inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Evidence Code section 801 limited Donahue\u2019s expert opinion testimony on the value of Manchester\u2019s business inventory to an opinion based on matter \u201cof a type that reasonably may be relied upon by experts in forming an opinion upon the subject to which his testimony relates. In large measure, this assures the reliability and trustworthiness of the information used by experts in forming their opinions.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B pt. 3 West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code (1995 ed.) foll. \u00a7 801, p. 21.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>\n                   \u201cAlthough the courts have rejected expert opinions '[w]here the basis of the opinion is unreliable hearsay,\u2019 . . . nevertheless, hearsay information of a type <em>reasonably relied upon </em>by professionals in the field in forming an opinion on the subject may be used to support an expert opinion, even though not admissible in court. . . .\u201d <em>(Korsak v. Atlas Hotels, Inc., supra, </em>2 Cal.App,4th at p. 1524, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Donahue testified he read books, attended courses and conversed with business valuation appraisers and brokers to determine how inventory was sold. Donahue also testified that based upon conversations with \u201csix or eight different distributors and dealers\u201d about the \u201ctypical markup\u201d and as consistent with teachings in business school, he removed from the retail price of Manchester\u2019s inventory items a \u201ckeystone markup\u201d of 50 percent as the assumed profit. In general, experts may reasonably rely on such sources in forming their opinions. However, the \u201creasonableness of an expert\u2019s reliance is a question of degree, and may well vary with the circumstances.\u201d <em>(Buckwalter v. Airline Training Center </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 547, 553-554 [184 Cal.Rptr. 659].) As discussed, appraisal of salvage auto parts indisputably presented a challenge as devoid of any precisely prescribed method for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>valuing such inventory items. Further, although the court faulted Donahue for not identifying the distributors and dealers he consulted about removing the retail markup and not identifying the industries they considered, Donahue\u2019s testimony was given at a foundational evidentiary hearing where the court had stated it wanted Caltrans to put on only \u201cin abbreviated fashion\u201d its \u201cprima facie valuation case.\u201d Under these circumstances, before excluding Donahue\u2019s entire testimony for its lack of specificity with respect to the identities of sources and industries, the court should have, at a minimum, asked Caltrans for an offer of proof. Moreover, in any event, such lack of specificity in Donahue\u2019s testimony simply affected the testimony\u2019s weight and could have been probed in cross-examination at trial. <em>(Ventura County Flood Control Dist. v. Security First Nat. Bank, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.3d at p. 1004; <em>San Bernardino County Flood Control Dist. v. Sweet, supra, </em>255 Cal.App.2d at p. 902.)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">On this record the jury was entitled to weigh the import and credibility of Donahue\u2019s testimony about the \u201ckeystone markup\u201d of 50 percent above wholesale cost. <em>(Buckwalter v. Airline Training Center, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d at pp. 553-554.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, since Donahue\u2019s opinion testimony about the fair market value of Manchester\u2019s business inventory was founded upon matters sufficient to form a proper basis for such opinion, we conclude Judge Selna abused his discretion in excluding such testimony. <em>(Korsak v.

However, in determining the values of Manchester\u2019s inventory items, Donahue did not consider the fact that Manchester sold those items to anyone who would buy them.

You buy it at wholesale, so that you can mark up the retail, and turn a profit.\u201d Counsel had also argued that if Caltrans paid Manchester retail for the inventory, Manchester would receive an \u201cabsolute windfall\u201d by not having to pay any of the normal business operating expenses (i.e., rent, salaries, utilities, advertising) for the future years it would have taken for Manchester to sell such inventory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b838-7\">In <em>McMahan\u2019s, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d 683, the appellate court stated: \u201cThe wholesale standard which we adopt in this decision is consistent with section 911, comment d, of the Restatement of the Law of Torts (1939) which provides as follows at pages 566-567: \u2018d. Wholesale or retail value. From the time when a chattel is manufactured to the time of its actual use, there may be many markets in which it is sold. Thus, different prices are paid by the wholesaler, the retail dealer and the consumer. Since the measure of recovery is determined by the harm done, the market which determines the measure of recovery by a person whose goods have been taken, destroyed or detained is that to which he would have to resort in order to replace the subject matter. Thus the consumer can recover the retail price; the retail dealer, the wholesale price. The manufacturer, who does not buy in a market, receives his selling price. Damages for the profits which the wholesale dealer or the retail dealer would normally anticipate from a sale are not ordinarily allowed. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 700-701, italics omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\">In <em>County Sanitation Dist. v.

Further, the \u201cweight to be given a method or approach to an opinion or determination of market value should be considered in the light of the views of the hypothetical buyer and seller respecting the results from the use of that method or approach and the factors considered in applying it to the circumstances at hand [citations].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 974.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b841-10\">Caltrans acknowledges that since Manchester\u2019s salvage auto parts had been enhanced in value by refurbishment, Donahue properly considered such enhanced value as would a prospective buyer. However, Caltrans contends any higher potential value resulting from retail sales of the refurbished items could not properly be considered as a measure of fair market value because inclusion of retail value would impermissibly result in a windfall to Manchester. <em>(McMahan\u2019s, supra, 146 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 700.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Evidence Code section 801 provides: \u201cIf a witness is testifying as an expert, his testimony in the form of an opinion is limited to such an opinion as is: ffl] . . .
