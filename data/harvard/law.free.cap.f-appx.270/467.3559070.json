In <em>United States v. Bass, </em>478 F.3d 948 (8th Cir.2007), we reversed the district court\u2019s order granting Mr. Bass a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>on a charge of conspiracy to distribute drugs and remanded the case for sentencing. In the present appeal, Mr. Bass asserts that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to convict him. But, as we observed in the previous appeal, a police officer testified that Mr. Bass confessed to him and there was overwhelming testimony tending to show Mr. Bass\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy. <em>See id. </em>at 952. The credibility of that testimony was a matter for the jury. Our previous holding is binding on us as the law of the case, and moreover we detect no error in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
