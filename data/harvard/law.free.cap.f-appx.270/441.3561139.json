After examining the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); Cir. R. 34(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b465-22\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b465-23\">This court affirmed Ronnie Barlow\u2019s conviction almost four years ago. Since then his sentence has remained in dispute. The Supreme Court remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We asked the district judge whether <em>Booker </em>would affect Barlow\u2019s sentence. See <em>United States v. Pala-dino, </em>401 F.3d 471, 481-85 (7th Cir.2005). The judge\u2019s affirmative answer led to a remand for resentencing. The new sentence, 240 months, is 84 months lower than the original sentence, and well below the bottom of the range calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines. It is presumptively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-24\">Nonetheless, Barlow maintains on this latest appeal, the sentence remains unreasonably high. He complains, for example, that the judge determined the quantity of cocaine for which he is culpable, though the jury\u2019s verdict just set a minimum of five kilograms. There is no problem in judicial decisions on a preponderance of the evidence, as the Court explained in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and the remedial portion of <em>Booker. </em>Barlow\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tention that <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007), changes this rule is one that we have considered and rejected before. See <em>United States v. Roti, </em>484 F.3d 934, 937 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Savage, </em>505 F.3d 754, 764 (7th Cir.2007). Barlow\u2019s further contention that a sentencing judge must address on the record all non-frivolous arguments made in support of a lower sentence is incompatible with <em>Rita.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">We note that <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), does not affect Barlow\u2019s case. His offense level depends on the powder cocaine that he distributed and not the smaller quantity of crack included in his relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Barlow\u2019s sentence is reasonable and is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
