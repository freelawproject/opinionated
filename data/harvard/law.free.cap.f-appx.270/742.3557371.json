McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b766-25\">On May 29, 2007, Adon Navor Rivas-Gonzalez, a native and citizen of Mexico, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>pleaded guilty to one count of reentry of a removed alien having previously been convicted of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and' (b)(2). He was sentenced to serve a term of 27 months\u2019 imprisonment, the bottom of his advisory range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and timely appealed. His counsel, James P. Baiamonte, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, filed an <em>Anders </em>brief and moved to withdraw as counsel. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Under <em>Anders, </em>a court-appointed defense counsel who believes that an appeal would be \u201cwholly frivolous\u201d may withdraw only upon submission of a brief to the client and the court indicating \u201canything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. The defendant \u201cmay then choose to submit arguments to the court.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir.2005). If we conclude, after a full examination of the record before us, that the appeal is frivolous, we will grant the motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. M; <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Mr. Rivas-Gonzalez has submitted no brief of his own, and the government declined to submit a reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief mentions one possible basis for appeal, namely, that although Mr. Rivas-Gonzalez received the minimum Guidelines sentence, the Guidelines are now advisory and he \u201ccould argue that his sentence was unreasonable and that the district judge did not adequately consider the statutory concerns other than the advisory guidelines expressed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">In reality, this sets out two potential claims. First, that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable, in that the district court failed \u2018\u201cto consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Verdin-Garcia, </em>516 F.3d 884, 895 (10th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Second, that the sentence was substantively unreasonable \u201cgiven all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Conlan, </em>500 F.3d 1167, 1169 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">The transcript of the sentencing hearing and the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion on sentencing reveal that the court fully considered the statutory factors. It expressly discussed most of them, including \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), even though procedural reasonableness does not require that the district court \u201cmarch through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing factors\u201d when rendering a sentence within the Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Rines, </em>419 F.3d 1104, 1107 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">Considered substantively, within-Guidelines sentences are presumed to be reasonable, <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1054 (10th Cir.2006), and our substantive review of a sentence is for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Angel-Guzman, </em>506 F.3d 1007, 1014-15 (10th Cir.2007). Here, as the district court recognized, nothing in Mr. Rivas-Gonzalez\u2019s case suggests that a within-Guidelines sentence would be unreasonable. The court acknowledged that it had authority to vary from the Guidelines, and took account of Mr. Rivas-Gonzalez\u2019s proffered reasons for a downward variance: that he had come to this country only for economic betterment and to support his family, that he has been employed, that his prior felony conviction for drag trafficking did not involve violence or firearms, and that he had been released from prison on that charge having served only eight months of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>a one-year sentence. On this basis, we see no plausible grounds for arguing that imposing a bottom-of-the-range 27-month sentence was beyond the district court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We have carefully reviewed the record, and are satisfied that there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal. We therefore GRANT Mr. Baiamonte\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal. It is ORDERED, that the docket of this case shall be amended to reflect Mr. Rivas-Gonzalez\u2019s correct middle name as \u201cNavor\u201d instead of \u201cNavoz.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b766-14\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
