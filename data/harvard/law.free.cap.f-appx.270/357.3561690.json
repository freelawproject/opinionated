Hunt filed a Fed. R.Crv.P. 60(b) motion to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition, and he also filed a motion for recusal of the district court and a magistrate judge. Hunt now challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motions, and moves this Court for authorization to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-21\">Hunt argues that he should not have to obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion. Hunt\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion did not merely seek authorization for out-of-time appeal. Rather, he raised several claims related to the judgment dismissing his \u00a7 2254 petition. Consequently, the COA requirement applies to his appeal from the judgment denying his Rule 60(b) motion. <em>Ochoa Canales v. Quarterman, </em>507 F.3d 884, 887-88 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-22\">Hunt will not receive a COA unless he makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Hunt has not made this showing with respect to any of the claims raised in his Rule 60(b) motion. To the contrary, he has abandoned these claims by failing to brief them. <em>Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999). Consequently, we DENY Hunt a COA on claims related to the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-23\">Hunt is correct in arguing that he is not required to obtain a COA to appeal the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>district court\u2019s denial of his motion to re-cuse. <em>Trevino v. Johnson, </em>168 F.3d 173, 176-78 (5th Cir.1999). However, Hunt has abandoned his claims related to the propriety of this decision by failing to brief them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). The district court\u2019s judgment denying Hunt\u2019s motion to recuse is AFFIRMED. Hunt\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
