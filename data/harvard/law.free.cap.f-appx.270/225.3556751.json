On February 13, 2007, the BIA issued a second decision in which it vacated the IJ\u2019s finding that Petitioners\u2019 asylum application was frivolous, but reaffirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of relief. We now hold that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-17\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). We apply an \u201cextremely deferential\u201d substantial evidence standard to the BIA\u2019s findings of fact. <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 223 (3d Cir.2004). Accordingly, we will reverse the BIA\u2019s determinations on issues like past persecution, the likelihood of future persecution, and the likelihood of torture only if \u201cthe evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 484 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-18\">We uphold an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations \u201cif they are supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 212, 216 (3d Cir.2005). Where an IJ makes an adverse credibility finding, he/she must supply specific, cogent reasons for concluding that the petitioner is not credible. <em>Ga-buniya v. Attorney General, </em>463 F.3d 316, 321 (3d Cir.2006). In addition, the IJ\u2019s conclusions must be based on the record, not on \u201cconjecture or speculation.\u201d <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 249-250 (3d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Petitioners claim that they will be harmed and persecuted in Indonesia on account of their religion and ethnicity. They offered evidence relating to a sexual assault on Tjio in a shopping mall in Indonesia. They also testified to subsequent threats and attempts to extort money from Petitioners by a security guard and a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The IJ dismissed Petitioners\u2019 application for asylum because it was not filed within one year of their entering the United States and neither Petitioner could establish changed or extraordinary circumstances. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2). The IJ also denied withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. In doing so, he noted several inconsistencies and contradictions between Tjio\u2019s written applications, her affidavit, and her hearing testimony, as well as other perceived problems with both Petitioners\u2019 testimony. The IJ found that both Tjio and Soesanto were \u201ctotally incredible\u201d and ruled that they had submitted a frivolous application. Alternatively, the IJ held that even if their testimony was believed, they had not established past persecution or a \u201cclear probability of [future] persecution.\u201d Finally, the IJ held that the country reports and other materials submitted by Petitioners did not establish a pattern or practice of persecution of Chinese Christians in Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The BIA initially upheld all of the IJ\u2019s findings in a two-paragraph <em>per curiam </em>order dated July 24, 2005. On February 13, 2007, the BIA issued a second opinion and order addressing Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen and reconsider.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therein, the BIA addressed their challenge to the adverse credibility finding and Petitioners\u2019 argument that their due process rights had been violated by the IJ\u2019s conduct of their hearings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The BIA ruled that Judge Fer-lise had not acted improperly. Specifically the BIA noted that the IJ\u2019s \u201cdecision focused on inconsistencies and was often repetitive in describing the credibility problems he saw; however, this does not rise to a violation of due process nor does it establish clear error.\u201d Supp.App. at 3. The BIA also found that even though the IJ took \u201ca direct role in questioning,\u201d there was no evidence of \u201cbadgering or bullying\u201d such as we have previously noted. <em>Id. </em>The BIA acknowledged that Judge Ferlise had been reprimanded in several cases, but observed that \u201cone cannot simply assume that he lacked decorum in every case before him.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">The BIA also found that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not based on speculation or conjecture, but rather \u201cinvolved conflicting statements in [Tjio]\u2019s written statements and her testimony about the specifics surrounding [her] claim of persecution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s finding that Petitioners\u2019 asylum claim was time-barred, and the Board reaffirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. The BIA explained that, regardless of Petitioners\u2019 credibility, the incidents they described \u201cdo not establish past persecution and are insufficient to establish that it is more likely than not the respondents will be persecuted or tortured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>if returned to Indonesia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. (citing <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1238, 1240 (3d Cir. 1993)). The BIA did, however, vacate the IJ\u2019s finding that Petitioners\u2019 asylum application was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">As a threshold matter, we do not have statutory authority to review the findings that the asylum application is time-barred. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). <em>See also Bonhome-tre v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 442 (3d Cir.2005) (aliens cannot seek review of a claim not presented to the Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The BIA\u2019s denial of Petitioners\u2019 application for withholding is supported by substantial evidence. Petitioners bear the burden of proving that they will more likely than not face persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). As noted by the BIA, persecution \u201cconnotes extreme behavior\u201d such as \u201cthreats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.\u201d Supp.App. at 4 (quoting <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The BIA did not clearly err in finding that the incidents described by Tjio and Soesanto do not establish past persecution and are insufficient to establish that it is more likely than not that the respondents will be persecuted or tortured if returned to Indonesia. Moreover, our independent review of their due process claim confirms the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the IJ\u2019s behavior fell short of \u201cbadgering and bullying\u201d the Petitioners. We agree, however, that his conduct of the hearing was certainly not a model of decorum. Nevertheless, the BIA correctly concluded that \u201cmost of the discrepancies on which the Immigration Judge relied to find the respondents incredible were revealed during cross-examination when the Immigration Judge was less interruptive.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Even assuming that Petitioners\u2019 testimony is credible, there is still substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s holding that they did not establish a pattern or practice of persecution. <em>See also Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 536-38 (3d Cir.2005) (substantial evidence supported findings that harms to an ethnic Chinese citizen of Indonesia were not so severe as to constitute persecution, and that a pattern or practice of persecution was not established). They certainly underwent hardships, harassment and discrimination. Their plight was aggravated by official corruption on the part of the police. However, we explained in <em>Fatin v. I.N.S., </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1239 (3d Cir.1993), that much more is needed to sustain a claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">Petitioners\u2019 brief does not provide any separate analysis of their CAT claim. However, it is clear from the record that them CAT claim is far weaker than the withholding of removal claim and that it was properly rejected. The mistreatment that they described falls woefully short of \u201ctorture.\u201d <em>See Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157,182-83 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">Accordingly, we will deny the Petition for Review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-13\">. Petitioner Soesanto initially claimed eligibility for relief as a derivative of Tjio\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. He subsequently filed his own application and the IJ held joint hearings on their applications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-14\">. Petitioners argue that the Board erred in failing to consider a Motion to Hold Decision in Abeyance \"that has not been included in the Administrative Record.\u201d Petitioners\u2019 Br. at 10. Our review is limited to the administrative record, and we may not consider the Board\u2019s failure to rule on a motion that is not included in that record. <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228 (3d Cir.2003) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\">. In the meantime. Petitioners sought review of the BIA's first order. Their Petitions have been consolidated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\">. Relying in part on cases in which we have criticized Judge Ferlise\u2019s conduct. <em>See Cham v. Attorney General, </em>445 F.3d 683 (3d Cir. 2006); <em>Shah v. Attorney General, </em>446 F.3d 429 (3d Cir.2006); <em>Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627 (3d Cir.2006); <em>Fiadjoe v. Attorney General, </em>411 F.3d 135 (3d Cir.2005), Petitioners argued to the BIA that Immigration Judge Ferlise had acted improperly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\">. The transcript of direct examination reveals that a majority of the questions came from the IJ rather than Petitioners\u2019 attorney. At times the transcript reads more like an interrogation than a hearing. Nonetheless, the BIA\u2019s decision to uphold the adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence in this instance. Moreover, as we have explained, the record would not support relief even if we accept Petitioners' testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
