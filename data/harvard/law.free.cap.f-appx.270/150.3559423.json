We granted a certificate of appealability to consider whether the state trial court\u2019s failure to convene a hearing regarding the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper use of peremptory challenges violated Hernandez\u2019s rights to equal protection and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court found that Hernandez\u2019s request for a <em>\u201cGilmore </em>hearing\u201d was a state law claim not subject to federal habeas review. We also asked the parties to address whether Hernandez\u2019s claim was properly exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-19\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the facts and proceedings below, we will not revisit them here. When considering habeas petitions, federal district courts are confined to determining whether a conviction violated the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). Insofar as a petitioner challenges the correctness of an application of state law without alleging a deprivation of any federal right, he may not obtain habeas relief. <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 119, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 788 (1982). Conversely, dismissal of state constitutional claims does not preclude federal habeas review of analogous federal constitutional claims. <em>Simmons v. Beyer, </em>44 F.3d 1160, 1166 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Here, Hernandez articulated his claim almost entirely as one of state constitutional law when he requested a <em>Gilmore </em>hearing and referenced the New Jersey Constitution. Hernandez also set forth a federal constitutional claim when he argued in his petition for writ of habeas corpus that \u201c[t]he lower courts[sic] failure to grant a <em>Gilmore </em>hearing in this matter violated petitioner\u2019s right to due process and a fair trial as guaranteed by ... the Constitution of the United States 14th Amendment.\u201d Likewise, in his supplemental habeas petition, Hernandez noted that <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), holds that the use of peremptory challenges to exclude jurors based on their race violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hernandez claimed that \u201cthe trial judge did not want to deal with this issue\u201d and denied his request for a hearing \u201con an issue that needed direct participation from the prosecutor to make a determination as to whether a clear and concise reason existed for the peremptory challenges made.\u201d Hernandez\u2019s reference to the Equal Protection Clause, coupled with his citation to <em>Batson, </em>is sufficient to state a federal constitutional claim that is cognizable under the federal habeas statute. <em>See, e.g., Brinson v. Vaughn, </em>398 F.3d 225 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">We turn to the question of exhaustion, which requires a habeas petitioner to \u201cgive the state courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d <em>O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 845, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999). In addition, federal constitutional claims must be \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state courts. <em>Baldwin v. Reese, </em>541 U.S. 27, 29, 124 S.Ct. 1347, 158 L.Ed.2d 64 (2004). A petitioner has \u201cfairly presented\u201d his claim if he presented the same factual and legal basis for the claim to the state courts in such a way as to place them \u201con notice that a federal claim is being asserted.\u201d <em>McCandless v. Vaughn, </em>172 F.3d 255, 261 (3d Cir.1999). After the District Court dismissed Hernandez\u2019s petition, we explained that to exhaust his claim a petitioner need only demonstrate: (a) reliance on pertinent federal cases employing constitutional analysis, (b) reliance on state cases employing constitutional analysis in like fact situations, (c) assertion of the claim in terms so particular as to call to mind a specific right protected by the Constitution, or (d) an allegation of a pattern of facts that is well within the mainstream of constitutional litigation. <em>Nara v. Frank, </em>488 F.3d 187, 198 (3d Cir.2007). Furthermore, a claim is exhausted as long as the state court had the opportunity to address the federal claim, regardless of whether it addressed it on the merits or dismissed it on procedural grounds. <em>Bond v. Fulcomer, </em>864 F.2d 306, 309 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In his supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief before the New Jersey Appellate Division, Hernandez claimed that the \u201cdefendant was hispanic, few hispanics were included in the jury array, the prosecutor peremptorily challenged every hispanic juror except one; and the defendant was tried by a jury of ten whites, one black, and one hispanic.\u201d This pattern, Hernandez asserted, \u201cestablished a <em>prime facie </em>[sic] showing that the prosecutor exercised his challenges because of group bias,\u201d and required remand for a hearing \u201cat which time the prosecutor should explain his reasons for peremptorily challenging all of the hispanic jurors except one.\u201d Although Hernandez relied heavily upon <em>Gilmore, </em>and requested a <em>\u201cGilmore </em>hearing,\u201d he also cited to <em>Batson </em>at two points in the brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>We find that Hernandez\u2019s supplemental brief, although far from a model of clarity, placed the New Jersey courts \u201con notice that a federal claim [was] being asserted.\u201d <em>McCandless, </em>172 F.3d at 261. Most notably, the language of Hernandez\u2019s argument plainly brings to mind the burden-shifting framework of <em>Batson, </em>which requires the defendant to first make out a prima facie case \u201cby showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose,\u201d 476 U.S. at 93-94, 106 S.Ct. 1712, after which the \u201cburden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion\u201d by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the fact pattern alleged is \u201cwell within the mainstream of constitutional litigation.\u201d <em>McCandless, </em>172 F.3d at 261. Hernandez\u2019s description of the jury selection is apparently meant to raise a <em>Batson </em>issue, and he cited <em>Batson </em>in his briefing. Under the <em>McCandless </em>factors, this was sufficient to alert the New Jersey courts to Hernandez\u2019s federal equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Hernandez\u2019s petition and we will remand the case to permit the District Court to consider whether Hernandez established a factual basis for his claim and whether he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
