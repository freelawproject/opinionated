Mar. 12, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A74 383 643 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 7, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-24\">While we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary denial of an adjustment of status, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), we retain jurisdiction to review an IJ\u2019s determination of a petitioner\u2019s eligibility for an adjustment of status, a determination which is non-discretionary. <em>Rodriguez v. Gonzales, </em>451 F.3d 60, 62 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-25\">Where, as here, the BIA affirmed summarily the IJ\u2019s decision and adopted its reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. I.N.S., </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the IJ\u2019s factual findings underlying that decision for substantial evidence, and treat them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review. Petitioner, who entered the United States without inspection, applied for an adjustment of status as a \u201cgrandfathered\u201d alien based on the Form 1-130 visa petition that her ex-husband, Antonio Rosario, filed on her behalf in May 1997. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(a)(l)(i)(A). During the lengthy pendency of Petitioner\u2019s deportation proceedings, Petitioner married Rosario, received INS approval of Rosario\u2019s visa, divorced Rosario, and married her current husband, Domingo Montoya. Petitioner argues chiefly that IJ Jankun erred in determining that she was ineligible for an adjustment of status because Rosario\u2019s visa petition was not \u201capprovable when filed,\u201d <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(a)(l)(i)(A), even though it was ultimately approved by the INS.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">An alien is \u201cgrandfathered,\u201d and therefore eligible to adjust status, if she is the beneficiary of a visa petition filed on or before April 30, 2001 that was \u201capprovable when filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Agency regulations define \u201capprovable as filed\u201d as (1) properly filed, (2) meritorious in fact, and (3) non-frivolous. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1245.10(a)(3). The determination of whether a visa petition fits this definition \u201cwill be made based on the circumstances that existed at the time the qualifying petition or application was filed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The INA generally precludes an adjustment of status predicated on a visa petition that is based on a marriage entered during the pendency of deportation proceedings; however, the alien may be eligible for an adjustment if she \u201cestablishes by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the marriage was entered into in good faith ... and the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of procuring the alien\u2019s admission as an immigrant.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">IJ Jankun concluded that the visa petition was not \u201capprovable when filed\u201d because Petitioner \u201cfailed to demonstrate that her marriage to Rosario was bona fide\u201d in May 1997, when Rosario filed the petition. The IJ\u2019s decision was grounded on Petitioner\u2019s testimony that \u201cshe realized, as early as April 1997, that her marriage to Antonio Rosario would not last,\u201d and that \u201cfrom that point on, they lived together, not as a married couple, but under an \u2018agreement\u2019 that she would do the household chores for him if he would help her get a \u2018green card.\u2019 \u201d Around that same time, Petitioner began a relationship with Domingo Montoya; together they had two children (both of whom took Montoya\u2019s name) while Petitioner was still ostensibly married to Rosario.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">After IJ Jankun denied Petitioner\u2019s application, the BIA issued a precedential opinion construing the terms \u201capprovable when filed\u201d and \u201cmeritorious in fact\u201d in the context of an application for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into while deportation proceedings were pending. The BIA explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">[I]n order to be \u201cmeritorious in fact,\u201d the visa petition must be based on a genuine marriage in which the parties intended to share a life as husband and wife, not a marriage of convenience designed solely to confer an immigration benefit on one of the parties.... In the marriage context, a \u201cfraudulent\u201d visa petition would include one where the marriage was not entered into in good faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>[The alien] must show that the marriage was bona fide at its inception. Evidence to establish that the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws may take many forms, including, but not limited to, \u201cproof that the beneficiary ... has been listed as the petitioner\u2019s spouse on insurance policies, property leases, income tax forms, or bank accounts, and testimony or other evidence regarding courtship, wedding ceremony, shared residence, and experiences.\u201d <em>Matter of Laureano, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 3 (B.I.A. 1983); <em>see also Matter of Phillis, </em>15 I. &amp; N. Dec. 385 (B.I.A.1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\"><em>In re Riero, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 267, 268-69 (Aug. 15, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">As a general matter, \u201ca court reviewing an agency decision following an intervening change of policy by the agency should remand to permit the agency to decide in the first instance whether giving the change retrospective effect will best effectuate the policies underlying the agency\u2019s governing act.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Food Store Employees Union, </em>417 U.S. 1, 10 n. 10, 94 S.Ct. 2074, 40 L.Ed.2d 612 (1974). In <em>Xiu Fen Xia v. Mukasey, </em>510 F.3d 162 (2d Cir.2007), however, we held that notwithstanding an intervening BIA decision, there is no need to remand where: \u201c[i] the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence; [ii] no valid challenge is raised against <em>Chevron </em>deference; [iii] the intervening decision supports and validates the reasoning of the decision under review; and [iv] the intervening decision does not amount to a pivot in agency policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Remand is the appropriate course here, <em>see Food Store Employees Union, </em>417 U.S. at 10 n. 10, 94 S.Ct. 2074, because we cannot ascertain whether <em>In re Riero </em>\u201csupports and validates the reasoning of the decision under review\u201d and/or \u201camount[s] to a pivot in agency policy.\u201d <em>See Xiu Fen Xia, </em>510 F.3d at 168. We understand <em>In re Riero </em>as requiring a petitioner to demonstrate that a marriage was bona fide at its inception,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but read the BIA\u2019s unpublished decision at issue before us as requiring Petitioner to demonstrate that her marriage was bona fide at the time Rosario\u2019s visa petition was filed. Moreover, there is somewhat conflicting evidence in the record concerning whether the marriage was bona fide at inception. On one hand, Petitioner declined Rosario\u2019s initial marriage proposal, and agreed to marry him only after she was later apprehended by immigration officials. On the other hand, however, Rosario\u2019s visa petition based on his marriage to Petitioner was approved by the agency, and Petitioner claimed to live with and share a bank account with Rosario following their marriage. <em>See In re Riero, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 269. Accordingly, a remand is necessary to allow the agency to reevaluate Petitioner\u2019s claim against the standard announced in <em>In re Riero.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">For the reasons set forth above, the petition for review is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is VACATED, and the case REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. Petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\">. Of course, if our understanding of <em>In re Riero </em>is mistaken, the agency can explain why on remand. Moreover, we express no opinion on whether <em>In re Riero </em>\u2014 as we currently understand it \u2014 is entitled to <em>Chevron </em>or <em>Auer </em>deference, <em>cf. Edwards v. INS, </em>393 F.3d 299, 308 n. 11 (2d Cir.2004), but note that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(a)(l)(i)(A) speaks to whether the visa petition was \u201capprovable when filed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
