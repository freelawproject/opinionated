Rose argues on appeal that his sentence is unreasonable because the minimum sentence of 188 months, according to the Guidelines range, imposed by the district court is greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, Rose argues that the district court, in denying Rose a downward variance, imposed a sentence that was too great in light of Rose\u2019s post-conviction and pre-sentence rehabilitation. Rose argues that the minimum Guideline sentence of 188 months \u201cis tantamount to punishing [Rose] for his status as a drug addict,\u201d rather than for his crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">This court reviews the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-45 (11th Cir.2005). Specifically, the district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). The Supreme Court has explained that a sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the guideline imprisonment range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, bases the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain its reasoning. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The Supreme Court has explained that the substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>It has suggested that review for substantive reasonableness under this standard involves inquiring whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">This court\u2019s reasonableness review is deferential and requires this court to \u201cevaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>In arriving at a reasonable sentence, the district court is required to consider the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-15\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-5\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">In considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explaining the reasoning behind its choice of sentence, we have held that the district court need not discuss or state that it has explicitly considered each factor of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Instead, we have held that an explicit acknowledgment that the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (holding that the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable when the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and provided a reasoned basis for its choice of sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Here, based on our review of the record, we conclude that Rose\u2019s sentence was not procedurally unreasonable because the district court heard statements of the parties, considered Rose\u2019s history contained in the pre-sentence investigative report, and considered the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329; <em>Hunt, </em>459 F.3d at 1182 n. 3; <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Moreover, we conclude from the record that Rose\u2019s sentence was not substantively unreasonable because the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing him at the low end of the applicable guideline range given his criminal history and recidivism. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Accordingly, we affirm Rose\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
