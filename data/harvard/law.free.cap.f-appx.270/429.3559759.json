Koscinski pleaded guilty to one count of dealing firearms without a license and one count of possessing a firearm as a felon, and was sentenced to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(1), 922(g)(1), 924(a). Koscinski filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed counsel now moves to withdraw because he cannot discern a non-frivolous basis for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We invited Koscinski to respond to counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), but he has not done so. Counsel\u2019s supporting brief is adequate, so we limit our review to the potential issues it identifies. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-21\">The record reveals the following events. Milwaukee police officers, responding to a citizen\u2019s complaint, obtained a warrant to search Koscinski\u2019s home and there found a firearm. About two weeks later, an informant told the police that he had bought a gun from Koscinski, and had seen several other firearms in Koscinski\u2019s apartment. Koscinski, a felon based on an earlier conviction for escape, did not have a valid federal license to sell firearms. Later on, but still before his arrest, Koscinski told federal agents that he had received firearms to sell from his neighbor. After his arrest and indictment on the firearms charges, Koscinski violated the conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>of his pre-trial release by, among other things, using cocaine and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In their plea agreement, Koscinski and the government agreed that the applicable base offense level for the two charged offenses was 20, and that there should be a six-level increase for the number of firearms involved. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4), (b)(1)(C). They also agreed to a two-level increase for stolen firearms. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4). The government further agreed to recommend a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility but only if Koscinski behaved consistent with the acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Koscinski\u2019s PSR repeated these guidelines calculations, except that it did not include the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility because, as the PSR explained, Koscinski committed crimes while on bond. The PSR placed him in criminal history category VI. With a total offense level of 28, the PSR recommended a sentencing range of 140 to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Koscinski objected to the criminal history calculation in the PSR. He argued that one of his past offenses included in the calculation did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2) because it occurred more than 10 years before the offense in this case, and that he should be in category V. The government agreed. Koscinski also contended that category III better reflected his criminal history and likelihood of recidivism because his past offenses consisted primarily of traffic offenses and nonviolent crimes. The government disagreed with this. Finally, the government agreed that he should be credited with acceptance of responsibility. An amended PSR placed him in criminal history category V, yielding a new advisory sentencing range of 130 to 162 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSR noted that with a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the range would then be 100 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">At sentencing, the court concluded that Koscinski should receive the three-level adjustment for accepting responsibility, but rejected Koscinski\u2019s argument that criminal history category V overstated the seriousness of his prior offenses. Turning to the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and considering Koscin-ski\u2019s personal history of drug use, the court stated that \u201cthere is nothing more serious than guns and drug related activity, and it is a deadly combination ... whether you\u2019re a user or dealer or distributor of drugs and then have guns around.\u201d The court maintained that \u201cany reasonable person\u201d would conclude that Koscinski was \u201cunable to conform to the simplest requirements\u201d of lawful conduct. The court also discussed the need for deterrence and protection of the public. The court then imposed a sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on the first count and 100 months\u2019 imprisonment on the second count, to be served concurrently and followed by three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Counsel first considers whether Koscin-ski could challenge the voluntariness of his guilty plea, including any defects in the plea colloquy. Counsel is correct, however, that he cannot proceed to consider such a challenge because Koscinski told him that he does not wish to attack the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 670-71 (7th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we examine the issue no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Counsel also correctly determines that any challenge to the reasonableness of Koscinski\u2019s sentence would be frivolous. Although, as counsel reports, Koscinski now disagrees with the offense level in the guidelines calculation, he told the district court in the plea agreement that it was correct. Absent a challenge to the plea agreement, such an argument would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>waived. <em>See United States v. Murdock, </em>491 F.3d 694, 698 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>243 F.3d 411, 415-16 (7th Cir.2001). Furthermore, Koscinski\u2019s sentence is at the low end of the properly calculated guidelines range and thus would be presumed reasonable on appeal, <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Gama-Gonzalez, </em>469 F.3d 1109, 1110 (7th Cir.2006). Counsel is understandably unable to articulate any reason why the presumption would be overcome. The district court gave detailed and meaningful consideration to the relevant factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), which is all it was required to do. <em>See United States v. Laufle, </em>433 F.3d 981, 987 (7th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Although Koscinski told the district court that he should not receive a higher sentence than the co-defendant who supplied him with the firearms for sale, any argument that Koscinski\u2019s sentence created an \u201cunwarranted disparity\u201d between him and a codefendant would be frivolous. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). We have said repeatedly that differences in sentences arising solely from the application of the guidelines cannot be unwarranted. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Duncan, </em>479 F.3d 924, 929 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Finally, counsel reports that Koscinski belatedly received his personal copy of the PSR. To the extent that Koscinski is charging his counsel with ineffective assistance, this claim is better pursued in collateral proceedings. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>394 F.3d 543, 557-58 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
