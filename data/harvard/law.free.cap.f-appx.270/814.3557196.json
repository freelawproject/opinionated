Scott appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to her former employer, Honda Manufacturing of Alabama, LLC (Honda), in her lawsuit claiming wrongful interference and retaliation under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 <em>et seq. </em>Scott asserts: (1) she demonstrated a qualifying event under the FMLA by alleging her mother suffered from a serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>health condition, (2) she presented a prima <em>facie </em>case of retaliation, and (3) Honda\u2019s reason for firing her was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we agree with the district court that Scott did not produce sufficient evidence to establish her mother was suffering from a serious health condition as defined by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.114(a)(1) or (a)(2)(i). In Scott\u2019s opposition to Honda\u2019s motion for summary judgment, however, she asserted her mother\u2019s condition met the requirements of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.114(a)(2)(iii), regarding a period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. The district court did not analyze Scott\u2019s claim under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.114(a)(2)(iii). Under this subsection, a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">\u201cserious health condition\u201d entitling an employee to FMLA leave means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves ... Any period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A chronic serious health condition is one which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-7\">(A) Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider, or by a nurse or physician\u2019s assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-8\">(B) Continues over an extended period of time (including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-9\">(C) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">Scott presented no evidence to the district court that her mother\u2019s condition required periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider or continued over an extended period of time; thus, Scott also did not produce sufficient evidence that her mother was suffering from a serious health condition as defined by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.114(a) (2) (iii). The findings of fact noted that Scott\u2019s mother underwent stress and other testing after experiencing shortness of breath in September 2005. Her only other appointment was the heart catheterization procedure on October 25, 2005, and \u201cher mother fully recovered within 48 hours of the procedure and returned to work with no restrictions.\u201d The district court further noted that, \u201cScott\u2019s mother did not follow up with her doctor after the [heart catheterization] procedure.\u201d Although \u201c[o]rdinarily we would remand to the district court to make this determination in the first instance,\u201d in this case, \u201c[w]e believe ... that there is no other possible conclusion that can be drawn from the district court\u2019s findings of fact.\u201d <em>See CBS Broad., Inc. v. EchoStar Commc\u2019ns Corp., </em>450 F.3d 505, 525 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Because we conclude Scott failed to produce sufficient evidence that her mother was suffering from a serious health condition, we also agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Scott did not present evidence sufficient to state a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. <em>See Strickland v. Water Works &amp; Sewer Bd. of Birnmigham, </em>239 F.3d 1199, 1207 (11th Cir.2001) (noting the first step in stating a prima <em>facie </em>case of FMLA retaliation is alleging that the plaintiff engaged in a statutorily protected activity). Additionally, we agree with the district court that Scott failed to show Honda\u2019s reason for terminating her employment was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Honda for the above-stated reasons, as well as the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion of July 30, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
