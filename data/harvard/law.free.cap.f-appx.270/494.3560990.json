We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-22\">Regardless of statutory jurisdictional limits, we retain jurisdiction in immigration cases over \u201cconstitutional claims and questions of law.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>410 F.3d 585, 587 (9th Cir.2005), <em>adopted in relevant </em>pari, 466 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc). Tajimaroa raises two issues that are within our jurisdiction, namely that (1) the Attorney General exceeded his authority in promulgating 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.7(d), and (2) the BIA applied an incorrect legal standard in determining that Tajimaroa had been convicted of a dangerous crime. Contrary to the government\u2019s assertion, we have jurisdiction over this petition for review. <em>Mejia v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 991, 998-99 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-23\">Tajimaroa\u2019s argument that the Attorney General exceeded his authority in promulgating the regulations is foreclosed by <em>Mejia. Id. </em>at 995-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-24\">Tajimaroa\u2019s second argument fails as well. There is no question that the BIA found Tajimaroa to have been convicted of a \u201cviolent or dangerous crime,\u201d a standard taken directly from the applicable regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>tion. <em>See id. </em>at 998-99 (holding that the BIA\u2019s determination that the petitioner\u2019s crimes were \u201cboth violent and dangerous\u201d and \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d adequately stated the proper standard). Moreover, Tajima-roa makes no colorable argument that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cviolent or dangerous crime\u201d standard violated his Constitutional rights, or was not rationally related to the discretionary grant of waivers of inadmissibility. <em>See id. </em>at 996-97; <em>Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1001, 1005 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Because Tajimaroa\u2019s claims of constitutional and statutory violations fail, we must deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
