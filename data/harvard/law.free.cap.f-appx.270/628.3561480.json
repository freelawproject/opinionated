The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen because the motion to reopen was filed more than eight months after the final administrative order and did not meet a regulatory exception to the 90-day filing requirement. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3); <em>Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1222 (9th Cir.2002) (BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition in part is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-25\">Further, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision declining to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss in part is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-26\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-27\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
