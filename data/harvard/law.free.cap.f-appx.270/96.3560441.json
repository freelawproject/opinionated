For the reasons that follow, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">On September 30, 2005, Pruden filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The District Court dismissed Pruden\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) &amp; (2). Approximately eighteen months later, Pruden filed a motion requesting the appointment of counsel and the consolidation of his cases. The District Court denied the motion as moot. Pruden appeals from the denial of his motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-24\"><em>Pro se </em>pleadings are liberally construed. <em>Abdul-Akbar v. McKelvie, </em>239 F.3d 307, 322 (3d Cir.2001). Accordingly, we will construe Pruden\u2019s motion, which requests the appointment of counsel and the consolidation of his multiple cases, as seeking post-judgment relief. To the extent that Pruden sought reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s order pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e), his motion was untimely. To the extent that Pruden sought relief pursuant to FedR.Civ.P. 60(b), his motion fails to state adequate grounds for relief. Accordingly, the denial of Pruden\u2019s motion was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-25\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that this appeal has no arguable basis in law or fact and will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Pruden\u2019s motion for counsel, motion requesting a transfer to another prison, and motion for a preliminary injunction are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-20\">. We note that Pruden\u2019s notice of appeal, filed on July 11, 2007, is untimely as to the District Court\u2019s order entered on October 21, 2005, dismissing his complaint. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
