Underhill, United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b98-16\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b98-17\">Defendant-Appellant Nam Pyo Kim was convicted, following a four-day jury trial in January 2005, of receiving stolen property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2315. In October 2005, Kim was sentenced to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by two year\u2019s supervised release, and ordered to pay a $100 special assessment. Restitution was ordered in the amount of $981,318.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-21\">On October 26, 2005, Kim timely filed a Notice of Appeal from his conviction. Shortly thereafter, on November 8, Kim filed a motion in district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, seeking vacatur of his conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel. This Court ordered Kim\u2019s direct appeal held in abeyance pending the outcome of the \u00a7 2255 hearing in district court. The district court denied Kim\u2019s motion on November 29, 2006. Finding that Kim had failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, the district court also denied Kim\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability on December 12, 2006. Kim then filed an appeal to this Court from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. In doing so, he sought, as required, a certificate of appealability from us. The appeal from the denial of the \u00a7 2255 motion was docketed separately from the direct appeal, and, though a series of letters between the parties confirmed their intention to have the two appeals consolidated, this was not done at the time. Thereafter, a panel of this Court reviewed Kim\u2019s \u00a7 2255 appeal and, by order dated March 1, 2007, declined to issue a certificate of appealability and, accordingly, dismissed the \u00a7 2255 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-22\">The direct appeal, not having been disposed of, is before us today. In his brief to us, Kim contends that his conviction should be vacated and he should be granted a new trial. In support, he makes substantially the same ineffective assistance of counsel arguments that he raised before Judge Griesa in the \u00a7 2255 hearing. On direct appeal he can make these arguments without a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>When we are presented with claims of ineffective assistance in a direct appeal in the ordinary course, we may \u201c(1) decline to hear the claim, permitting the appellant to raise the issue as part of a subsequent [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255 [motion]; (2) remand the claim to the district court for necessary fact-finding; or (3) decide the claim on the record before us.\u201d <em>United States v. Leone, </em>215 F.3d 253, 256 (2d Cir.2000). The Supreme Court, however, has said that \u201cin most cases a motion brought under \u00a7 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance.\u201d <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). Consistent with <em>Massaro, </em>we decline to hear the claims on direct appeal. Usually, this would result in the claims being considered, subsequently, on a \u00a7 2255 petition. In the instant case, however, that consideration has already taken place, and we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (\u201cUnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a proceeding under section 2255.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The appeal is therefore DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\">. Kim argues that his appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion should be allowed as on March 20, 2007, an order was issued by the Acting Clerk of Court consolidating the direct appeal, No. 05-6089-cr, and the \u00a7 2255 appeal, No. 07-0052-pr, \"for purposes of briefing and oral argument.\u201d As the issuance of a certificate of appealability has been denied by this Court, we lack jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B), notwithstanding administrative orders that might suggest the contrary. We also note that to the extent Kim might be appealing Judge Griesa's decision to deny Kim\u2019s motion for a new trial, made pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure during the interim between his trial and sentencing, we find that Kim has failed to present this argument, and we therefore deem it waived. <em>Tolbert v. Queens Coll., </em>242 F.3d 58, 75 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
