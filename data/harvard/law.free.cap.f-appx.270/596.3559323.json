This Court reviews an adverse credibility determination under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 741 (9th Cir.2007). \u201c[Cjredibility findings will be upheld unless the evidence <em>compels </em>a contrary result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (emphasis in Don). The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, based in part on Charath\u2019s inability to recall significant events in the Punjab, including the assassination of the then-Chief Minister, at the time he was purportedly persecuted in that region, is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151-53 (9th Cir.1999) (upholding adverse credibility finding in part based on petitioner\u2019s failure to provide specificity and details outside of information contained in newspaper article upon which petitioner relied). Because at least one basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence, the IJ\u2019s decision must be upheld. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cSo long as one of the identified grounds is supported by substantial evidence ... we are bound to accept the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.\u201d) (citation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">2. Charath\u2019s inability to produce material and non-duplicative corroborating evidence that was indisputably available supports the adverse credibility finding. <em>See Sidhu v. I.N.S., </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-17\">3. Charath contends that the IJ erred in failing to grant him relief under the CAT. However, Charath did not initially file an application for CAT relief. The IJ denied Charath\u2019s last-minute request to continue the hearing so that he could file an application for relief under the CAT, noting that it was little more than a delay tactic. Charath did not appeal this finding by the IJ in the administrative proceedings. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review this issue. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1139, 1144 n. 1 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b621-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
