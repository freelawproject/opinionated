Having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>carefully reviewed the record and considered White\u2019s arguments, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment on his claims asserting that defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs in treating his toenail fungus. <em>See, Johnson v. Hamilton, </em>452 F.3d 967, 971-72 (8th Cir.2006) (de novo standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We further decline to decide whether the district court improperly dismissed defendant Vanessa Boydston as untimely served, <em>see Moore v. Jackson, </em>123 F.3d 1082, 1085-86 (8th Cir.1997), because we conclude that a remand for further proceedings against her would be futile, as White cannot show that Boydston was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs, <em>cf. Thornburgh v. Am. Coll. of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists, </em>476 U.S. 747, 756 n. 7, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986) (remand not required in cases of futility), <em>ovem'ided on other grounds by Planned Parenthood of Southeastern, Pennsylvania v. Casey, </em>505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992); <em>LeMay v. U.S. Postal Sera, </em>450 F.3d 797, 799 (8th Cir.2006) (court may affirm district court\u2019s dismissal on any basis supported by record).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying White\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, <em>see Abdullah v. Gunter, </em>949 F.2d 1032, 1035 (8th Cir.1991) (abuse-of-discretion review standard and factors), or grossly abuse its discretion in denying White\u2019s motions to compel, see <em>Heart of Am. Grain Inspection Serv., Inc. v. Missouri Dep\u2019t of Ag., </em>123 F.3d 1098, 1107 (8th Cir.1997) (gross-abuse-of-discretion review standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-26\">. The Honorable Stephen N.
