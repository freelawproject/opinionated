DeFonzo pretermitting Mi\u2019s asylum application and denying his application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Liaqat Ali/Adeel Liaqat, </em>Nos. A76 090 364/95 961 808 (B.I.A. Mar. 8, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>Nos. A76 090 364/95 961 808 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 21, 2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-16\">As an initial matter, Ali has not challenged the agency\u2019s pretermission of his asylum application in his brief to this Court. Issues not argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). Therefore, we deem waived any challenge to the denial of Ali\u2019s asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-17\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 304 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-18\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was proper, based on the following findings by the IJ: (1) Ali\u2019s testimony that he was arrested during a rally on August 14, 1993, Pakistani Independence Day, was inconsistent with documents that he submitted indicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ing that the incident occurred on August 24, 1993; (2) Ali\u2019s testimony that he was released in the first week of September 1993 was inconsistent with a bail document that he submitted indicating that he was released on bail in October 1993; (3) Ali\u2019s testimony that he was arrested in 1994 on the charges of \u201cvandalism, blocking traffic, and other such crimes\u201d was inconsistent with his own statement, which asserted that he was arrested for harboring absconders; and (4) Ali\u2019s testimony that he was beaten after he was arrested in August 1993 was inconsistent with his \u201cwritten application for relief,\u201d which made no mention of that assertion. While Ali was given the opportunity to explain these discrepancies, he failed to provide explanations that would compel a reasonable factfinder to credit them. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The IJ also found implausible Ali\u2019s claim that the authorities continue to seek his and his wife\u2019s arrest, when he also testified that the \u201cfake\u201d charges that had been leveled against him in August 1993 had ultimately been dismissed. This Court will reject an IJ\u2019s deductions only when they are based on bald speculation, <em>ie., </em>when there is a complete absence of probative facts in the record to support them, and will accord deference to those deductions as long as they are \u201ctethered to the evi-dentiary record.\u201d <em>Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168-69 (2d Cir.2007). Here, the IJ properly \u201ctethered\u201d his finding that it was unlikely that Ali was sought for arrest by the Pakistani government to Ali\u2019s own testimony that the charges against him had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">While each of the above-mentioned findings, on its own, might concern matters that are ancillary to Ali\u2019s claims of persecution, their cumulative effect was nevertheless deemed consequential by the IJ, and provides substantial evidence for the adverse credibility finding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Because the only evidence that Ali was likely to be tortured depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for CAT relief. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b43-14\">. Adeel Liaqat is the son of Liaqat Ali. Adeel was included as a derivative applicant on his father's application for asylum. All references in this order are to Liaqat Ali (\"Ali\u201d) alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\">. Because we find that the adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence based on the findings identified above, we need not reach the IJ's finding that Ali\u2019s documentary evidence was fabricated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
