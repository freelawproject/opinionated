The district court, applying a total offense level of 33, assessed a 72-month sentence under the Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Roberts challenged the sentence on the grounds that the district court sentenced him to the statutory maximum \u201cwhen the facts of this case clearly dictated that the Court exercise its <em>Booker </em>authority to impose a non-guidelines sentence,\u201d and that the court imposed a Guidelines sentence despite its concern that the sentence was harsh. He also argued that the district court erred in identifying the Guideline that it used to calculate his base offense, alleging that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4(a)(2) was more analogous to his offense than \u00a7 2A3.1, and that the court failed to perform an \u201cextensive analysis\u201d of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cwhich might have justified a lower sentence.\u201d Finally, he alleged that this court\u2019s presumption of reasonableness afforded to a within-Guidelines sentence is a violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">We affirmed the district court\u2019s sentence, finding that the district court \u201cthoroughly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We held that Roberts had \u201cnot demonstrated that his sentence ... [was] unreasonable\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \"under <em>United States v. Mares.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Roberts petitioned for cert., and the Supreme Court granted the petition. On January 7, 2008, it vacated the judgment and remanded \u201cfor further consideration in light of <em>Gall v. United States. </em>...\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We also review this case in light of <em>Rita v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as the district court assessed a sentence within the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-19\">In <em>Rita, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the question of \u201cwhether a court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonable<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d and concluded that it may.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Gall, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the standard of review for sentences and held that \u201c[r]egardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review [a district court] sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court held that for within-Guidelines sentences, we may but are not required to presume that the sentence is reasonable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When reviewing a sentence, we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ady\">We must then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u201d considering \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The district court in the present case correctly calculated the Guidelines range, as we previously held,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and did not commit any other procedural errors. Although expressing concern regarding the harshness of the Guidelines, the court did not view the Guidelines as mandatory. Instead, it found \u201cno reason to deviate from ... [the Guidelines] sentence\u201d and held that \u201cfurther consideration of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) yields no other compelling consideration not to apply the guidelines in this case.\u201d Nor did it fail to explain its reasons for the sentence or base its sentence on clearly erroneous facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">Moving to the reasonableness of the sentence, we find that a presumption of reasonableness, as permitted by <em>Rita </em>and <em>Gall </em>for within-Guidelines sentences, is appropriate in this case. Even if we were to decline to apply this presumption, the sentence is reasonable. As we found in our original opinion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-14\">the record shows that the district court thoroughly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determined that a deviation therefrom was not warranted by the facts of the case, even though in its sentencing memorandum it devoted little space explicitly to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">As the Supreme Court held in <em>Rita, </em>\u00a7 3553(a) \u201cdoes call for the judge to \u2018state\u2019 his \u2018reasons.\u2019 ... That said, we cannot read the statute (or our precedent) as insisting upon a full opinion in every case.... The law leaves much, in this respect, to the judge\u2019s own professional judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court here explained that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but found none of them sufficiently compelling to apply a non-Guidelines sentence. We recognize <em>Rita\u2019s </em>statement that where \u201ca par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ty contests the Guidelines sentence generally under \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d a court may need to provide an explanation beyond a simple assumption that a judge has rested \u201chis decision upon the Commission\u2019s own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is a proper sentence (in terms of \u00a7 3553(a) and other congressional mandates).\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the court did not expound upon its \u201cfurther consideration\u201d of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it considered them independently, beyond the basic assumption that the Guidelines sentence was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In his brief, Roberts argued that the \u201cfacts of the instant case, when considered in conjunction with the particularly difficult time the court stated that it had in deciding how to sentence,\u201d mandated a non-Guidelines sentence. A judge\u2019s explanation of his difficulties in deciding to assess what he viewed as a \u201charsh\u201d sentence does not persuade us that the court abused its discretion, or that the sentence was unreasonable. Instead, it shows that the judge carefully considered and weighed all of the factors \u2014 more so than in many cases. He stated, \u201c[Wjhat we\u2019re down to is the question of whether there are appropriate 3553(a) factors that might apply in this case. I consider it a serious enough case to do the unusual here, and that\u2019s to break at this point and allow counsel the opportunity to brief it,\u201d and later stated that he was \u201ctaking the unusual step of outlining [his] thought process\u201d once he had determined the sentence. The judge also indicated that he had \u201cexplored and analyzed\u201d \u201cthe facts presented when the guilty plea was accepted.\u201d Although the facts may have been \u201cbizarre,\u201d as Roberts claims,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the judge carefully considered them in imposing the sentence. We are not persuaded that the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
