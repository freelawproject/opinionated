To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, and review de novo claims of due process violations in removal proceedings, including claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-21\">Yuan\u2019s contention that equitable tolling excuses his untimely filing is moot because the BIA considered the merits of his motion. We agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that former counsel\u2019s performance did not result in prejudice to Yuan, and thus his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003) (to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must demonstrate prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-22\">Yuan\u2019s remaining contentions were previously addressed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Yuan v. Gonzales, </em>139 Fed.Appx. 899 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b535-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
