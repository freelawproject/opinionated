After careful review, we deny Yann\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Yann contends he is entitled to asylum and related relief because of a well founded fear he will be persecuted in Cambodia due to his membership in an opposition political party, the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP). Yann alleges the death threats of a police officer in Cambodia, from whom he narrowly escaped capture, forced him into hiding for fourteen months and eventually caused him to seek refuge in the United States. Yann claims this particular police officer, Nget Touch, continues to search for him at the homes of friends and family in Cambodia.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The IJ did not find credible Yann\u2019s account of his experiences in Cambodia, noting several omissions, material inconsistencies, and unexplained discrepancies between his oral testimony and his amended asylum application. The IJ found implausible Yann\u2019s claim that Officer Touch sought to kill him, noting inconsistent testimony regarding: the location from which Yann escaped, the means of his escape, the location to which he fled after his escape, whether some or all of his companions escaped, and whether he met up with any of his companions after the escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Because Yann\u2019s credibility was at issue, the IJ required corroborating evidence. <em>See Kondakova v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 792, 796 (8th Cir.2004) (stating where an alien is found not credible, his failure to provide corroborating evidence can be fatal). Yann submitted a SRP membership card, which was issued nine months after the persecution allegedly began, and also a letter from the SRP confirming Yann\u2019s status as an active party member living at a Cambodian address. The SRP letter was dated October 25, 2004, two and a half years after Yann moved to the United States. Yann also submitted a letter from a Cambodian friend, who wrote police officers had come to his house looking for Yann. The IJ did not find the documents Yann submitted to be adequate corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">Having found Yann\u2019s testimony of past persecution not credible, the IJ reasonably determined Yann failed to establish a clear probability of future persecution. The IJ expressly denied all forms of relief based on the general conclusion that Yann\u2019s testimony was not credible and his story was unbelievable. <em>See, e.g., Fofanah v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 1037, 1040 (8th Cir.2006) (holding where withholding of removal and CAT claims were based on the same discredited testimony, the BIA properly concluded the adverse credibility finding was fatal to all claims). The BIA affirmed without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">Generally, we review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Where the BIA affirms an IJ\u2019s decision without issuing its own opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>Habtemicael v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 774, 779 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">Yann challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. A credibility determination is a finding of fact, and \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) provides it should be accepted \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Singh v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 553, 556 (8th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Applying this standard, we conclude the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by specific, cogent reasons to doubt Yann\u2019s credibility. <em>See Gemechu v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 944, 947-48 (8th Cir.2004) (holding an IJ\u2019s credibility findings are entitled to deference if supported by specific, cogent reasons). Yann\u2019s inconsistent testimony and suspect corroborating evidence support the IJ\u2019s finding. <em>See Onsongo v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 849, 853 (8th Cir.2006). The IJ offered an adequate explanation for her finding Yann was not credible. The record does not compel a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Accordingly, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-16\">. The Real ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. 109-13, includes a specific provision governing credibility determinations, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), but this provision applies only to applications made after May 11, 2005. Pub.L. 109-13, \u00a7 101(h)(2). Yann made his application before that date, so the new statute does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
