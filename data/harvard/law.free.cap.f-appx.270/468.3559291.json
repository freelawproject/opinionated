Bryan appeals the sentence imposed on him by the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after he pleaded guilty to a child-pornography charge, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2). In a brief filed under <em>An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Bryan\u2019s counsel seeks to withdraw and questions whether the sentence \u2014 imposed at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range \u2014 is reasonable, and whether the district court erred by not allowing Bryan to self-surrender. Bryan has filed a supplemental brief asserting that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceeding, including at sentencing, and he also appears to deny the truth of unobject-ed-to facts reported in the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-23\">Bryan\u2019s written plea agreement contains a waiver of his right to appeal his sentence, directly or collaterally. We find the appeal waiver to be valid and we therefore enforce it. The plea-hearing transcript shows that Bryan entered into the plea agreement and the appeal waiver knowingly and voluntarily, and we can perceive no injustice that would result from enforcing the waiver. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc) (discussing enforceability of appeal waiver); <em>United States v. Estrada-Bahe-na, </em>201 F.3d 1070, 1071 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (enforcing appeal waiver in <em>An-ders </em>case). Thus, we do not review the arguments raised in Bryan\u2019s pro se supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>mental brief or counsel\u2019s argument that Bryan\u2019s sentence is unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">To the extent that the issue of self-surrender is not covered by the appeal waiver, we conclude that the district court did not err in ordering Bryan detained following sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3148(b)(1), 3145(c). Finally, after conducting an independent review under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), of any matters not covered by the appeal waiver, we find that there are no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Accordingly, we affirm. We grant counsel leave to withdraw, subject to the condition that counsel promptly comply with the requirements of Part V of this Court\u2019s Plan to Implement the Criminal Justice Act by advising his client of the procedures for filing a petition for writ of certio-rari pro se.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-17\">. The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b493-16\">. Regardless of any appeal waiver, we decline to consider the ineffective-assistance claim. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>330 F.3d 1068, 1069 (8th Cir.2003) (ineffective-assistance claims should ordinarily be brought in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding because they normally involve facts outside original record).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
