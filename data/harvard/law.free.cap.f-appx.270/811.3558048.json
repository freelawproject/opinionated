On appeal, Fernandez-Tellez argues that he should have received a minor-role reduction because in comparison to the other participants in the methamphetamine distribution conspiracy, he was \u201cclearly a comparatively ... minor participant in the offense.\u201d After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings regarding a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. In determining the defendant\u2019s role, the decision falls within the sound discretion of the district court: \u201ca trial court\u2019s choice between two permissible views of the evidence is the very essence of the clear error standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945 (internal quotation and citation omitted). As long as the district court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and the district court clearly resolves any disputed facts, the sentencing judge need not make specific subsidiary factual findings regarding the defendant\u2019s role in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">The Guidelines provide for a downward adjustment of two to four levels based on a defendant\u2019s mitigating role in an offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. There is a \u201crange of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(A). A four-level reduction for a minimal participant is warranted for \u201cdefendants who are plainly among the least culpable ... of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a) cmt. n. 4. A two-level reduction for a minor role is appropriate for a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) cmt. n. 5. The determination of whether to apply the reduction is fact-based, and the court need not apply the adjustment \u201cbased solely on the defendant\u2019s bare assertion.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">In <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>we established a two-part test to determine whether a mitigating-role reduction is appropriate. The first prong is the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct, and the second is the defendant\u2019s role compared to other participants in the relevant conduct. 175 F.3d at 940. In applying the first prong, \u201cthe district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. Thus, the court only may consider criminal conduct for which the defendant was held accountable. <em>Id. </em>For a drug offense, the court may not consider the \u201cgreater drug conspiracy,\u201d but only the conduct that determined the defendant\u2019s base offense level. <em>See id. </em>at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>In <em>De Varan\u2019s </em>second prong, the district court also can assess a defendant\u2019s relative culpability vis-a-vis \u201cother participants in the relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. The district court only may consider participants who are \u201cidentifiable or discernable from the evidence,\u201d and \u201c[t]he conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even if a defendant\u2019s role is \u201cless than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct,\u201d he may not be entitled to an adjustment because, in some cases, there are no minor or minimal participants. <em>Id. </em>To apply the adjustment, the district court must find that \u201cthe defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In this case, Fernandez-Tellez argues that the district court erred by denying him a minor-role adjustment. Fernandez-Tellez argues that he was not as culpable as co-conspirator Leticia Valdes and was \u201cthe low man on the [t]otem [p]ole\u201d with respect to the larger conspiracy. He says that his role was confined to being present when Valdes entered an undercover police car, tested the drugs, and determined that they were not of high quality. In addition, he argues that Valdes had the name of a drug supplier in her pocket when they were arrested, clearly indicating his minor role.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The district court did not clearly err in determining that Fernandez-Tellez failed to qualify for a minor-role reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2. Contrary to Fernandez-Tellez\u2019s argument, the district court should not consider the \u201cgreater drug conspiracy,\u201d but rather only the conduct that determined Fernandez-Tellez\u2019s base offense level. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 942. The district court reduced Fernandez-Tellez\u2019s base offense level to ensure that he was only being held responsible for the 360 grams of methamphetamine involved in his transaction with the undercover police officers. Fernandez-Tellez admitted that he inspected the 360 grams of methamphetamine. Since Fernandez-Tellez\u2019s relevant conduct was limited to the amount of drugs involved in the undercover operation, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that his role was not minor in relation to his relevant conduct. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">In addition, Fernandez-Tellez points to only one identifiable participant, Valdes, for purposes of comparison. But even if Fernandez-Tellez\u2019s role was less than that of Valdes, he is not automatically entitled to an adjustment, particularly where, as here, they performed essentially the same tasks and there were no minor or minimal participants. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in denying Fernandez-Tellez a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Fernandez-Tel-lez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
