Hooper argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove he \u201cused\u201d a firearm during the crime. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">A person violates federal law when \u201cduring and in relation to any crime of violence\u201d he \u201cuses or carries a firearm[] or ..., in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). To sustain a conviction for the use or possession of a firearm, \u201cthe government must have sufficient evidence on both the \u2018uses and carries\u2019 prong and the \u2018during and in relation to\u2019 prong.\u201d <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1250 (11th Cir.2002) (interpreting section 924(c)(1)(A)). This test requires the government to prove \u201ceither that [the defendant] used <em>or </em>carried the firearm during and in relation to the ... crime, not both.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">At trial, there was a conflict in testimony about Hooper\u2019s use of a firearm. Lieutenant Richard Edwards testified that he watched Hooper adjust a face mask and enter the Merchant <em>&amp; </em>Southern Bank in Ocala, Florida, with a gun in his hand. When Edwards yelled, \u201c[f]reeze, police,\u201d and drew his service revolver, Hooper ran out of the bank. Two bank tellers, Amanda Carrier and Susan Berry, testified that they also observed the masked robber with a gun in his hand. Edwards pursued Hooper, watched Hooper discard his mask and gun, and observed Hooper\u2019s face when he twice glanced back at Edwards. Hooper admitted at trial that he entered the bank with a gun and the intent to rob the bank, but testified, contrary to Edwards, that the gun remained in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">The trial resolved this conflict. The jury considered the conflicts in the testimony and, by returning a verdict against Hooper, found Edwards more credible. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>473 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe jury gets to make any credibility choices, and we will assume that they made them all in the way that supports the verdict.\u201d (citing <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 740 (11th Cir.1989))). The jury was entitled to find, based on Edwards\u2019s testimony, that Hooper used a firearm in violation of Section 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">Even if we were to credit Hooper\u2019s testimony, we would still conclude that the record supports Hooper\u2019s conviction. To violate section 924(c)(1)(A) under the \u201ccarry\u201d element, an individual need only possess a gun. <em>See Timmons, </em>283 F.3d at 1250 (applying the plain language interpretation used in <em>Muscarello v. U.S., </em>524 U.S. 125, 127, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 1914, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998), to the word \u201ccarry\u201d). Hooper\u2019s testimony established that he \u201ccarried\u201d a firearm when he concealed it in his pocket and possessed it with the intent to rob the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">Hooper\u2019s conviction for using or carrying a firearm is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
