The district court imposed a 63-month term of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. One of the conditions of supervised release required him to \u201cparticipate in a psychological/psychiatric counseling or treatment program, as approved and directed by the Probation Officer.\u201d The district court did not articulate its reasoning for imposing this condition, and Ross did not appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In 2007, the government sought revocation of supervised release because Ross, among other things, did not show up to required appointments with his therapist. The Probation Office Violation Report noted that Ross was no longer taking his prescribed psychotropic medication. At the revocation hearing, Ross did not dispute the recommended 11-month sentence, but \u201cask[ed] that there be no supervision to follow.\u201d Making no additional findings, the district court imposed that term of imprisonment and placed Ross on a two-year term of supervised release under the \u201csame terms and conditions\u201d as the original sentence, which in part provided that Ross \u201cshall participate in a psychological/psychiatric counseling or treatment program, as approved and directed by the Probation Officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Ross now appeals the psychiatric treatment condition. He failed to object to that condition, so our review is for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>424 F.3d 876, 879 n. 1 (9th Cir.2005). Insofar as psychiatric treatment may include medication, when \u2014 as here \u2014 a district court imposes a treatment condition without making the on-the-record findings required by <em>United States v. Williams, </em>356 F.3d 1045, 1055-57 (9th Cir.2004), the \u201call-encompassing ... condition <em>must necessarily be understood as limited </em>to those medications that do not implicate a particularly significant liberty interest of the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Cope, </em>506 F.3d 908, 919 (9th Cir.2007) (emphasis added). As the government rightly concedes, therefore, the district court could not \u201cproperly find [Ross] in violation\u201d of the treatment provision should he fail \u201cto take <em>psychotropic </em>medication.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In accordance with <em>Cope, </em>we construe the terms of Ross\u2019 supervised release to be that he \u201cshall participate in a psychological/psychiatric counseling or treatment program, as approved and directed by the Probation Officer, <em>but he may not be compelled to take medication that implicates a particularly significant liberty interest, such as psychotropics, without farther order of the dist7ict court.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">As to Ross\u2019 other belated objections, we hold that the district court did not plainly err in imposing the psychiatric treatment condition, because it was reasonably related to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c). <em>See United States v. Rearden, </em>349 F.3d 608, 619 (9th Cir.2003). Ross\u2019 argument that it impermissibly delegates judicial authority to the probation office is foreclosed by <em>Stephens. See </em>424 F.3d at 880-82 (rejecting constitutional argument); <em>id. </em>at 883 (rejecting statutory argument); <em>see also Rearden, </em>349 F.3d at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The district court remains free to modify Ross\u2019 conditions of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
