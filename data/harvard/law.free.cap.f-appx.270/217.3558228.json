For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-20\">Inasmuch as we mite primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we need not set forth the factual or historical background except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-26\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>provides a remedy for employees who are discharged by their employer for engaging in activity that is protected under the statute. To prevail on a claim of retaliatory discharge under Title VII, Rossell must demonstrate (1) that she engaged in protected activity, (2) that her employer discharged her, and (3) that the discharge was in retaliation for the protected activity she engaged in. <em>Kachmar v. SunGard Data Sys., Inc., </em>109 F.3d 173, 177 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-30\">However, a retaliatory discharge claim must be based on retaliation for an employee\u2019s opposition to a Title VII violation. <em>See Lowrey v. Texas A &amp; M Univ. Sys., </em>117 F.3d 242, 249 (5th Cir.1997). Therefore, the actions underlying the employee\u2019s conduct must be activity that Title VII was intended to protect. <em>See generally, Slagle v. County of Clarion, </em>435 F.3d 262 (3d Cir.2006). Rossell\u2019s claim is based upon alleged discrimination against the bank\u2019s customers, not its employees. She claims that she was fired because she opposed the bank\u2019s treatment of certain Black customers. Whether or not there is a grain of truth in her allegation, it is clear that Congress never intended Title VII to be stretched to cover it. <em>See Nelson v. Upsa-la College, </em>51 F.3d 383, 388 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-31\">The district court recognized that and correctly granted the Bank\u2019s motion to dismiss. We will affirm that order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-23\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court's decision to dismiss the complaint is plenary. <em>Beers-Capitol v. Whetzel, </em>256 F.3d 120, 130 n. 6 (3d Cir.2001)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
