He does not challenge his conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-19\">Athough the indictment is plainly erroneous because it fails to charge the \u201cintended or likely to deceive\u201d element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6), the error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. The evidence that the false statements were \u201cintended or likely to deceive\u201d was overwhelming and uncontroverted, and the jury was instructed before and at the end of trial that the government was required to prove that element beyond a reasonable doubt; the instruction largely mitigated the eiTor. <em>See United States v.
