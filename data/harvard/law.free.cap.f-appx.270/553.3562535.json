R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order adopting and affirming an Immigration Judge\u2019s order denying petitioners\u2019 application for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">We have reviewed the response to the court\u2019s October 1, 2007 order to show cause, and we conclude that petitioners Juan Manuel Perez and Candeler\u00eda Avendano have failed to raise a colorable constitutional or legal claim to invoke our jurisdiction over this petition for review. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the court dismisses this petition for review as to Juan Manuel Perez and Candeler\u00eda Avendano for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">A review of the response to the court\u2019s October 1, 2007 order to show cause and the administrative record also demonstrates that petitioner Oscar Perez presented at the time of his merits hearing no evidence that he had a qualifying relative for purposes of cancellation of removal as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2002). The BIA therefore correctly concluded that, as a matter of law, petitioner was ineligible for cancellation of removal. Accordingly, the questions raised by this petition for review as to Oscar Perez are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam). To the extent petitioner Oscar Perez claims he has recently married and now has a qualifying relative, we lack jurisdiction to consider unexhausted claims that could have been corrected by the Board of Immigration Appeals. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">Petitioners\u2019 motion for in forma pauperis status is granted. All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b578-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
