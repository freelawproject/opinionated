Having carefully reviewed the record and considered Diggs\u2019s arguments, we find no basis for reversal. <em>See Jacob-Mua v. Veneman, </em>289 F.3d 517, 520 (8th Cir.2002) (de novo standard of review). We also conclude there is no merit in Diggs\u2019s argument that the district court improperly coerced her into amending her complaint to substitute the City for the police department as defendant, because the police department was not amenable to suit. <em>See Ketchum v. City of West Memphis, </em>974 F.2d 81, 82 (8th Cir.1992) (police department was simply subdivision of city government and not juridical entity suable as such).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-23\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-26\">.
