Therefore, the district court properly sustained those claims and properly dismissed the remaining counterclaims because they were based on the same facts as those presented in the administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">As to the surviving claims in Daugherty\u2019s and DLMI\u2019s Fourth Amended Answer, we affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment order granted in favor of Ford Credit and Lincoln Mercury. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e), when a motion for summary judgment is made, the adverse party\u2019s response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided by the rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is genuine issue for trial. Under <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the nonmoving party will bear the burden of proof at trial, Rule 56(e) \u201crequires the nonmoving party to go beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the \u2018depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\u2019 designate \u2018specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We held in <em>Forsberg v. Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Co. </em>that a district court is \u201cnot required to comb the record to find some reason to deny a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We explained and expanded upon <em>Forsberg </em>in <em>Carmen v. San Francisco Unified School District</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Carmen, </em>we held that \u201cRule 56 may be adequately satisfied by a lawyer designating where (outside the opposition papers) the critical evidence can be found and what it says, though ordinarily the better practice would be to photocopy and attach the evidence to the opposition papers.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We further held that \u201c[wjhether the evidence is attached or not, Rule 56(e) requires that the adverse party\u2019s \u2018response,\u2019 not just the adverse party\u2019s various other papers, \u2018set forth specific facts\u2019 establishing a genuine issue.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">We have carefully examined Daugherty\u2019s opposition to the motion for summary judgment by Ford Motor Credit Company and Daugherty\u2019s opposition to motion for summary judgment by Ford Motor Company, Lincoln Mercury Division. In arguing that there is a genuine issue of material fact, Daugherty cites to the pleadings but not to any cognizable evidence. The district judge concluded that \u201cDLMI and Daugherty have not tendered any evidence of specific facts that support them contention that factual disputes exist,\u201d citing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e). At oral argument, Daugherty suggested that a genuine issue might be found in Ford\u2019s own submissions in support of its motion for summary judgment. That was not argued, though, in its opposition to summary judgment in district court, nor was it argued in its brief on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Thus, based on what was put before it and what was briefed to us, the district court did not err. In order to survive the opposing parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment, it was incumbent upon Daugherty to demonstrate by evidence cognizable under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 that there were genuine issues of material fact to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b524-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
