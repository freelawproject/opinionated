We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-22\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because there are material inconsistencies in the evidence presented that go to the heart of the claims. <em>See Chebchoub v. I.N.S., </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). Because the IJ had a basis to doubt Xue and Niu\u2019s credibility, she could properly consider the lack of documentary evidence to corroborate their claims. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-23\">Because Xue and Niu failed to demonstrate their eligibility for asylum, it follows that they did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Substantial evidence also supports the denial of relief under the CAT. See id at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-24\">The petitions for review are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b677-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
