We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">When Johnson was placed on probation, he accepted the State of Montana\u2019s required conditions. Those conditions limited his right to be free from intrusions into his residence; they provided for searches of his residence upon reasonable suspicion, and for home visits \u201cas required per policy.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government now concedes that the entry into the residence to conduct a search was not upon reasonable suspicion, but it argues that the entry was a home visit. However, the Government did not present evidence to carry its burden of persuasion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the question of whether this was a home visit as required per policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yet that is the only kind of home visit that Montana provides for. The Government\u2019s failure to support its home visit claim is fatal to its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b662-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-11\">. No doubt those restrictions were permitted under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>See Samson </em>v. <em>California, </em>547 U.S. 843, 850-52, 126 S.Ct. 2193, 2199, 165 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006); <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 122, 122 S.Ct. 587, 593, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001); <em>Griffin v. Wisconsin, </em>483 U.S. 868, 875-76, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 3169-70, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-25\">. When a residence is entered without a warrant, the Government has the burden of showing that the entry was constitutional. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>332 F.3d 1163, 1168 n. 3 (9th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Ojeda, 276 </em>F.3d 486, 488 (9th Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b662-26\">. The officers' subjective belief that they were conducting a search precludes an argument that the acts themselves are evidence of what the home visit policy might be, and the Government presented no other evidence on that subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
