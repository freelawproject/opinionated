Jul. 16, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Hwang\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although the deadline for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled in appropriate circumstances, such tolling requires a showing that the movant has exercised due diligence in vindicating his or her rights. <em>See Cekic v. INS, </em>435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2006). Due diligence depends on: 1) when the petitioner discovered or should have discovered the ineffective assistance, and 2) what actions the petitioner took in the period between this actual or constructive discovering and the filing of the motion to reopen. See <em>Jian Hua Wang v. BIA, </em>508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Iavorski v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The BIA reasonably found that Hwang did not prove due diligence warranting equitable tolling in this case. Hwang claimed that, between 1996 and 2005, she went to her prior counsel\u2019s office \u201cmany times\u201d asking if there was \u201cany chance\u201d she could reopen her case and was told every time that her case was \u201chopeless.\u201d She then filed the motion to reopen in 2006. It was clearly within the BIA\u2019s discretion to conclude, as it did, that Hwang had not \u201cadequately established that a person exercising \u2018due diligence\u2019 would wait for over a decade to seek further advice.\u201d Moreover, the BIA reasonably noted the gap of almost a year between the last time Hwang spoke with her prior counsel in 2005 and the date on which she retained present counsel and finally filed her motion to reopen. This period of inactivity alone was sufficient for the BIA to reject Hwang\u2019s claim of due diligence. <em>See Jian Hua Wang, </em>508 F.3d at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
