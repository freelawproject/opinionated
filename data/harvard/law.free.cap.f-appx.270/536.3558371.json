Towles, appeals the district court\u2019s entry of judgment in favor of Defendant/Appellee United States (\u201cthe government\u201d). Milton brought suit under the Federal Torts Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671, et seq. Milton alleged that the Veteran\u2019s Affairs medical staff at the Michael O\u2019Callahan VA Hospital in Las Vegas committed medical malpractice in treating her son, Robert K. Towles, who is now in a persistent vegetative state. Following a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of the government. We review for clear error, <em>Husain v. Olympic Airways, </em>316 F.3d 829, 835 (9th Cir.2002), and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-23\">Suits brought under the FTCA are to be decided \u201cin accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1) (1988). As Towles was treated in a VA Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, Nevada law applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Under Nevada law, \u201c \u2018[mjedical malpractice\u2019 means the failure of a physician, hospital or employee of a hospital, in rendering services, to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.\u201d Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 41A.009. \u201cTo prevail in a medical malpractice action, the plaintiff must establish the following: (1) that the doctor\u2019s conduct departed from the accepted standard of medical care or practice; (2) that the doctor\u2019s conduct was both the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury; and (3) that the plaintiff suffered damages.\u201d <em>Prabhu v. Levine, </em>112 Nev. 1538, 930 P.2d 103, 107 (1996). The plaintiff must establish all three factors by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Perez v. Las Vegas Med. Ctr., </em>107 Nev. 1, 805 P.2d 589, 591 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The district court held a five day bench trial, in which it heard testimony from 16 witnesses, including 12 physicians, three of which were called as expert witnesses. At the conclusion of the trial, and after reviewing post-trial briefing, the district court found that Milton failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, either that the VA staffs conduct departed from the accepted standard of medical care or practice, or that the conduct was the proximate cause of Towles\u2019 injury. The district court did not clearly err in either finding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b560-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
