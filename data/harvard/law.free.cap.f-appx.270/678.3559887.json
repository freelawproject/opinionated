Gallo Winery v. EnCana Corp., </em>508 F.3d 1027, 1033 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cSummary judgment is appropriate only where ... there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A material issue of fact exists as to the date the second policy was adopted. <em>Grosz-Salomon v. Paul Revere Life Insurance Co., </em>237 F.3d 1154 (9th Cir.2001), could control only if the second policy was adopted prior to the date Maynard\u2019s benefits were denied. <em>See id. </em>at 1160-61. The second policy\u2019s effective date is irrelevant unless the policy was adopted prior to the denial of Maynard\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Although there was evidence in the record as to when the second policy was effective, there was no evidence in the record as to when the policy was adopted. Given this material issue of fact, the district court abused its discretion when it denied Maynard\u2019s request for additional discovery under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f). <em>See Chance v. Pac-Tel Teletrac Inc., </em>242 F.3d 1151, 1161 n. 6 (9th Cir.2001) (providing that a court abuses its discretion in refusing further discovery under Rule 56(f) when \u201cthe movant can show how allowing additional discovery would have precluded summary judgment\u201d and the movant has diligently pursued previous discovery opportunities, as Maynard has here) (citation omitted). On remand, the district court should permit that discovery and should then resolve anew the issue of which policy controls including whether CNA\u2019s extensive reliance on the first policy throughout the claim process precluded CNA\u2019s later reliance on the second policy during this litigation. <em>See Shane v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>504 F.3d 1166, 1169 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Even if the second policy controlled, remand would still be necessary. As part of the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling, it erroneously concluded that \u201c[i]n abuse of discretion cases, evidence outside the administrative record is completely inadmissible.\u201d However, under <em>Abatie v. Alta Health and Life Insurance Company, </em>458 F.3d 955 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc), \u201c[t]he district court may in its discretion, consider evidence outside the administrative record to decide the nature, extent, and effect on the decision making process of any conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 970. Accordingly, remand is required to allow the district court to apply <em>Abatie </em>if it determines that the second policy controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">Appellant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees is premature. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 39-1.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">REVERSED AND REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b703-14\">B. FLETCHER,</author>\n<p id=\"AWT\">Circuit Judge, concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-15\">I agree that this case must be remanded for further proceedings, including discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>ery to determine the date of adoption of the second policy. I write separately because the majority opinion could be read to imply that \u2014 absent estoppel \u2014 the second policy will control if it was adopted prior to the date on which CNA denied Maynard\u2019s claim. Our caselaw makes clear, however, that the first policy would apply if (1) by its own terms, Maynard\u2019s rights had vested before CNA denied her claim, or (2) the second policy directed the administrator to apply the first policy. <em>Shane v. Albertson\u2019s Inc., </em>504 F.3d 1166, 1169 (9th Cir.2007) (noting that both the original and amended policies directed the administrator to apply the policy in effect on the date of disability). On remand, the district court after discovery will be in a better position to interpret the language of both policies to determine whether Maynard\u2019s rights had vested under the first policy or whether the second policy directed the plan administrator to apply the first policy where, as here, the claimant was not actively at work on the effective date of the second policy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
