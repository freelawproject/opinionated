The defendants moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted. The court held that Sossa-mon\u2019s due process claim was barred under the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>reasoned that the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine applied because the property officer\u2019s actions in destroying the multi-plug were not authorized by AD 03.72 and because the state provided an adequate post-deprivation remedy. <em>See Allen v. Thomas, </em>388 F.3d 147, 149 (5th Cir.2004). The court held also that Sossamon\u2019s retaliation claim failed, reasoning that the destruction of the multi-plug was too de minimus to \u201csilence a person of ordinary firmness from future First Amendment activities.\u201d Sossamon gave timely notice of his appeal. <em>See Morris v. Powell, </em>449 F.3d 682, 684-85 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Summary judgment is proper under Fed.R.CivP. 56 \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Freeman v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice, </em>369 F.3d 854, 860 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Sossamon contends that the provision AD 03.72, on which the district court based its conclusion that Williams\u2019s actions in destroying the multi-plug were not authorized, is not applicable because the multi-plug was deemed \u201cdangerous contraband.\u201d Sossamon\u2019s contention is at odds with the record, however, for the district court pointed out that the defendants filed no summary judgment evidence and did not challenge that the plug was \u00ab\u00abaltered and not dangerous contraband. Consequently, the district court correctly determined that there was no genuine issue whether Williams\u2019s actions were random and unauthorized. <em>See Allen, </em>388 F.3d at 149; <em>see also Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548. Because his actions were random and unauthorized, the district court correctly held the claim barred by the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine, because Sossa-mon has an adequate post-deprivation remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Sossamon has also failed to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to his retaliation claim or that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548. The district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment as to this issue is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Sossamon\u2019s conclusional argument does not demonstrate that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in refusing to compel discovery responses. <em>See Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., </em>392 F.3d 812, 817 (5th Cir.2004). The magistrate judge\u2019s order refusing to compel responses is not reversible.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Finally, Sossamon contends that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in refusing to appoint counsel. The record reflects that Sossamon is capable of presenting his case. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 213 (5th Cir.1982). Sossamon has not shown that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in refusing to appoint counsel. <em>See Baranowski v. Hart, </em>486 F.3d 112, 126 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">For all these reasons, which mirror those articulated by the district court, the judgment dismissing the claims is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
