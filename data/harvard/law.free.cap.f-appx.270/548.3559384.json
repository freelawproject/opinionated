R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b573-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-21\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order adopting and affirming an Immigration Judge\u2019s order denying petitioner\u2019s application for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-22\">We have reviewed the record, the motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary disposition, and the opposition thereto. We conclude that petitioner has failed to raise a colorable constitutional or legal claim to invoke our jurisdiction over this petition for review with respect to the BIA\u2019s determination that petitioner failed to establish the requisite hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction is granted with respect to the BIA\u2019s hardship determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">A review of the administrative record demonstrates that there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s decision that petitioner failed to establish either continuous physical presence in the United States for a period of not less than ten years or good moral character as required for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A), (B); <em>Lopez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 847, 850-51 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review with respect to continuous physical presence and good moral character are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">This court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), 1229c(f); <em>Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003) (dismissing petition where BIA denied voluntary departure, concluding petitioner was statutorily ineligible for such relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part, DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b573-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
