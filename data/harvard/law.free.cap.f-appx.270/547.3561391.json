INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The regulations provide that \u201ca party may file only one motion to reopen\u201d and that the motion \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Petitioner contends that his second and untimely motion to reopen meets the changed country conditions exception to these time and numerical limitations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). However, petitioner failed to provide sufficient evidence regarding a material change that he, in particular, faces a risk of persecution or torture in India. <em>See Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe critical question is ... whether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d). Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s second and untimely motion to reopen. See <em>Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 894-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
