Specifically, Santana argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying him a mitigating-role reduction because it only considered his role relative to the charged codefen-dants in this case and did not consider his role relative to the conduct of all the uncharged coconspirators who organized and profited from the drug trafficking venture. Santana points out that his role was noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>ing more than that of a courier, that he did not actually receive, nor did he believe that he would share in, any of the drug proceeds, and that various individuals who were equally responsible for the commission of the instant offense have not been arrested or prosecuted. Additionally, Santana asserts that the court failed to consider the amount of money that he was paid for his involvement in the conspiracy, his lack of equity interest in the drugs, his nonexistent role in the planning of the instant offense, and his role in the overall distribution of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by four levels if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the criminal conspiracy, or by two levels if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 8B1.2(a), (b) (2007). \u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>but we must accept the court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.2005). Specifically, we review the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense only for clear error. <em>See Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 937, 945. \u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">In <em>Rodriguez De Var\u00f3n, </em>we identified two principles that should inform the district court\u2019s determination of whether the defendant\u2019s role in an offense entitles him to a mitigating-role reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 940, 945. First, and most importantly, \u201cthe district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable\u201d at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 940. That is, \u201cthe district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. Thus, in the drug courier context, a courier \u201ccannot prove that [he] is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although courier status alone neither precludes nor establishes minor participation in an offense, \u201cwhen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Second, although we have acknowledged that the first method of analysis will be dispositive in many cases, the district court may also measure a defendant\u2019s culpability against that of other participants in a conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 945. However, a district court is limited to considering only those participants who are identifiable by the evidence and who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 944. \u201cThe conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, a defendant is not entitled to a minor-role reduction merely because he demonstrates that his role in the relevant conduct was less than that of other identifiable participants; oftentimes, no participants play a minor role. <em>Id. </em>To receive a mitigating-role reduction, the defendant must prove that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>substantially less culpable than most other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id.; </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(A) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">After carefully reviewing the record and considering the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. The relevant conduct for which Santana was held accountable at sentencing only concerned the 2,500 kilograms of cocaine that ultimately ended up on board a fishing boat, the <em>Don Juan K, </em>along with Santana and the other conspirators. The evidence supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Santana\u2019s role \u2014 as a paid crewman of the \u201cgo fast\u201d boat that initially transported this large shipment of drugs \u2014 constitutes an integral part in the conspiracy to possess the drugs with the intent to distribute them. Santana acknowledged that he could not distinguish his conduct from that of his fellow crew members, and he is no less culpable, let alone substantially less culpable, than any other discernable participants in this conspiracy. We may not, as Santana urges, compare his role to that of any individuals involved in a larger drug trafficking conspiracy that extends beyond this one sizea-ble shipment. The district court did not clearly err in denying Santana a mitigating-role reduction, and accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
