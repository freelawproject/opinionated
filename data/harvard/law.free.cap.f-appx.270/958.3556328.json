Dillon appeals her 70-month sentence for conspiracy to import cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963 (2006). On appeal, Dillon challenges her sentence on two grounds: (1) it was clear error for the district court to fail to award her requested two-level minor role sentence reduction; and (2) her <em>pre-United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentence was unreasonable under the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We find Dillon\u2019s arguments to be without merit and affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"a9l-dedup-0\">Appellant first argues that, in denying her a minor-role reduction, the district court never made factual findings establishing the relevant conduct for which she was found responsible, and this failure constituted clear error under our holding in <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 945 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). Dillon did not object below to the district court\u2019s failure to make factual findings regarding her role in the relevant conduct, and therefore we review her claim of error, raised for the first time on appeal, for plain error. <em>See United States v. Harness, </em>180 F.3d 1232, 1234 (11th Cir.1999). To reverse under a \u201cplain error\u201d standard, we must conclude that (1) there is an error; (2) the error is plain; and (3) the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless. <em>United States v. Vance, </em>494 F.3d 985, 993 (11th Cir.2007). We may correct a forfeited error, but only if the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>430 F.3d 1357, 1375 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted), cert. <em>denied, </em>547 U.S. 1149, 126 S.Ct. 2305, 164 L.Ed.2d 816 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">When determining whether the defendant is entitled to a two-level minor role reduction, a district court first \u201cmust measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which she was held accountable at sentencing....\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 945. Second, the court \u201cmay also measure the defendant\u2019s role against the other participants ... in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the district court\u2019s decision is supported by the record, and there are no unresolved factual disputes, \u201ca simple statement of the district court\u2019s conclusion is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. Accordingly, we have held that \u201ca district court is not required to make any specific findings other than the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">In deciding that Dillon\u2019s role precluded her from receiving a minor-role reduction, the district court complied with the procedural requirements of <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>when it made the ultimate determination, based on facts admitted by Dillon, that \u201cshe did exactly what [the other participants] ... did: she imported the cocaine,\u201d and concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t think she meets the criteria for a minor role reduction.\u201d Because this determination was supported by the record, the district court committed no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>error, plain or otherwise, by failing to make specific findings establishing her role in the relevant conduct since we do not require such findings under <em>De Var\u00f3n.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Dillon next argues that the district court committed substantive error in denying her a minor role reduction because her conduct was minor relative to the scope of the conspiracy and in comparison to her coconspirators. Specifically, she renews her objection to the presentence report and contends that the district court overlooked the following facts: (1) she was the only one who had no prior smuggling experience; (2) she was the only one who did not take the cruise, on which they smuggled the cocaine, with the intent to smuggle cocaine; (3) she did not learn of the importation scheme until she discovered she had been given cocaine; and (4) she was the only one who gave a truthful statement to law enforcement. Dillon asserts that this evidence established that she was less culpable than her coconspirators, and therefore should have been granted a two-level reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002). We have recognized that the district court enjoys considerable discretion in making this factual determination, and that the defendant bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 938, 939. A defendant warrants a minor-role reduction if he is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but [his] role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5 (2007). However, \u201ca defendant is not automatically entitled to a minor role adjustment merely because she was somewhat less culpable than the other discernable participants.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Given that Dillon engaged in exactly the same conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy as her coconspirators, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Dillon was not less culpable than the other participants, and therefore was not a minor participant, was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying her motion for a minor role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Finally, Dillon argues that her sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in that her personal background, lack of criminal history, and cooperation with authorities warranted a lesser sentence. She also contends that she had been tricked and coerced into participating in the conspiracy, and her \u201climited\u201d participation rendered her sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">In this procedurally unusual case, Dillon\u2019s original 2004 sentence was entered prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), but was later vacated and reinstated under our decision in <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>225 F.3d 1198 (11th Cir.2000), in order to perfect this appeal. The purpose of the <em>Phillips </em>doctrine is to put a party back in the position she would have been had ineffective assistance of counsel not deprived her of an opportunity to file a timely appeal. <em>See United States v. Parrish, </em>427 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2005) (discussing the summary nature of <em>Phillips </em>sentence reinstatement); McI<em>ver v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 1327, 1331 (11th Cir.2002) (discussing purpose of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 remedy).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">We need not and do not express an opinion about whether the <em>post-Booker </em>reinstated sentence should have been entered in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and note that there is no evidence in the record before us that Dillon made a challenge under <em>Booker </em>at the time of the' original sentence on November 12, 1004, or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>resentencing on September 28, 2006. Had Dillon timely appealed her November 12, 2004 sentence, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>which was handed down on January 12, 2005, would have been announced during the pendency of the briefing schedule in that appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 31(a) (setting an 84-day briefing schedule for appeals). This Court would have, then, reviewed for <em>Booker </em>error had the appeal been timely and had the argument not been waived. <em>See Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 716, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987) (\u201cWe therefore hold that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Dillon\u2019s pre-<em>Booker </em>sentence is subject to reasonableness review under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Dillon\u2019s failure to raise any \u00a7 3553(a) arguments below requires us to review Dillon\u2019s sentence for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Had Dillon filed a timely appeal of her 2004 sentence, the statutory <em>Booker </em>error \u2014 -treating the Guidelines as mandatory \u2014 -would have been made manifest during the appellate process. Dillon would have been able, on a timely appeal, to satisfy the first two prongs of the plain error test: there was error and it was plain after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker. </em>However, Dillon fails to satisfy the third prong of the plain error test, and cannot, under our decision in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299-1306 (11th Cir.2005), meet her burden to prove substantial prejudice. \u201c[W]here the effect of an error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate \u2014 where we would have to speculate \u2014 the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error; he has not met his burden of showing prejudice; he has not met his burden of showing that his substantial rights have been affected.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301. There must be a \u201ca reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion by the sentencing judge in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">Here, Dillon fails to demonstrate with any reasonable probability how the court below might have applied the Guidelines in an advisory fashion. At sentencing, the court indicated that it would sentence Dillon at the bottom of the Guidelines range \u2014 but notably without a minor-role reduction \u2014 and expressed no desire to sentence below that range had it been available to the court. <em>Cf. United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1332 (11th Cir.2005) (finding reasonable probability of prejudice when district court made several remarks on the record about the Guidelines range being too severe, sentenced defendant to the lowest possible range, and indicated that said sentence was \u201cmore than appropriate\u201d). In this case, it would be nothing more than guesswork on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>our parts to discern any probability of a reduced sentence in a <em>post-Booker </em>context, and therefore we find Dillon has failed to demonstrate prejudice under our plain error review to entitle her to a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">We find no plain error in the entry of Dillon\u2019s 2004 sentence and accordingly the sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-6\">. Dillon has not made a constitutional challenge to her <em>pre-Booker </em>sentence, and accordingly has waived this argument. <em>See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(Booker-Apprendi </em>issues and contentions not timely raised in an appellant\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned). We additionally observe that Dillon expressly waived her right to raise constitutional challenges to her sentence at the time she executed her plea agreement. Not only does the plea agreement reflect this waiver, but so too does Dillon\u2019s plea colloquy. Nevertheless, we will assume without deciding that this waiver did not include a waiver of what we have referred to elsewhere as \"[s]tatutory <em>Booker </em>error,\u201d whereby the court treats the Guidelines as mandatory instead of advisory. <em>See United States v. Houston, </em>456 F.3d 1328, 1339 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b986-16\">.
