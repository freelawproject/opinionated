Regalado, and Leonardo Hernandez (collectively Soil Tech). Prime Insurance contends that: (1) Soil Tech is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because the district court dismissed Prime Insurance\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which Prime Insurance argues is not an adjudication on the merits; (2) the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees after it dismissed Prime Insurance\u2019s complaint; and (3) Soil Tech\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees was untimely filed and accordingly should have been denied by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">In the suit underlying this appeal, Prime Insurance sought a declaratory judgment against Soil Tech regarding a business automobile liability and property damage policy it had issued to Soil Tech. After answering Prime Insurance\u2019s third amended complaint, Soil Tech moved for summary judgment, arguing among other things that Prime Insurance\u2019s third amended complaint did not satisfy the amount in controversy requirement for federal diversity jurisdiction. The district court dismissed the third amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, allowing Prime Insurance twenty days to file an amended complaint curing the jurisdictional defect. Prime Insurance did not file an amended complaint and did not appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">Forty-nine days after the district court dismissed Prime Insurance\u2019s complaint, Soil Tech filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees, arguing that it was entitled to the fees under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.428(1) because it was the prevailing party. The distinct court granted the motion in part, awarding Soil Tech $10,290.00 in attorney\u2019s fees and $216.82 in costs. Prime Insurance appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">Prime Insurance first contends that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.428(1) permits a court to award attorney\u2019s fees only where the prevailing party succeeded on the merits, which it claims Soil Tech did not do because the complaint was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We have consistently recognized that in diversity cases a party\u2019s right to attorney\u2019s fees is determined by reference to state law. <em>See All Underwriters v. Weisberg, </em>222 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.428(1) is substantive law under the Erie doctrine). Under certain circumstances Florida law permits an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in a dispute between an insurer and its insured. Section 627.428(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-13\">Upon the rendition of a judgment or decree by any of the courts of this state against an insurer and in favor of any named or omnibus insured or the named beneficiary under a policy or contract executed by the insurer, the trial court or, in the event of an appeal in which the insured or beneficiary prevails, the appellate court shall adjudge or decree against the insurer and in favor of the insured or beneficiary a reasonable sum as fees or compensation for the insured\u2019s or beneficiary\u2019s attorney prosecuting the suit in which the recovery is had.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.428(1). This provision applies both when the insured prevails in a suit it brought against its insurer and when the insured prevails in a suit brought against it by its insurer. <em>Roberts v. Carter, </em>350 So.2d 78, 79 n. 6 (Fla.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>We are not persuaded by Prime Insurance\u2019s argument that a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is insufficient to warrant an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.428(1). By its very terms, the statute does not require an insured party to succeed on the merits of a case in order to recover attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.428(1). Moreover, Florida courts applying the statute have awarded attorney\u2019s fees even in cases where the insured party did not prevail \u201con the merits.\u201d <em>See Dawson v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>283 So.2d 860, 861 (Fla. 3d DCA 1970) (concluding that the dismissal of an insurer\u2019s declaratory judgment action against its insured was a \u201crendition of a judgment against an insurer in favor of an insured\u201d under a previous version of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.428(1), even though the trial court did not reach the merits of the insurer\u2019s claims because the underlying worker\u2019s compensation dispute was pending before an administrative agency); <em>see also Home Ins. Co. v. Drescher, </em>220 So.2d 902, 903-04 (Fla.1969) (awarding attorney\u2019s fees incurred in litigating the appeal before the Florida Supreme Court after discharging a writ of certiorari as improvidently granted); <em>Arango v. United Auto. Ins. Co., </em>901 So.2d 320, 321 (Fla. 3d DCA 2005) (\u201cWe construe the prevailing party clause in the appellate fee portion of section 627.428, which mandates a fee award \u2018in the event of an appeal in which the insured or beneficiary prevails\u2019 to include cases in which an insurer commences an appeal, but the appeal is then dismissed without a decision on the merits.\u201d); <em>Leaf v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>544 So.2d 1049, 1050-51 (Fla. 4th DCA 1989) (reversing the trial court and ordering an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.428 where the trial court granted the insured\u2019s motion to compel arbitration but did not reach the underlying merits of the insurance dispute, reasoning that the statute\u2019s purpose \u201cis to penalize a carrier for wrongfully causing its insured to resort to litigation to resolve a conflict when it was reasonably within the carrier\u2019s power to do so.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Prime Insurance relies on <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Maryland v. USAFORM Hail Pool, Inc., </em>465 F.Supp. 478 (M.D.Fla. 1979), as support for the \u201con the merits\u201d requirement it would read into Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.428(1), but its reliance is misplaced. While that district court opinion does use the language \u201con the merits,\u201d it does not cite any statutory language or Florida case as support for the requirement. In any event, we are not bound by that decision. Instead, because we are required to apply state law, we must follow the decisions of the Florida Supreme Court and Florida\u2019s intermediate appellate courts. <em>See generally McMahan v. Tato, </em>311 F.3d 1077, 1079 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201c[T]he rule is that, absent a decision from the state supreme court on an issue of state law, we are bound to follow decisions of the state\u2019s intermediate appellate courts unless there is some persuasive indication that the highest court of the state would decide the issue differently.\u201d). We conclude that under Florida law Soil Tech was entitled to its attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Prime Insurance also contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees because it dismissed the third amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We disagree. While it is true that a district court may not adjudicate the merits of a claim once it has determined that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, <em>see Stanley v. CIA, </em>639 F.2d 1146, 1157 (5th Cir. Mar.1981)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cWhen a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>court must dismiss a case for lack of jurisdiction, the court should not adjudicate <em>the merits of the claim.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)), that is not what we have here. The court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees was collateral to the merits of the case and was therefore within the court\u2019s jurisdiction, even after the court determined it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying suit. <em>Cf. Willy v. Coastal Corp., </em>503 U.S. 131, 138, 112 S.Ct. 1076, 1080, 117 L.Ed.2d 280 (1992) (concluding that a district court could impose Rule 11 sanctions even where it was later determined that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying case because an \u201cimposition of a Rule 11 sanction is not a judgment on the merits of an action. Rather, it requires the determination of a collateral issue: whether the attorney has abused the judicial process, and, if so, what sanction would be appropriate. Such an order implicates no constitutional concern because it does not signify a district court\u2019s assessment of the legal merits of the complaint\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); <em>Moore v. Permanente Med. Group, </em>981 F.2d 443, 445 (9th Cir.1992) (concluding that the district court retained jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees even after remanding the case to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because \u201cit is clear that an award of attorney\u2019s fees is a collateral matter over which a court normally retains jurisdiction even after being divested of jurisdiction on the merits\u201d); <em>cf. also Morand v. Stoneburner, </em>516 So.2d 270, 271 (Fla. 5th DCA 1987) (\u201cWe believe, however, that this court\u2019s jurisdiction to award fees in connection with the dismissal of an appeal is separate and apart from its jurisdiction to hear the merits of a particular case. We note a line of cases [that] have upheld the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees from insurance carriers by prevailing insureds, where the carrier\u2019s petition for certiorari review is denied in the supreme court for lack of jurisdiction. It would seem that these cases are in accord with the principle that a court has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction, and that ancillary to such determination can award attorney\u2019s fees where authorized by statute.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Finally, Prime Insurance\u2019s contention that Soil Tech did not timely file its motion for attorney\u2019s fees is of no moment. The local rules for the Southern District of Florida require that a motion for attorney\u2019s fees be filed and served within thirty days of the entry of a final judgment or other appealable order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> S.D. Fla. R. 7.3.A(vii). The order dismissing Prime Insurance\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction did not become a final, appealable order until after the twenty-day period the district court allowed for amendments to the complaint expired. <em>See Schuurman v. Motor Vessel \u201cBetty K V\u201d, </em>798 F.2d 442, 445 (11th Cir.1986) (holding that where the district court dismisses a complaint and provides a stated period within which the plaintiff may amend, \u201cthe order of dismissal ... becomes final upon the expiration of the time allowed for amendment. The time for appeal is measured from the date on which the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>court order of dismissal becomes final\u201d). Soil Tech filed its motion for attorney\u2019s fees twenty-nine days after the amendment period expired. Its motion was therefore timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-4\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit that were rendered prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b989-6\">. Prime Insurance also cites Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(2)(B) and suggests that Soil Tech's motion was untimely because it was not filed within fourteen days. In <em>Tire Kingdom, Inc. v. Morgan Tire &amp; Auto, Inc., </em>253 F.3d 1332 (11th Cir.2001), we considered and rejected the same argument. <em>Id. </em>at 1335. There, we concluded that S.D. Fla. R. 7.3 was an \"order of the court\u201d that extended the time to file a motion for attorney's fees beyond the fourteen days allowed under the Federal Rules. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
