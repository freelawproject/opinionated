Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006). We review de novo questions of law. <em>Id. </em>We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-22\">The IJ correctly concluded that Villam-il-Ocampo is ineligible for cancellation of removal because of his 1996 conviction for possession of cocaine under California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11350(a). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C). Contrary to Vil-lamil-Ocampo\u2019s contention, he does not qualify for relief under the Federal First Offender Act (\u201cFFOA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3607, because he previously received the state-law equivalent of FFOA relief with respect to his 1992 charge. <em>See de Jesus Melendez v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1019, 1020 (9th Cir.2007) (alien may not avoid the immigration consequences of a drug conviction as a first offender when, as a result of a prior drug possession arrest, he was granted pretrial diversion under California law and was not required to plead guilty).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-23\">Villamil-Ocampo\u2019s due process contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary decision to deny voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 654 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (stating that the REAL ID Act \u201cdoes not restore jurisdiction over discretionary determinations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b729-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
