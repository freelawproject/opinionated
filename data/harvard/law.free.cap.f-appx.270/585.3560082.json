Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir.2006) (concluding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 denial of motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case if a prior adverse discretionary decision was made by the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-20\">Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is also construed as a motion, in part, for summary disposition. So construed, respondent\u2019s motion is granted.
