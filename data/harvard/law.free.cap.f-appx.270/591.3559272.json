INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c). The motion was filed on April 17, 2007, over ninety days after the BIA\u2019s final administrative order of removal issued on July 20, 2006. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition in part is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Respondent\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss in part is granted because the court lacks jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its discretionary authority to reopen sua sponte. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1158-59 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, the petition for review is dismissed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
