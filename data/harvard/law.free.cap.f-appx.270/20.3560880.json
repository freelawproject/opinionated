Sadowski seeks review of a February 13, 2007 order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), dismissing his appeal from an Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his motion to terminate removal proceedings, and denying his request for remand to pursue a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). <em>In re Sadowski, </em>No. A 19 530 563 (B.I.A. Feb. 13, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 19 530 563 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 17, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case, as well as the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-23\">Sadowski first argues that the BIA erred in affirming, on the ground that he no longer had a pending naturalization application before the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), the IJ\u2019s denial of his request to terminate his removal pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ceedings. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1239.2(f) (\u201cAn immigration judge may terminate removal proceedings to permit the alien to proceed to a final hearing on a pending application or petition for naturalization when the alien has established prima facie eligibility for naturalization and the matter involves exceptionally appealing or humanitarian factors.\u201d). Sadowski asserts that because the DHS erroneously adjudicated his naturalization application on the merits while he was still in removal proceedings, that adjudication was essentially void <em>ab initio </em>and his naturalization application remained pending as a matter of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429 (\u201c[N]o application for naturalization shall be considered by the Attorney General if there is pending against the applicant a removal proceeding pursuant to a warrant of arrest....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Sadowski concedes that he did not raise this argument before the BIA. Therefore, he has not administratively exhausted the question of whether his naturalization application remained legally pending, and we decline to address it here. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104 n. 1, 124-25 (2d Cir.2007). We also reject Sadowski\u2019s arguments that, despite his failure to exhaust this issue, we should still consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Sadowski next contends that the IJ should have determined that he was <em>prima facie </em>eligible for naturalization under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1239.2(f). The BIA did not address this argument on the merits, holding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s choice <em>not </em>to make a <em>prima facie </em>eligibility determination because it was not a reviewable decision under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b)(3). We find no error in this conclusion. Further, remand to the BIA to consider this issue on the merits would be futile in light of the Board\u2019s recent decision in <em>Matter of Hidalgo, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 103, 106 (B.I.A.2007). In that case, the BIA held that \u201cneither [the Board] nor the Immigration Judges have authority to determine [an alien\u2019s] prima facie eligibility for naturalization in order to terminate removal proceedings pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1239.2(f),\u201d and that \u201cit is appropriate for the Board and the Immigration Judges to require some form of affirmative communication from the DHS prior to terminating proceedings based on [the alien\u2019s] pending naturalization application.\u201d The BIA has interpreted 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1239.2(f) to preclude an IJ from determining an alien\u2019s prima facie eligibility for naturalization. We defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation, since it is not plainly erroneous, inconsistent with the regulation, or inconsistent with the agency\u2019s previous interpretation. <em>See Zhen Nan Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>459 F.3d 255, 262 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Finally, the BIA did not err in denying Sadowski\u2019s request for remand to pursue a waiver of inadmissibility under Section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). Section 212(h) relief is unavailable to a lawful permanent resident who has been convicted of an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). In 1988, Sadowski was convicted of first degree manslaughter under N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 125.20(1). We have expressly held that \u201cfirst-degree manslaughter in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 125.20(1) or (2) is categorically a crime of violence.\u201d <em>Vargas-Sarmiento v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>448 F.3d 159, 172 (2d Cir.2006). Because Sadowski was convicted of a crime of violence, the immigration laws classify him as an aggravated felon. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). The BIA therefore did not err in denying Sadowski\u2019s request for a remand to pursue Section 212(h) relief. We have considered Sadowski\u2019s remaining arguments, and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
