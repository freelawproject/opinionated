Hayes, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b546-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">Kevin Devers appeals his jury conviction of two counts of transportation of a minor for prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3741, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">Devers contends the district court erred in admitting evidence that he smoked marijuana with TW, a minor, and expert testimony that pimps manipulate prostitutes by threatening their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">Evidence of other unlawful conduct is admissible if it is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with evidence concerning the crime charged. <em>United States v. Soliman, </em>813 F.2d 277, 279 (9th Cir.1987). It may also satisfy the requirements of Fed. R.Evid. 404(b). We have explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACh\">Other acts evidence is admissible under Rule 404(b) if it (1) tends to prove a material point in issue; (2) is not too remote in time; (3) is proven with evidence sufficient to show that the act was committed; and (4) if admitted to prove intent, is similar to the offense charged. The court must then assess the evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 403.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-17\"><em>United States v. Beckman, </em>298 F.3d 788, 794 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-18\">Neither drug use nor violence towards prostitutes\u2019 families are elements in the case. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>291 F.3d 1180, 1189 (9th Cir.2002). They do not constitute part of the transaction that forms the basis for the criminal charge and are not necessary for a coherent story regarding the crime. <em>Id. </em>The government did not provide any evidence that Devers\u2019s drug use was a method of exerting dominion over TW or that Devers threatened TW\u2019s family. Accordingly, the district court erred when it admitted evidence that was neither \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the criminal charge nor admissible under Rule 404(b) because it does not prove a material point in the case. <em>Beckman, </em>298 F.3d at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-19\">However, these errors were harmless because direct witness testimony and Devers\u2019s admissions provided strong, direct evidence that Devers committed the crimes charged. The district court also specifically instructed the jury that Devers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>was not on trial for any conduct or offense not charged in the indictment. In addition, the district court gave a limiting instruction regarding the proper use of the other crimes evidence. Given that a jury is presumed to follow its instructions, <em>see Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 540, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993), any error in admitting the challenged evidence was harmless. <em>United States v. Dering-ton, </em>229 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Devers also contends that the district court improperly denied him the opportunity to inform the jury adequately as to his theory of defense by refusing to give his proposed \u201cinnocent travel\u201d instruction. We uphold the district court\u2019s formulation of an instruction if the jury instructions, taken as a whole, are not misleading or inadequate to guide the jury\u2019s deliberations. <em>United States v. Joetzki, </em>952 F.2d 1090, 1095 (9th Cir.1991). Although the district court refused Devers\u2019s proposed instruction, the jury instructions clearly stated the law and adequately incorporated Devers\u2019s proposed \u201cinnocent travel\u201d instruction. <em>United States v. Solomon, </em>825 F.2d 1292, 1295 (9th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the district court did not err in refusing to give Devers\u2019s proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b546-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\">. Devers also argues that the district court erred in admitting evidence that: a) Devers was becoming a \"gorilla pimp;\u201d b) Devers regularly battered another prostitute; c) TW had a difficult upbringing; d) Devers had sexual intercourse with TW; and e) TW mentored another prostitute. Because these contentions were not raised in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Vonti, </em>535 U.S. 55, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). For the reasons discussed above, including the strong, direct evidence supporting the crimes charged and the district court's limiting instructions, this evidence was not \"highly prejudicial,\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), and the district court did not commit plain error by admitting it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
