He was sentenced to the mandatory minimum term of 15 years under the provisions of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA or the Act), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), and now appeals the district court\u2019s sentencing order, contending: (1) that the government\u2019s failure to provide written notice of its intent to request a sentence under the Act violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments as well as the ACCA itself; (2) that the sentencing judge\u2019s determination that McGov-ney\u2019s prior sentences qualified as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial; and (3) that one of his burglary convictions did not qualify as a predicate offense under the Act. We find no basis on which to overturn the sentence and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">The first two issues raised on appeal require little analysis or discussion. Formal notice is not required under the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>See United States v. Mauldin, </em>109 F.3d 1159, 1162-1163 (6th Cir.1997). Moreover, the defendant in this case had actual notice almost two months prior to his sentencing hearing \u2014 at the very latest \u2014 in compliance with the requirements of procedural due process. <em>See Oyler v. Boles, </em>368 U.S. 448, 452, 82 S.Ct. 501, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962) (\u201c[A] defendant must receive reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard relative to [a] recidivist charge even if due process does not require that notice be given prior to the trial on the substantive offense.\u201d). Nor is he entitled to have a jury determine that his prior convictions qualify as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under the Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>See James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1600 &amp; n. 8, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), in which the Supreme Court rejected a Sixth Amendment challenge to an ACCA enhancement, calling the sentencing court\u2019s determination a matter of \u201cstatutory interpretation, not judicial fact-finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In his third and final issue on appeal, McGovney challenges the district court\u2019s determination that his 1983 conviction for third-degree burglary under Kentucky Revised Statute \u00a7 511.040 qualified as a predicate felony under the ACCA. <em>See </em>Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 511.040 (1999). Because there was no objection to the inclusion of this conviction in the defendant\u2019s presentence report and only a nonspecific objection to application of the Act at the sentencing hearing, we review the alleged defect in the sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Murphy, </em>241 F.3d 447, 450 (6th Cir.2001) (claim of error is subject to plain error review when the defendant \u201cdid not specifically object on the ground which he now attempts to argue on appeal\u201d). Under that standard, the defendant can prevail only if there was error below that was plain and that affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and impugned the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 380 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Our first step, therefore, is to determine whether the district court misinterpreted the Kentucky burglary statute, as McGovney contends. Under the ACCA, the recidivist enhancement applies to a defendant who has three or more prior convictions for violent felonies. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Burglary is considered a violent felony for purposes of the Act if it involves \u201can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Recognizing that the state statutory definitions of burglary vary, the <em>Taylor </em>decision provides that \u201cwhere the generic definition has been adopted, with minor variations in terminology, then the trial court need find only that the state statute corresponds in substance to the generic meaning of burglary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Here, McGovney argues that the 1983 conviction does not qualify because the offense as set out in the Kentucky statute is broader than the generic definition of burglary in <em>Taylor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Without question, the language of the Kentucky burglary statute is at variance with the generic definition of burglary in <em>Taylor. </em>Although the elements of the offense line up with the generic definition, the Kentucky statute differs in that it includes within its definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">\u201cBuilding,\u201d in addition to its ordinary meaning, means any structure, vehicle, watercraft or aircraft:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">(a) Where any person lives; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">(b) Where people assemble for purposes of business, government, education, religion, entertainment or public transportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 511.010(1) (1999). Because the statute covers break-ins of vehicles, watercraft, and aircraft, the defendant contends that his conviction for entering a \u201cbuilding\u201d cannot meet the <em>Taylor </em>test without further evidence. In this regard, he relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction in <em>Shepard v. United States </em>that \u201cenquiry under the ACCA to determine whether a plea of guilty to burglary defined by a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d 544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). Apparently, the only document produced in this case was an \u201coffense report\u201d mentioned in the presen-tencing report, which is not a qualifying document under <em>Shepard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The government argues in response that we should hold that the Kentucky statute is, in fact, generic under <em>Taylor </em>for purposes of the ACCA. Yes, the Kentucky statute broadens the definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d to include \u201cvehicles, watercraft and aircraft\u201d but, the government points out, they qualify as a \u201cbuilding\u201d only if used as residences or places of assembly. This argument has some appeal, viewed in terms of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent analysis in <em>James:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">The main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another\u2019s property, but rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party \u2014 whether an occupant, a police officer, or a bystander\u2014 who comes to investigate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">127 S.Ct. at 1594. Nevertheless, like the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States v. Grisel, </em>488 F.3d 844 (9th Cir.2007), in which the <em>en banc </em>court reviewed a similar Oregon burglary statutory to determine whether it could be considered \u201cgeneric\u201d for ACCA purposes, we are reluctant to read the Act\u2019s terminology too broadly. As the majority noted in <em>Chisel, </em>\u201cAlthough a vehicle or boat that has been adapted for accommodation may qualify as a building in certain circumstances, it does not do so categorically.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 851, n. 5. Certainly, we cannot say, in the words of <em>Taylor, </em>that the state statute\u2019s definition of burglary has merely \u201cminor variations in terminology\u201d in comparison to the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of generic burglary in that case. 495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">A determination that, under the Kentucky statute, burglary does not quality categorically as a crime of violence would not, however, end the inquiry. We would still need to consider whether the defendant\u2019s conviction qualifies under the modified categorical approach approved in <em>Shepard. </em>Although the record in this case does not contain written documentation to support a conclusion that McGovney\u2019s 1983 conviction involved a building that would qualify under TayloTs generic definition, the colloquy between the district judge and the defendant can be considered under <em>Shepard. </em>The transcript of the sentencing hearing shows that defense counsel conceded that his client\u2019s three prior burglary convictions \u201cappeared] to meet the requirements under <em>U.S. v. Taylor </em>and <em>U.S. v. Shepard,\u201d </em>while at the same time indicating that he wished to \u201cpreserve the objection\u201d to ACCA sentencing. In addressing the district judge, the defendant took the position that he did not \u201cfit the category\u201d of a career criminal, at the same time admitting on the record that the 1983 burglary for which he was convicted was committed \u201con Heck\u2019s Dry Cleaning,\u201d thereby corroborating the information in the presentence report. That information established that \u201cofficers ... dispatched to Heck\u2019s Cleaners in reference to a possible burglary ... observed that a window had been broken out of the building\u201d and arrested the defendant, who was at the scene and was \u201cidentified by the witness as the perpetrator.\u201d In view of the defendant\u2019s admission, we conclude that a remand for the purpose of further substantiation is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Under the unique circumstances of this case, we hold that the district court\u2019s reliance on the presentence report to qualify the conviction in question as a violent felony under the ACCA was not plain error. Certainly, that reliance cannot be said to have affected the defendant\u2019s substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>rights or to have impugned the integrity of the proceedings that resulted in the sentence imposed. For this reason, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
