We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The BIA correctly dismissed Gomis\u2019 appeal because it was filed a week late. <em>See Da Cruz v. INS, 4 </em>F.3d 721, 722 (9th Cir.1993); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.38(b) (requiring the notice of appeal to the BIA to be filed within 30 days of the IJ\u2019s decision). Gom-is\u2019 contention that the \u201cprison mailbox rule,\u201d which deems papers filed when delivered to prison authorities for forwarding to a court clerk, should apply here to render his appeal timely lacks merit because the regulation governing appeals to the BIA defines the date of filing as \u201cthe date the Notice is received by the Board.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.38(c); <em>cf. Nigro v. Sullivan, </em>40 F.3d 990, 994-96 (9th Cir.1994). Accordingly, we do not reach Gomis\u2019 contentions regarding the underlying merits of the 2005 removal order. <em>See Da Cruz, 4 </em>F.3d at 722-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider challenges to the 2004 removal order and any other previous agency determinations. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (requiring a petition for review to be filed within 30 days of the challenged final removal order). We also lack jurisdiction to review Gomis\u2019 claims regarding detention and government misconduct. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) (conferring jurisdiction over final orders of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Our jurisdiction to consider Gomis\u2019 claim of derivative citizenship is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the claim as frivolous. <em>See Iasu v. Smith, </em>511 F.3d 881, 886, 889-91 (9th Cir.2007) (acknowledging jurisdiction over non-frivolous citizenship claims in petitions for review). Gomis states his father may have obtained citizenship at some point when he was a sailor but does not set forth a basis for deriving status from his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Gomis\u2019 remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">All pending motions and requests are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b683-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
