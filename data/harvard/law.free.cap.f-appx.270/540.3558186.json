R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b565-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-21\">Thelma Spirtos (\u201cThelma\u201d) appeals a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\u201cBAP\u201d) decision affirming a settlement agreement between the trustee of Basil Spirtos\u2019s (\u201cBasil\u2019s\u201d) bankruptcy estate and one of the estate\u2019s creditors. She also appeals the BAP\u2019s orders imposing $22,500 in sanctions for a frivolous appeal and a frivolous petition for rehearing. We affirm the decision and the sanctions orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-22\">Thelma lacks standing to object to the settlement agreement. Thelma proffered her claim against Basil\u2019s bankruptcy estate in support of her failed Chapter 11 plan, and the claim subsequently became property of her Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate. Therefore, the trustee of Thelma\u2019s bankruptcy estate possesses the exclusive right to object to the settlement agreement on behalf of the estate, and he filed a notice of non-opposition. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 323; <em>Moneymaker v. CoBen (In re </em>Eisen), 31 F.3d 1447, 1451 n. 2 (9th Cir.1994); <em>see also Estate of Spirtos v. One San Bernar-dino County Superior Court Case Numbered SPR 02211, </em>443 F.3d 1172, 1175-76 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-23\">Thelma argues that part of her claim against Basil\u2019s bankruptcy estate, the child support arrearages, did not become part of her bankruptcy estate. Thelma is judicially estopped from raising this argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>because it is inconsistent with Thelma\u2019s prior proffer of her entire claim against Basil\u2019s estate to support her failed Chapter 11 plan, a proffer that was accepted by the bankruptcy court. <em>See Hamilton v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>270 F.3d 778, 782-85 (9th Cir.2001). Moreover, the issue whether Thelma is estopped from asserting ownership in any part of her claim against Basil\u2019s bankruptcy estate has already been litigated and decided. <em>See Spirtos v. Moreno (In re Thelma </em>Spirtos), No. 02-1243 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. Mar. 28, 2003) (unpublished memorandum disposition).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thelma is precluded from re-litigating it. <em>See, e.g., Kourtis v. Cameron, </em>419 F.3d 989, 994 (9th Cir.2005) (listing requirements of issue preclusion under federal law); <em>Pena v. Gardner, </em>976 F.2d 469, 472 (9th Cir.1992) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Because Thelma lacked standing to object to the settlement agreement, we do not reach the BAP\u2019s alternative basis for affirming the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The BAP did not abuse its discretion in imposing $22,500 in sanctions on Thelma and her attorneys Michelle Spirtos and Jon Eardley for Thelma\u2019s frivolous appeal and frivolous petition for rehearing. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8020. Both the appeal and the PFR were \u201cwholly without merit.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Sentry Life Ins. Co., </em>729 F.2d 652, 656 (9th Cir.1984) (applying Fed. R.App. P. 38); <em>see also </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8020 advisory committee\u2019s notes. Thelma lacked standing to litigate any of her claims, and Thelma\u2019s petition for rehearing failed to address the BAP\u2019s substantive basis for affirming the settlement agreement. Thelma\u2019s discussion of <em>Ehrenberg v. California State University (In re Beachport </em>Entertainment), 396 F.3d 1083, 1087 (9th Cir.2005), which addressed the imposition of sanctions under Rule 8010, is inapplicable to the sanctions in this case, which were imposed under Rule 8020.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b565-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
