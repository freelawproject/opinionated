He contends that in sentencing him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the district court failed sufficiently to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and failed to impose a sentence that was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, in light of the nature of his prior convictions. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">In his plea agreement, Cortez waived the right to appeal his sentence but retained the right to appeal \u201cthe court\u2019s determination of [his] criminal history category.\u201d The district court placed Cortez in criminal history category V. It found that he was a career offender, which raised his criminal history category to VI under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">Cortez does not challenge the determination of his criminal history category, but rather argues that the district court should have imposed a sentence outside the Guidelines. This argument falls within the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Speel-man, </em>431 F.3d 1226, 1229 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b664-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
