Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 1051, 1053 (9th Cir.2006). We review de novo whether a crime is an aggravated felony. <em>Kharana v. Gonzales, </em>487 F.3d 1280, 1283 (9th Cir.2007). We review the BIA\u2019s decision because it conducted an independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>review of the record. <em>Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1193 (9th Cir.2003). As the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history of this case, we do not recite them here, except as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">To determine whether a crime is an aggravated felony, we \u201ccompare its elements to the relevant definition of an aggravated felony in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).\u201d <em>Chang v. INS, </em>307 F.3d 1185, 1189 (9th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)). Manning was convicted of violating Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) \u00a7 205.463.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This statute is a divisible statute whereby a person can violate it by knowingly obtaining and using personal identifying information (1) to harm another person or (2) for any unlawful purpose. <em>See, e.g., Carty v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1081, 1083 (9th Cir.2005). Because obtaining and using personal information to harm another person does not require fraud or deceit, the crime is not categorically an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">If a state statute is \u201ccategorically broader than the generic definition of a crime,\u201d we apply the modified categorical approach and look to certain documents underlying the conviction to determine whether the alien\u2019s conviction under that statute qualifies as a conviction of the generic crime, here an aggravated felony. <em>See Navarro-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1063, 1073 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). Here, the documents of conviction do not \u201cunequivocally establish that the defendant pleaded guilty to all elements of the generic offense.\u201d <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 892, 896 n. 7 (9th Cir.2004). The guilty plea stated that Manning pleaded guilty to Counts 1 &amp; 2 \u201cas more fully alleged in the charging document.\u201d The indictment described her intent in the disjunctive, \u201cto harm said person <em>or </em>for any unlawful purpose\u201d (emphasis added), and was not an admission of an intent to defraud or deceive. The facts pleaded and the plea colloquy established that she made unauthorized transfers but failed to establish that the transfers necessarily involved fraud or deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Furthermore, the BIA erred in relying on the Presentence Report (PSR) for additional facts that established that Manning fraudulently transferred these funds into her own account. A PSR is not a document of conviction that may properly be considered as part of a modified categorical analysis. <em>See Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 1121, 1132 (9th Cir.2006). Though the Amended Guilty Plea Agreement stated that the parties agreed to use the PSR dated February 24, 2004, it did not state that the parties agreed to use this document to provide a factual basis for the plea. Without such a statement, we decline to conclude that the parties meant to use the PSR for more than its routine use in sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Because the documents of conviction do not unequivocally establish that Manning pleaded guilty to every element of the generic crime as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), we grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">We GRANT the petition for review, VACATE the order of removal, and REMAND the matter to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b656-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\">. We interpret NRS \u00a7 205.463 as it existed in 2004, at the time of Manning\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b657-12\">LARSON, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqUf\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Court should apply the modified categorical approach to determine if petitioner was convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). I also agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that, absent a specific manifestation of the parties\u2019 intent to incorporate the findings of the PSR as part of the factual basis of the plea, the Court may not rely on the facts set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">However, unlike the majority, I would conclude that petitioner\u2019s admission during the plea colloquy that she was not authorized to enter into the relevant transactions is an admission that she committed an offense \u201cinvolving fraud or deceit.\u201d Viewed in the context presented by the documents of conviction, by admitting she made unauthorized transactions, petitioner necessarily admitted that either she had no authority to make the transfers or she exceeded the authority delegated to her by her employer to make the transfers. In either circumstance, to effectuate those transfers, she would have by necessity made either an affirmative representation that she was authorized to do so, or she would have made a material omission by failing to disclose that she was not authorized to do so. Either of those alternatives involve deceptive conduct. <em>Bobb v. Attorney General, </em>458 F.3d 213, 218 (3d Cir.2006) (noting that the Third Circuit has held that Congress intended 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) to have a broad scope because the provision refers to an offense that <em>\u201cinvolves </em>fraud or deceit\u201d) (emphasis in the original); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>435 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201cdeceit\u201d as \u201c[t]he act of intentionally giving a false impression\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Because I believe that the documents of conviction unequivocally establish that petitioner pleaded guilty to every element of the generic crime as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), I would deny the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
