We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the IJ\u2019s decision directly because the BIA adopted it as the final agency determination. <em>See Mashiri v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 1112, 1118 (9th Cir.2004). We grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">We examine the record to determine whether substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Toma is not credible. <em>See Gui v. I.N.S., </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002). Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. In the IJ\u2019s decision, the IJ admits that Toma\u2019s inconsistent testimony regarding the complexities of the different Kurdish groups, by itself, would not be enough to support an adverse credibility determination. The other basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, that Toma\u2019s statement of incarceration was not credible, is also not supported by substantial evidence. The IJ addressed the inconsistency regarding the reasons for Toma\u2019s incarceration (supplying weapons versus supplying food and medicine to the Kurds), but did not give Toma an opportunity to explain the perceived inconsistency in the record. <em>See Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 611, 618 (9th Cir.2004). Moreover, the IJ further found it implausible that Toma did not bleed when he was beaten with a two-inch diameter stick. The IJ also found it significant that Toma was not subject to more severe punishment by Saddam Hussein and the Ba\u2019ath Party if Toma was really suspected of supplying weapons to the Kurds. These findings are based on conjecture and speculation, which is an impermissible basis for an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Ge v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1121, 1126 (9th Cir.2004) (findings cannot be based on personal conjecture about what authorities would or would not do); <em>Lopez-Reyes v. I.N.S., </em>79 F.3d 908, 912 (9th Cir.1996) (findings based on \u201cwhat guerillas likely would and would not do\u201d is not a substitute for substantial evidence). Therefore, Toma is deemed credible. <em>See Shire v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 1288, 1299 (9th Cir.2004). The IJ determined that, if Toma had testified credibly, the events he experienced did constitute past persecution. We agree, and therefore conclude that the record compels the conclusion that Toma has established past persecution on account of his political opinion. <em>See Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 799, 804 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">\u201cIf past persecution is established, a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear arises, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), and the burden shifts to the government^]\u201d <em>Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir.2004). The IJ determined the presumption of future persecution would be rebutted by changed country conditions pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i). The government, however, has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i), (b)(l)(ii); <em>Hanna v. Keisler, </em>506 F.3d 933, 938 (9th Cir.2007). The government must introduce, and the BIA must provide an analysis of, evidence as to Toma\u2019s particular circumstances as they apply to the changed circumstances. <em>See Lopez, </em>366 F.3d at 805 (quoting <em>Borja v. I.N.S., </em>175 F.3d 732, 738 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc)); <em>Berroteran-Melendez v. I.N.S., </em>955 F.2d 1251, 1257 (9th Cir.1992). The record merely indicates that the government submitted information about the general changes and situation in Iraq. <em>See Rios v. Ashcroft, </em>287 F.3d 895, 901 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Garrovillas v. I.N.S., </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1017 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cInformation about general changes in the country is not sufficient [to rebut the presumption].\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Because we find that the government did not rebut the presumption, it is appropriate to permit the BIA on remand \u201cto assess whether changed country conditions rebut the presumption based on the proper legal standards!.]\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>366 F.3d at 807. We therefore grant the petition for review as to the asylum claim and remand this matter to the BIA. We also remand the claims for withholding of removal, CAT relief, and humanitarian asylum, in order to make a similar assessment. The BIA, however, need not reach these claims if the government does not rebut the presumption that Toma has a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b673-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
