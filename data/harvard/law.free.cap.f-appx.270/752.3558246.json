Castma currently is serving a 365-month term of imprisonment, based on his convictions on one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base and four counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. On appeal, he argues that the district court erred by denying his \u201cmotion to reopen,\u201d in which he sought an extension of time in which to appeal the denial of an earlier post-judgment motion relating to his 1998 convictions, because he showed that he did not receive notice of an order entered against him until over a year after the order was entered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-21\">We review the decision on a motion for an extension of time to appeal for abuse of discretion. <em>See Advanced Estimating Sys., Inc. v. Riney, </em>77 F.3d 1322, 1324-25 (11th Cir.1996) (applying the \u201cexcusable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>neglect\u201d standard to excuse untimely notices of appeal in criminal cases to a civil context). \u201cPro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>487 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1908, 167 L.Ed.2d 568 (2007). However, \u201c[Iliberal construction does not mean liberal deadlines.\u201d <em>Wayne v. Jarvis, </em>197 F.3d 1098, 1104 (11th Cir.1999) (affirming a district court\u2019s dismissal of a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 1983 case on statute of limitations grounds), <em>overruled on other grounds </em>by <em>Manders v. Lee, </em>338 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">\u201cIn a criminal case, a defendant\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 10 days after\u201d the entry of the order being appealed. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i). Although the clerk of court must provide notice to the defendant regarding an order entered on any post-arraignment motion, a clerk\u2019s failure to do so \u201cdoes not affect the time to appeal, or relieve- \u2014 or authorize the court to relieve\u2014 a party\u2019s failure to appeal within the allowed time.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 49(c); <em>see also </em>Fed. RApp. P. 26(b) (providing that courts cannot extend the time to file a notice of appeal, except as authorized by Rule 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Rule 4(b), in turn, authorizes a 30-day extension of the time period for filing the notice of appeal, upon a finding by the district court that the failure to file during the original period resulted from \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d or good cause. <em>United States v. Ward, </em>696 F.2d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir.1983); Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). However, such an extension cannot \u201cexceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(b).\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-9\">In criminal cases, this court has customarily treated a late notice filed after the expiration of the ten-day period and before the lapse of forty days (ten plus thirty), as a motion for extension of time but a motion that properly should be decided by the district court. In such cases it is the practice of this court to remand to the district court for a determination whether excusable neglect justifies an extension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-12\"><em>Ward, </em>696 F.2d at 1317-18 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">Rule 4(a)(6) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which applies to <em>civil </em>cases, permits the district court to reopen the time to file an appeal, but only if the following three conditions are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-14\">(A) the court finds the moving party did not receive notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed within 21 days after entry;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-15\">(B) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry, whichever is earlier; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-16\">(C) the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-17\">Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6)(A-C).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-18\">Even if we were to construe Castma\u2019s earlier appellate proceedings as civil in nature, and thus subject to Rule 4(a)(6), because he did not file the instant appeal within the 180-day time limit specified in Rule 4(a)(6)(B), the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion. Moreover, to the extent Castma\u2019s motion is criminal in nature, because the notice of appeal was not timely under Rule 4(b), the district court did not abuse its discretion is denying his motion. Accordingly, we af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>firm the district court\u2019s denial of Castma\u2019s motion to reopen the time to file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-14\">. Although Castma was convicted in 1998 and sought post-judgment relief several times between 2001 and 2006 without success, his notice of appeal is timely <em>only </em>as to the district court\u2019s July 3, 2007 order on his \u201cmotion to reopen.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
