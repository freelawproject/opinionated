Jan. 19, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 96 395 413 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, June 23, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but, as here, closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Security, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law including \u201cwhat evidence will suffice to carry any asylum applicant\u2019s burden of proof,\u201d <em>Island v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, <em>see Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s factual determination that Zheng\u2019s fear of future pei\u2019secution was not well founded. Zheng claimed that he was identified as a Falun Gong supporter by two Chinese policemen who saw him and others passing out flyers in support of Falun Gong. He testified that the police officers attempted to arrest him and that, although he was able to flee, two members of his group were arrested. Moreover, Zheng testified that following the incident the police came to his dormitory and his pai\u2019ents\u2019 house to arrest him. This evidence, however, does not \u201ccompelf ]\u201d the conclusion that Zheng was or would be targeted for <em>persecution. See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000) (\u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d). While the State Department Report in the record indicates that the Chinese government has persecuted Falun Gong practitioners, Zheng admittedly was not a practicing Fa-lun Gong member in China, and there was inconclusive evidence in the record to support Zheng\u2019s subjective belief that the police would, upon apprehending him, persecute him simply for handing out flyers. Moreover, although Zheng assumed that the police were looking for him based on his act of handing out flyers (as opposed to some other reason), there is no evidence that that was in fact the police\u2019s motive. Accordingly, we affirm the agency\u2019s denial of Zheng\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Moreover, although Zheng\u2019s brief requests in passing that we reverse the agency\u2019s decision denying withholding of removal and CAT relief, we deem these claims abandoned because he does not directly address the agency\u2019s rulings with respect to them. <em>See Yueqiug Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005); <em>see also Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cIssues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
