We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Because the IJ relied on minor inconsistencies, <em>see Mendoza Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir.2003), and because the IJ improperly found that Nikoghosyan\u2019s admission that he came to the United States in part to seek a job undermined his credibility regarding his fear of returning to Armenia, <em>see Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1068 (9th Cir.2003) (recognizing that fear of persecution need not be the alien\u2019s only motivation for fleeing), substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Mendoza Manimbao, </em>329 F.3d at 660-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Assuming that Nikoghosyan\u2019s testimony was credible and that he was persecuted in the past, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that any presumption of a well-founded fear is rebutted because of changed country conditions in Armenia. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 1000-01 (9th Cir.2003). The IJ\u2019s analysis of how changed country conditions affected Nikoghosyan\u2019s specific situation was sufficiently individualized. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Because Nikoghosyan failed to demonstrate he was eligible for asylum, he necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Nikoghosyan did not show it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to Armenia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b748-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
