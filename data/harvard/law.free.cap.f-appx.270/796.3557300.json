Altonaga, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b821-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Thomas Crandall appeals his 36-month sentence, imposed upon revocation of his supervised release. He argues, for the first time on appeal, that during sentencing the district court impermissibly considered (1) the leniency of his underlying sentence as originally imposed, and (2) the fact that his underlying sentence was foreshortened for good behavior and his completion of a drug treatment program. Finding that the distinct court did not commit plain error, we affirm Crandall\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">In 2002, Crandall was sentenced by a federal district court to a prison term of 51 months to be followed by four years of supervised release. After serving approximately 31 months of his underlying sentence, he was put on supervised release, his time in jail reduced for good behavior and for completing the Bureau of Prison\u2019s residential drug treatment program. Soon after his release, Crandall sent explicit material to an undercover officer posing as a fifteen-year-old boy, a crime for which he was convicted by a Florida court.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">As a result of this conviction, the district court revoked Crandall\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court did not find whether his guideline range should be computed based on a Grade A or Grade B violation of his supervised release, concluding that in either case, an above guideline sentence was appropriate. In making this determination, the district court stated that it considered, in part, the following factors: (1) \u201cthe fact that the sentence [Crandall] actually served in federal custody [was] significantly below the guideline range that would otherwise have been computed had [Crandall not been given] the benefit of the doubt on a number of sentencing issues\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe foreshortening of the sentence that was originally intended and should have been served by [Crandall].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">Crandall did not take issue with the court\u2019s consideration of these factors below. When asked whether Crandall\u2019s counsel had any objections to the district court\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law, counsel responded, \u201cYes.... We would object to the sentence imposed outside the guidelines.\u201d The district court then asked counsel whether he would like to elaborate further, to which he responded, \u201cJust that, Your Honor. And we would also say that the court didn\u2019t really rule on whether it was [a Grade] A or B [violation], but we would argue it is a [Grade] B violation.\u201d At no time below did Crandall mention the two factors he takes issue with on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">Whether the district court relied on an impermissible factor during sentencing is a question of law that we will review <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir.2006). However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>where a defendant does not clearly state the grounds for an objection before the district court, review on appeal is limited to plain error. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Crandall did not adequately specify below his objection to the factors relied on by the district court. We have described the specificity required as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-5\">Whenever a litigant has a meritorious proposition of law which he is seriously pressing upon the attention of the trial court, he should raise that point in such clear and simple language that the trial court may not misunderstand it, and if his point is so obscurely hinted at that the trial court quite excusably may fail to grasp it, it will avail naught to disturb the judgment on appeal. Thus, if a defendant fails to <em>clearly </em>articulate a specific objection during sentencing, the objection is waived on appeal and we confine our review to plain error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1087-88 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Riggs, </em>967 F.2d 561, 564 (11th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">In no way did Crandall\u2019s objections take issue with the factors relied on by district court when sentencing him, let alone \u201cclearly articulate\u201d any objection to the district court\u2019s consideration of the leniency and foreshortening of his underlying sentence. <em>See Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1088. Furthermore, Crandall specifically declined the district court\u2019s invitation for him to \u201celaborate further\u201d upon his objection. At best, his objection to the factors, if any, was \u201cso obscurely hinted at[,] that the trial court quite excusably [failed] to grasp it\u201d and, accordingly, we will disturb the judgment only for plain error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">An error cannot meet the \u201cplain\u201d requirement of the plain error rule unless it is \u201cclear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1999). Where \u201cneither the Supreme Court nor this Court has ever resolved an issue, and other circuits are split on it, there can be no plain error in regard to that issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1321 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (citing <em>Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d at 587).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">At the time of sentencing, it was by no means clear under our current precedent that a court could <em>not </em>consider the leniency and foreshortening of a defendant\u2019s underlying sentence when sentencing him after a revocation of his supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In fact, depending on the circumstances, these two factors may or may not be relevant during the court\u2019s inquiry into \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d the defendant\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics,\u201d the need to \u201cafford adequate deterrence,\u201d or the need to \u201cprotect the public from further crimes.\u201d At best, the law of this Circuit was unclear as to whether consideration of the leniency or foreshortening of a defendant\u2019s underlying sentence fails to achieve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a), and therefore, the district court did not plainly err in considering these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\">. When sentencing a defendant upon revocation of supervised release, a court must consider: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence, protect the public from further crimes, and provide the defendant with education or training and medical care or treatment; (3) the policy statements in chapter seven of the Sentencing Guidelines; (4) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities; and (5) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (providing that the court may revoke a term of supervised release after considering the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-22\">. To the extent Crandall takes issue with the <em>substantive </em>reasonableness of his sentence, we also conclude that Crandall\u2019s 31-month sentence was substantively reasonable as it was based on a careful consideration of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and well below the five-year statutory maximum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
