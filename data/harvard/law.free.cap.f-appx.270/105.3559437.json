For the following reasons, we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">This case arises from several motor vehicle convictions entered against the Appellant which he alleges were the result of harassment, racial profiling and retaliation by the Brentwood Police Department. Mendoza filed a complaint seeking damages to compensate for loss of employment due to the suspension of his driving privileges, in alleged violation of his equal protection and due process rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He further requests that his driver\u2019s license be returned to him and that his driving suspension and traffic citations be overturned. Mendoza also requests a hearing in federal district court to establish that his due process rights have been abridged as the result of his convictions for traffic offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claims that unidentified court transcripts and audio and visual materials support his view that the series of tickets he received constitute evidence of racial profiling and that these materials will demonstrate \u201cthe pattern/s, or discrepancies, and inaccuracies that took place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">The District Court dismissed Mendoza\u2019s case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>reasoned that Mendoza is barred from asserting a \u00a7 1988 claim until the convictions on his challenged motor vehicle offenses are set aside or have otherwise terminated in his favor. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (\u00a7 1983 damages actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments that necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement). Mendoza filed a timely notice of appeal, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), <em>see, e.g., Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000), and conclude that Mendoza\u2019s appeal fails because it is \u201cindisputably meritless.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827,104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We disagree with the District Court that <em>Heck </em>applies to a case such as Mendoza\u2019s. <em>Heck </em>does not bar a \u00a7 1983 claim where the plaintiff is unable to challenge his conditions of confinement through a petition for federal habeas corpus. <em>Leather v. Eyck, </em>180 F.3d 420, 424 (2d Cir.1999). Because Mendoza was never incarcerated, or otherwise in custody, federal habeas relief has never been available to him and, therefore, <em>Heck </em>cannot apply. <em>Id. </em>However, we may affirm the District Court on any ground supported by the record. <em>See Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Mendoza has failed to state a claim that contains even an arguable basis in law for violations of either the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause against either defendant. \u201c[T]o sustain a \u00a7 1983 claim based upon a violation of procedural due process [a plaintiff] must, at a minimum, prove recklessness or \u2018gross negligence\u2019 and in some instance may be required to show a \u2018deliberate decision to deprive\u2019 the plaintiff of due process.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O\u2019Brien &amp; Frankel, </em>20 F.3d 1250, 1277 (3d Cir.1994), <em>citing Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 333-34, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). Mendoza has not alleged any facts to support an intentional or reckless deprivation of due process. However, even if he did and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had no legal basis for suspending his license, Mendoza had various remedies that he could have pursued to retrieve his license, including an application for reinstatement. \u201c[A]n unauthorized intentional deprivation of property by a state employee does not constitute a violation of the procedural requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if a meaningful postdeprivation remedy for the loss is available.\u201d <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); <em>see also Bell v. Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971) (suspension of a driver\u2019s license implicates a protectible property interest). Moreover, Mendoza does not claim to have been denied a hearing to challenge the suspension of his license; rather, he alleges that the loss of his license caused him economic hardship. Such an allegation is not sufficient to constitute a Due Process violation. The Due Process Clause is satisfied if, \u201cwhen a State seeks to terminate an interest such as [an individual\u2019s drivers\u2019 license and registration],\u201d it affords \u201c \u2018notice and opportunity for [a] hearing appropriate to the nature of the case\u2019 before the termination becomes effective.\u201d <em>Bell, </em>402 U.S. at 542, 91 S.Ct. 1586. Mendoza does not allege he was denied such an opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Mendoza also fails to allege or provide any evidence that he was treated differently from other people who are similarly situated, which is necessary to state an equal protection claim. <em>See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., </em>473 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>U.S. 432, 439, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985); <em>Keenan v. City of Phila., </em>983 F.2d 459, 465 (3d Cir.1992). Accordingly, his equal protection claim must also be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Mendoza\u2019s retaliation claim likewise lacks merit. Retaliation for the exercise of constitutionally protected rights is itself a constitutional violation. <em>White v. Napoleon, </em>897 F.2d 103, 111-12 (3d Cir. 1990); <em>see also Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 224-25 (3d Cir.2000) (\u201c[Gjovernment actions, which standing alone do not violate the Constitution, may nonetheless be constitutional torts if motivated in substantial part by a desire to punish an individual for exercise of a constitutional right.\u201d). However, Mendoza has failed to allege facts demonstrating a causal link between his constitutionally protected conduct of filing a lawsuit, and the traffic citation he received on May 24, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the appeal is meritless and we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\">. On May 24, 2007, Mendoza was ticketed for \"driving while operating privilege is suspended or revoked\u201d in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543. At that time he signed an acknowledgment that his license had been surrendered as a result of a prior suspension. Appellant apparently has a history of driving while his driver\u2019s license is suspended, dating back to at least February 5, 1998. <em>See Mendoza v. Larotonda, </em>2:07cv210, Doc. No. 1-2 at P-4</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b130-16\">. The Court conducted a two-step analysis to determine whether to direct service of the complaint, because Mendoza sought to proceed in forma pauperis. <em>See Roman v. Jeffes, </em>904 F.2d 192, 194 n. 1 (3d Cir.1990). The Court found Mendoza to be without sufficient funds to pay the required filing fee and granted him leave to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
