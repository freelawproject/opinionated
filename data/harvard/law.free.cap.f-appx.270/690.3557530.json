We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law. <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006). We review for abuse of discretion the IJ\u2019s decision denying a continuance. <em>Baires v. INS, </em>856 F.2d 89, 91 (9th Cir.1988). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">The IJ did not abuse her discretion when denying Adena\u2019s motion for a continuance because Adena\u2019s eligibility for Federal First Offender Act (\u201cFFOA\u201d) relief was speculative at the time of his hearing. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000) (agency abuses its discretion only when it acts. arbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to law). It follows that his due process rights were not violated. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (to prevail on a due process challenge, an alien must show error and substantial prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">In any event, Adena has not shown he would have been eligible for relief under the FFOA. <em>See Chavez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1284, 1292-93 (9th Cir.2004) (government may order the removal of an alien whose conviction might be erased sometime in the future).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b715-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
