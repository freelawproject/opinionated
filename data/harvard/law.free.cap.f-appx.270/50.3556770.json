The BIA denied his motion to reopen or reconsider its November 15, 2006 decision denying remand and affirming a May 11, 2005 decision of Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Robert D. Weisel denying Ahmad\u2019s applications for political asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture, and cancellation of removal. <em>In re Ashfaq Ahmad, </em>No. A73 187 244 (B.I.A. Mar. 6, 2007). On appeal, Ahmad challenges the BIA\u2019s March 2007 order to the extent it denied his motion to reopen based on new and material evidence of extraordinary and extremely unusual hardship to his U.S. citizen wife, and the November 2006 order to the extent that it denied his motion seeking remand for the purpose of deciding his application for adjustment of status. We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The BIA\u2019s November 2006 order is not properly before this Court, and the issue of Ahmad\u2019s adjustment application has not been preserved for our review. \u201c[T]he filing of a motion to reopen does not toll the time for filing a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s final exclusion or deportation orders.... \u201d <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). A petition for review of a final order of removal must be filed no later than thirty days after its issuance. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Because no petition for review was filed within thirty days of the BIA\u2019s November 15, 2006 decision, we are \u201cprecluded from passing on the merits of the underlying exclusion proceedings, and must confine our review to the\u201d March 2007 denial of Ahmad\u2019s motion to reopen those proceedings. <em>Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233 (quoting <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir.2001)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006) (per cu-riam); <em>Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233. \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found in those circumstances where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233-34 (quoting <em>Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 93) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court lacks jurisdiction \u201cto review discretionary determinations concerning cancellation of removal,\u201d including the BIA\u2019s determination \u201cthat an alien has failed to demonstrate that his removal will cause a qualifying U.S. citizen relative to suffer \u2018exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u2019 \u201d <em>De La Vega v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). We have also stated that \u201cwe cannot, on a petition for review of a motion to reopen, exercise jurisdiction over that which we would not have had jurisdiction to review on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Omar v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 647, 650 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">In denying Ahmad\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA reviewed evidence of hardship to Ahmad\u2019s wife that had been submitted to the IJ (medical records), as well as new evidence to support the hardship claim (the wife\u2019s affidavit). The Board concluded that \u201con the evidence submitted it has not been shown that [his wife\u2019s] anticipated hardships rise to the level that is considered to be \u2018exceptional and extremely unusual\u2019 in nature whether considered individually or cumulatively.\u201d We would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>have jurisdiction to review this discretionary hardship determination on direct appeal. Therefore, we cannot review it now, in the context of a motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Further, we detect no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s rulings that: 1) its previous finding that Ahmad did not specifically request an opportunity to present his wife\u2019s testimony below was correct; 2) Ahmad did not comply with the requirements for advancing an ineffective assistance claim as discussed in <em>Matter of Lazada, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 637 (B.I.A.1988); and 3) Ahmad did not show that the new evidence of his wife\u2019s hardship was not previously available. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). The BIA provided adequate reasoning for these conclusions, which were consistent with established policies and precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
