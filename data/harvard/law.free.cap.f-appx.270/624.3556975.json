R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b648-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-20\">This is a petition for review from the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) September 13, 2007 decision denying petitioner\u2019s motion, properly construed as both a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-21\">We have reviewed the record and respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition. We conclude that summary disposition is appropriate because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-22\">The regulations provide that a party may file a motion to reconsider any given decision within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion, filed 58 days after the BIA\u2019s decision, as late. In addition, the BIA was correct in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>concluding that the motion to reconsider failed to identify any error in fact or law not already considered by the agency. <em>See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004) (BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider is reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Moreover, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion, construed as a motion to reopen, for failure to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. The evidence submitted with the motion had no bearing on the agency\u2019s previous decision finding that petitioner was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because she had failed to establish the requisite 10 years of continuous physical presence in the United States. <em>See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1222 (9th Cir.2002) (BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b648-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
