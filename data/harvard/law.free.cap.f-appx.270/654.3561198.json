We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Schnidrig v. Columbia Mach., Inc., </em>80 F.3d 1406, 1408 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Home Depot argues that summary judgment in its favor was appropriate on Hunter\u2019s federal and state reasonable accommodation claims and family and medical leave act claims because Hunter had not been working more than 34 hours per week when she presented her doctor\u2019s note to Home Depot, and she had indicated on several occasions that she needed to work more hours for financial reasons. Therefore, Home Depot argues, Hunter was seeking to work more hours for financial reasons, which does not constitute a request for a reasonable accommodation based on a disability or a request for medical leave. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Hunter\u2019s requests for a fixed 32-34 hour per week schedule stemmed from her desire to maximize her income without affecting her social security disability benefits. Hunter has not demonstrated that her requests to be scheduled to work more hours per week were because of physical disabilities and therefore, could be interpreted as a request for a reduced work schedule or medical leave. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (preventing discrimination, including failing to accommodate, \u201cbecause of\u2019 an individual\u2019s disability); <em>see also </em>Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 659A.112.14 (same); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a) and (b) (the federal Family Medical Leave Act gives eligible employees the right to take intermittent leave or have a reduced schedule \u201cbecause of\u2019 a serious health condition); <em>see also </em>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 \u00a7 659A.150 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">Hunter\u2019s retaliation claims also fail. Home Depot presented a legitimate reason for the reduction in Hunter\u2019s hours \u2014 another Home Depot store had recently opened nearby and other employees experienced a reduction of hours. Home Depot likewise presented a legitimate reason for the discipline \u2014 Hunter was tardy for work three times in one week, and the supervisor who imposed the discipline was unaware that Hunter had presented a human resources manager a doctor\u2019s note stating she could not work more than 34 hours a week. Hunter did not present evidence demonstrating that either of these reasons were a pretext for retaliation. <em>See Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trs., </em>225 F.3d 1115, 1124 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cplaintiff must show that the articulated reason is pretextual either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Finally, Hunter\u2019s constructive discharge claim fails because the evidence presented is not sufficient to rise to the level of an objectively intolerable working environment. <em>See McGanty v. Staudenraus, </em>321 Or. 532, 901 P.2d 841, 856-57 (1995) (in order to prove constructive discharge, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>plaintiff must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that the \u201cworking conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee\u2019s position would have resigned because of them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
