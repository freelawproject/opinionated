The court affirmed the denial of Atkinson\u2019s claim for disability benefits, which is governed by the Employee Retirement Income- Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Taft v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y, </em>9 F.3d 1469, 1471 (9th Cir.1993). The appeal presents two issues: (1) did the district court apply the correct standard of review in affirming AT&amp;T\u2019s denial of Atkinson\u2019s claim; and (2) should the grant of summary judgment in favor of AT&amp;T be affirmed?</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">We answer both questions in the affirmative. The district court correctly reviewed AT&amp;T\u2019s denial of benefits for abuse of discretion. <em>Abatie v. Alta Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>458 F.3d 955 (9th Cir.2006). Atkinson\u2019s argument that the court should have reviewed the denial de novo lacks merit as she has not shown that the administrator \u201cengage[d] in wholesale and flagrant violations of the procedural requirements of ERISA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 971. Nor has Atkinson proven that a low level of deference under the abuse of discretion standard of review is proper because the structural conflict of interest at issue is accompanied by other nefarious factors. Accordingly, the district court correctly reviewed the denial of benefits for abuse of discretion, under which the court may set aside the administrator\u2019s discretionary determination only when it is arbitrary and capricious. <em>Jordan v. Northrop Grumman Corp. Welfare Benefit Plan, </em>370 F.3d 869, 875 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">It cannot be said that AT&amp;T\u2019s denial of Atkinson\u2019s claim is arbitrary and capricious. Medical documents submitted by Atkinson indicate that her back pain, which began in 1994, had not become so severe as to preclude her from working at a sedentary job, which her job at AT&amp;T was. Accordingly, the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of AT&amp;T.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b658-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
