Hubbard brought this action against Bimbo for: (1) sex discrimination and retaliation for opposition to sex discrimination, in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq.; </em>(2) sex discrimination and retaliation for opposition to sex discrimination, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat \u00a7 659A.030, <em>et. seq.; </em>and (3) common law wrongful discharge. Hubbard asserts two male coworkers made offensive sexual comments and advances to him over a period of a few months. He further asserts that, when he complained of the offensive conduct to his superiors, Bimbo retaliated against him by deciding to transfer him another distribution facility five miles away and by subjecting him to such an intolerable work environment such that he had no choice but to resign (i.e., he was \u201cconstructively discharged\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s determination a plaintiff exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>B.K.B. v. Maui Police Dept., </em>276 F.3d 1091, 1099 (9th Cir.2002). We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Craig v. M &amp; O Agencies, Inc., </em>496 F.3d 1047, 1053 (9th Cir.2007). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The district court correctly found Hubbard exhausted his administrative remedies before bringing his claims of discrimination in violation of federal and state statutes. Hubbard filed an administrative complaint with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (\u201cBOLI\u201d) alleging statutory employment discrimination three days after he brought his original state civil action alleging common law wrongful discharge. Oregon law states an administrative complaint alleging unlawful discrimination \u201cmay not be filed [with BOLI] if a civil action has been commenced in state or federal court alleging the <em>same matters.\u201d </em>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 659A.820(2) (emphasis added). Hubbard\u2019s administrative complaint and state civil action were based on the <em>same set of facts, </em>but <em>different matters (ie., </em>different causes of action; the administrative complaint alleged causes of action arising under statutes; the civil action complaint alleged a cause of action arising under the common law, which required proof of different elements). Because Oregon rules regarding administrative complaints use language in other situations regarding \u201cthe same set of facts,\u201d the district court correctly concluded Hubbard\u2019s state civil action and his administrative complaint did not allege the \u201csame matters\u201d within the meaning of Or. Rev. Stat \u00a7 659A.820. <em>See </em>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 659A.805(d) (BOLI \u201cmay adopt reasonable rules ... [f]or internal operation and practice and procedure before the commissioner under this chapter.\u201d); <em>SEC v. McCarthy, </em>322 F.3d 650, 656 (9th Cir.2003) (The use of different words or terms within a statute or regulation demonstrates an intent to convey a different meaning for those words.). By amending his complaint to add the statutory counts under Title VII and Or. Rev. Stat \u00a7 659A.030, <em>et. seq., </em>within 90 days of receiving a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter from BOLI and the EEOC, Hubbard exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The district court correctly granted summary judgment to Bimbo on Hubbard\u2019s common law wrongful constructive discharge claim. <em>See McGanty v. Staudenraus, </em>321 Or. 532, 557, 901 P.2d 841 (1995). Hubbard\u2019s evidence fails to create triable issues of fact regarding all elements of common law wrongful constructive dischai'ge, except the element that requires the plaintiff to have actually quit. First, the evidence does not show Hubbard\u2019s working conditions were so intolerable a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign. Next, there is no evidence Bimbo created an intolerable work environment with the intent to force Hubbard to resign. Finally, there is no evidence Bimbo\u2019s decision to transfer Hubbard to the Tigard facility was because of Hubbard\u2019s complaints of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The district court correctly granted summary judgment to Bimbo on Hubbard\u2019s hostile work environment claim. <em>See Kortan v. California Youth Authority, </em>217 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir.2000). The evidence did not create a triable issue of fact as to whether Hubbard suffered from offensive conduct so severe and pervasive as to alter the terms and conditions of Hubbard\u2019s employment. The case Hubbard cites in support of his hostile work environment claim, <em>Nichols v. Azteca Restaurant Enterprises, Inc., </em>256 F.3d 864 (9th Cir.2001), presents a completely different picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>The district court correctly granted summary judgment to Bimbo on Hubbard\u2019s retaliation claim. <em>See Kortan, </em>217 F.3d at 1112. The evidence does not create a triable issue of fact as to whether Bimbo\u2019s decision to transfer Hubbard to Tigard was in any way caused by or in retaliation for Hubbard\u2019s complaints. Indeed, when Hubbard was not available to go to Tigard, the Tigard foreman was nonetheless moved to Beaverton and another employee was promoted and sent to Tigard. This was evidence of a valid employment reason to send Hubbard to Ti-gard, unrebutted by any evidence of pretext. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-17\">. Because the facts are known to the parties, we revisit them only as necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b634-5\">BERZON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ac0-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">I agree with the majority for the most part, but would remand for trial on the hostile work environment cause of action. On this summary judgment record, a reasonable trier of fact could find the offensive conduct to which Hubbard was exposed both sex-based and sufficiently severe and pervasive to amount to actionable sexual harassment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l) and O.R.S. \u00a7 659A.030. I would not rely for this conclusion on Felty\u2019s remark regarding wanting a \u201crelationship\u201d with \u2018 Hubbard, which a reasonable person in Hubbard\u2019s position would not construe as sexually suggestive. But there was other conduct \u2014 remarks, suggestively close invasion of Hubbard\u2019s \u201cspace,\u201d and \u201csmooching sounds\u201d \u2014 that occurred over about a year, culminating in the incident in which Felty drove a truck dangerously close to Hubbard and then made remarks that a reasonable person could construe as a crude sexual proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">It may well be that this conduct, if it occurred at all, was both meant and understood as expressing purely personal animosity through crude behavior and language, rather than sex-based propositions or hostility. But that would be a question for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">I note as well that on Hubbard\u2019s version of events, it appears that he raised his concerns with his supervisors sufficiently to trigger a responsibility to take action to eliminate the harassment. <em>See Nichols v. Azteca Restaurant Enters., Inc., </em>256 F.3d 864, 875 (9th Cir.2001). Johnson and Ka-nyo deny Hubbard\u2019s account, maintaining that Hubbard\u2019s complaints about Felty did not include the sexual conduct now alleged, and that he did not complain about Marshall at all. Such divergent accounts of plainly material facts can only be resolved at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
