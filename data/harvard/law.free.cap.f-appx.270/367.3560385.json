Limbrick, a federal prisoner, was convicted on several counts of conspiracy and obstruction of interstate commerce by attempted robbery and the use of a firearm in connection with the attempted robberies. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a reduction of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He argues that retroactive amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 entitle him to a lower sentencing range for his offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-18\">Because none of the enhancements to his two obstruction-of-commerce offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 required the involvement of a firearm, the amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 are not relevant to Lim-brick\u2019s sentence. <em>Compare United States v. Dixon, </em>273 F.3d 636, 642-44 (5th Cir. 2001). Accordingly, Limbrick has shown no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of his motion. <em>United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 430 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
