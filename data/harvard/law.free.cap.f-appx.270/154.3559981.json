We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-24\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b179-25\">Because we write solely for the parties, who are familiar with the tragic background of this case, we will discuss only those facts relevant to our decision. Allstate Indemnity Company (\u201cAllstate Indemnity\u201d) and Allstate Insurance Compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ny (\u201cAllstate Insurance\u201d) (collectively, \u201cAllstate\u201d) filed these two diversity actions. Allstate Indemnity sought a declaration that it has no obligation to defend or indemnify Edward Batzig, Jeannette Bat-zig, and Edward Batzig, Jr., who are being sued in state court by Paul Sweeney, the parent of a child who was murdered by, among others, Edward Batzig, Jr. Similarly, Allstate Insurance sought a declaration that it has no obligation to defend or indemnify Dominic Coia, Sr., Dominic Coia, Jr., or Nicholas Coia, who are also being sued by Sweeney in the state court action because Dominic Coia, Jr., and Nicholas Coia participated in the murder of Sweeney\u2019s son. Edward Batzig, Jr., is the child of Edward and Jeannette Batzig. Dominic Coia, Jr., and Nicholas Coia are the children of Dominic Coia, Sr. At the time of the murder, the three young murderers resided with their respective parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The Allstate homeowners\u2019 insurance policies issued to Jeannette Batzig and to Dominic Coia, Sr., exclude from coverage \u201cany bodily injury or property damage intended by, or which may reasonably be expected to result from the intentional or criminal acts or omissions of, any insured person.\u201d (App. 78, 80, 147, 149 (original emphases).) The policies define \u201cinsured person(s)\u201d to include \u201cany relative\u201d who is a resident of the household. (App.75, 144.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The District Court granted summary judgment to Allstate in both cases, holding that Allstate was not required under the policies to defend or indemnify the children or their parents in the state court action brought by Sweeney. Sweeney appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">II. Discussion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">On appeal, Sweeney does not dispute that Edward Batzig, Jr., Dominic Coia, Jr., and Nicholas Coia acted intentionally and criminally and that Allstate has no duty to defend or indemnify them. Instead, Sweeney argues that the District Court erred in concluding that Allstate was not required to defend and indemnify Edward and Jeannette Batzig and Dominic Coia, Sr. (collectively, the \u201cParents\u201d). He argues that because his complaint in the state court action alleges, in effect, negligent supervision by the Parents, Allstate has a duty under the policies to defend and indemnify them.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">We disagree. Under Pennsylvania law, courts must give effect to \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d language in an insurance contract. <em>Kvaemer Metals Div. of Kvaerner U.S., Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>589 Pa. 317, 908 A.2d 888, 897 (2006). The insurance policies in this case exclude from coverage \u201cany bodily injury or property damage intended by ... any insured person.\u201d (App. 78, 80, 147, 149 (original emphases).) It is undisputed that Edward Batzig, Jr., Dominic Coia, Jr., and Nicholas Coia are \u201cinsured person[s]\u201d within the meaning of the policies. Therefore, bodily injury or property damage resulting from their intentional acts is not covered. The fact that the Parents did not engage in any intentional behavior is irrelevant. <em>See Donegal Mut. Ins. Co. v. Baumhammers, </em>893 A.2d 797, 818 (Pa.Super.Ct.2006) <em>(en banc), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>938 A.2d 286 (Pa.2007) (\u201cThe fact that Parents did not engage in criminal behavior is immaterial because the [insurance] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>policy exclusion applies to criminal behavior of <em>any </em>insured.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Sweeney next argues that, even if the exclusion clause bars coverage, we should refuse to enforce that clause because it violates public policy. However, not only did Sweeney fail to make that argument before the District Court, he has failed to identify on appeal a \u201cclearly expressed public policy\u201d of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that would be violated by our enforcement of the exclusion clause. <em>See Prudential Prop. and Cas. Ins. Co. v. Colbert, </em>572 Pa. 82, 813 A.2d 747, 752 (2002) (\u201c[C]ourts must give plain meaning to a clear and unambiguous contract provision unless to do so would be contrary to a clearly expressed public policy.\u201d). Therefore, we must reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the judgments of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332(a) and 2201. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. P.N. v. Clementon Bd. of Educ., </em>442 F.3d 848, 852 (3d Cir.2006). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
