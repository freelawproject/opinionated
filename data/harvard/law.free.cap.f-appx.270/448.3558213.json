Before sentencing Hernandez-Carillo, the district court granted the government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure and calculated the 115-month sentence by reducing the low end of Hernandez-Carillo\u2019s advisory Guidelines imprisonment range by 15%.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-15\">In a brief filed under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Hernandez-Carillo\u2019s counsel seeks permission to withdraw and presents arguments challenging the reasonableness of the 115-month sentence. Upon review, we find these arguments unpersuasive. Contrary to counsel\u2019s first argument, we first conclude the district court adequately considered Hernandez-Carillo\u2019s cooperation and the risk it created to his family. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (explaining where the district court listened to the defendant\u2019s arguments for a downward departure and was fully aware of the relevant circumstances, a reviewing court could infer from the context and record the district court\u2019s conclusion that such circumstances did not warrant a lower sentence, even though the conclusion was not expressly stated). Second, to the extent Hernandez-Carillo\u2019s counsel argues the district court erred in its criminal history computation, the argument has been waived. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>289 F.3d 524, 526-27 (8th Cir.2002) (declining to review the district court\u2019s findings related to sentencing enhancement, drug quantity, and criminal history, even for plain error, where defendant\u2019s counsel withdrew objections to the PSR at the sentencing hearing and asked for a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range). Third, we find the district court adequately and appropriately considered the section 3553(a) factors, and did not overlook a relevant factor, give significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or make a clear error of judgment in weighing appropriate factors \u2014 including Hernandez-Carillo\u2019s criminal past. <em>See United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (8th Cir.2005) (discussing standard for reasonableness review).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-20\">We also conclude arguments in Hernandez-Carillo\u2019s pro se supplemental brief are unavailing. Hernandez-Carillo\u2019s complaints regarding his counsel should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>brought, if at all, in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>310 F.3d 1105, 1111-12 (8th Cir.2002) (holding ineffective assistance of counsel claims should generally be raised under \u00a7 2255 because normally the claims require development of facts outside the record). To the extent Hernandez-Carillo is challenging the knowing and voluntary nature of his guilty plea, that claim is not properly before us because it was not presented to the district court. <em>See United States v. Mims, </em>440 F.2d 643, 644 (8th Cir.1971) (per curiam) (declaring defendant\u2019s argument that his guilty plea was involuntary was not properly before the appellate court because defendant did not file a motion in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea; involuntariness of a guilty plea must first be presented to the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Finally, after reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues for direct appeal. Thus, we grant counsel leave to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-16\">. The Honorable Linda R.
