R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b689-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">Loren Larson filed a petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court dismissed Larson\u2019s petition as untimely. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2253(a) and 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-18\">The gravamen of Larson\u2019s habeas petition is that pre-deliberation juror misconduct violated his constitutional rights. Larson became aware of that misconduct when he obtained affidavits from some of the jurors. He filed his federal habeas petition more than one year from his receipt of those affidavits, even taking into account the tolling that occurred when he was pursuing post-conviction relief in the Alaska courts. Thus, his petition was untimely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-22\">We reject Larson\u2019s argument that the appropriate factual predicate is the Alaska Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in <em>Larson v. State, </em>79 P.3d 650 (Alaska Ct.App.2003). That decision does not qualify as a \u201cfact\u201d for purposes of deciding when the statute of limitation was triggered. <em>See Johnson v. United, States, </em>544 U.S. 295, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005); <em>Shannon v. Newland, </em>410 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-23\">We reject the argument that <em>Larson\u2019s </em>allegedly erroneous decision denying him state post-conviction relief independently deprived him of his federal constitutional rights. First, a post-conviction proceeding is not a criminal trial and the panoply of constitutional protections that accompany a criminal trial do not apply in a post-conviction proceeding. <em>Cf. Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 557, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987) (holding that there is no constitutional right to counsel in state post-conviction proceedings). To grant relief on the merits we would have to find that <em>Larson\u2019s </em>ruling by the state courts that Alaska Evidence Rule 606(b) prevents introduction of the proffered evidence is \u2014 \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Yet, Larson has cited no Supreme Court case which holds to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>contrary. Larson contends that the Alaska Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of Alaska Rule of Evidence 606(b) in his state post-conviction proceeding independently violates the Fourteenth Amendment. But resolution of that issue was subject to direct review on a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, which Larson did not pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Because his federal habeas petition was untimely, the judgment of the district court dismissing it for that reason is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b689-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
