Both Bonilla-Tello and Bruno-Hernandez contend the district court erred at sentencing by denying them mitigating-role reductions, and assert them sentences are unreasonable. In addition to appealing them sentences, they have moved to adopt their co-conspirator\u2019s arguments that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and that the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act is unconstitutional. After review, we affirm Bonilla-Tello\u2019s and Bruno Hernandez\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">Both Bonilla-Tello and Bruno-Hernandez assert they played minor roles in the larger conspiracy because they were simply crew members on the vessel carrying the cocaine. They contend the district court erred in denying them mitigating-role reductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-15\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, a district court must calculate the Guidelines range correctly and must consider it when determining a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. </em>Crawford, 407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a finding of fact, which we review for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-16\">Section 3B1.2 of the Guidelines permits a mitigating-role adjustment to the applicable Guidelines range for a defendant who is substantially less culpable than the average participant due to a mitigating role. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 3. The defendant bears the burden of establishing that his role was minimal or minor by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Varna, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-17\">In determining whether a defendant meets the burden of demonstrating a mitigating role, a district court examines (1) the defendant\u2019s role based on the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable and (2) the defendant\u2019s role in comparison to the other participants. <em>Id. </em>at 940. In the drug courier context, relevant facts include, but are not limited to: the amount of drugs, their fair market value, the amount of money to be paid to the courier, an equity interest in the drugs, a role in planning the scheme, and the role in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>distribution. <em>Id. </em>at 945. The drug quantity \u201cmay be the best indication of the magnitude of the courier\u2019s participation,\u201d and a drug courier\u2019s role is not presumed to be minor. <em>Id. </em>at 943. The defendant must establish that he played a minor role in the conduct for which he has been found guilty and not just a minor role in the larger conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 941-942, 944. Therefore, the district court may only assess a defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to \u201cother participants in the relevant conduct,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>participants who are \u201cidentifiable or discernable from the evidence,\u201d and \u201cwho were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">With respect to the first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, the record indicates that Bonilla-Tello and Bruno-Hernandez were held accountable for possessing and conspiring with others to distribute 2,700 kilograms of cocaine on board a vessel. Although Bonilla-Tello and Bruno-Hernandez objected that they were not aware of the actual quantity of drugs on the vessel, neither Bonilla-Tello nor Bruno-Hernandez objected to the amount of drugs found on the vessel or to the facts in the PSI. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (holding a defendant admits facts when he does not object to the PSI\u2019s factual statements). With regard to Bonilla-Tello, the district court noted the seriousness of attempting to bring a large quantity of cocaine into the United States, and stated that \u201cthe quantity involved in this particular case also gravitates sternly away from any downward adjustment at least for a minor role.\u201d With regard to Bruno-Hernandez, the court noted the relevant conduct did \u201cnot include other episodes generated by the same international conspiracy.\u201d The court also stated \u201cthe quantity involved here virtually, if not absolutely, precludes the concept of minor role,\u201d and the quantity made it \u201cextremely remote\u201d that Bruno could show he was \u201cmaterially less culpable than similarly situated defendants or other crewmen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Regarding the second prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, the other participants discernable from the evidence and involved in the relevant conduct are Bonilla-Tello\u2019s and Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s codefendants, the boat operator who started the gasoline fire and later died, and the other injured crew members who were treated in Colombia and not brought to the United States for prosecution. Bonilla-Tello contends the district court should have evaluated his role in the broader conspiracy, and suggests a crewman\u2019s role in a boat case is generally minor. However, under <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>the roles of participants in any larger conspiracy are irrelevant. <em>De Var\u00f3n, 175 </em>F.3d at 944. The record does not show that Bonilla-Tello\u2019s role was any different from any of the other crew members except, perhaps, the captain. Moreover, this Court does not presume that a drug courier plays a minor role in a drug distribution conspiracy, and has stated that the drug quantity is a significant factor in determining the courier\u2019s role. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Regarding Bruno-Hernandez, again, the record does not show his role was any different from any of the other crew members except, perhaps, the captain. However, even though Bruno\u2019s role may be less than that of the captain\u2019s, Bruno-Hernandez is not automatically entitled to a mitigating-role adjustment since it is possible that none of the participants are minor. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944. Moreover, this Court does not presume that a drug courier plays a minor role in a drug distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>bution conspiracy, and has stated that the drug quantity is a significant factor in determining the courier\u2019s role. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Bonilla-Tello and Bruno-Hernandez bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that they were entitled to mitigating-role reductions, but, based on the close convergence between Bonilla-Tello\u2019s and Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s conduct and the conduct for which each was held accountable, they have failed to show their roles were less culpable than the roles of other average participants on the boat. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939, 944. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in determining that neither Bonilla-Tello nor Bruno-Hernandez qualified for a mitigating-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">With regard to the unreasonableness of their sentences, Bonilla-Tello and Bruno-Hernandez contend them sentences do not adequately reflect their need to provide for their families, who live in poverty. After setting out the applicable standard of review and relevant cases, we review then-sentences in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">We review the final sentences imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005). If we determine the district court committed no significant procedural error, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentences imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">Reasonableness review is deferential, and \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-13\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). While the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is not required to discuss each factor. \u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient....\u201d <em>Id. </em>A lengthy discussion of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is not required in the typical case, as long as the sentencing judge \u201cset[s] forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Although we do not apply a presumption of reasonableness to a within-Guidelines sentence, we will ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-17\">With regard to the procedural reasonableness of Bonilla-Tello\u2019s sentence, the district court stated it had considered the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>trict court did not state each of the factors individually, the record shows the court considered Bonilla-Tello\u2019s arguments for a below-range sentence on the basis of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In particular, the district court considered Bonilla-Tel-lo\u2019s individual and family circumstances, the nature of the offense, the need for punishment, and the sentences of similarly situated defendants. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A), (6). The district court also found the sentence was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was sufficient. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Bonilla-Tello also has not established his sentence was substantively unreasonable. His 135-month sentences are at the low end of the advisory Guidelines range and below the statutory maximum of life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii). Therefore, this Court ordinarily would expect Bonilla-Tello\u2019s sentence to be reasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Bonil-la-Tello asserts his case was not in the \u201cmine run\u201d of national cases and that, therefore, he could show that an in-range sentence was not reasonable. However, he did not present, either below or on appeal, any law or unusual facts to support his argument. Indeed, the district court noted that Bonilla-Tello\u2019s circumstances were \u201ctragic\u201d but \u201ctypical\u201d of similar cases in the division. Although there may be a range of reasonable sentences under Bonil-la-Tello\u2019s circumstances, Bonilla-Tello has not shown the district court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">With regard to the procedural reasonableness of Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s sentence, the district court stated it had considered the Sentencing Guidelines \u201cto the extent applicable after <em>United States v. Booker,\u201d </em>as well as the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although the district court did not state each of the factors individually, the record shows the court considered Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s arguments for a below-range sentence on the basis of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In particular, the district court considered Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s individual and family circumstances, the nature of the offense, the need for punishment, and the sentences of similarly situated defendants. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A), (6). The district court also found the sentence was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was sufficient. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">Bruno-Hernandez also has not established his sentences are substantively unreasonable. Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s 210-month sentences were at the low end of the advisory Guidelines range, and below the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii). Because Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s sentences were within the Guidelines range, this Court ordinarily would expect the sentence to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The district court noted that Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s higher sentence was a result of his higher criminal history but was otherwise \u201cessentially the same sentence\u201d as in the many \u201cmulti-ton boat cases over a period of years.\u201d The district court also noted there was \u201cnothing to distinguish this case\u201d from the others. The district court considered Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s arguments regarding his criminal history and found it was adequately represented. Although there may be a range of reasonable sentences under Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s circumstances, Bruno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>has not shown the. district court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum. See <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Talley, </em>481 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Although Bonilla-Tello\u2019s and Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s attempted adoption of Estrada-Obregon\u2019s arguments are arguably improper, we will exercise our discretion and grant Bonilla-Tello\u2019s motion to adopt, and consider Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s adoption in his reply brief. As we decided in the related case against co-conspirator James Estrada-Obregon, the district court did not plainly err in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss these cases on the basis that the vessel was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, or on the basis that there was no nexus with the United States. <em>See United States v. Estrada-Obregon, </em>No. 07-13517, 2008 WL 816670 (11th Cir.2008). In addition, the co-conspirators\u2019 remaining constitutional arguments are foreclosed by our previous decisions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">The district court did not clearly err in denying mitigating-role reductions for Bonilla-Tello and Bruno-Hernandez, and the sentences are proeedurally and substantively reasonable. In addition, the district court did not plainly err in failing to dismiss these cases for lack of jurisdiction or lack of nexus. Accordingly, we affirm Bonilla-Tello\u2019s and Bruno-Hernandez\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
