Rye contends that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s findings that Rye could sit \u201cat least 4-6 hours a day with a sit/stand option\u201d and that \u201che is able to walk in 15-minute increments for at least 2 hours in a work-day,\u201d are ambiguous and inconsistent with the finding that Rye is not disabled because, under the low-end estimate of four hours of sit/stand time, he could not work a full eight-hour day.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legal principles upon which the Commissioner\u2019s decision is based. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). We will affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision on a disability benefits application if it is supported by substantial evidence and the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards. <em>Graham v. Apfel, </em>129 F.3d 1420, 1422 (11th Cir.1997). The Commissioner\u2019s decision will not be disturbed if, in light of the record as whole, it appears to be supported by substantial evidence. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439-40 (11th Cir.1997). Under this limited standard of review, we will not decide the facts anew, make credibility determinations, or reweigh the evidence. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">Once the ALJ finds that a claimant cannot return to his or her prior work, as in this case, the burden of proof shifts to the Commissioner to establish that the claimant could perform other work that exists in the local or national economy. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). In determining whether the Commissioner has met this burden, the ALJ must develop a full record regarding the vocational opportunities available to a claimant. <em>Allen v. Sullivan, </em>880 F.2d 1200, 1201 (11th Cir.1989). This burden may be met through the use of a vocational expert. <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1559 (11th Cir.1995). In order for a vocational expert\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose to him a hypothetical question which contains all of the claimant\u2019s impairments. <em>See Vega v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>265 F.3d 1214, 1220 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">The residual functional capacity test is an assessment, based upon all of the relevant evidence, of a claimant\u2019s remaining ability to do work despite his impairments. <em>See Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997). Social Security Ruling 96-8p defines an individual\u2019s residual functional capacity as the person\u2019s maximum remaining ability \u201cto do sustained work activities in an ordinary work setting on a regular and continuing basis.\u201d S.S.R. 96-8p at 2. A \u201cregular and continuing basis\u201d means eight hours a day, five days a week, or the equivalent work schedule. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">Here, the ALJ found that Rye could sit for \u201cat least\u201d four to six hours, and that he could stand and walk in fifteen minute increments for \u201cat least\u201d two hours in a workday. The record supports this finding and supports the conclusion that Rye can perform work on a regular and continuing basis under the residual functional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>capacity test. The ALJ heard testimony from a vocational expert that given the limited number of hours Rye can sit and stand in a workday, he could still find employment as a food and beverage order clerk or ticket taker, jobs the expert opined exist both in Florida, where Rye lives, and in the broader national economy. In light of the deferential review we give agency findings, <em>Moore, 405 F.3d </em>at 1211, we cannot accept Rye\u2019s interpretation of the ALJ\u2019s finding with regard to the number of hours he could sit in a workday. Doing so would ignore the words \u201cat least\u201d and the finding that he could sit for six hours. We therefore conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
