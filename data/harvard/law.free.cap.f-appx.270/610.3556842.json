We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-17\">California prisoners whose sentences provide for the possibility of parole have a \u201cconstitutionally protected liberty interest in the receipt of a parole release date,\u201d and a parole board\u2019s decision to deny parole deprives a prisoner of due process if it is not supported by \u201c \u2018some evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Irons v. Carey, </em>505 F.3d 846, 850-51 (9th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Sass v. Calif. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1128-29 (9th Cir.2006)); <em>see also Superintendent v. </em>Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 457, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). Rose contends that the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard should not apply to denial-of-parole cases. Rose further contends that even if the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard does apply, the Board\u2019s reliance on the unchanging facts of his commitment offense deprived him of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process because there was no nexus between the Board\u2019s findings and his current suitability for parole. <em>See Hayward v. Marshall, </em>512 F.3d 536, 545-48 (9th Cir.2008)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-18\">As we noted in <em>Irons, </em>the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard is \u201cclearly established\u201d for cases in which we review a parole board\u2019s decision to deny parole, and we reject Rose\u2019s contention that an alternative standard should apply. 505 F.3d at 851; <em>see also Hill, </em>472 U.S. at 457, 105 S.Ct. 2768; <em>Sass, </em>461 F.3d at 1128-29. With respect to Rose\u2019s due process claim, the Board relied on more than just the unchanging facts of Rose\u2019s commitment offense in denying Rose parole. The Board relied on Rose\u2019s demonstrated lack of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>sight into the commitment offense, Rose\u2019s demeanor at his parole hearing, as well as the facts of the commitment offense in determining that Rose was unsuitable for parole. We conclude that the Board\u2019s decision to deny Rose parole is supported by \u201csome evidence\u201d and did not violate Rose\u2019s right to due process. <em>See Irons, </em>505 F.3d at 851-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The district court correctly concluded that the state trial court\u2019s determination that the Board did not violate Rose\u2019s due process rights was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Irons, </em>505 F.3d at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b635-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
