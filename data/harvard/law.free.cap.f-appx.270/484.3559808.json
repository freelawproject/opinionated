Wood brought this action against GCC for: (1) age discrimination and retaliation for opposition to age discrimination, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, <em>et seq.; </em>(2) age discrimination and retaliation for opposition to age discrimination, in violation of Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 659A.030; and (3) common law wrongful constructive discharge, <em>see McGanty v. Staudenraus, </em>321 Or. 532, 557, 901 P.2d 841, 856-57 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Wood worked as a senior advertising sales person at GCC\u2019s radio stations. Wood asserts that after she began to challenge GCC owner Jim Gross\u2019s efforts to hire a \u201cyounger, attractive, aggressive\u201d sales force, she was demoted and subjected to such an embarrassing and stressful work environment such that she had no choice but to resign <em>(ie., </em>she was \u201cconstructively discharged\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">The district court granted GCC\u2019s motion for summary judgment to the extent Wood\u2019s claims were premised on both federal and state law constructive discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">In granting summary judgment to GCC on Wood\u2019s federal constructive discharge claims, the district court held Wood presented insufficient evidence to create an issue of fact that her working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in her position would have felt she had no choice but to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-17\">In granting summary judgment to GCC on Wood\u2019s Oregon law constructive discharge claims, the district court held: (1) the workplace embarrassment Wood experienced was not a change in the terms and conditions of employment that could support a finding of constructive discharge; and (2) the five-month lapse between Wood\u2019s claimed demotion and her resignation could not support the required finding of causation between the two events.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-18\">The district court denied GCC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Wood\u2019s claims to the extent they were premised on her demotion (rather than constructive discharge) as the adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-19\">The parties sought and the district court entered a Stipulated Judgment of Dismissal, which dismissed with prejudice all of Wood\u2019s claims, to seek appellate review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the district court\u2019s decision regarding constructive discharge. On appeal, Wood challenges only the district court\u2019s holding that the evidence did not create a triable issue of fact as to whether GCC constructively discharged her.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Schnidrig v. Columbia Mach., Inc., </em>80 F.3d 1406, 1408 (9th Cir.1996), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The district court correctly held Wood\u2019s evidence fails to create an issue of fact that her working conditions were so intolerable a reasonable person in her position would have felt she had no choice but the resign. See <em>Penn. State Police v. Suders, </em>542 U.S. 129, 141, 124 S.Ct. 2342, 159 L.Ed.2d 204 (2004). Although Wood\u2019s work environment may have been unpleasant and stressful for her, the evidence does not meet the standard under federal law that her conditions were so \u201cextraordinary and egregious to overcome the normal motivation of a competent, diligent, and reasonable employee to remain on the job to earn a livelihood and to serve his or her employer.\u201d <em>See Poland v. Chertoff, </em>494 F.3d 1174, 1184 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Similarly, the evidence does not meet the requirement under Oregon constructive discharge law that she experience a concrete change in the terms and conditions of her employment that caused her to resign. Gross\u2019s embarrassment of Wood in the workplace is not a change in the terms and conditions of employment under Oregon law. <em>See Doe v. Denny's, </em>327 Or. 354, 359, 963 P.2d 650 (1998). Although there was a factual issue as to whether Wood\u2019s reassignment amounted to a demotion, the five-month lapse between what Wood claimed to be a demotion and her decision to resign defeats her claim of a causal relationship between the two events. <em>See Clark County Sell. Dist. v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 273-74, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001). Moreover, Wood offered no evidence that GCC demoted her with an intent the demotion would cause Wood to resign. <em>See McGanty, </em>321 Or. at 557, 901 P.2d at 856-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b509-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
