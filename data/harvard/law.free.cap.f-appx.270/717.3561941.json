King, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Hawaii, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Maria Guadalupe Ambriz-Rivera, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) summarily affirming a decision of an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) finding her removable for alien smuggling under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(E)\u00ae. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The IJ\u2019s decision finding that Ambriz-Rivera was removable for alien smuggling was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 917, 925 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that when the BIA affirms the IJ without an opinion pursuant 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as we would that of the BIA); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (noting that we review a final order of removal for substantial evidence). Border Patrol and immigration agents testified that they were running a program to apprehend alien smugglers or guides, where agents follow an alien (who has presented false documentation at the U.S.Mexico border) until she meets with a smuggler in the United States, and both are apprehended. After Lorena Rodriguez-Salinas presented false documents while crossing the border, three Border Patrol and immigration agents observed her cross the border at San Ysidro and take a northbound trolley to San Diego, wait at a trolley station for approximately 30 minutes while five southbound trolleys passed, suddenly board a southbound trolley on which Ambriz-Rivera was also riding, get off a couple of stops later with Ambriz-Rivera, and walk several blocks with Ambriz-Rivera while the two constantly looked over them shoulders as if they feared they were being followed. As soon as they split up, both were apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">Our conclusion that the IJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence is fortified by the IJ\u2019s assessment of the credibility of Ambriz-Rivera\u2019s testimony. The IJ, who had the opportunity to view both Am-briz-Rivera and the agents as they testified, noted that her testimony was weak, unreliable, evasive, and inconsistent with the testimony of the officers (even giving her ample opportunity to explain the inconsistencies). <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 969 n. 14 (9th Cir.1998) (noting that when reviewing a decision for substantial evidence \u201cwe may not reweigh the evidence\u201d to make our own determination, but rather, must determine only whether the evidence compels a conclusion contrary to that of the BIA); <em>Canjura-Flores v. INS, </em>784 F.2d 885, 888 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cThe [IJ] is in the best position to make credibility findings because he views the witness as testimony is given.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Lastly, the agents\u2019 testimony alone supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that AmbrizRivera affirmatively aided Rodriguez-Salinas illegally enter the United States. <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812 (stating that the BIA\u2019s factual findings may be reversed only if the evidence compels a different conclusion). We therefore need not determine whether the government made reasonable efforts to secure Rodriguez-Salinas\u2019s presence at the hearing or whether admitting Rodriguez-Salinas\u2019s interview into evidence violated Ambriz-Rivera\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b742-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b743-6\">B. FLETCHER,</author>\n<p id=\"A1Fy\">Circuit Judge, concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">I concur in the majority\u2019s disposition. I write separately because of what I consider to be the government\u2019s inexcusable failure to make reasonable efforts to secure the presence of Lorena Rodriguez-Salinas at Ambriz-Rivera\u2019s deportation hearing in light of its intention to use her testimony by way of affidavit, without providing any opportunity to cross-examine her. Had we found it necessary to resolve whether the IJ erred in admitting into evidence Rodriguez-Salinas\u2019s sworn statement, I would have concluded that the IJ erred because the government \u201c \u2018may not use an affidavit from an absent witness unless [it] first establishes that, despite reasonable efforts, it was unable to secure the presence of the witness at the hearing.\u2019\u201d <em>Hernandez-Guadarrama v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 674, 681-82 (9th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Ocasio v. Ashcroft, </em>375 F.3d 105, 107 (1st Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">After arresting her in San Diego on March 5, 2002, immigration agents interviewed Rodriguez-Salinas and obtained a sworn statement in which she admitted her intent to enter the United States with false documents and identified Ambriz-Rivera as her paid smuggler. Subsequently, Rodriguez-Salinas had her fingerprints taken, had her biometric information entered into the IDENT database, and was granted voluntary departure back to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">On April 25, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) sent a letter to Rodriguez-Salinas\u2019s address in Aguascalientes, Mexico, which is located in western central Mexico more than 1,000 miles from San Diego and the Port of Entry at San Ysidro, California.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the letter, DHS \u201crequested\u201d Rodriguez-Salinas\u2019s presence at Ambriz-Rivera\u2019s hearing in San Diego on August 26, 2003, and stated that she \u201cwill be required to testify\u201d in the matter. The letter further stated that Rodriguez-Salinas needed to report to the Port of Entry at San Ysidro, California, on August 26, 2003, by 5:00 a.m., and that she would have to present the letter \u201cfor permission to be paroled into the United States for the limited purpose of traveling to the court and back on the date of the hearing.\u201d The letter also stated that Rodriguez-Salinas would be required to present identification to the inspector at the border. Finally, the letter stated that Rodriguez-Salinas could telephone the Office of the District Counsel if she had any questions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">The letter failed to assure Rodriguez-Salinas that she would not be detained, fined or prosecuted for having entered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>United States unlawfully on March 5, 2002. The letter also failed to offer to pay Rodriguez-Salinas\u2019s reasonable travel expenses for the journey of over 1,000 miles from Aguasealientes to San Diego. These failures are significant and have been recognized as such in our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">First, it is simply a fantasy to expect that a witness who has been arrested, detained, processed and sent back to Mexico by the United States government for unlawfully entering the country with false documentation and with the aid of a paid smuggler would later choose to report back to that government without a promise that she will not face further repercussions for her unlawful entry. Without such a promise, the witness would naturally be terrified to subject herself again to the same authorities that had previously arrested and detained her. We recognized the importance of promising that a witness will be free from further repercussions in <em>United States v. Olafson, </em>213 F.3d 435 (9th Cir.2000), where we upheld the district court\u2019s conclusion that an illegal alien who had been returned to Mexico was an \u201cunavailable\u201d witness, and that therefore his hearsay statements were admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a), partly on the ground that a border patrol agent had repeatedly promised him that he would not be incarcerated again if he returned to the United States to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Second, it is likewise a fantasy to expect that an apparently impecunious witness who relied on relatives to pay for a smuggler to help her enter the United States would pay her own way to travel over 1,000 miles to testify on behalf of the government in her smuggler\u2019s deportation hearing. An offer to pay the witness\u2019s expense not only would be reasonable, but it also would be necessary to warrant any expectation that the witness would make the required journey in order to testify. Thus, in <em>United States v. Yida, </em>498 F.3d 945 (9th Cir.2007), we agreed with the district court that the government\u2019s offer to pay the travel expenses of a witness who had pled guilty to a drug crime and who had been deported back to Israel was \u201ceffectively the Government\u2019s only legitimate effort to ensure that [the witness] would be present at defendant\u2019s re-trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 960-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">To be sure, the chance that a removed witness living abroad will choose to return to the United States to testify remains slim even if the government promises that the witness will suffer no further repercussions and offers to pay the witness\u2019s reasonable travel expenses. The government drastically reduces the chance that a witness will testify when it decides in the first place to remove the witness from the United States. <em>See Yida, </em>498 F.3d at 957 (holding that the reasonableness of the government\u2019s deportation of a witness should be considered in determining whether the witness is \u201cunavailable\u201d to testify under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Nevertheless, the chance that a witness will return to the United States to testify would likely be significantly greater if the government were to promise that the witness would be free from further repercussions for her earlier unlawful entry into the United States and any other unlawful actions in this country and were to offer to pay the witness\u2019s reasonable travel expenses. To rely on the fantasy that a witness will return to testify simply because she is \u201crequested\u201d to do so is not the reasonable effort to secure the witnesses\u2019s presence that due process requires. <em>See Hernandez-Guadarrama, </em>394 F.3d at 681 (\u201c[T]he constitutional and statutory guarantees of due process require that \u2018the government\u2019s choice whether to produce a witness or to use a hearsay statement [not be] wholly unfettered.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Sai-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>dane v. </em>INS, 129 F.3d 1063, 1065 (9th Cir.1997) (second alteration in <em>Hernandez-</em>Guadarrama)).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">. Ambriz-Rivera argues on appeal that the government failed to make reasonable efforts to secure Rodriguez-Salinas\u2019s presence at her hearing because it mailed the letter to the address contained in the Form 1-213 that an immigration officer prepared regarding Rodriguez-Salinas instead of to the allegedly less vague address provided by Rodriguez-Salinas in her sworn statement. As indicated in the majority\u2019s disposition, we do not reach the merits of this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b743-14\">.
