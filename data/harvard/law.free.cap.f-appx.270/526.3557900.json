Lara-Rivas raises two due process challenges to the IJ\u2019s finding of removability. First, he argues that the facts alleged in the Notice to Appear (NTA), as amended by the Form 1-261, were insufficient to support the false claim to U.S. citizenship charge that was added by the amendment and did not provide the requisite notice of the content of that charge. Second, he argues that, even if the Form 1-261 was sufficient, the IJ erred by relying on evidence outside of the record of conviction to sustain that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-19\">We conclude that any error was harmless. <em>See Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1066-67 (9th Cir.2007). Lara-Rivas conceded his removability under the original charge, i.e. being an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). He sought relief from removal, however, in the form of adjustment of status. An alien bears the burden of proving his eligibility for adjustment of status. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(2)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d). The evidence of Lara-Rivas\u2019s use of a false U.S. passport to obtain a California driver\u2019s license was properly admitted in support of the government\u2019s motion to pretermit his adjustment application. <em>See, e.g., Salviejo-Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 1063, 1066 (9th Cir.2006). That evidence and, in particular, Lara-Rivas\u2019s own testimony, established his inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii) (rendering inadmissible an alien who makes a false claim to U.S. citizenship in order to obtain a benefit under federal or state law), a non-waivable bar to eligibility for adjust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>ment of status. Lara-Rivas failed to rebut this contention both in his brief and at oral ai\u2019gument.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b550-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
