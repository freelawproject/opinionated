His sole contention on appeal is that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Because Hinojos preserved the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence, the applicable standard of review is \u201cwhether, viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence establishes the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Villarreal, </em>324 F.3d 319, 322 (5th Cir.2003). The evidence need not exclude every other reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt. <em>United States v. Resio-Trejo, 45 </em>F.3d 907, 911 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Three witnesses testified that they saw Hinojos at an apartment near downtown El Paso where they stayed overnight after illegally reentering the United States. Hi-nojos argues that the testimony of these witnesses was incredible as a matter of law. He contends that the time lines provided by the illegal aliens placed them in Las Cruces, New Mexico, at the time in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">While, as the Government concedes, there is some confusion in the testimony of the illegal aliens as to the exact date they illegally reentered and the number of days thereafter they were in Las Cruces before returning to El Paso and going to the apartment and there are some inconsistencies in then- testimony, nevertheless, as the Government argues, their testimony is clear that they observed Hinojos at the apartment getting food for and otherwise involved with the illegal aliens being harbored there. Then testimony in this respect, if credited by the jury, amply suffices to sustain the verdict. It is the province of the jury to determine the weight and credibility of the evidence. <em>United States v. Casilla, </em>20 F.3d 600, 602 (5th Cir.1994). The testimony of these witnesses was not \u201cfactually impossible.\u201d <em>See United States v. Casel, </em>995 F.2d 1299, 1304 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">Taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence showed that Hinojos acted in concert with others involved in the offense by acting as a lookout at the apartment complex and by providing food to the illegal aliens, conduct which, by its nature, \u201ctended to substantially facilitate the alien[s] remaining in the United States illegally.\u201d <em>United States v. De Jesus-Ba-tres, </em>410 F.3d 154, 160 (5th Cir.2005). <em>See also United States v. Shum, </em>496 F.3d 390, 392 (5th Cir.2007). Because the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
