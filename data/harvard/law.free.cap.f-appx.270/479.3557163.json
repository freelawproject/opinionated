According to Singh, he went into hiding after his third detention while he arranged travel to the United States. Singh left India on April 4, 2002 and, after traveling through Jordan, Greece, and France, took a crew berth on a ship sailing from Haiti to the United States. On May 9 or 10, 2002, Singh and three other Indian crewmen deserted from the ship and entered the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">On May 20, 2003, Singh filed his application for asylum and withholding of removal based on religion, political opinion, and membership in a particular social group and for protection under the Torture Convention. On January 26, 2005, Singh testified at his removal hearing that he never left India before April 4, 2002. The IJ based his adverse credibility determination on, among other grounds, the fact that information contained in Singh\u2019s passport and seafarer\u2019s identification book contradicted his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Where, as here, \u201cthe BIA adopts the findings and reasoning of the IJ, this court reviews the decision of the IJ as if it were that of the BIA.\u201d <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). The standard of review is extremely deferential because \u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. (quoting </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). This standard applies to IJ credibility findings. Therefore, we must deny Singh\u2019s petition unless no reasonable finder of fact could hold that he was not credible. <em>Id. </em>The IJ \u201cmust have a legitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility, and must offer a specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief,\u201d and that reason \u201cmust be substantial and bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.\u201d <em>Salaam v. I.N.S., </em>229 F.3d 1234, 1238 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The IJ concluded that \u201cit is a fact that the respondent [Singh] definitely did not leave India for the first time in his life in April 2002. It is evident that the respondent was outside of India, perhaps on several occasions, perhaps for lengthy periods of time, before April 2002.\u201d The IJ cited the following facts in support of this conclusion: (1) the Embassy of India in Athens, Greece issued Singh\u2019s passport on November 11, 2001 as a replacement for a passport originally issued February 4, 1997; (2) the passport contains stamps indicating travel before April 4, 2002, including two mostly illegible stamps dated January 10, 2002; and (3) Singh\u2019s seafarer\u2019s identification was issued in 2000. The IJ rejected Singh\u2019s testimony that an agent acquired his passport and seafarer\u2019s identification for him just before his departure from India and that he had no knowledge concerning the dates of issue or the various stamps on the passport. The IJ found that Singh\u2019s \u201ctravels in this respect certainly call into question each and every one of the arrests and detentions that he states he suffered in India in the years 2000, 2001, and 2002.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The passport and seafarer\u2019s identification are substantial documentary evidence that Singh traveled outside India before April 4, 2002. Moreover, at least one of the dates of travel indicated by the passport stamps (January 2002) occurred during the time Singh testified that he had been in hiding in India, a few weeks after the third arrest and detention, calling into question the heart of his claim. We have considered Singh\u2019s contention that the IJ lacked substantial evidence to reject his testimony that (1) Singh had nothing to do with obtaining the travel documents and (2) the first time he saw them was just before he left India. However, given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>documentary evidence, a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that he left India before April 4, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The IJ cited three other grounds for his adverse credibility determination: (1) Singh displayed little knowledge of the goals of the pro-Sikh opposition party and did not describe its political agenda, including the party\u2019s goal of establishing an independent Sikh state called \u201cKhalistan\u201d; (2) Singh\u2019s testimony concerning the identity of the police inspector responsible for the third arrest and detention was inconsistent with a correction made to Singh\u2019s application at the start of the hearing; and (3) Singh testified at the hearing that the agency that arrested and detained him three times was called the \u201cCl,\u201d which is inconsistent with his application and with the background materials that indicate that this Indian law enforcement agency is known as the \u201cCIA.\u201d We do not address these grounds here, because, \u201c[s]o long as one of the identified grounds is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of [Singh\u2019s] claim of persecution, we are bound to accept the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Wang v. I.N.S., </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1259 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"a5z-dedup-0\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b503-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-26\">. The IJ also denied Singh\u2019s application for asylum on the ground that he did not establish that he applied within one year of his arrival in the United States. He does not contest this finding in his petition to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b505-10\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ABNg\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">Because, in my opinion, none of the four grounds upon which the IJ relied in making his adverse credibility determination meets even our deferential standard of review for substantial evidence, I dissent. First and foremost, the ground relied upon by the majority cannot be sustained. The IJ did not explain his rejection of Singh\u2019s entirely plausible testimony that an agent acquired his travel documents and that he therefore had no knowledge of their contents. <em>See Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1013 (9th Cir.1998) (holding adverse credibility determination unsupported by substantial evidence where the \u201cBIA did not comment on [alien\u2019s] explanation, nor suggest any reason that it found his explanation not credible\u201d). Moreover, the IJ impermissibly speculated that a fake passport would not contain stamps from prior travels. <em>See, e.g., Ge v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1121, 1125-26 (9th Cir.2004) (reversing adverse credibility determination where IJ\u2019s findings were \u201cbased on impermissible speculation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">Second, the three grounds that the majority declines to address are equally insufficient to support the IJ\u2019s determination. One, Singh testified to the goals of the pro-Sikh opposition party including fair crop prices and water distribution, and was never asked about the party\u2019s views on Khalis-tan at the hearing. Two, as the Government concedes, Singh testified consistently about the police inspector responsible for his third arrest. Three, the distinction between \u201cCl\u201d and \u201cCIA\u201d is the type of trivial eiTor that we have consistently found to be an insufficient basis for an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Ji-bril v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1129, 1133 (9th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201c[t]rivial errors by an asylum applicant do not constitute a valid ground upon which to base a finding that an asylum applicant is not credible\u201d) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">I would grant the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
