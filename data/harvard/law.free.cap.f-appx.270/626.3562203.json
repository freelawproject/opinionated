Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The regulations provide that a motion to reconsider \u201cmust be filed with the Board within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision\u201d and that a motion to reopen \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2) &amp; (c)(2). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion as untimely where it was filed more than three years after the final administrative decision was rendered. <em>See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied as to petitioner Jose Juan Del Rio-Meza.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-26\">To the extent that petitioners seek review of the BIA decision denying relief to petitioner Jorge Del Rio-Rodriguez, A78-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>001-075, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction is granted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Sheviakov v.
