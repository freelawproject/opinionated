Dan A. Polster, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b403-25\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b403-26\">The plaintiff, Deborah Prechtel, appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendant, Kellogg\u2019s, doing business as Kellogg\u2019s Snacks, on Prechtel\u2019s state-law claims of sex-based discrimination, retaliation, and unequal pay. The district court held that the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding the claims raised in her complaint. We agree, and we therefore affirm the district court's judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-27\">At the time she filed suit, Prechtel was a long-time employee of a cookie company in Louisville, Kentucky, that was eventually purchased by Kellogg\u2019s. After that corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>rate acquisition, Ray Hauser became the plant operations manager at the Louisville facility and assumed supervisory control over the job functions of the plaintiff and other \u201cteam leaders\u201d who, in turn, supervised \u201cline managers\u201d for each of the plant\u2019s three shifts. However, on June 14, 2005, Hauser informed Prechtel that her job performance did not meet company standards and that she had the option of remaining as a team leader and having her employment deficiencies documented, agreeing to a severance package, or accepting a demotion to the position of line manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Ten days later, on June 24, 2005, Jenny Stewart, another team leader and the plaintiffs closest friend at work, informed Hauser that Prechtel was contemplating filing a sexual harassment suit against him and against Kellogg\u2019s. The company then began an internal investigation of the charges, which ultimately led company officials to conclude that the plaintiffs claims could not be substantiated. Even prior to the conclusion of that inquiry, however, Prechtel took the first of two consecutive leaves of absence from the company and did not return to work \u2014 as a line manager rather than as a team leader \u2014 until January 17, 2006. In the meantime, she had filed a lawsuit in Kentucky state court, pursuant to provisions of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act, K.R.S. Chapter 344, and that action was removed to federal court by the defendant on diversity of citizenship grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In her employment discrimination action, Prechtel alleged that Hauser made certain sexual advances toward her that created a hostile work environment and that her rejection of those advances led to Hauser\u2019s decision to demote her, force her into early retirement, or document problems with her work. She also claimed that Kellogg\u2019s management retaliated against her for alleging sexual discrimination by citing her for various workplace deficiencies during a three-month period from March to June 2006, and that she was paid a lesser salary than comparably-situated male employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">In almost all respects, the district court correctly identified the legal principles relevant to the plaintiffs allegations and properly applied those precedents to the facts presented. In doing so, the court concluded that Prechtel failed to adduce evidence of severe or pervasive harassment, that she failed to substantiate gender-based pay differentials at the Louisville facility, and that she did not successfully link any job discipline to the company\u2019s knowledge of and retaliation for her discrimination allegations. Issuance of a full, written opinion by this court addressing these issues and determinations would be duplicative and would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court, in part upon the reasoning set out by that court in its opinion and order filed on June 1, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Two issues nevertheless require additional comment. First, the plaintiffs complaint alleged that Hauser\u2019s actions not only created a hostile work environment at Kellogg\u2019s Louisville plant, but also that \u201c[pjromotional opportunity and continued employment were made contingent upon Plaintiff complying with said sexual advances.\u201d The district court, however, did not discuss explicitly the so-called <em>quid pro quo </em>aspect of Prechtel\u2019s discrimination claim, perhaps because there was so little in the record to substantiate it. As we noted in <em>Bowman v. Shawnee State University, </em>220 F.3d 456, 461 (6th Cir.2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akg-dedup-0\">To prevail under a sexual harassment claim without showing that the harassment was severe or pervasive, the employee must prove the following: 1) that the employee was a member of a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tected class; 2) that the employee was subjected to unwelcomed sexual harassment in the form of sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; 3) that the harassment complained of was on the basis of sex; 4) that the employee\u2019s submission to the unwelcomed advances was an express or implied condition for receiving job benefits or that the employee\u2019s refusal to submit to the supervisor\u2019s sexual demands resulted in a tangible job detriment; and 5) the existence of <em>respondeat superior </em>liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Absolutely no evidence adduced in this case by the plaintiff suggests that Pre-chtel\u2019s rebuffs of Hauser\u2019s alleged advances were the impetus for any adverse employment action. Indeed, if such were the case, Hauser allowed an inordinate amount of time to elapse after the rejections of his overtures before taking action detrimental to the plaintiff in mid-June 2005. For example, the three inappropriate comments allegedly made by Hauser to Prechtel occurred seven or eight months prior to that time, and the alleged attempt by Hauser to grab the plaintiffs leg (even though he was seated immediately adjacent to <em>his </em>female boss at the time) occurred three months prior to the meeting at which the plaintiff was given the three options for her future with the company. Under such circumstances, Prechtel has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact that militates against the grant of summary judgment to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Second, in discussing the reasons supporting the grant of summary judgment to Kellogg\u2019s on Preehtel\u2019s retaliation claim, the district court, relying upon our decision in <em>Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee, </em>211 Fed.Appx. 373 (6th Cir. 2006), held that \u201cparticipation in an internal investigation initiated by [her employer] in the absence of any pending EEOC charge is not a protected activity under the participation clause [of Title VII].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376. Recently, however, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari in <em>Crawford </em>to consider the question whether \u201cthe anti-retaliation provision of section 704(a) of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects] a worker from being dismissed because she cooperated with her employer\u2019s internal investigation of sexual harassment.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1118, 169 L.Ed.2d 846 (2008); <em>pet. for cert. found at </em>2007 WL 1594338, at *i (U.S. May 30, 2007). Consequently, the possibility now exists that the Supreme Court could reverse the Sixth Circuit\u2019s ruling in <em>Crawford </em>and hold that a plaintiff does indeed engage in \u201cprotected activity\u201d when involved in an internal investigation of discrimination, even in the absence of a pending charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Regardless of the Supreme Court\u2019s ultimate ruling in <em>Crawford, </em>however, the district court\u2019s denial of Prechtel\u2019s retaliation claim need not be overturned in this case because the district court provided an alternative basis for that decision. In its memorandum opinion, the district court noted that even if Prechtel could establish that she engaged in \u201cprotected activity,\u201d she had not adduced any evidence to establish that the defendant was aware of that activity at the time it undertook the allegedly retaliatory acts. In fact, Hauser first learned of the possibility that Pre-chtel might seek legal redress for alleged wrongs ten days after he spoke with the plaintiff about her options with the company. Furthermore, discussing the disciplinary write-ups Prechtel received in 2006, the district court correctly recognized that the plaintiff offered no evidence that her team leader \u201cknew of her previous sexual harassment complaints and that, if he did, [that] his counseling of her was motivated by that knowledge.\u201d Indeed, as the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>trict court noted, Prechtel even \u201cadmitted] in her deposition that she did not know whether [her team leader who identified her work deficiencies] had knowledge of her prior complaints, and Plaintiffs counsel have pointed to no piece of evidence that would show that he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">For the reasons articulated in the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion filed on June 1, 2007, as well as those set out above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
