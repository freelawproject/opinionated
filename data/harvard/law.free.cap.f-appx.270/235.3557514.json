The district court sentenced McGowan to 78 months in prison. McGowan timely appealed. McGowan\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), identifying no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether the district court erred by denying McGowan\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. McGowan was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-24\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 197, 166 L.Ed.2d 161 (2006). Where, as here, the motion was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, this court \u201cdo[es] not review the credibility of the witnesses and assume[s] the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>government.\u201d <em>United States v. Sun, </em>278 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002). The court \u201cmust consider circumstantial as well as direct evidence, and allow the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In order to convict McGowan under \u00a7 922(g)(1), the Government had to establish that (1) McGowan had been previously convicted of a felony, (2) McGowan knowingly possessed the firearm, and (3) the possession was in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce. <em>See United States v. Gilbert, </em>430 F.3d 215, 218 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 58, 166 L.Ed.2d 54 (2006). McGowan stipulated to the first element at trial. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and resolving all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the Government, the evidence showed that McGowan dropped an object in the bushes. When the object was investigated, it toned out to be a stocking cap wrapped around gloves and a pistol. McGowan\u2019s DNA was on the gloves, and the firearm had traveled in interstate commerce. In addition, a witness had seen McGowan with a firearm earlier in the day. We conclude that jurors could reasonably convict McGowan on this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm McGowan\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
