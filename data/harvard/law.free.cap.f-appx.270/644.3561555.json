This court has jurisdiction to review final BIA orders. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">In his direct appeal, Koci challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which must be supported by substantial evidence on review. <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002). The record fully supports the IJ\u2019s reasons for finding Koci incredible. Koci initially claimed his wife and child still resided in Albania, where his wife was in hiding in fear for her life; he later admitted his family resided with him in the United States. The initial lie was clearly intended to buttress his asylum claim. He denied several times under oath that he was related to his only witness. After consulting with counsel during a recess, Koci then admitted the witness was his brother-in-law. In addition, he produced a certificate of questionable authenticity to support his claim he served as a judge in Albania, advanced as one of the reasons he was persecuted. The questionable document and untruthful testimony substantially supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">The BIA also correctly concluded the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT was based on a consideration of all evidence submitted in Koci\u2019s application for relief. The IJ cited but did not specifically discuss all documentary evidence, including the State Department\u2019s country report for Albania. This was minimally sufficient under the circumstances. <em>See Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 922-23 (9th Cir.2006) (denial of CAT relief upheld where IJ generally stated he considered all evidence, petitioner\u2019s testimony was discredited, and country report of torture in Albania did not compel conclusion petitioner would be tortured).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">In his motion to reopen, Koci asserted his previous counsel was ineffective for failure to file a brief or raise a due process claim because his hearing transcript was incomplete. The denial of a motion to reopen is reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002). The BIA\u2019s denial of Koci\u2019s motion to reopen was a rational exercise of discretion. The record here stands in contrast with that in <em>Grigoryan v. Mukasey, </em>515 F.3d 999 (9th Cir.2008), where counsel\u2019s failure to file an adequate appellate brief was deemed presumptively prejudicial. Even though Koci\u2019s attorney failed to file an appellate brief, the record does not support a presumption of prejudice because the BIA addressed Koci\u2019s direct appeal on the merits, and considered all arguments raised in his notice of appeal. <em>Cf. Grigoryan, </em>515 F.3d at 1002-03 (noting a summary affirmance by the BIA.) Koci has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>not identified any argument or issue that was foreclosed by counsel\u2019s failure to file a brief or by the unavailability of a complete transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">THE PETITIONS IN NOS. 04-71718 AND 04-75386 ARE DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b669-14\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b670-5\">PAEZ, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"a7c-dedup-0\">concurring in part<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Binding precedent requires that Koci\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion to reopen (No. 04-73586) be granted. <em>See Grigoryan v. Mukasey, </em>515 F.3d 999 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Because <em>Grigoryan </em>compels a holding that the BIA abused its discretion by failing to presume prejudice from the ineffective assistance of Koci\u2019s former counsel, I must respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">An alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings must normally establish prejudice by showing that \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Maravilla Ma-ravilla v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam). However, in cases where counsel\u2019s error is so fundamental as to \u201centirely deprive[ the alien] of meaningful review, she is entitled to a presumption of prejudice.\u201d <em>Grigoryan, </em>515 F.3d at 1006. Although the Government may rebut this presumption, \u201cit is not rebutted if a petitioner demonstrates a plausible ground[ ] for relief on her underlying claim.\u201d <em>Id.; accord Ray v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 582, 587 (9th Cir.2006). In <em>Grigor-yan, </em>we clarified that the presumption of prejudice \u201cmay arise from counsel\u2019s failure to file a timely notice of appeal or petition for review, <em>his failure to file a brief to the BIA </em>or this court, or his filing of a boilerplate brief.\u201d 515 F.3d at 1006 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">Here, it is undisputed that Koci\u2019s prior counsel \u201cfail[ed] to file a brief to the BIA.\u201d Moreover, it is clear that the BIA did not presume prejudice, but rather denied Koci\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim because Koci \u201cfailed to demonstrate that his prior counsel\u2019s failure to file an appellate brief ... prejudiced him.\u201d This was error and an abuse of the BIA\u2019s discretion. <em>See Grigoryan, </em>515 F.3d at 1006 (\u201cThe BIA abused its discretion when it failed to presume prejudice from former counsel\u2019s actions and instead required Gri-goryan to demonstrate that she suffered prejudice.\u201d). Under these circumstances, where the BIA has applied an erroneous legal standard, we may proceed in the following manner: (1) if it is clear from the record whether or not the petitioner is entitled to relief, we may apply the proper prejudice standard and either remand to the BIA with instructions to grant the motion to reopen, <em>see id. </em>(\u201cBecause Gri-goryan has established plausible grounds for relief, her presumption of prejudice is not rebutted.\u201d), or deny the petition on the grounds that the petitioner has presented no plausible grounds for relief; (2) if it is not clear whether the petitioner is entitled to relief under the proper prejudice standard, we must remand to the BIA for application of the proper standard in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>first instance. <em>Cf. INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">While failing to acknowledge the BIA\u2019s legal error in applying the wrong prejudice standard, the majority cites <em>Grigoryan </em>without persuasively distinguishing it. The court notes that the BIA \u201caddressed Koci\u2019s direct appeal on the merits,\u201d but, in <em>Grigoryan, </em>prejudice was presumed notwithstanding the fact that the BIA denied the appeal on the merits. <em>See Grigoryan, </em>515 F.3d at 1002. In fact, regardless of whether the issues summarily raised in Koci\u2019s notice of appeal were addressed \u201con the merits\u201d in the BIA\u2019s one-paragraph order denying relief, <em>Grigoryan </em>compels the conclusion that Koci was \u201cdeprived of meaningful appellate review\u201d by his counsel\u2019s failure to file a brief arguing those issues. <em>Id. </em>at 1004. As a result, Koci is entitled to a presumption of prejudice which \u201cis not rebutted if [he] demonstrates a plausible grounds for relief on h[is] underlying claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">In light of the record, I would hold that Koci did not \u201cdemonstrate[ ] plausible grounds for relief\u2019 on his claims for asylum or withholding of removal under the INA, but did demonstrate plausible grounds for relief on his CAT claim. Accordingly, I would remand to the BIA with instructions to grant Koci\u2019s motion to reopen in part and to address his CAT claim on the merits. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Because I conclude that the result reached by the majority in this case cannot be reconciled with <em>Grigoryan, </em>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\">. I concur in the majority's denial of petition No. 04-71718.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\">. In a Rule 28(j) letter dated December 17, 2007, Koci requested relief under an earlier version of <em>Grigoiyan </em>which was published on November 19, 2007. That version of <em>Grigor-yan </em>was withdrawn and superseded by the February 5, 2008 opinion, but the minor revisions are immaterial for purposes of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b670-13\">. The facts in <em>Grigoiyan </em>involved the filing of a \u201cboilerplate brief ... almost devoid of specific references to Grigoryan's case.\" 515 F.3d at 1002. However, even if <em>Grigoiyan'&amp; </em>reference to \"failure to file a brief to the BIA\" is technically dicta, it is clear that <em>Grigoiyan </em>must control the instant case. If the presumption of prejudice is applied where counsel filed a boilerplate brief, <em>a fortiori </em>it must be applied where counsel filed no brief at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
