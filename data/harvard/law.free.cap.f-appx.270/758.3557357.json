White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). Amendment 706, effective November 1, 2007, reduced the base offense level for offenses involving at least 50, but less than 150, grams of cocaine base from 32 to 30. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706; <em>compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4) (2006), <em>mth </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5) (2007). Section 3582(c)(2) states a court may modify a term of imprisonment, based on a Guidelines range that is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, if the reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements from the Sentencing Commission, and it does not limit the time period when a court may make such a modification. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized unless the amendment is listed in \u25a0\u00a7 lB1.10(c). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a). Amendment 706 was listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) effective on March 3, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">The district court did not err in denying the motion because Tensley prematurely filed it on November 8, 2007. Although the amendment is retroactive, it did not become retroactive until March 3, 2008. Accordingly, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
