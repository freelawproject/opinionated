The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) made an adverse credibility finding and held that Danielyan was ineligible for asylum because he assisted in the persecution of others. The IJ also found that Danielyan had failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on a protected ground. The IJ therefore denied all relief. Daniel-yan appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. The BIA declined to reach the merits of Danielyan\u2019s asylum claims, and instead determined that Danielyan was statutorily ineligible for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b) (2) (A)(iii) and withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(iii) because \u201cthere are serious reasons for believing that the alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crime____\u201d The BIA also denied CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-18\">On petition for review to this court, Dan-ielyan contends that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ord and that the BIA erred in holding that Danielyan had engaged in the persecution of others.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Danielyan\u2019s arguments are misplaced. \u201cWhere ... the BIA reviews the IJ\u2019s decision de novo, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s opinion is expressly adopted.\u201d <em>Shah v. INS, 220 </em>F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Here, the BIA authored an opinion of its own. Nowhere in that opinion does the BIA expressly adopt any of the IJ\u2019s findings. This court\u2019s review, which is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision, therefore does not address the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Danielyan also misstates the BIA\u2019s holding. Though the IJ found him ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal based on persecution of others under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), the BIA did not adopt that holding. Instead, the BIA held Danielyan ineligible under different provisions, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(iii) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(iii), which state an alien is ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal if there are serious reasons for believing that the alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the United States prior to the arrival of the alien in the United States. A serious nonpolitical crime \u201cis a crime that was not committed out of genuine political motives, was not directed toward the modification of the political organization or ... structure of the state, and in which there is no direct, causal link between the crime committed and its alleged political purpose and object.\u201d <em>McMullen v. INS, </em>788 F.2d 591, 595 (9th Cir.1986) (internal quotations and citation omitted), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Barapind v. Enomoto, </em>400 F.3d 744, 751 n. 7 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). We review only the BIA\u2019s holding under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(iii), and not the holding as Danielyan misstates it.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">This court applies a deferential \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of review to BIA determinations of eligibility for asylum. <em>Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir.2006); <em>see also INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We can reverse \u201conly if the applicant shows that the evidence <em>compels </em>the conclusion that the asylum decision was incorrect.\u201d <em>Gu, </em>454 F.3d at 1018. Danielyan testified that as a member of the Yerkrapah \u201cvolunteer platoon,\u201d he collected money from local businesses as part of a protection racket, threatened individuals who did not pay, observed as his associates beat noncompliant individuals, signed fraudulent documents related to forced sales, and maintained lists of businesses that paid protection money and \u201chad to be visited again.\u201d Danielyan\u2019s own testimony supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that there is serious reason to believe that he engaged in nonpolitical crimes, including \u201cnumerous acts of extortion with threats of bodily harm, forced sales of businesses, racketeering, and acting as an armed accomplice to aggravated battery and attempted murder.\u201d Danielyan has not demonstrated any link between these crimes and a political purpose. Therefore, there is substantial evidence to con-elude that he is statutorily ineligible for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(iii) and withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The temporary stay of removal issued by this court will remain in effect until the mandate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"pA9_\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
