We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006) and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">Samano-Ontiveros contends that his conviction under California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11351 was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights and therefore does not render him removable. We reject this contention, as we cannot collaterally revisit the circumstances of a conviction. <em>See Ortega de Robles v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1355, 1358 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cCriminal convictions cannot be collaterally attacked in deportation proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-19\">Samano-Ontiveros\u2019 due process contention is unpersuasive. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.10(e) (\u201cAt any time during the proceeding, additional or substituted charges ... may be lodged by the Service in writing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b506-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
