HALL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b51-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Darrick Washington (\u201cWashington\u201d) appeals from a judgment of the United States District Coui\u2019t for the Northern District of New York (McAvoy, J.). He pled guilty to possession of a firearm after being convicted of a felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), under an agreement that permitted him to appeal the district court\u2019s refusal to suppress the gun and ammunition found during a search. After increasing Washington\u2019s offense level because he had two previous felony convictions for crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) and 4B1.2, the court sentenced him principally to 84 months of incarceration. Washington appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion and its determination that a prior domestic assault conviction was a crime of violence. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case, as well as the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s ultimate determination of probable cause <em>de novo, </em>but reviews findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>452 F.3d 207, 211-12 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">The district court properly denied Washington\u2019s motion to suppress. \u201cProbable cause to arrest exists when the officers have knowledge of, or reasonably trustworthy information as to, facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested.\u201d <em>Zellner v. Summerlin, </em>494 F.3d 344, 368 (2d Cir.2007). \u201cWhen information is received from a putative victim or an eyewitness, probable cause exists, unless the circumstances raise doubt as to the person\u2019s veracity.\u201d <em>Curley v. Vill. of Suffern, </em>268 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir.2001) (citations omitted). Washington was stopped following a police report of a burglary in which the victim identified him by name and physical description as the perpetrator. Washington, himself, established the reliability of the victim\u2019s account when he admitted that he was involved in an \u201cincident\u201d on Second Street. Additionally, the district court properly found that due to the department\u2019s prior experience with Washington, the police officers had reason to believe that he was armed. Washington confirmed their suspicions when, in response to the officers\u2019 questioning about whether he was carrying a handgun or had one in his vehicle, he nervously stated that the vehicle he was driving was not his. Because the police had probable cause to arrest him, the handgun and ammunition were admissible as the result of a search incident to arrest. <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">Washington also claims that the district court incorrectly increased his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), after erroneously determining that his conviction for second degree aggravated domestic assault constituted a crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) increases a defendant\u2019s base offense level if the defendant \u201ccommitted any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of ... a crime of violence.\u201d For a prior conviction to be considered a crime of violence under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), which incorporates the definition provided in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a), the conviction must have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l). Washington disputes that his conviction meets this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">We review a district court\u2019s legal interpretations of the Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Jones, </em>415 F.3d 256, 260 (2d Cir.2005). The district court did not err in its interpretation of the Guidelines. It concluded, after reviewing the charging instrument, that Washington\u2019s conviction involved a crime of violence. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). The district court stated that even if second degree domestic aggravated assault is not \u201cper se\u201d a crime of violence, the charging instrument nonetheless supported a finding that Washington\u2019s conviction involved a violent crime. The criminal information charged that Washington committed the alleged crime by \u201crecklessly causing bodily injury to a family or household member ... by squeezing her arms.\u201d We agree that this conduct involves the use of physical force allowing for an enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We have reviewed Washington\u2019s remaining contentions and find them lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
