Kubicki (Kubicki) and his son, Joseph J. Kubicki, appeal the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of three Whitemarsh Township police officers. We will affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the facts and proceedings below, we will not revisit them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment only if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the officers are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Feesers, Inc. v. Michael Foods, Inc., </em>498 F.3d 206, 212 (3d Cir.2007). In reviewing the record below, we construe the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in the Kubickis\u2019 favor. <em>Michael Foods, </em>498 F.3d at 212. The substantive law of exigent circumstances and excessive force determines which facts are material.1 <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">Kubicki and his son argue that the officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights by entering their home without a warrant. A warrantless home entry is presumptively unconstitutional, but \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d can excuse the warrant requirement. <em>See Welsh v. Wisconsin, </em>466 U.S. 740, 749-50, 104 S.Ct. 2091, 80 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984). Where police officers assert exigency, they \u201creasonably must believe that someone is in <em>imminent </em>danger.\u201d <em>Parkhurst v. Trapp, </em>77 F.3d 707, 711 (3d Cir.1996) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-18\">Our review of the record reveals disputed facts regarding the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 belief that someone at 402 Roberts Avenue was in imminent danger. The Kubickis testified that it was quiet in their upstairs apartment, while the officers reported that they heard \u201can agitated male\u2019s voice coming from the second floor apartment.\u201d In addition, the Kubickis testified that they heard nothing downstairs (where they can usually \u201chear real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>good\u201d), while the officers asserted that a \u201cloud disturbance\u201d occurred that night in the first floor apartment. Finally, the Kubickis\u2019 testimony that they did not hear the police yelling until after they entered the otherwise quiet apartment contradicts the officers\u2019 testimony that they repeatedly knocked and announced before entering. Because these disputed facts are material to determining whether the officers reasonably believed that <em>exigent </em>circumstances existed, we must reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on this count. <em>See Couden v. Duffy, </em>446 F.3d 483, 493 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Kubicki next argues that the officers employed excessive force. Like the exigent circumstances inquiry, the excessive force inquiry asks \u201cwhether the officers\u2019 actions [were] \u2018objectively reasonable\u2019 in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them.\u201d <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). In assessing the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 actions, we account for the fact that they must make \u201csplit-second judgments \u2014 in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving \u2014 about the amount of force that is necessary.\u201d <em>Couden, </em>446 F.3d at 497 (quoting <em>Graham, </em>490 U.S. at 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Accepting Kubicki\u2019s version of the facts, we find the officers\u2019 belief that Kubicki posed a threat to them was objectively reasonable. Kubicki and his son testified that when the officers instructed Kubicki to put his hands behind his head, he put them behind his back instead. Based upon this disobedience, a reasonable officer would be justified in fearing that Kubicki was reaching for a weapon. We find the force employed to neutralize this threat reasonable and affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on this claim. <em>Scott v. Henrich, </em>39 F.3d 912, 915 (9th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">We have considered all of the contentions raised by the parties and conclude that no further discussion is necessary. The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\">. In light of our decision that material issues of fact are in dispute regarding the reasonableness of the warrantless entry, we do not reach the question of whether a constitutional violation occurred for purposes of qualified immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
