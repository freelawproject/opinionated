U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). A party\u2019s failure \u201cto elaborate or provide any citation of authority in support\u201d waives the argument for appellate purposes. <em>Flanigan\u2019s Enter., Inc. v. Fulton County, </em>242 F.3d 976, 987 n. 16 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">We conclude from the record that Lav-erde fails to adequately raise her asylum claim based on past persecution, or her withholding of removal and CAT relief claims in her appellate brief. We also conclude that she fails to sufficiently challenge the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was largely dispositive regarding her request for asylum. Accordingly, these issues are deemed abandoned, and Laverde\u2019s petition for review is denied in this respect. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2; <em>Flanigan\u2019s Enter., Inc., </em>242 F.3d at 987 n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">As a result, it is not necessary to decide whether the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was based on specific, cogent reasons or supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we analyze the remaining question of whether the IJ properly denied Laverde\u2019s claim for asylum based on a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the opinion of the IJ. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-16\">Factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we will affirm if the IJ\u2019s decision is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). In order to reverse the IJ\u2019s decision, we must conclude that the record compels reversal. <em>Niftaliev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir.2007) (involving <em>sua sponte </em>reconsideration of an earlier appeal). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>dence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">An adverse credibility determination alone may be the basis for denying an asylum application if the applicant produces no evidence other than her testimony. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. If the applicant produces evidence then it must also be considered by the IJ. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined in the INA as an individual who is unwilling or unable to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutory factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutory factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). Demonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution <em>\u201con account </em>of\u2019 a statutory factor. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">The asylum applicant does not need to show that she will be singled out for persecution if she establishes a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d in her country of \u201cpersecution of a group of persons similarly situated\u201d and a reasonable fear of persecution on account of a protected ground based on her inclusion in that group. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Persecution on account of political opinion refers to persecution based on the victim\u2019s political opinion, not persecution based on the persecutor\u2019s political opinion. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[E]vidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">Neither the INA nor the regulations define \u201cpersecution,\u201d but we have indicated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). \u201cNot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). For example, menacing telephone threats do not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. We have held that the cumulative effect of beatings, kidnaping, and threatening phone calls constituted past persecution. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 766 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">An applicant may establish a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d by demonstrating that her fear of future persecution is \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">Because Laverde\u2019s testimony was deemed to be not credible, it cannot be used to find that she had a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Laverde also submitted evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>however, including a written statement, a police report, and a Country Report, and the IJ was required to consider these materials. <em>See id. </em>The IJ did so, even though most of the evidence was not directly relevant to her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Although the IJ did not expressly consider whether the written statement and police report by themselves were grounds for granting her asylum claim, the IJ made clear that Laverde had failed to satisfy her burden of proof, noting, for example, that these documents were inconsistent with her testimony and that she had not provided medical documentation related to the kidnaping incident. Furthermore, the IJ specifically found that Laverde had failed to produce \u201csufficient and concrete evidence\u201d to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. Having reviewed the IJ\u2019s findings, we conclude that they are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Accordingly, we deny Laverde\u2019s Petition for Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-10\">. Although Laverde's husband and two children are also named as petitioners, their claims for asylum are based on derivative status. Accordingly, the petitioners will be collectively referred to as \"Laverde.\u201d Derivative status is unavailable under the withholding statute. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231; <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b936-18\">. In any event, we have independently reviewed the IJ\u2019s credibility determination and conclude, in the alternative, that it is supported here by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
