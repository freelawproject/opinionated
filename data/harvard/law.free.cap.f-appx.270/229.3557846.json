For the reasons set forth below, we will deny Amo-roso\u2019s consolidated petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">In an Order to Show Cause dated January 15, 1997, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service charged Amoroso with being deportable as a result of his conviction for distribution of cocaine. Amo-roso denied the allegation that he was deportable and he further challenged the allegation that he was a citizen of Italy, claiming United States citizenship. On February 2, 1998, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) issued an oral decision rejecting Amoroso\u2019s claim to United States citizenship and finding him to be a citizen of Italy. The IJ sustained the allegation regarding his conviction for cocaine distribution and found him deportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-16\">Amoroso sought a waiver pursuant to former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ found he lacked jurisdiction to consider Amoro-so\u2019s request for relief under \u00a7 212(c) and ordered his deportation to Italy. The BIA dismissed Amoroso\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision in an order dated December 6, 1999. Amoroso filed a petition for review with this court, which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on February 4, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-18\">On May 18, 2001, Amoroso filed with the BIA a motion to reopen, requesting that his proceedings be remanded for a bond hearing and to allow him to seek a stay of deportation. On June 21, 2001, the BIA denied Amoroso\u2019s motion as untimely. Amoroso was deported from the United States in early July 2001. In September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>2001, Amoroso reentered the United States unlawfully. He was apprehended in July 2004, and remains in federal custody awaiting trial for his unlawful reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On January 13, 2006, Amoroso filed a second motion to reopen his deportation proceedings pursuant to <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that he was eligible for a waiver under former \u00a7 212(c). On April 10, 2006, the BIA denied Amoroso\u2019s second motion to reopen, finding that it was untimely filed and it exceeded the numerical limitation for motions to reopen. Amoroso filed with this court a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s April 10, 2006, order denying his second motion to reopen, which was docketed at No. 06-2628.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">On May 4, 2006, Amoroso filed with the BIA a motion to reconsider its denial of his second motion to reopen, arguing that his prior counsel failed to advise him of \u201chis options regarding a <em>St. Cyr </em>based motion to reopen,\u201d and challenging the federal regulation promulgated following the <em>St. Cyr </em>decision, which imposed the deadline of April 26, 2005 to seek relief under former \u00a7 212(c). On September 11, 2006, the BIA denied Amoroso\u2019s motion to reconsider because it found no error of fact or law in its prior decision on his second motion to reopen. To the extent Amoroso claimed ineffective assistance of his prior counsel, the BIA held that he failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for bringing such a claim. Amoroso filed with this court a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s September 11, 2006, order denying his motion to reconsider, which was docketed at No. 06-4385 and consolidated with No. 06-2628.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">On September 11, 2006, the same day the BIA denied Amoroso\u2019s motion to reconsider, Amoroso filed a document entitled \u201cResponse to Government\u2019s Opposition\u201d to his motion to reconsider (the \u201cResponse\u201d), arguing that he had satisfied the <em>Lozada </em>requirements to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. However, nothing in the record indicates that the Government had filed an opposition to Amoroso\u2019s motion to reconsider. Because Amoroso\u2019s Response was filed the same day as the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion to reconsider, the BIA did not consider the Response in rendering its September 11, 2006, decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">Subsequently, on October 6, 2006, Amo-roso filed with the BIA a third motion to reopen, which was entitled <em>\u201cLozada </em>Motion to Reopen,\u201d alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel and eligibility for relief under <em>St. Cyr.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>By order dated December 18, 2006, 2006 WL 3922226, the BIA denied Amoroso\u2019s third motion to reopen, finding that <em>even if </em>Amoroso had satisfied the procedural requirements of <em>Lozada, </em>he could not demonstrate the necessary prejudice to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim because <em>St. Cyr </em>did not render him eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. The BIA further determined in the December 18, 2006, order that Amoroso\u2019s previous removal from the United States deprived it of jurisdiction to reopen his deportation proceedings. Amoroso did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>file a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s December 18, 2006, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We have jurisdiction to review final orders of the BIA under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. However, in cases such as this involving criminal aliens, the REAL ID Act restricts this court\u2019s jurisdiction to constitutional claims and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D); <em>see Papageor-giou v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 356, 358 (3d Cir.2005). Therefore, we may consider Amoroso\u2019s main contention on appeal that the BIA erred in denying his motions to reopen and reconsider, as well as his due process claim alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, which he asserted in his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Denials of motions to reopen or reconsider are within the discretion of the BIA. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Thus, we review the BIA\u2019s denial of Amoroso\u2019s second motion to reopen and his motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Borges v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 398, 404 (3d Cir. 2005). Under this standard, the BIA\u2019s decision will be upheld unless it was \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 562 (3d Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). However, we review <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s determination of an underlying procedural due process claim, such as its determination in the September 11, 2006, order denying Amoroso\u2019s motion to reconsider that he failed to comply with the procedural requirements to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See Fadiga v. Attorney General, </em>488 F.3d 142, 153 (3d Cir.2007) (holding that ineffective assistance of counsel claims in immigration proceedings are reviewed de novo). Finally, questions of law, such as whether the BIA applied the correct legal standard in considering the motions to reopen and reconsider also are reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 153-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Although we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Amoroso\u2019s second motion to reopen and his motion to reconsider the denial of that motion, we do not have jurisdiction to consider claims that were not properly brought before this court. As noted above, Amoroso did not file a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s December 18, 2006, order denying his third motion to reopen. Accordingly, we do not have jurisdiction to consider Amoroso\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim to the extent he relies on arguments and evidence submitted in his third motion to reopen, which was denied by the BIA in its December 18, 2006, order, nor do we have jurisdiction to consider Amoroso\u2019s argument that the BIA erred by holding in the December 18, 2006, order that it lacked jurisdiction to reopen his deportation proceedings because of his previous removal from the United States. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 395, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (holding that \u201cthe filing of the reconsideration motion does not toll the time to petition for review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Contrary to Amoroso\u2019s position, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying his second motion to reopen or his motion to reconsider the denial of that motion. Further, Amoroso has not established that the BIA violated his due process rights by rejecting his ineffective assistance of counsel claim which he asserted in his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">A motion to reopen must be filed within ninety days of the BIA\u2019s decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Here, Amoroso filed his second motion to reopen on January 13, 2006, which was over six years after the BIA\u2019s December 6, 1999, dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>al of his appeal of the I J\u2019s order finding he was deportable and denying his application for a waiver under former \u00a7 212(c). Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Amoroso\u2019s second motion to reopen as untimely. The BIA also correctly observed that Amoroso\u2019s second motion to reopen was not filed within ninety days of the Supreme Court\u2019s June 12, 2001, decision in <em>St. Cyr, </em>or by the April 26, 2005, deadline established by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(h) for special motions to seek \u00a7 212(c) relief for aliens subject to final orders of deportation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Further, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Amoroso\u2019s second motion to reopen based on the numerical bar under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) limiting the appellant to a single motion to reopen. <em>See id. </em>(stating that an alien may file only one motion to reopen deportation proceedings). Exceptions to this numerical limitation under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2 do not apply in Amoroso\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Likewise, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Amoroso\u2019s motion to reconsider. The BIA correctly determined in its September 11, 2006, order denying Amoroso\u2019s motion to reconsider that he failed to identify any error of fact or law in its earlier decision denying his second motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (requiring that a motion to reconsider \u201cstate the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision\u201d). Rather, Amoroso argued that reconsideration was warranted because his prior attorneys failed to advise him about \u201ca <em>St. Cyr </em>based motion to reopen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">To the extent Amoroso asserted that the BIA erred by failing to reopen his immigration proceedings due to the ineffective assistance of his prior attorneys, the BIA properly found in its September 11, 2006, order that Amoroso\u2019s second motion to reopen and motion to reconsider did not establish that he satisfied the requirements for bringing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In <em>Lozada, </em>the BIA laid out a three-step procedure for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel that would justify reopening.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The BIA correctly determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>that Amoroso\u2019s second motion to reopen did not establish ineffective assistance under <em>Lozada\u2019s </em>three-step procedure because he (1) failed to submit an affidavit detailing his agreements with his former attorneys and (2) failed to show that he filed complaints against either of them with appropriate disciplinary authorities, or explain why no complaints were filed. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reconsider its decision to deny reopening of Amoroso\u2019s immigration proceedings, and the BIA\u2019s rejection of Amoroso\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim did not violate Amoroso\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny Amoroso\u2019s consolidated petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s April 10, 2006, order denying his second motion to reopen his deportation proceedings and its September 11, 2006, order denying his motion to reconsider the denial of that motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-13\">. Former \u00a7 212(c) of the INA allowed the Attorney General to waive deportation for aliens under certain circumstances. In 1996, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\u201d). Section 440(d) of AEDPA amended \u00a7 212(c) by identifying a broad set of offenses for which convictions would preclude a waiver, including Amoroso\u2019s drug conviction. Also in 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIR-IRA\u201d). IIRIRA repealed \u00a7 212(c) relief altogether and replaced it with cancellation of removal, which was not available to aggravated felons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">. In <em>St. Cyr, </em>the Supreme Court held \u00a7 212(c) relief remains available for aliens \u201cwhose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d 533 U.S. at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-12\">. The arguments raised by Amoroso in his third motion to reopen, as well as the documents he submitted with that motion in support of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, were virtually identical to his September 11, 2006, Response.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">. Following the Supreme Court's decision in <em>St. Cyr, </em>the Executive Office for Immigration Review, pursuant to its authority delegated by the Attorney General, published a rule setting forth how requests for \u00a7 212(c) relief would be handled. The rule \u2014 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(h) \u2014 provides that \u201c[a]n alien subject to a final administrative order of deportation or removal must file a special motion to seek section 212(c) relief on or before April 26, 2005,\u201d which was 180 days from the October 28, 2004, effective date of the rule. On appeal, Amoroso argues that this provision, which places a time limit on filing a special motion for \u00a7 212(c) relief, constitutes an improper exercise of the Attorney General\u2019s regulatory authority and an impermissible implementation of the Supreme Court's holding in <em>St. Cyr. </em>We reject Amoroso's argument because \u00a7 1003.44(h) afforded aliens like Amoroso a sufficient window to raise a \u00a7 212(c) claim. <em>See Johnson v. Gonzales, </em>478 F.3d 795 (7th Cir.2007) (upholding the BIA\u2019s adherence to the deadline in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(h) on the grounds that \"the rule does not eliminate relief; it simply imposes a deadline for requesting relief, the sort of procedural limitation that is commonly found in the law\u201d and further finding that \"[t]he deadline does not directly contravene <em>St. Cyr\"). Id. </em>at 799.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b257-12\">. Under the <em>Lozada </em>procedure for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must (1) provide an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts regarding the detailed agreement entered into with former counsel, (2) inform former counsel of the allegations and allow him the opportunity to respond prior to presenting those allegations to the BIA, and (3) provide evidence that a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding the allegedly ineffective representation, and if not, the reason therefor. <em>Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 639. We have held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>that the BIA's three-step <em>Lozada </em>procedure is not an abuse of the BIA\u2019s discretion. <em>See Lu v. Ashcroft, </em>259 F.3d 127, 133 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
