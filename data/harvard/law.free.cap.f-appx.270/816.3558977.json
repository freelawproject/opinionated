Ibanez was found to be removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) because he was a criminal alien. Ibanez argues that the BIA should have held his case in abeyance or remanded for further fact finding based on a pending Freedom of Information Act request. Ibanez also argues that the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) relief for aliens convicted after a jury trial has an impermissible retroactive effect. Finally, Ibanez argues that distinguishing between aliens who pled guilty and aliens convicted after a jury trial violates his right to equal protection and due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>whether we have subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2007). In addition, we review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>with appropriate deference to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the statute in question. <em>See Sarmiento Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>381 F.3d 1277, 1279-80 (11th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). However, no deference is owed to the agency when the interpretation of the statute involves the retroactive application of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 1280. Finally, we review constitutional claims <em>de novo. Contreras-Rodrignez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>462 F.3d 1314, 1316 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">We first conclude that we lack jurisdiction to address Ibanez\u2019s claim that the Board should have granted his request to hold the administrative proceedings in abeyance. This court may not review \u201cany final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2) (A) (iii), that is, an alien removable for an aggravated felony offense. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). The only exception to the jurisdictional bar is that we may review constitutional claims and questions of law. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Because Ibanez is removable due to his convictions for aggravated felony drug offenses, we conclude that judicial review of the Board\u2019s discretional denial of his request to abate the proceedings is barred. <em>See Jean-Pierre v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>500 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Ibanez next argues that he had an expectation of the availability of a \u00a7 212(c) waiver when he went to trial in Tennessee, and that the waiver should remain available to him, notwithstanding Congress\u2019s repeal of \u00a7 212(c) in 1986. He is wrong. In <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), the Supreme Court held that the provisions that repealed discretionary relief from deportation under \u00a7 212(c) do not apply retroactively to an alien who pleaded guilty to criminal charges, in reliance on the possibility of \u00a7 212(c) relief, prior to the enactment of the repealer provisions. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 326, 121 S.Ct. at 2293. If an alien pleaded guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>to certain crimes before April 1,1997, he may file a motion to reopen his deportation proceedings in order to seek \u00a7 212(c) relief. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44. An alien is ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief if he was convicted of an aggravated felony, unless he was convicted between 1990 and 1996 and served less than five years of his sentence, or he was convicted pursuant to a guilty plea before 1990. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 1003.44(c), 1212.3(f)(4)(i)-(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">In <em>Alexandre v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>452 F.3d 1204 (11th Cir.2006), we concluded that \u00a7 212(c) relief is not available to aliens who were convicted after a trial instead of on a guilty plea. <em>Alexandre, </em>452 F.3d at 1207. Moreover, we have noted as consistent with <em>St. Cyr, </em>the distinction between aliens who pleaded guilty and those who proceeded to trial. <em>See Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1274 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">The overwhelming majority of circuit courts have held that there is no impermissible retroactive effect in \u00a7 212(c) relief which is not granted to someone who went to trial, because the person did not detrimentally rely on the availability of relief. Accordingly, we reject Ibanez\u2019s argument that he had an expectation of the availability of \u00a7 212(c) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Finally, we reject Ibanez\u2019s contention that distinguishing between aliens who are convicted after a trial and aliens who plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>guilty violates his right to due process or equal protection. <em>See Brooks, </em>283 F.3d at 1274 (citing <em>Femandez-Bernal v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the U.S., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1312 (11th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">For the above-stated reasons, we DISMISS the petition in part, and DENY the petition in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
