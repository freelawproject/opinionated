The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 37 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. As a special condition, the district court, over objection, ordered that he spend the first four months of supervised release in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>residential reentry center. Knuckles appeals, asserting a lack of jurisdiction and an abuse of discretion. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">This court reviews \u201cthe district court\u2019s imposition of special conditions of supervised release for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Smart, </em>472 F.3d 556, 558 (8th Cir.2006). A sentencing court may impose a condition of supervised release if, among other things, the condition \u201cinvolves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in section 3553(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2). These purposes are deterrence, protection of the public, and provision of necessary training or correctional treatment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2); <em>United States v. Camp, </em>410 F.3d 1042, 1045 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Knuckles argues that the district court abused its discretion because the condition deprives him of liberty to a greater degree than necessary, since a Bureau of Prisons policy favors placement in residential reentry centers toward the end of prison terms. The district court rejected this argument, stating, \u201cI realize that ordinarily they do that anyway, but they don\u2019t always____I just think in his case I want to make certain it is done, and I don\u2019t want it to be overlooked.\u201d The court cited the need for Knuckles to live in a stable and disciplined environment, where he could obtain employment and counseling before fully reintegrating into society. The court specifically noted his youth (19 years old at sentencing) and prior conviction for sexually molesting a child. The court clearly wanted Knuckles to receive the treatment necessary to rehabilitate and avoid committing future crimes, the purposes in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Knuckles also contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d) to impose residence at a reentry center as a condition of supervised release. To the contrary, \u201c \u00a7 3583(d) continues to include community-corrections confinement as a discretionary condition of supervised release.\u201d <em>United States v. Griner, </em>358 F.3d 979, 982 (8th Cir.2004). <em>See also United States v. Porter, </em>417 F.3d 914, 919 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201cCommunity confinement is a potential condition contemplated by the statute----\u201d). Therefore, this argument is foreclosed by precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-24\">.
