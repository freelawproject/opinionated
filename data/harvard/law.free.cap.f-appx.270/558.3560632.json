Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005). On remand, the district court reaffirmed the sentence previously imposed, finding that the sentence imposed was not materially different from the sentence that would have been given had the Court known that the guidelines were advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">A review of the record and the opening brief indicates that the questions raised in this appeal are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The district court carefully considered the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Further \u201creasonableness\u201d review by this court is not warranted. <em>See United States v. Combs, </em>470 F.3d 1294, 1297 (9th Cir.2006). Appellant\u2019s argument that he should have been allowed to allocute when the case was remanded for an <em>Ameline </em>inquiry is foreclosed by this court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Silva, </em>472 F.3d 683 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Accordingly, appellee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">All pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b582-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
