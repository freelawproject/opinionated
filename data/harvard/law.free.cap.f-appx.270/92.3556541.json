June 13, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A78 746 874 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 12, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-22\">When the BIA affirms the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-23\">As a preliminary matter, because Liu failed to challenge the agency\u2019s denial of his CAT claim before this Court, we deem any such arguments waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>We find it unnecessary to review the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination because we agree with its conclusion that, even if credible, Liu failed to carry his burden of proof as to asylum and withholding of removal. An alien may establish eligibility for asylum by demonstrating past persecution based on his or her own \u201cresistance\u201d to a coercive population control program or a well-founded fear that he or she will be subjected to persecution for such resistance. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 312-13 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)). The BIA has found that \u201cthe term \u2018resistance\u2019 covers a wide range of circumstances, including expressions of general opposition, attempts to interfere with enforcement of government policy in particular cases, and other <em>overt </em>forms of resistance to the requirements of the family planning law.\u201d <em>In re S-L-L- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1,10 (BIA 2006) (en banc) (emphasis added) <em>(quoted in Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 313).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We find no error in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Liu failed to demonstrate \u201cresistance\u201d to China\u2019s family planning policy. We note that Liu does not challenge the BIA\u2019s definition of the term \u201cresistance,\u201d only its application of the law to the facts of his case. The conclusory arguments contained in his brief do not sufficiently explain how his actions could be considered \u201cresistance\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Accordingly, the agency properly denied his asylum application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Because Liu was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 155 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Finally, the brief submitted on Yu\u2019s behalf by John Z. Zhang fails to comply with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and is otherwise of poor quality. Among other deficiencies, the brief cites, as the basis of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, a statute that says nothing about jurisdiction; includes a summary of the argument that merely states the issues presented; fails to note any standard of review; does not even mention the BIA\u2019s decision in this case; includes nearly no citations to legal authority; fails to discuss <em>Shi Liang Lin </em>or the \u201cresistance\u201d issue in any coherent fashion; and is riddled with grammatical errors. <em>Cf. </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">This is at least the fifth time that Zhang has submitted such inadequate briefing to this Court. <em>See Rui Rong Ni v. BIA, </em>214 Fed.Appx. 96, 98 n. 1 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Jin Bao Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>187 Fed.Appx. 56, 57 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Yun Shou Xie v. BIA, </em>186 Fed.Appx. 88, 91 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Chun Yan Gao v. BIA, </em>161 Fed.Appx. 87, 88 (2d Cir.2005). On the previous four occasions, the Court warned Zhang that subsequent failure to comply with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure could subject him to discipline. He has therefore had sufficient warning. The Court hereby refers the matter to the Court\u2019s Grievance Panel to take whatever measures it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\">. While Liu testified that he feared sterilization if returned to China, he failed to raise this assertion in his brief to the BIA on remand or in his brief to this Court. Accordingly, we deem any such argument abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 545 n. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
