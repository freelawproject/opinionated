Wyche, Jr. appeals the guideline sentence of 87 months\u2019 incarcera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tion imposed by United States District Judge Sylvia H. Rambo (\u201cthe District Court\u201d). The issue before this Court is the District Court\u2019s interpretation and application of <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237 (3d Cir.2006), relating to the 100:1 craek/powder cocaine ratio. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The pertinent facts are as follows. Over a two-week period, between January and February 2006, Wyche negotiated and sold 95 grams of crack cocaine to federal investigators in a total of four controlled transactions. On April 5, 2006, Wyche, his older sister, and her boyfriend were charged with conspiracy to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) determined that Wyche\u2019s base offense level was 32. The report added a two-point enhancement for Wyche\u2019s leadership role, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), and three points were subtracted for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b). The total offense level was set at 31 with a Criminal History Category of I; thus setting the Sentencing Guidelines range at 108 to 135 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Both Wyche and the government filed objections to the PSR. The parties reached an agreement whereby the government would not present evidence in support of the leadership enhancement (a two-level enhancement) and Wyche would not seek a safety valve downward departure (a two-level reduction) pursuant U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5). The District Court consequently omitted the two-point leadership enhancement. The adjusted level was 29, and with a Criminal History Category of I the Guideline range was 87-108 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">During the sentencing hearing, in addition to revealing the parties\u2019 agreement, Wyche argued that a sentence outside the Guidelines range would be appropriate in light of <em>Gunter, </em>which addressed the 100:1 crack to powder ratio. 462 F.3d 237. The District Court sentenced Wyche to 87 months\u2019 incarceration, explaining that its sentence was at the low end of the Guideline range for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">1) Within the a two-week period, investigators bought approximately 95 grams of crack cocaine from Wyche during four controlled buys;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">2) Wyche has a criminal history not reflected in his criminal history category, including a criminal adjudication for delivery of cocaine and possession with intent to deliver cocaine and five driving under suspension convictions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">3) Failure to consider that Wyche\u2019s criminal history would effectively treat him the same as a similarly situated defendant with no prior contact with the law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-13\">4) Wyche\u2019s prior criminal history raises the likelihood of recidivism;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-14\">5) Wyche had a somewhat difficult childhood;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-15\">6) Wyche benefitted greatly by the plea agreement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-16\">7) The Court considered \u201cthe ratio between crack and powder cocaine as a basis for sentencing at the low end of the guideline range.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-17\">On appeal, Wyche argues that his sentence should be vacated and remanded for resentencing. In sum, Wyche argues that his sentence does not meet the reasonableness standards required by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 226-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). While Wyche concedes that the sentence is at the low end of the applicable guideline range, he contends that where the sentence incorporates the crack cocaine Guideline, it is unreasonable. According to Wyche, the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gunter </em>and reports prepared by the United States Sentencing Commission explain that the 100:1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>crack/powder cocaine ratio fails to meet sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Wyche contends the record does not clearly indicate that the District Court understood and reasonably discharged its obligation to consider all relevant section 3553(a) factors in imposing its sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Applying a deferential standard, this Court will review the sentence by the District Court for reasonableness pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1). <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 327 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The District Court properly applied the three-step process set forth by this Court in <em>Gunter </em>and properly exercised its sentencing discretion. 462 F.3d 237. In <em>Gunter, </em>this Court explained two types of <em>Booker </em>errors: 1) reliance upon judge-found facts, other than prior convictions to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the statutory minimum, commonly referred to as \u201cconstitutional error\u201d; and 2) application of the Guidelines mandatorily, commonly referred to as \u201cnon-constitutional error.\u201d <em>Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 247. In the interests of avoiding these errors, this Court instructed district courts to follow a three-step sentencing process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">(1) Courts must continue to calculate a defendant\u2019s Guidelines sentence precisely as they would have before <em>Booker.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">(2) In doing so, district courts must \u201cformally rul[e] on the motions of both parties and stat[e] on the record whether they are granting a departure and how that departure affects the Guidelines calculation, and tak[e] into account [our] Circuit\u2019s <em>pre-Booker </em>case law which continues to have advisory force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">(3) Finally, district courts are required to \u201cexercise[ ] [their] discretion by considering the relevant [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors\u201d in setting a sentence regardless whether it varies from the sentence calculated under the Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 247 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-11\"><em>\u201cPost-Booker, </em>a sentencing court errs when it believes that it has no discretion to consider the crack/powder cocaine differential incorporated in the Guidelines \u2014 but not demanded by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) \u2014 -as simply advisory at step three of the post-Booker sentencing process (imposing the actual sentence after considering the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors)\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249. Here, no such error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">The District Court specifically stated its consideration of the disparity between crack and powder as a basis for sentencing on the low end of the Guidelines. However, it is under \u201cno obligation to impose a sentence below the Guidelines solely on the basis of the crack/powder cocaine differential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, contrary to Wyche\u2019s suggestion, the District Court is not required to \u201ccategorically reject\u201d the 100:1 ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">The record reflects that the District Court considered all relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
