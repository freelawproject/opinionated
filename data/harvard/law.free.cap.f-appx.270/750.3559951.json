Dominguez-Ramirez argues that the district court erred in (1) denying his motion to suppress evidence found at his house;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) calculating his advisory sentencing guidelines offense level based on a drug quantity determination that was unsupported by the evidence;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) applying an aggravating role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) that was unsupported by the evidence;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (4) failing to state adequate reasons for imposing a sen-fence in the middle of the advisory guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, in contravention of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (5) applying the advisory guidelines in a <em>defacto </em>mandatory fashion by imposing guidelines enhancements that were not charged in the indictment and not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">After review and oral argument, we conclude that each of Dominguez-Ramirez\u2019s claims on appeal lack merit, and that the district court committed no reversible error in denying Dominguez-Ramirez\u2019s amended motion to suppress or in sentencing Dominguez-Ramirez. Therefore, we affirm Dominguez-Ramirez\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-6\">. \"A district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>180 F.3d 1237, 1240 (11th Cir.1999). We review the district court's findings of fact for clear error and the district court's application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. Id. </em>The party challenging the validity of a search bears the burdens of proof and persuasion. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>133 F.3d 1394, 1398 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\">. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs used to establish a base offense level for sentencing purposes under the clearly erroneous standard.\" <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b775-8\">. A district court's determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a finding of fact that we review for clear error. <em>United States v.

A district court's compliance with \u00a7 3553(c)(1) is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v.

If a defendant preserves a constitutional objection to his sentence, we review the sentence <em>de novo </em>and vacate and remand only if there is harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). The parties dispute whether or not Dominguez-Ramirez preserved this argument before the district court. We need not resolve that dispute, however, because even under <em>de novo </em>review, the underlying argument is meritless. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300-01 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that extra-verdict enhancements are constitutional in an advisory guidelines system after <em>United States v.
