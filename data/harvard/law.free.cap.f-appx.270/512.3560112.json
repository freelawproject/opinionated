Shameem and Sharon Sabina Begum, all natives and citizens of Fiji, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing their appeal from an Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying their motion to reopen removal proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel (No. 06-70505), and the BIA\u2019s order denying their subsequent motion to reconsider (No. 06-71650). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of motions to reopen and reconsider. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d </em>785, 791 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than two years after the BIA\u2019s January 25, 2002 order. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.23(b)(1) (an alien seeking to reopen proceedings must file the motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision). Petitioners did not demonstrate that they exercised diligence in discovering their former counsel\u2019s errors. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2003) (equitable tolling is available to a petitioner who establishes that she suffered from deception, fraud or error, and exercised due diligence in discovering such circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because Petitioners did not demonstrate legal or factual error in the BIA\u2019s dismissal of their appeal. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004) (BIA\u2019s order denying motion to reconsider is reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [they were] prevented from reasonably presenting [them] case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b537-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
