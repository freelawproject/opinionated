Glacier contended it fired Head solely because he committed \u201cequipment abuse\u201d by submerging the loader, causing the loader potentially serious long-term damage. Head brought an action claiming, among other things, Glacier fired him in retaliation for Head\u2019s request Glacier reasonably accommodate Head\u2019s disability, depression and bipolar disorder. He claimed this firing was in violation of the American with Disabilities Act. After trial, a jury found that Head\u2019s request for an accommodation for his disability was a motivating factor in Glacier\u2019s decision to fire Head, and awarded him compensatory damages totaling $160,000. The district court then awarded Head attorneys\u2019 fees totaling $190,371.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Glacier appeals: (1) the district court\u2019s grant of Head\u2019s motion in limine excluding evidence of the \u201cultimate disposition\u201d of the loader, <em>i e., </em>that the loader was \u201ctotaled\u201d; (2) the district court\u2019s denial of Glacier\u2019s motion for a new trial; and (3) the district court\u2019s order awarding Head attorneys\u2019 fees. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence the loader was totaled. Glacier did not learn the full extent of the damage Head caused the loader until <em>after </em>it fired Head. Even assuming the evidence was relevant to Glacier\u2019s motivation at the time it fired Head, the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding it. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403 (\u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d). Glacier also contends the district court abused its discretion by excluding the evidence because it was relevant to the credibility of Glacier\u2019s witnesses. Specifically, the evidence would have rehabilitated Eric Muller and Mark Tougas, after Head challenged them testimony they fired Head because they believed Head had caused long-term damage to the loader. Glacier, however, did not re-offer the evidence at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Next, Glacier contends the district court abused its discretion by denying its motion for a new trial because there was no evidence the decision-maker for Head\u2019s discharge, Muller, was motivated by a discriminatory animus. There was, however, ample evidence Tougas was biased, and Glacier does not challenge this evidence on appeal. There also was evidence Tougas \u201cinfluenced or participated in the decision[-]making process,\u201d based on which a rational jury could conclude Tougas\u2019s discriminatory animus affected the employment decision. <em>Dominguez-Curry v. Nevada Transp. Dept., </em>424 F.3d 1027, 1039-40 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Head the lodestar amount of $190,371.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees. The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding Head\u2019s claims arose from a common core of facts and were intended to remedy a common course of conduct. <em>Odima v. Westin Tucson Hotel, </em>53 F.3d 1484, 1499 (9th Cir.1995). The district court also was within its discretion in assessing the extent of Head\u2019s success <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>and determining his success merited an award of the lodestar amount. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AhK\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
