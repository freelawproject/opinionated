After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">In 2002, Johnson pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least 5 kilograms of <em>cocaine, </em>in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii), 846 (Count 1), and one count of attempting to conduct a financial transaction affecting interstate commerce involving the proceeds gained from Count 1, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957(a). Johnson was sentenced to concurrent 87-month sentences on both counts, to be followed by five years of supervised release. Following a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 motion by the government for substantial assistance, Johnson\u2019s sentence was reduced to 70 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">On March 30, 2007, Johnson was released from prison and began his term of supervised release. The conditions of Johnson\u2019s supervised release included, among other things, that Johnson would: (1) \u201cnot commit another federal, state or local crime\u201d; (2) \u201cnot leave the judicial district without the permission of the court or the probation officer\u201d; and (3) \u201canswer truthfully all inquiries by the probation officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">On July 19, 2007, Johnson\u2019s probation officer filed a petition for a warrant alleging that Johnson had violated the terms of his supervised release. According to the petition, Johnson was arrested in Tennessee and charged with driving on a suspended license. When Johnson\u2019s probation officer questioned Johnson about this arrest, Johnson stated that he had traveled out of the district on an emergency concerning his daughter. However, this story conflicted with what Johnson told officers at the time of his arrest \u2014 that he was returning from Buffalo, New York. The petition charged Johnson with new criminal conduct, failure to answer the probation officer\u2019s questions truthfully and unauthorized travel outside the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">At the revocation hearing, Johnson admitted the violations. During the hearing it was revealed that, when Johnson was arrested in Tennessee, he was traveling with a woman named Charmane Porter and $12,000 was found in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-16\">Johnson called his fiancee, Adrai McConnell, to testify regarding the $12,000. McConnell testified that she was having financial difficulties and she and Johnson decided to sell jewelry Johnson had given her before his incarceration. McConnell and Johnson pawned some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>the jewelry, but Johnson told her he would find a pi\u2019ivate buyer for the remainder. After his Tennessee arrest, Johnson told McConnell that he had sold her jewelry to a man in New York and that the Tennessee authorities had confiscated the money. McConnell opined that the money found in the car must have been the proceeds of the sale of the rest of the jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">On cross-examination, McConnell said that she did not know Charmane Porter, the woman riding in Johnson\u2019s car when he was arrested. McConnell was also unaware that Porter had submitted a claim alleging that the money belonged to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Before the district court, Johnson explained that he drove to New York to sell McConnell\u2019s jewelry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Johnson stated that he took Porter along so she could drive. Johnson sold the jewelry for $12,000 to raise money to buy a truck so he could find work and ease his and McConnell\u2019s financial difficulties. Johnson admitted lying to the Tennessee officer who pulled him over about whose money it was because Johnson knew the money would raise a suspicion of drug proceeds. For this reason, Johnson asked Porter to claim the money as hers, which she did. Johnson also admitted lying to his probation officer because he was afraid his probation officer would think he was involved with drugs again.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">The district court found that Johnson violated the conditions of supervised release. The district court stated that it was \u201creally relying in particular on [charge] numbers 2 and 3, the failure to answer the [probation] officer\u2019s questions .truthfully and also the unauthorized travel.\u201d The district court noted that Johnson\u2019s explanation of what happened did not make sense and found that Johnson was lying about what actually happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">Although Johnson\u2019s advisory guidelines range was three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment, the government recommended a minimum of a twelve-month sentence. The district court concluded that the advisory guidelines range was not adequate and imposed a twelve-month sentence. Johnson filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">On appeal, Johnson argues that the twelve-month sentence imposed upon revocation of his supervised release was unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant violated a condition of supervised release, the district court may revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering various factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, The district court must also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>consider the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines, one of which provides recommended, non-binding ranges of imprisonment. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006). The sentencing court \u201cshall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of a particular sentence, and, if the sentence ... is outside the [guidelines] range, ... the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from that described. ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">With Grade C violations and a criminal history category of I, Johnson\u2019s recommended guidelines range under advisory Chapter 7 was three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.4(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Johnson\u2019s maximum statutory term of imprisonment upon revocation of supervised release was two years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">After reviewing the record and the briefs, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Johnson outside the advisory guidelines range or that the twelve-month sentence was unreasonable. Johnson admitted violating his supervised release by both leaving the district without permission and then lying to his probation officer about his reasons for doing so. Johnson, also continued to lie in court about what actually happened. Further, Johnson committed the violations less than three months after he was released from prison. Additionally, Johnson\u2019s twelve-month sentence is well below the two-year statutory maximum and the amount of the variance (three months upward) is relatively small.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">We also reject Johnson\u2019s argument that the district court imposed an above-guidelines sentence based merely on a hunch that Johnson was engaged in illegal activity. In asking for a sentence above the guidelines range, the government stressed that Johnson had never given a satisfactory explanation for traveling outside the district, having $12,000 in cash in his car or lying to both his probation officer and the Tennessee officer who arrested him. The government also emphasized that Johnson had been out of prison for only three months when he violated the conditions of his supervised release and engaged in \u201csketchy\u201d conduct. The government requested that the district court impose a sentence for \u201ca considerable period of time over and above\u201d the guidelines range and \u201cat least a year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">In imposing the sentence, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-11\">I\u2019m really relying in particular on [charge] numbers 2 and 3, the failure to answer the [probation] officer\u2019s questions truthfully and also the unauthorized travel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-12\">In addition to that, it seems to me that Mr. Johnson\u2019s explanation for what actually happened in this case just does not compute. It just does not make sense to me, and I believe that Mr. Johnson in fact is lying still about what actually happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-13\">Now, the custody guideline range here is three to nine months. I agree with the government that this guidelines range is not adequate. I\u2019m confident something fishy and illegal was going on here but I don\u2019t know what it was. So I\u2019m going to moderate the sentence, and I will accept the government\u2019s recommendation for a one-year sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">Considering the record as a whole, the district court imposed a sentence above the recommended range because it found Johnson was still lying about why he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>in Tennessee with $12,000, a credibility determination we will not disturb, <em>see United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994), and because the violations of his supervised release occurred so soon upon his release.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the district court believed Johnson was engaging in something \u201cfishy and illegal,\u201d it did not not base the variance on that belief because the district court expressly stated that it did not know what Johnson had been doing. Instead, the district court focused on the fact that Johnson continued to lie about what actually happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Furthermore, the district court\u2019s concern over Johnson\u2019s continued lack of truthfulness is consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s approach to violations of supervised release. The commentary to Chapter 7 instructs that the sentencing court \u201cshould sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust, while taking into account, to a limited degree, the seriousness of the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator.\u201d U.S.S.G. ch. 7, pt. A, introductory cmt. n. 3(b). Although Johnson characterizes his violations as \u201ctechnical,\u201d they go to the heart of whether the Probation Office and the district court can trust him on supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">For all these reasons, we affirm Johnson\u2019s twelve-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\">. The record does not show any oath administered to Johnson. Johnson simply makes statements in court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-8\">. Sentences imposed for violating a condition of supervised release are reviewed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). A district court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence above the range recommended by Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1239 (11th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s findings of fact with regard to violations of supervised release are binding unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b795-16\">. Factors the district court considers include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, the need to provide the defendant with education, medical care or treatment or other correctional treatment, the kinds of sentences and sentencing range, the pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\">. Johnson does not dispute the calculation of his advisory guidelines range of three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b797-9\">. We reject Johnson\u2019s argument that the district court did not discredit the testimony of McConnell, his fiancee. Although the district court did not single out McConnell's testimony and explicitly reject it, the district court found unbelievable Johnson\u2019s explanation for the $12,000, which was supported largely by McConnell\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
