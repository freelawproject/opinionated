The state court concluded that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to interview witness and victim William Hutchinson was not deficient representation because there had been no showing that this was anything other than a reasonable tactical decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">We must conclude that the record supports that conclusion, particularly in light of trial counsel\u2019s declaration before the district court explaining that Hutchinson had been hostile and uncooperative at the preliminary hearing and that counsel feared Hutchinson\u2019s testimony might have turned out to be damaging to Cruz. It was not an unreasonable application of federal law for the state court to hold that the facts failed to establish deficient representation. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b624-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publica-lion and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>by 9th Cir.
