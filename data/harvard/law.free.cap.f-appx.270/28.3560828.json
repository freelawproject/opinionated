He was sentenced principally to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by five years\u2019 supervised release. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">On appeal, Rodriguez argues that the district court committed procedural error in applying the cross-reference provisions contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l) and 2X1.1 to calculate the base offense level for his felon-in-possession of a firearm offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1, which applies to offenses involving \u201cunlawful restraint.\u201d He contends that his base level should not have been calculated under \u00a7 2A4.1 because he was not convicted of any crime involving unlawful restraint, and the factual record does not support the application of the unlawful restraint provision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">As an initial matter, because Rodriguez stipulated in his plea agreement to the application of \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l), 2X1.1, and 2A4.1; expressly argued to the district court that it should impose a sentence in accordance with his plea agreement; failed to object to the portion of the Probation Office\u2019s calculation that called for him to be sentenced under \u00a7 2A4.1; and conceded in his sentencing letter the facts supporting application of \u00a7 2A4.1, Rodriguez waived the right to appeal his sentence on this ground. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (explaining that where a claim has been waived through explicit abandonment, rather than forfeited through failure to object, plain error review is not available). Even were Rodriguez\u2019s claim not waived, however, we see no plain error in the district court\u2019s calculation. This Court has not yet addressed Rodriguez\u2019s contention that he cannot be sentenced under \u00a7 2A4.1 if he has not been convicted of an unlawful restraint offense. Every circuit to address the issue, however, has rejected Rodriguez\u2019s argument. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Flanagan, </em>339 F.3d 1229, 1232-35 (10th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Drew, </em>200 F.3d 871, 877-79 (D.C.Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Branch, </em>91 F.3d 699, 742-43 (5th Cir. 1996); <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>8 F.3d 1264, 1266-67 (8th Cir.1993). Thus, the error, if any, is not \u201cso plain [that] the trial judge and prosecutor were derelict in countenancing it, even absent the defendant\u2019s timely assistance in detecting it.\u201d <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 163, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982). Further, the facts alleged in Rodriguez\u2019s Pre-Sentence Report, which were adopted by the district court and not objected to by Rodriguez, provide sufficient evidence of non-consensual, unlawful restraint to support the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2A4.1. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>157 F.3d 46, 49-50 (2d Cir.1998) (noting that a district court may rely upon and incorporate into its judgment the factual assertions set forth in a pre-sentence report); <em>United States v. Romano, </em>825 F.2d 725, 728-29 (2d Cir.1987) (suggesting that, short of a full evidentiary hearing at the judge\u2019s discretion, \u201ca defendant may challenge pre-sentence information, <em>[inter alia, </em>] by offering written submissions [or by] directing argument to the court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Rodriguez also contends that the district court\u2019s sentence was substantively unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>sonable. We find no merit in Rodriguez\u2019s claim. We review his sentence for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006). At sentencing, the district court considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining the appropriate sentence and did not rely solely on the Guidelines, which it treated as advisory. Given the seriousness of the firearms and robbery offenses of which Rodriguez was convicted and the district court\u2019s finding that he had engaged in \u201ca repeated pattern of violent behavior,\u201d this is not one of those rare cases where a sentence within the Guidelines range is substantively unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 27 (\u201cWe recognize that in the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in particular circumstances.\u201d) Giving due respect to the district court\u2019s reasoned judgment, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594-96, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we reject Rodriguez\u2019s challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\">. Because the government does not seek to invoke the appellate waiver provision in the parties\u2019 plea agreement, we proceed to the merits of Rodriguez's appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
