Bacas appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Frances J. Harvey, Secretary of the Army (Secretary). Bacas, who was formerly a civilian army employee, alleges that he was discriminated against because of his age, his race, his national origin, and in retaliation for equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaints. Bacas asserts that because of this discrimination, the following adverse employment actions occurred: (1) his employment was terminated; (2) he was not promoted; (3) a written reprimand was placed in his file for taking unauthorized leave; and (4) he was subjected to a hostile environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Bacas raises two issues on appeal. First, he contends that the district court erred in finding that the Merit Systems Protection Board\u2019s (MSPB\u2019s) decision to uphold Bacas\u2019s removal was supported by substantial evidence. Second, Bacas argues that the district court inappropriately granted summary judgment on his employment discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">Because Bacas asserted his claims through the EEO process and through the MSPB process, this is a \u201cmixed case.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c), we review Bacas\u2019s discrimination claims raised before the MSPB de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our review of the MSPB\u2019s decision to uphold Bacas\u2019s termination is limited to the administrative record, and the MSPB\u2019s determinations must be upheld \u201cunless they are clearly arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-15\">The district court concluded that the decision to terminate Bacas was clearly supported by substantial evidence. We agree. Bacas filed inappropriate leave requests, filed frivolous complaints of workplace violence against his co-workers, and falsely claimed to the military police that his supervisor assaulted him. Given Bacas\u2019s actions, the MSPB\u2019s decision to terminate his employment was made to promote the efficiency of the service and is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">Bacas argues that the district court erred in concluding that there are no genuine issues of material fact with regard to his claim that discrimination caused the selection of another candidate rather than him for a facilities manager position, his receipt of a written reprimand for unauthorized leave, and the termination of his employment. To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for discrimination, Bacas must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he suffered an adverse employment decision; (3) he was qualified for the position sought or held; and (4) the position sought was filled by someone outside of the protected class or persons not in the protected class were treated more favorably.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Secretary can rebut Bacas\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action taken against Bacas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ba-cas may then rebut the Secretary\u2019s reason by proving (1) that the reason was merely a pretext for discrimination; or (2) \u201cthat the [Secretary\u2019s] reason, while true, is only one of the reasons for its conduct, and another motivating factor is [Bacas\u2019s] protected characteristic.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Bacas claims that the failure to promote him to a facilities manager\u2019s position was based on unlawful discrimination. Even assuming Bacas established a <em>prima facie </em>case in the selection of Christopher Snodgrass \u2014 a candidate not sharing Bacas\u2019s protected characteristics \u2014 for the facilities manager position, the Secretary has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for promoting Snodgrass. A selection board comprised of two officers reviewed Snodgrass\u2019s and Bacas\u2019s resumes, and concluded that Snodgrass was the best-qualified candidate because he had been a facilities manager in the past, had recent supervisory experience, and had recent health facility training. To prove those reasons were pretextual, as Bacas contends, he must show that he was clearly better qualified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Bacas asserts that he was clearly better qualified because he had a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree while Snodgrass was only a high school graduate. However, the facilities manager position did not require college education. Further, the selection board credited Bacas with superior educational credentials, but still recommended Snod-grass based upon a consideration of each candidate\u2019s overall qualifications. Accordingly, Bacas has not countered the Secretary\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for promoting Snodgrass in lieu of Bacas.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">Bacas fails to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case with regard to his having a written reprimand placed in his employment file for being absent without leave and for the termination of his employment. He fads to show anyone who engaged in similar misconduct being treated more favorably. Moreover, the Secretary has provided a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for reprimanding Bacas. Bacas was notified that he was considered absent without leave for September 3-6, 2002. Bacas did not submit any documentation to account for his absence during this time period. In fact, he only offers his own unsupported belief that the Secretary\u2019s reasons for the adverse employment actions were untrue. However, we have held \u201cthat an employee\u2019s subjective belief that he suffered an adverse employment action as a result of discrimination, without more, is not enough to survive a summary judgment motion, in the face of proof showing an adequate nondiscriminatory reason.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The district court also granted the Secretary summary judgment on Bacas\u2019s hostile work environment claim. Bacas only references the facts in his brief; he does not inform us of an error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the issue is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
