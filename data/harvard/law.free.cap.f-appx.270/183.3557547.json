For the reasons that follow, we will grant the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">Petitioner was born on August 4, 1982, in Fujian, China, and is a Chinese national. In 2000, she began dating Jian Xin Dan. Though they lived together, the couple was denied a marriage certificate because Petitioner was underage. Shortly after this, local \u201cfamily planning cadres\u201d told Petitioner that she was violating family planning policy and told her not to get pregnant. When Petitioner refused to comply with then* demands, they assaulted her boyfriend and escorted her to the local hospital where a doctor forcibly inserted an intrauterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d). In April 2001, officials told Petitioner to report for a gynecological exam. About a month earlier, her IUD had fallen out, and fearing that this would be discovered, Petitioner went into hiding. When the family planning cadres were unable to locate her, they threatened to destroy her home if she failed to report for her exam. In June 2001, Petitioner fled to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Donald V. Ferlise found Petitioner credible, but held that as a matter of law, she was not a \u201crefugee\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, but affirmed the decision of the IJ on the grounds that the harm alleged did not rise to the level of persecution required to qualify for relief. The BIA did not clearly address the question of whether Petitioner was a \u201crefugee.\u201d On September 21, 2006, Petitioner timely filed the petition presently before us.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">We have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal under 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u00a7 1252. Where the BIA adopts some of the findings of the IJ and makes additional determinations as well, we will review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>Santana Gonzalez v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>506 F.3d 274, 276 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">We review legal determinations of the BIA <em>de novo. Escobar v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 363, 365 (3d Cir.2005). Such <em>de novo </em>review of the BIA\u2019s legal determinations is \u201csubject to established principles of deference\u201d as explained by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), and as interpreted by this Court. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 347, 349 (3d Cir.2004). Whether a petitioner has established past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution is a question of fact, and must be upheld if supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in the record. <em>Yu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 346, 348 (3d Cir.2008). We treat the BIA\u2019s findings of fact as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 167 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">On appeal, Petitioner argues (1) that the IUD insertion, threats, and other actions taken against her, are harmful enough to \u201crise to the level of persecution\u201d and (2) that this harm was on account of a \u201cprotected ground,\u201d in this case political opinion, because her resistance to the insertion of the IUD satisfies the \u201cother resistance\u201d prong of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). Both (1) and (2) must be satisfied for Petitioner to prevail. <em>Konan, </em>432 F.3d at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">Asylum or withholding of removal can only be granted to a \u201crefugee,\u201d defined as a person unable or unwilling to return to her own country \u201cbecause of past persecution or because of a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 271 (2002)). In order to make out a claim for relief, an applicant must demonstrate (1) an act or acts of harm that rises to the level of persecution; (2) that is \u201con account of\u2019 one of the statutorily-protected grounds; and (3) is committed by the government or forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">It is a petitioner\u2019s burden to establish that the harm alleged \u201crises to the level of persecution.\u201d Persecution includes \u201cthreats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.\u201d <em>Yu, </em>513 F.3d at 348. Persecution \u201cdoes not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Fatin v. I.N.S., </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 <em>&amp; </em>n. 10 (3d Cir.1993). A law or practice must be \u201cextreme\u201d in nature to rise to the level of persecution. <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 221, 231 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">An applicant must also show that the persecution she alleges was on account of a \u201cprotected ground.\u201d <em>Lukwago, </em>329 F.3d at 167. Pursuant to a 1996 amendment of the INA, one of the ways an applicant may establish a \u201cprotected ground\u201d is by showing that she was required to abort a pregnancy, was forcibly sterilized, or \u201cfor other resistance to a coercive population control program.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The IJ denied Petitioner\u2019s claim as a matter of law because he was \u201cunwilling to expand the definition of refugee to an individual who is unwillingly made to wear an IUD.\u201d Petitioner appealed this decision to the BIA, which quoted the IJ\u2019s language, as well as the \u201cother resistance to a coercive population control program\u201d language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). However, the BIA did not expressly adopt or repudiate the IJ\u2019s determination that a petitioner who had an IUD forcibly inserted could not qualify as a \u201crefugee\u201d for \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s coercive population control policy. Instead, the BIA relied on a alternate ground, finding that as a factual matter, the level of harm alleged by Petitioner did not \u201crise to the level of persecution,\u201d relying on <em>Fatin, </em>12 F.3d at 1240. The BIA acknowledged that forcible insertion of an IUD was an \u201coffensive intrusion into the private sphere of life\u201d that caused \u201csome harm.\u201d It went on to state that while forcible IUD insertion could \u201cunder some set of circumstances not before us\u201d constitute persecution, the harm here did not \u201cl\u00e1se to the level of persecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">While our standard of review is \u201cextraordinarily\u201d deferential to the BIA, \u201cthe availability of judicial review (which is specifically provided in the INA) necessarily contemplates something for us to review.\u201d <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 555 (3d Cir.2001). When the BIA fails to adequately explain its reasoning, such that it becomes \u201cimpossible for us to review its rationale,\u201d we will vacate and remand for further explanation of the decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Here, the BIA states, in conclusory fashion, that Petitioner suffered \u201csome harm,\u201d but that it was not \u201csufficient to rise to the level of persecution.\u201d Instead of providing an explanation for this conclusion, the BIA cursorily asserts that insertion of an IUD could under \u201csome set of circumstances\u201d create a harm rising to the level of persecution, but just not in the present case. The BIA does not give any further explanation of how the present case is insufficient, or what \u201cset of circumstances\u201d might raise a forcible IUD insertion to the level of persecution. The BIA does not state with specificity which facts it considered in reaching its decision that the level of harm was not sufficient to be considered persecution. The BIA did not support its decision by pointing to other hypothetical scenarios and distinguishing them from the instant case. Without such examples or explanation, we cannot meaningfully review the BIA\u2019s finding that the instant case falls short of its criteria for persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Because a dearth of explanation and reasoning \u201cmakes it impossible to meaningfully review this decision,\u201d we will vacate and remand \u201cso that the BIA can further explain its reasoning.\u201d <em>Konan, </em>432 F.3d at 502 (citations omitted). We take no position on \u201cwhether substantial evidence <em>could </em>support\u201d a finding in this particular case that forcible IUD insertion, threats, and other alleged harms did not \u201crise to the level\u201d of persecution, but rather \u201cleave [that] task to the BIA\u201d to determine afresh. <em>Id. </em>at 502 n. 3. Although Petitioner asks us reach the merits of this issue, in observation of our well-established principles of deference, we will allow the agency an opportunity to revisit this issue and explain its decision in full. <em>See, e.g., Butt v. Gonzales, </em>429 F.3d 430, 438 (3d Cir. 2005) (\u201c[Although Butt asks us also to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>rule in his favor on the merits of his asylum claim, we decline his invitation in order to allow the agency the opportunity to review the substance of that claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">On remand, the BIA should therefore (1) reconsider whether the harm alleged rises to the level of persecution, explaining its reasoning in detail, as discussed <em>supra. </em>Upon remand, the BIA should also (2) determine whether an applicant who is forcibly inserted with an IUD, and who subsequently flees the country to seek asylum in the United States, can satisfy the \u201cprotected ground\u201d requirement via \u201cother resistance to a coercive population control program\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the BIA\u2019s decision never clearly addresses this issue, it should be addressed on remand. <em>Kouan, </em>482 F.3d at 502 (\u201c[i]f the BIA failed to consider [a petitioner's claim of persecution based on [a particular protected ground], the case must be remanded.\u201d (citing <em>Vente v. Gonzales, </em>415 F.3d 296 (3d Cir.2005))).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we -will grant the petition with respect to the asylum and withholding of removal claims, vacate the BIA\u2019s order, and remand for further consideration consistent with this opinion. We will deny the petition with respect to the CAT claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-12\">. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Petitioner's CAT claim on the grounds that she had not shown that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if returned to China. While Petitioner does request CAT relief, her brief barely mentions this claim and never explains why the IJ or the BIA erred in their determinations. Where a petitioner \u201cdoes not press [a CAT] claim[] on appeal\u201d we will therefore \"deem th[e] claim[ ] waived.\u201d <em>Konan v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 497, 500 &amp; n. 2 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-8\">. The full text of this amendment reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">For purposes of determinations under this chapter, a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure <em>or for other resistance to a coer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>cive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, </em>and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, \u00a7 601(a)(1), Pub.L.

Although this question has been addressed to varying extents by our sister circuits, <em>see Yang v.

Appx. 486, 488 (3d Cir.2004) (remanding to the BIA in part because \"[a]s to the forced implantation of the IUD, the government concedes before this court that the Board and the Circuit Courts have not specifically addressed whether a woman who unwillingly acquiesced to obtaining an IUD has been persecuted [under the \u2018other resistance\u2019 clause].\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)) (nonpre-cedential). Because Petitioner\u2019s brief before the BIA argued that she had suffered past persecution \"from the coercive birth control policy,\u201d this claim was properly before the BIA and should have been addressed in its decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
