For the reasons stated below, the Petition for Review will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">A citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Wu lived in Fuzhou, China for his entire life prior to his arrival in the United States. While living in China, Wu married his first wife and had one child. When Wu\u2019s first wife became pregnant a second time, in violation of China\u2019s family planning laws, the authorities allegedly aborted the baby. After the abortion, Wu and his first wife lost them jobs. After one to two weeks of an unsuccessful job search, Wu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>fled alone to Brazil and then to the United States. While in the United States, Wu received a divorce from his first wife, remarried, and had three children with his second wife. Wu now contends that he would be coercively sterilized by the Chinese government if he returned to China because he has a total of four children, in violation of Chinese birth control law.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">On August 30, 2005, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Wu\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT and dismissed Wu\u2019s appeal. The BIA found, <em>inter alia, </em>that, even assuming Wu was credible, he had not established that he had suffered past persecution, nor did he establish an objectively reasonable well-founded fear of future persecution. Wu filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">While that appeal was pending, we remanded the case to the BIA for consideration of Wu\u2019s application for adjustment of status in light of our decision in <em>Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>422 F.3d 98 (3d Cir.2005). The BIA denied Wu\u2019s motion to remand to the IJ for lack of jurisdiction. Wu appealed that decision as well, and the two appeals have been consolidated for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under a substantial evidence standard. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Senathirajah v. INS, </em>157 F.3d 210, 216 (3d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Turc-ios v. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1396, 1398 (9th Cir. 1987)). The BIA\u2019s determination will not be disturbed unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">I. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">In order to be eligible for asylum, an alien has the burden to establish that he or she is a \u201crefugee,\u201d as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). An asylum applicant may qualify as a refugee \u201ceither because he or she has suffered past persecution or because he or she has a well-founded fear of future persecution\u201d on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b). If an applicant can establish past persecution on account of a protected ground, there is \u201ca rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, as long as that fear is related to the past persecution.\u201d <em>Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 174 (3d Cir. 2003); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). This presumption may be rebutted if the Government proves by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) \u201c[tjhere has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d; <em>or </em>(2) \u201c[t]he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality ... and ... it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i); <em>see also Shardar v. Attorney General, </em>503 F.3d 308, 312-13 (3d Cir.2007). If an applicant cannot establish past persecution, he <em>or she </em>bears the burden of establishing a \u201csubjective fear of [future] persecution that is supported by objective evidence that persecution is a reasonable possibility.\u201d <em>Lukioago, </em>329 F.3d at 175 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">A. Past Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">In his petition for review before this Court, Wu argues that he \u201chas suffered past persecution and is eligible for the relief of asylum as a spouse of [a] victim ... because he was legally married to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ex-wife at the time when she was forcibly aborted by the Chinese government.\u201d (Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. 26.) In his appeal to the BIA, however, Wu explicitly disavowed any reliance upon past persecution as a basis for his asylum application. As stated in his brief on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">It is clear from Respondent husband\u2019s testimony and his written affidavit for asylum that Respondent husband and his wife\u2019s asylum application is based on a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of the coercive birth control policy of China <em>only, </em>as the first sentence in Respondent husband\u2019s amended affidavit reads, \u201cI apply for political asylum because I fear that I will be persecuted by the coercive family planning policy if I were to return to China.\u201d It is also clear that Respondent husband did not intend to apply for asylum based on the forcible abortion of his ex-wife in China as he freely admitted in his asylum application and to the Court he has divorced his ex-wife in 1994 and that his only fear was either he or his wife would be sterilized upon returned [sic] because they have four children. In this sense, Respondent husband\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s forcible abortion is not material to Respondent\u2019s asylum application though it may be relevant to the subjective fear of Respondent husband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">(App. 44-45 (emphasis in original).)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Despite Wu\u2019s intent not to rely on past persecution as a ground for asylum, the BIA nonetheless considered it as a potential argument, but rejected that argument on its merits. While the BIA held in <em>Matter of C-Y-Z-, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 915 (BIA 1997), that an alien whose spouse was forced to undergo an abortion or sterilization procedure can establish past persecution under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), the BIA declined to extend this decision to ex-spouses. According to the BIA, \u201c[n]either the [INA], nor our case law extends protection to individuals based solely on their prior spousal relationship to a woman who was forcibly aborted.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (App.34.) On the record before us, we find no reason to disturb the BIA\u2019s decision in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">B. Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">To succeed under the second prong of the asylum analysis, Wu has the burden to establish \u201ca well-founded fear of persecution,\u201d which encompasses \u201cthreats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom,\u201d including forced sterilization. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>Yu v. Attorney General, </em>513 F.3d 346, 347-48 (3d Cir.2008); <em>Fatin v. I.N.S., </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993). Specifically, Wu must demonstrate \u201ca subjective fear ... that is supported by objective evidence that persecution is a reasonable possibility.\u201d Bal<em>asubramanrim v. I.N.S., </em>143 F.3d 157, 165 (3d Cir.1998). The BIA is charged with determining whether or not Wu has made this showing; our role is only to ascertain whether the BIA\u2019s conclusion is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Yu, </em>513 F.3d at 347-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Our recent decision in <em>Yu, </em>containing facts analogous to those of the instant case, governs the issues raised here. In <em>Yu, </em>two petitioners, a husband and wife from China\u2019s Fujian providence, sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT based on their fear that one or both of them would be forcibly sterilized for violating China\u2019s family planning regime were they made to return. <em>Yu, </em>513 F.3d at 347-48. The <em>Yu </em>couple alleged that they were at risk because they had a second child while residing in the United States and relied, almost exclusively, on an affidavit prepared by retired demographer Dr. John Aird in order to prove the objective reasonableness of their claimed fear of sterilization. Analogous to the situation in <em>Yu, </em>Wu relies heavily on an affidavit by Villanova Law Professor Joseph W. Dellapenna and on several news articles to support the contention that the Fujian Province strictly enforces China\u2019s coercive birth control policy. However, as in <em>Yu, </em>the record here contains the 2004 State Department Country Report for China \u2014 which rejects the notion that returning Chinese citizens face persecution if they have multiple children outside the country. We have \u201crepeatedly recognized that State Department reports may constitute substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Yu, </em>513 F.3d at 349. After a review of the record before it, the BIA determined that Wu \u201chas not sustained his burden of proving eligibility for relief in the form of asylum.\u201d (App.34.) Considering the record as a whole, we cannot say that the BIA\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Also like the petitioner in <em>Yu, </em>Wu argues that the BIA\u2019s assessment of the objective reasonableness of his fear contradicts <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556 (3d Cir.2004). In <em>Guo, </em>the Third Circuit reversed a BIA refusal to grant a petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen her asylum proceeding predicated on her claimed fear of future persecution due to multiple children she gave birth to in the United States; the motion to reopen was based upon the submission by the petitioner of an affidavit written by a \u201cspecialist on demographic development and population policy in China.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Wu cannot make the same procedural claim that the <em>Guo </em>petitioner made, however. As we recognized in <em>Yu, Guo </em>is distinguishable because the issue before the BIA in that case was whether the petitioner had made a prima facie showing for reopening. Here, as in <em>Yu, </em>the issue is whether the petitioners have carried their \u201cultimate burden of persuasion in making an asylum claim.\u201d <em>Yu, </em>513 F.3d at 349. The BIA found that they did not, and we conclude that this finding was supported by substantial evidence \u201con the record considered as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Balasubraman-rim, </em>143 F.3d at 161 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">II. Withholding of Removal and the CAT</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Because the threshold for asylum is lower than the threshold for protection under the withholding of removal and CAT provisions, our rejection of Wu\u2019s asylum claim \u201cnecessarily requires\u201d that we reject his withholding and CAT claims as well. <em>See, e.g., Yu, </em>513 F.3d at 349. As no additional analysis is required, we need proceed no further with a discussion of these claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>III. Wu\u2019s Claim for Adjustment of Status</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Wu claims that the BIA improperly denied his request for a remand to the IJ to adjudicate his application for an adjustment of status. The BIA explained that \u201c[w]hile this case was pending before us on remand, amendments to the regulations regarding the availability of adjustment of status for arriving aliens in removal proceedings were promulgated.\u201d (App. 3 (citing 71 Fed.Reg. 27,585-592 (May 12, 2006) (now codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii))).) The amended regulations make clear that, unless certain criteria are met, \u201cthe immigration judge does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate any application for adjustment of status filed by the arriving alien.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii). According to the BIA, these new amendments \u201care applicable to all cases pending administrative or judicial review on or after May 12, 2006.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Wu contends (in a conclusory fashion) that his case \u201cshould be grandfathered from the Interim Regulations ... and remanded to the Immigration Court.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. 31-32.) Finding no legal basis for this contention, we are not so convinced. Accordingly, Wu and his wife must pursue any applications for status with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, independent of their removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the Petition for Review will be DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ahv\">. Wu's wife, Hui Chen, originally filed an I-589 asylum application on her own behalf, but has since withdrawn that application and is now proceeding as a derivative under Wu\u2019s application. Thus, although there are two petitioners, we refer throughout this opinion only to Wu, as he is the lead petitioner in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-16\">. As we write for the benefit of the parties alone, we need not set forth a lengthy recitation of the facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\">. The BIA reaffirmed this position in <em>Matter of S-L-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1 (BIA 2006), refusing to extend <em>C-Y-Z- </em>to boyfriends or fianc\u00e9s and limiting its holding \"to applicants who <em>are </em>legally married under Chinese law.\" <em>Id. </em>at 4 (emphasis added); <em>cf. Zhuang </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>471 F.3d 884, 890 (8th Cir.2006) (noting that the court is \"unaware of any authority that expands this doctrine to cover a former spouse\u2019s involuntary sterilization, even if the sterilization was performed while the couple was married\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\">. Wu's reliance on the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Yang v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 1117 (8th Cir.2005), and the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109 (2d Cir.2006), does not affect our conclusion in this regard, as those cases are distinguishable on their facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b239-11\">. To the extent that Wu\u2019s CAT claim is based on his allegedly unlawful escape from China, we agree with the BIA that Wu cannot sustain his burden of proving that he will more likely than not be tortured \u2014 as defined in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a) \u2014 upon his return to China. The 2004 State Department report (China: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>which is part of the administrative record in this case and upon which the BIA relied, supports this conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\">. Wu does not meet the criteria set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii), which would permit the Immigration Court to review his adjustment of status application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b240-10\">STAPLETON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGf\">concurring and dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The BIA, interpreting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B), has held that \u201cforced sterilization of one spouse ... is an act of persecution against the other spouse\u201d because it \u201cnaturally and predictably has a profound impact on both parties to the marriage.\u201d <em>Matter of C-Y-Z, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 915 (BIA 1997). Under this ruling, it would appear that Wu suffered past persecution beginning at the time of his wife\u2019s forced abortion. Without some further explanation of the BIA\u2019s decision that Wu has not experienced past discrimination, it is impossible for this Court to determine whether the ruling in this case is consistent with that in <em>Matter of C-Y-Z </em>or is an arbitrary and capricious deviation from it. Because we are responsible for making that determination, I would remand this matter to the BIA in order to secure a statement of the rationale behind its disposition of the past persecution issue. <em>Smriko v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 279, 291 (3d Cir.2004).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b240-13\">. Because the BIA chose to address the past persecution issue, Wu has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to it, and I find it properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
