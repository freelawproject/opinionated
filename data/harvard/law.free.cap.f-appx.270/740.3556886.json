R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-20\">Defendant-Appellant Jose Manuel Ramirez-Santos pleaded guilty to a single count of illegal re-entry by a removed alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) &amp; (b). The district court sentenced him to twenty-one months\u2019 imprisonment followed by two years\u2019 supervised release. On appeal, Mr. Ramirez-Santos\u2019s counsel has filed a brief arguing that there are no legally viable issues for appeal in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). The government has declined to file a response. Mr. Ramirez-Santos was served with copies of the briefs and has failed to respond. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we dismiss the appeal and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-21\">On January 31, 2007, Mr. Ramirez-Santos was charged by information with one count of illegal re-entry of a removed alien. He pleaded guilty that same day. The pre-sentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated that Mr. Ramirez-Santos had an adjusted offense level of 10 and a criminal history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>category of V, resulting in an advisory Guidelines range of twenty-one to twenty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. A sentencing hearing was held on April 16, 2007. Counsel for Mr. Ramirez-Santos and the prosecutor both agreed with the PSR\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines range. However, Mr. Ramirez-Santos\u2019s counsel argued that because Mr. Ramirez-Santos was sentenced to only ninety-eight days\u2019 imprisonment on his prior felony conviction, the conviction was not serious and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) therefore supported a below-Guidelines sentence. Mr. Ramirez-Santos declined the district court\u2019s invitation to speak on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The district court disagreed with Mr. Ramirez-Santos\u2019s argument that his prior felony conviction was not serious, noting that Mr. Ramirez-Santos had immediately violated the conditions of his release after serving his term of imprisonment on that conviction. The court also noted that Mr. Ramirez-Santos had a long arrest record for his age, as well as several different aliases, birth dates, and Social Security numbers. Based on the Guidelines range and its weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed a sentence of twenty-one months, at the bottom of the advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Under <em>Anders, </em>a court-appointed defense counsel who believes an appeal would be \u201cwholly frivolous\u201d may</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">submit a brief to the client and the appellate court indicating any potential appealable issues based on the record. The client may then choose to submit arguments to the court. The Court must then conduct a full examination of the record to determine whether defendant\u2019s claims are wholly frivolous. If the court concludes after such an examination that the appeal is frivolous, it may grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and may dismiss the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-8\"><em>United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">We agree with counsel that there are no potentially meritorious issues on appeal. Mr. Ramirez-Santos seeks to challenge only the length of his sentence. Prior to pleading guilty, he was advised of the sentence that could be imposed for his conduct, and there is no reason to believe that his plea was not knowing and voluntary. <em>See Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755-56, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">We review Mr. Ramirez-Santos\u2019s sentence for both procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Conlan, </em>500 F.3d 1167, 1169 (10th Cir.2007). \u201cProcedural reasonableness involves using the proper method to calculate the sentence,\u201d while \u201c[s]ubstantive reasonableness involves whether the length of the sentence is reasonable given all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court has significant discretion in sentencing, and we will not disturb its judgment absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">There is no indication that Mr. Ramirez-Santos\u2019s sentence was improperly calculated or that its length was substantively unreasonable. Mr. Ramirez-Santos did not dispute any of the salient facts contained in the PSR, which the court used to calculate the Guidelines range. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(A) (permitting a sentencing court to \u201caccept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact\u201d). The court explicitly considered and applied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Geiner, </em>498 F.3d 1104, 1107 (10th Cir.2007) (holding that sentence reflecting a proper Guidelines calculation and application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors is procedurally reasonable). The district court sentenced Mr. Ramirez-Santos at the bottom of the presumptively reasonable Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1054 (10th Cir.2006); <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462-63. The district court\u2019s explanations for imposing the sentence it chose were adequately reasoned, and Mr. Ramirez-Santos has offered no evidence to counter the presumption of reasonableness we give his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Having considered Mr. Ramirez-Santos\u2019s sentence, we find no abuse of discretion in the twenty-one-month sentence imposed. We therefore DISMISS this appeal and GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b764-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
