R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b623-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Petitioner Jorge Rochel-Romero, a citizen and native of Mexico, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Denial of a motion to reopen deportation proceedings is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000). RochelRomero no longer challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen on the ground of new evidence. Instead, he now argues that remand is appropriate because the BIA misapplied 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2 in denying his motion to reopen. Such a legal argument should be presented to the BIA in the form of a motion to reconsider, not in a motion to reopen. A motion to reopen should be based upon alleged new facts that bear upon the agency\u2019s earlier decision. <em>See Ghahremani v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 993, 997 n. 1 (9th Cir.2007) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1), (c)(1)). The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it refused to grant the motion to reopen to consider Rochel-Romero\u2019s legal argument. <em>See Membreno v. Gonzales, </em>425 F.3d 1227, 1229-30 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). Also, we cannot construe Rochel-Romero\u2019s motion to reopen as a motion to reconsider because it would not be timely. His motion was filed well beyond the thirty day period set in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2) for filing a motion to reconsider. <em>See Membreno, </em>425 F.3d at 1230 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Rochel-Romero\u2019s argument that his conviction for solicitation of burglary is not a crime involving moral turpitude under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). An order of removal \u201cis final, and reviewable, when issued.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). A petition for review must be filed within thirty days of the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.G. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>see also Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003). Rochel-Romero did not petition for review of the BIA\u2019s May 27, 2004, order dismissing his appeal, and his motion to reopen, filed on August 27, 2004, did not toll the time he had to petition for review. <em>See Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537 (explaining that the finality of an order of removal \u201cis not affected by the subsequent filing of a motion to reconsider.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
