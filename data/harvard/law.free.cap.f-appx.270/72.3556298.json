Jan. 31, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A76 858 009 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 24, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">When, as in this case, the BIA adopts \u201cthe IJ\u2019s conclusion that an asylum applicant is not credible and emphasizes particular aspects of the IJ\u2019s decision! ], we review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s opinions.\u201d <em>Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). We review an IJ\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). Our review of credibility determinations is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>See Ming Xia Chen, </em>435 F.3d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The record reflects that Doe never reported her alleged abuses and refused to provide details regarding who her assailants were, even though she admitted knowing the identity of at least some of these individuals. Doe also claims to have spent time in a hospital in Australia to treat her injuries, yet she was unable to produce medical records of any kind. Further, the country conditions evidence in the record contradicts Doe\u2019s assertion that the Australian government could or would not seek to identify and punish organized child abusers who harm outspoken victims. For example, the State Department Report for Australia establishes that the government has enacted \u201ctough criminal laws aimed at restricting the trade in, and possession of, child pornography.\u201d The agency therefore properly denied asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because the only evidence that Doe would be persecuted or tortured depended on her credibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">To the extent that the IJ denied Doe\u2019s asylum claims in the alternative based on a determination that she failed to establish persecution because of membership in a particular social group, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1), and failed to establish that her assailants were in any way tied to the Australian government, <em>see id., </em>we need not address the merits of these claims because our affirmance of the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding provides an independent basis for denying the petition for review. Moreover, despite Doe\u2019s contention that the agency failed to address her request for humanitarian relief, such a finding was unnecessary because Doe failed to establish her eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. We VACATE the previously granted stay of deportation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. Although Doe provided some plausible explanations to refute several of the agency\u2019s stated reasons for finding her incredible \u2014 for example, why she did not produce affidavits of a victim she could not locate or why she provided vague testimony regarding her qualifications to be a counselor \u2014 a reasonable fact finder would not have been compelled to credit them, and so we find no error in the agency's decision not to do so. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
