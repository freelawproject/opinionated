He accused them of a criminal conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 241 &amp; 242 and sued them for equal protection and due protection violations ostensibly pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. Although his complaint is not a model of clarity, Allen appears to allege that state claims for unpaid child support payments and unpaid foster care reimbursement payments are false and the product of a conspiracy to deprive him of his civil rights. The District Court dismissed Allen\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. Allen appeals and moves for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will dismiss Allen\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) because it has no arguable basis in fact or law. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">To the extent that Allen sought to impose criminal liability under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 241 &amp; 242 on Defendants, he lacked standing to proceed. <em>See United States v. Friedland, </em>83 F.3d 1531, 1539 (3d Cir. 1996) (\u201c[T]he United States Attorney is responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases within his or her district.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Furthermore, Allen did not assert actionable civil claims against Defendants. Neither Defendant may be considered a \u201cperson\u201d subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 64, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Furthermore, the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution protects an unconsenting state or state agency from a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens. <em>See Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984); <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 663, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). Although Congress can abrogate a state\u2019s sovereign immunity, it did not do so through the enactment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, through which Allen ostensibly proceeds. <em>See Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 345, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">For these reasons, we will dismiss Allen\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Because his appeal lacks merit, we will deny his motion for appointment of counsel. <em>See Tabron v. </em>Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 155 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
