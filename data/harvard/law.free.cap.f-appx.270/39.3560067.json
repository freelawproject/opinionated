Szucs pled guilty without benefit of a plea agreement to both counts of a Superseding Indictment\u2014 one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute MDMA and one count of distribution and possession with intent to distribute MDMA. The district court sentenced Szucs to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment, the bottom of the Guidelines range of 37 to 46 months calculated by the district court. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-21\">Szucs does not challenge the district court\u2019s Guidelines calculation, but argues that it failed to adequately consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The record reveals that these factors were adequately considered by the district court. Szucs\u2019s sole complaint seems to be that the district court did not explicitly list the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We have held that \u201ca sentencing judge\u2019s decision not to discuss explicitly the sentencing factors or not to review them in the exact language of the statute does not, without more, overcome the presumption that she took them all properly into account.\u201d <em>United States v. Pereira, </em>465 F.3d 515, 523 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e presume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-22\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
