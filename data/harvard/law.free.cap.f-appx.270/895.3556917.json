The Board found that Nolasco failed to prove that she suffered \u201cpast prosecution,\u201d a probability of future persecution, or she was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be tortured when she returns to Venezuela. We deny Nolasco\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">Nolasco entered the United States on January 11, 2003, as a nonimmigrant visitor. Over a year later, Nolasco filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal. At her removal hearing, Nolasco testified about the incidents that led her to leave Venezuela.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">Nolasco taught at \u201cthe basic national school\u201d where she opposed political changes to the educational program. No-lasco was also a member of Un Nuevo Tiempo, a group that worked to defend democracy and human rights and opposed the regime of Hugo Chavez. Nolasco received notes in her office and on her car that referred to her as a \u201ctraitor.\u201d The school principal asked Nolasco to resign. She refused, but was not fired. On one occasion, all of her car tires were flat and a note on her car said, \u201cthis is your last opportunity, get away, do not come back.\u201d The notes were unsigned and contained the words \u201cthe revolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">On another occasion, a group of women confronted Nolasco. One of the women brandished a knife and told Nolasco \u201cit looks like you did not understand the message.\u201d As Nolasco drove home, a man riding a motorcycle and wearing a red t-shirt slowed as he approached Nolasco\u2019s car, \u201cshot once,\u201d and sped away. Nolasco did not know any of her assailants, but she recalled that the man on the motorcycle wore a type of shirt common to members of the Bolivarian Circles, a group that supported Chavez.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-15\">Nolasco also received calls on her home and cellular telephone that threatened to harm her and her relatives. The callers did not identify themselves, but used the words \u201cthe revolution\u201d and Nolasco believed they were members of the Bolivari-an Circles. Nolasco explained that she did not move to a different location inside Venezuela because members of the Boliva-rian Circles lived throughout the country. After Nolasco resided in the United States, her family told her that conditions had worsened and cautioned her to not return to Venezuela.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">The immigration judge ruled that Nolas-co\u2019s application for asylum was untimely and denied Nolasco\u2019s application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention. The judge found that Nolas-co failed to show either that her life or freedom would be threatened due to her political opinion or that she was a victim of past persecution. The judge found that Nolasco was unable either to identify the individuals who threatened or attempted to harm her as members of the Bolivarian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Circles or establish that she was threatened based on her political activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed. The Board decided that Nolasco was ineligible for asylum and she did not establish she was subject to past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The Board also decided that No-lasco failed to establish that she would, more likely than not, be tortured when she returned to Venezuela.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">We review the decision of the Board to determine whether it is \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Lorisme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444-45 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201cTo reverse [those] fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Nolasco challenges two of the three decisions of the Board. Nolasco challenges the denial of her application for withholding of removal and her argument for relief under the Convention. Nolasco does not challenge the finding that her application for asylum was untimely, which we lack jurisdiction to review. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Nolasco\u2019s burden is well-established. To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must prove that her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)). The alien must establish that she \u201cmore-likely-than-not would be persecuted ... upon [her] return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Fahim, </em>278 F.3d at 1218). An applicant for relief under the Convention must \u201cestablish that it is more likely than not that ... she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Torture is confined to those acts inflicting \u201csevere pain and suffering, whether physical or mental\u201d committed at the hands, under the direction, or with the acquiescence of \u201ca public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">Substantial evidence supports the decision that Nolasco did not suffer political persecution. The anonymous telephone calls and notes constitute harassment but do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229,1238 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). Nolasco was not present when her tires were flattened, and she did not even testify that her tires were damaged. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. In the incidents that involved the group of women and the motorcycle gunman, Nolasco could not identify either the individuals involved or establish that their attacks were politically motivated. Nolasco also was not harmed in any incident. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1234, 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">Nolasco also is not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution because she failed to establish that she suffered past persecution and she offered no proof that she would be singled out due to her political beliefs if she returned to Venezuela. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Nolasco did not allege that the Venezuelan authorities engaged in a pattern or practice to persecute members of Un Nue-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>vo Tiempo. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2). She testified that she has family in Venezuela who have not been threatened or harmed. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the finding that Nolasco will not likely be tortured upon her return to Venezuela. \u201cThe burden of proof for an applicant seeking withholding of removal under the Convention, like that for an applicant seeking withholding of removal under the statute, is higher than the burden imposed on an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303; <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Because Nolasco failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution, she also cannot establish that she would suffer \u201ctorture.\u201d <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Nolasco\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
