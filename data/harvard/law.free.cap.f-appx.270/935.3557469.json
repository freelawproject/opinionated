California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-21\">Previously, in <em>United States v. Maria De Los Angeles Garcia-Flores, </em>no. 04-15327, we affirmed Garcia-Flores\u2019s convictions for: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(b)(1)(A); (2) possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1),(b)(1)(A); and (3) failure to appear in court, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(a). Although we affirmed the sentence for Garcia-Flores\u2019s failure to appear, we vacated her drug trafficking sentences and remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court resentenced Garcia-Flores to 188 months imprisonment on both counts, set to run concurrently, followed by 5 years supervised release, and she now appeals the reimposed sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-23\">Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no issues of arguable merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Garcia-Flores\u2019s aggregate sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
