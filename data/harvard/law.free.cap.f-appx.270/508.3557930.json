INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1253 (9th Cir.2003). The IJ denied Shoriz\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal on the ground that Shoriz\u2019s testimony was not credible. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) (\u201cThe testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d); <em>Ji-bril v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1129, 1133 (9th Cir.2005). We review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination under the deferential substantial evidence standard, and we must uphold that determination \u201cunless the evidence <em>compels </em>a contrary result.\u201d <em>Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 741 (9th Cir.2007) (emphasis in original). Where, as here, the IJ has offered multiple grounds to support the adverse credibility determination, we must uphold the determination as \u201clong as one of the identified grounds is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of [the] claim of persecution.\u201d <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Shoriz\u2019s testimony was inconsistent and unclear regarding the arrangements he made to pay a smuggler to transport him from Jordan to Belize, and this inconsistency strikes at the heart of Shoriz\u2019s claim. <em>See Don, </em>476 F.3d at 741-43. The IJ\u2019s finding that Shoriz was unable to discuss his practice or knowledge of Christianity in meaningful fashion provides an additional substantial evidentiary basis to affirm, because Shoriz\u2019s claim that he was a practicing Christian was a basis for his claim of relief. <em>See id. </em>at 741-42. Moreover, the IJ based his adverse credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>bility determination in part upon Shoriz\u2019s pauses during questioning, and we accord such demeanor-based findings \u201cspecial deference.\u201d <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based on substantial evidence, we uphold the ruling denying asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
