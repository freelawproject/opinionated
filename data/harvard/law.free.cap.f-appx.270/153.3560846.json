(\u201cElite\u201d). On September 30, 2005, Elite filed suit against NYLIC asserting various tort and breach of contract claims arising from NYLIC\u2019s use of loans secured against the policies\u2019 cash values and dividends to pay the policies\u2019 premiums. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>District Court granted summary judgment in favor of NYLIC on October 25, 2006, 2006 WL 3052703, holding (1) that Elite\u2019s tort claims were barred by Pennsylvania\u2019s two-year statute of limitations and (2) that Elite\u2019s breach of contract claims failed as a matter of law. The District Court also held that the class action settlement agreement in <em>Willson v. New York Life Insurance Co., </em>No. 94-127804, 1995 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 652 (N.Y.Sup.Ct. Nov. 8, 1995), barred Elite\u2019s claims under the doctrines of release and <em>res judicata. </em>Elite timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Elite raises a single issue on appeal, namely whether the District Court erred in concluding that the notice of settlement provided in <em>Willson </em>met the requirements of due process. We need not reach this issue, however, because, as appellee correctly argues, it is one of two alternative grounds on which the District Court\u2019s decision was based. Elite\u2019s failure to challenge the District Court\u2019s conclusions with respect to the timeliness of its tort claims and the adequacy of its contract claims in its opening brief constitutes a waiver of these issues on appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see United States v. Pelullo, </em>399 F.3d 197, 222 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201cIt is well settled that an appellant\u2019s failure to identify or argue ah issue in his opening brief constitutes waiver of that issue on appeal\u201d), and we therefore will affirm because these unappealed aspects of the District Court\u2019s decision represent an adequate and independent ground for granting summary judgment in favor of NYLIC.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-5\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We exercise appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-6\">. Elite does not seriously challenge these conclusions even in its reply brief, stating only the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">[NYLIC] argues that [Elite], in its Appellant brief, argued notice but failed to discuss the two year statute of limitations for tort claims or argue breach of contract. Because the tolling of the statute of limitations in tort and breach of contracts [claims] are dependant upon notice and discovery, whether or not adequate notice was provided to Elite is a genuine issue of material fact to a finding of either.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-18\">(Reply Br. at 1.) Although it is less than clear, Elite's argument appears to conllate notice of the accrual of its claims against NYLIC with notice of the <em>Willson </em>settlement. If this is the argument, it is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
