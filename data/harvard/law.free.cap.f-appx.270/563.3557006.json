After a hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration denied his claim. The district court affirmed, and Ferguson brought this appeal. We review de novo a district court\u2019s affirmance of a denial of disability benefits. <em>Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1193 (9th Cir.2004). The Commissioner\u2019s decision must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence and the Commissioner relied on the correct legal standards. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">The district court correctly determined that the Commissioner\u2019s conclusions were supported by substantial evidence. Ferguson failed to meet his burden of proving that he was disabled for at least one year prior to the date last insured. <em>See Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.1999) (placing the burden of proof on the claimant). Ferguson presented evidence that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, but he presented scant evidence that this condition constituted a severe impairment as required for a finding of disability under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c). The doctor\u2019s reports for the period in question indicate that Ferguson did not face significant functional limitations. The ALJ was entitled to credit these reports over medical reports issued after the period in question, especially in light of the finding that Ferguson\u2019s self-reporting to physicians was not entirely credible. Therefore, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">Nor was it error for the ALJ to rely upon the testimony of a non-examining medical expert in rejecting portions of the examining physicians\u2019 reports. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821 (9th Cir.1996). Following the requirement of <em>Lester, </em>the ALJ stated specific and legitimate reasons beyond the expert\u2019s testimony for rejecting the examining physicians\u2019 conclusions. <em>See id. </em>at 831. The examining physicians\u2019 reports sometimes presented conflicting information, Ferguson failed to seek medical treatment for significant stretches of time during the requisite period and, as noted above, Ferguson\u2019s self-reporting was found not to be credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">Finally, we consider Ferguson\u2019s argument that the ALJ failed to give sufficient weight to the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) disability rating. While such ratings are ordinarily entitled to great weight, the Commissioner properly gave less weight to the VA disability rating because the Commissioner stated \u201cpersuasive, specific, valid reasons for doing so that are supported by the record.\u201d <em>McCartey v. Massanari, </em>298 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir.2002). The VA issued both of its ratings decisions after the date Fer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>guson was last insured. These decisions were not supported by objective medical assessments, and they relied upon Ferguson\u2019s questionable self-reporting of symptoms. The VA also increased its rating retroactively on the basis of the same evidence underlying its first decision. In light of these facts, the ALJ did not commit error under <em>McCartey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b588-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
