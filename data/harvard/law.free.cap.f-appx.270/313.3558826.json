His conviction was affirmed on appeal and he was denied state habeas relief. Baxter filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application, which the district court denied. After denying Baxter\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application, the district court granted Baxter a certificate of ap-pealability on the questions whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied a mandatory evidentiary presumption in a way that violates the Constitution and whether Baxter suffered prejudice from his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to jury instructions containing a mandatory evidentiary presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-22\">Regarding the jury instruction issue, Baxter contends that his constitutional rights were violated when the trial court failed to give a charge on the presumption that, he insists, was mandated by Texas Penal Code \u00a7 2.05(a)(2) (Vernon 2005) after the court gave the jury a Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.02(c) (Vernon 2005) instruction on a presumed fact. His argument consists of generalized legal boilerplate regarding jury instructions and due process. He asserts in a conclusional fashion that there is a reasonable likelihood that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>jury applied the presumption in a way that violated the Constitution. In light of the record and the detailed analyses of the state appellate court and the district court, we conclude that Baxter has failed to establish that the district court erred in denying habeas relief on this issue. <em>See Ortiz v. Quarterman, </em>504 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.2007); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Baxter also asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Although Baxter insists that there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury would have returned a different verdict if it had been properly instructed, he does not address the detailed analysis performed by the district court regarding this issue. His argument is conclusional, at best. Conclusional allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are insufficient to establish the petitioner\u2019s right to habeas relief. <em>Miller v. Johnson, </em>200 F.3d 274, 282 (5th Cir.2000). Moreover, Baxter\u2019s argument does not amount to the affirmative showing of prejudice that is required under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 693-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). His argument thus fails to establish that the district court erred in denying habeas relief on this ground. <em>See Ortiz, </em>504 F.3d at 496; \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
