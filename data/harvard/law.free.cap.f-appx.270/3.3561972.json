July 20, 2005), <em>affg </em>No. A 78 400 330 (Im-mig.Ct.N.Y.City, Oct. 23, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">As an initial matter, Lin asserted in her asylum application that she feared being persecuted in China because she departed that country illegally. However, the IJ found that because Lin used her own passport to exit China, she did not depart illegally. Lin did not challenge this finding in her appeal to the BIA or in her petition for review in this Court. Accordingly, her claim for relief based on her illegal departure from China is deemed abandoned and we will not address it further. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., minus the single argument for denying relief that was not relied upon by the BIA. <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law regarding \u201cwhat evidence will suffice to carry any asylum applicant\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 305. However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">The record supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Lin failed to establish eligibility for asylum. The incident upon which she based her claim of past persecution consisted of the police going to her home to arrest her when she was not there. Lin does not allege that she was detained or physically mistreated by the authorities in China, <em>cf. Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2006), and the threat of arrest alone does not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 70 (2d Cir. 2002) (concluding that \u201c[wjith regard to the threat of detention, the threat itself, is not past persecution\u201d). Under these circumstances, the IJ reasonably found that Lin failed to demonstrate past persecution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>See Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 216, 222 (BIA 1985). Therefore, she was not entitled to the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Additionally, the record supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Lin failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Even if the authorities indicated an intent to arrest Lin in the past, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the authorities maintain any interest in her. Indeed, Lin testified that she does not know if the police returned to look for her after their initial visit. Moreover, as the IJ accurately noted, the letter from her mother does not indicate that the police intend to arrest Lin if she returns to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">While Lin testified that, in this country, she practices Falun Gong \u201csometimes\u201d alone in her room, the IJ observed that Falun Gong did not appear to be a \u201cmajor factor\u201d in her life. Although we have observed that one\u2019s level of knowledge of a given religion may bear no relation to the likelihood that one may face persecution on that basis, <em>see Yose Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 84, 90 (2d Cir.2006), we cannot disagree with the agency that, in this case, Lin did not establish an objectively reasonable fear of persecution. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding that a fear is not objectively reasonable if it lacks \u201csolid support\u201d in the record and is merely \u201cspeculative at best\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Because Lin was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on her claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b29-8\">. We decline to consider the evidence to which Lin refers that does not appear in the administrative record. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (stating that the court of appeals \"shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based\u201d); <em>see also Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 270 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
