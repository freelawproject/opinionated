Segovia-Portillo argues that the district court erred by relying upon, inter alia, a New York certificate of disposition to determine that his New York conviction of first degree manslaughter was a crime of violence (COY) under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2006). He also argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The district court in Segovia-Portillo\u2019s case admitted into evidence a certificate of disposition that indicates that SegoviaPortillo entered a plea of guilty to violating the first subsection of the New York first degree manslaughter statute, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 125.20 (McKinney 1997). SegoviaPortillo concedes that a conviction under the first subsection of \u00a7 125.20 warrants a COV enhancement. New York certificates of disposition are presumptive evidence of the facts stated therein and are admissible to determine the nature of a prior conviction. <em>United States v. Neri-Hemandes, </em>504 F.3d 587, 592 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1106, 169 L.Ed.2d 838 (2008). Certificates of disposition are not conclusive and may be rebutted. <em>Id. </em>However, as Segovia-Portillo produced no evidence calling into question the reliability of the certificate of disposition in his case, the district court did not err in using the certificate of disposition to establish that Segovia-Portillo was convicted of the first subsection of the New York first degree manslaughter statute, which is a COV. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Segovia-Portillo challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
