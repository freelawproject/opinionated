We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-25\">This case is before us for the second time. In the first appeal, we affirmed Abdul-Aziz\u2019s conviction but vacated his sentence and remanded to the District Court for resentencing. <em>United States v. Abdul-Aziz, </em>486 F.3d 471, 479 (8th Cir.2007). We held that the District Court\u2019s justification for imposing a two-level en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>hancement for obstruction of justice under United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3C1.1 was insufficient because the explanation did not show that the court made \u201can independent determination that the defendant perjured himself\u2019 at trial but instead relied on the fact of conviction. <em>Abdul-Aziz, </em>486 F.3d at 479. On remand, the District Court held a hearing, made the necessary finding that Abdul-Aziz perjured himself, added the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, and again sentenced Abdul-Aziz to thirty-three months in prison. Abdul-Aziz again appeals his sentence challenging the obstruction of justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">On appeal, we review the District Court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Guidelines de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 478. Abdul-Aziz argues there was \u201cno evidence\u201d to support the court\u2019s finding of perjury. Br. of Appellant at 8. We disagree. <em>See id. Abdul-Aziz </em>at 474-78 (detailing the evidence before the court at trial). Giving \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the experienced trial judge\u2019s finding, explicitly stated at the resentencing hearing, that Abdul-Aziz lied under oath at trial, we conclude that the obstruction enhancement was properly applied in this case. <em>United States v. Denton, </em>434 F.3d 1104, 1114 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-26\">. The Honorable James E.
