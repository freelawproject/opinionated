The district court granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) solely on the issue of Ortiz\u2019s claim that her sentence violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Ortiz argues, among other things, that the Supreme Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>remedial holding in <em>Booker\u2022 </em>is retroactively applicable to her case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The holdings of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>stem from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court addressed a state sentencing scheme that enhanced punishment of criminal conduct beyond that which was charged in the indictment and beyond that which was proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court held that this procedure violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights and was unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 476-97, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The Court further held that a sentencing judge may enhance a sentence beyond the statutory maximum only when based on a defendant\u2019s admissions or prior convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 488-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">In <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court extended the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>and concluded that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court extended the holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, holding that a mandatory Guidelines scheme violates the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury by permitting a sentencing judge to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence based on facts that are neither found by a jury nor admitted by the defendant. To comport with the constitutional rule laid out in the first majority opinion, the Court, through a separate majority opinion, excised the provisions of the Guidelines which made them mandatory, thus rendering the Guidelines advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 345, 124 S.Ct. 2531.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">As Ortiz recognizes, we have addressed the question of whether <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>apply retroactively in \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review. <em>See Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 867 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 924, 126 S.Ct. 312, 163 L.Ed.2d 269 (2005). In <em>Varela, </em>we unequivocally concluded that <em>\u201cBooker\u2019s </em>constitutional rule falls squarely under the category of new rules of criminal procedure that do not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 868 (citing <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004) (holding that \u201cjudge-not-jury\u201d rale of <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002) did not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review)); <em>see also In re Anderson, </em>396 F.3d 1336, 1339-40 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that Supreme Court has not made <em>Booker </em>retroactively available on collateral review for purposes of authorizing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">We also have addressed the retroactive applicability of the two <em>Booker </em>holdings. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Duncan, </em>which dealt with the direct appeal of a criminal sentence, the appellant essentially argued that the Court should apply the <em>Booker </em>constitutional holding retroactively on direct review, but refuse to apply the Court\u2019s remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>retroactively. <em>Id. </em>at 1304. We expressly rejected the idea that a court may splice <em>Booker\u2019s </em>Sixth Amendment holding from the remedial holding and apply only part of <em>Booker </em>retroactively, at least on direct appeal. <em>Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">To the extent Ortiz suggests that <em>Varela </em>was wrongly decided, or that we should apply <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding retroactively, we decline her invitation to recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>sider this issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we have held that the rules established in <em>Booker/Blakely </em>are not retroactively applicable on collateral review, the district court did not err by dismissing Ortiz\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-15\">. It is <em>well-settled, </em>in this Circuit that a panel of this Court cannot overrule binding precedent issued by a prior panel. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>934 F.2d 270, 274 (11th Cir.1991). \u201cOnly a decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court can overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Machado, </em>804 F.2d 1537 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
