To the extent we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Where the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA. <em>See Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). We review the factual findings underlying denial of an asylum application for substantial evidence. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>356 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Here the petitioners claim that members of the Jaime Bateman Cayon Group, a leftist guerilla political organization in Colombia, attempted to extort money from them and threatened to kidnap their son, at least in part, because of their political opinion. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that the petitioners failed to demonstrate that these acts were \u201con account of\u2019 any political opinion. <em>See Molina-Morales v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1048, 1051 (9th Cir.2001) (concluding that, absent any evidence in the record, petitioner was not persecuted on account of any actual or imputed political opinion). The evidence, instead, shows a non-political motivation: the petitioners\u2019 perceived ability to pay. We therefore hold that the petitioners have failed to establish eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Because the petitioners failed to establish eligibility for asylum, they necessarily fail to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of CAT relief because the petitioners failed to raise, and therefore exhaust, that issue before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
