Patel and his wife, Bhavanaben B. Patel, natives and citizens of India, appeal the district court\u2019s order denying their motion for reconsideration of its dismissal of their declaratory judgment action. In their action, the Patels sought to challenge the regulation set forth at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10\u00a9 (2007) as ultra vires. Because the Patels failed to raise any issues pertaining to the propriety of the district court\u2019s finding that it lacked jurisdiction over their challenges to the regulation, we find that they failed to preserve any issues for review. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (\u201c[T]he argument ... must contain ... appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201cFailure to comply with the specific dictates of [Rule 28] with respect to a particular claim triggers abandonment of that claim on appeal.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Patel v. Chertoff, </em>No. 8:05-cv-01304-PJM (D.Md. Aug. 31, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
