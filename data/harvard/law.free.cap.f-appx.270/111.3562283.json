The police arrested and charged Morrison with possession of a prohibited offensive weapon, in violation of 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6105(a)(1), and he served approximately eight months in prison before one of his wife\u2019s friends confessed to being the actual culprit. The government thereafter dropped all charges. Morrison\u2019s claims turn on whether the police had probable cause to arrest and charge him with the above-noted offense. Because we agree with Magistrate Judge Rice that the police possessed probable cause, we will affirm his order granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">On December 9, 2002, Gail Schwambach (\u201cSchwambach\u201d) contacted the Reading Police Department to report two suspicious males in an alley, one of whom she described as having a \u201cpumper type rifle.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Schwambach observed the two men for approximately ten minutes, beginning when they pulled up in a green car. She eventually had a verbal exchange with one of them, whom she later identified as Morrison. She described the individual who got out of the driver\u2019s seat as approximately six feet tall and 180 pounds and the passenger as approximately five feet six inches or five feet eight inches tall and 140 pounds. As officers were en route, Schwambach called the police again to report that the two men had gotten into a green vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">When Officer Scott Shultz (\u201cShultz\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> arrived at the scene, he saw a green Mercury Sable that was occupied by two men. Shultz testified that the two men exited the car and fled on foot when he identified himself as a police officer and instructed them to get back into the vehicle. Shultz stated that the individual exiting from the passenger side was significantly shorter than the individual exiting from the driver\u2019s side and that he was wearing a black puffy coat and a hood on his head from a hooded shirt. He estimated that the driver was approximately five feet ten inches or six feet tall, of medium build, and likely weighed about 175 pounds. Shultz described the passenger as having \u201cbig, bushy hair, like an afro, but it was like a long afro that you don\u2019t see very often.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">Shultz chased the driver when the two men exited the car. During the chase, he slipped and fell, at which point the driver fled behind nearby houses. Thereafter, Shultz observed a van in the area driving away at a high rate of speed. He could not see who was in the van, but nonetheless radioed a description of both the van and the individual he had been chasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">Officer Mark Gresh (\u201cGresh\u201d) received Shultz\u2019s dispatch and observed a van driving on Laurel Street in Reading. According to Gresh, a black male with a gray hooded shirt exited the van and then ran between two houses located behind 719 Laurel Street. Thereafter, several officers arrived at the scene and searched 719 Laurel Street. Morrison was in the house with six other individuals. According to testimony, police suspicion focused on Morrison and Andrew Bing (\u201cBing\u201d), who was also found at the house, because they matched the general physical description of the men they were looking for. Morrison is five feet, ten inches tall, and weighed approximately 160 pounds at the time of his arrest. He had a goatee and was wearing a white T-shirt and blue jeans when the police arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">Officer Gresh testified that he could not identify the person who jumped out of the van and that he \u201cthought the guy that ran from the car looked lighter, lighter-skinned.\u201d However, Gresh also testified that if he had thought Morrison was \u201cnot the guy,\u201d he would have said as much. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The driver of the van, Raphael Figueroa, stated that a black male with a goatee held a gun to his head and forced him to drive the van. However, Figueroa was not able to provide a description of that individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Shultz was initially uncertain that Mom-son was the individual that he had chased from the green car. However, he testified that after thinking about the chase in his head, he became convinced that he could identify Morrison. Morrison was not wearing a black puffy coat or hooded shirt, as Shultz had seen on the individual he chased. Nonetheless, Shultz indicated that he recognized Morrison\u2019s face. Once he was able to identify Morrison, Shultz arranged for Schwambach to take part in a \u201cshowup identification,\u201d a process in which police arrange for an encounter between a witness to a crime and a detained suspect to see if the witness can make an identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Here, police led Morrison, Bing, and another man who was in the house outside for the showup. Bing and the third suspect, Jonathan Almodovar, were juveniles at that time. Almodovar was six feet tall, dark-skinned, and approximately 180 pounds. Some evidence suggested that Bing was handcuffed during the identification, although Bing himself disputed that was the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">After arriving at the scene, approximately 45 minutes after she first observed the two men in the alley, Schwambach identified Morrison as \u201cthe passenger that was sitting in the car that had the gun.\u201d However, she could not identify the driver. According to her subsequent testimony, Schwambach had no hesitation when she identified Morrison. After Schwambach\u2019s identification, Shultz arrested Morrison. Further investigation revealed that Morrison had previously been convicted of kidnapping and was on parole for those charges. Shultz charged Morrison with possession of a prohibited offensive weapon, in violation of 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 908(a), and with unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6105(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">After reviewing the facts set forth in an affidavit of probable cause that Shultz prepared, a magisterial district judge approved the charges. Shultz\u2019s affidavit set forth the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">I was dispatched to the 400 block of Orange Street on 12/9/02 at 1326 hours relative to a complaint of two black males in an alley there acting suspiciously and one of them was carrying a pump-style gun. As I arrived on location, I received an update from the complainant that the two males had gotten into a green car in the block. I immediately spotted the car, a 1996 Mercury sable, bearing PA registration DJM-4199, which was later reported stolen, with two black males sitting in the front seats. As I was relaying the information to radio dispatch, the two started getting out of the car. I ordered them back in the car. They took off running. After a foot chase over three city blocks, I lost sight of the suspect who ran from the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle. A large brown conversion van was seen speeding away from the area. Other officers were alerted and the vehicle was stopped a short time later. The driver, Raphael Figueroa, said the suspect pointed a gun at him and demanded he drive from the area. The suspect was let out in the 400 block of S. 7th Street. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Officer Steve Gresh, who was in the area, witnessed the suspect jumping out of the van there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">Through further investigation, the suspects were located at 719 Laurel Street. The original complainant, Gail Schwam-bach, was transported to that location and positively identified the suspect as the person in the car with the shotgun. The owner of the car the suspects ran from had returned to her car in the meantime and told officers that it had been stolen in the area of S. 9th and Franklin Streets. She gave us permission to search the vehicle and inside on the rear seat lay an Ithaca, 12 gauge, pump, shotgun with the barrel sawed off to 14 and 3/4 inches, and loaded with 4 slug, 12 gauge, shells.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">Further investigation revealed the suspect has been convicted on kidnapping charges in Philadelphia and is currently on parole for those charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">Based on the information received and the investigation conducted, I request a warrant for the arrest of Steven Cory Morrison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The affidavit contained a number of omissions and ambiguous statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">First, Schwambach\u2019s identification of Morrison as the passenger was inconsistent with Shultz\u2019s belief that Morrison had been the driver. Second, Shultz\u2019s description of the passenger was inconsistent with Morrison\u2019s actual appearance. Morrison was actually about five feet ten inches tall and 160 pounds, with short ham. Shultz described the passenger as short with \u201cbig, bushy\u201d hair.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Third, Shultz\u2019s description of the clothing of the man he was chasing differed from Schwambach\u2019s description, and both their descriptions were different from the clothing Morrison was found to be wearing when police arrived at the house. Shultz testified that the individual he was chasing was wearing a black puffy coat and a gray hooded shirt or jacket. Schwambach testified that Morrison was wearing a black hat, an orange sweater, and jeans. At the time police found Morrison in the house, he was wearing jeans, a white shirt and a multicolored jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">The affidavit also contained a number of statements that are ambiguous and arguably erroneous. First, the affidavit implied that Figueroa identified Morrison as the individual who held a gun to his head in the van. Specifically, the affidavit states that \u201cThe driver, Raphael Figueroa, said the suspect pointed a gun at him and demanded he drive from the area.\u201d Similarly, the affidavit implied that Officer Gresh identified Morrison, stating that \u201cOfficer Steve Gresh, who was in the area, witnessed the suspect jumping out of the van there.\u201d Both statements are confusing because Officer Shultz used the term \u201csuspect\u201d to refer to Morrison specifically and more generically to describe the unidentified individuals the police were pursuing. Neither Figueroa nor Gresh were able to identify Morrison, or anyone else, as the generic suspects they had encountered.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">After being arrested and charged, Morrison sought to suppress Schwambach\u2019s identification. The Berks County Court of Common Pleas denied his suppression motion, reasoning that Schwambach had an opportunity to observe the individual she identified, that she positively identified him, and that the identification was not unduly suggestive. Thereafter, on June 10, 2003, Andrew Bing confessed to the crime with which police had charged Mor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>rison and eventually made a written confession. The police dropped all charges against Morrison on or about August 20, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">On January 12, 2005, Morrison filed a <em>pro se </em>Complaint asserting claims for false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution against Shultz, the City of Reading, and a number of other defendants not relevant to this appeal. At the request of the court, Morrison\u2019s current counsel entered an appearance on Morrison\u2019s behalf. On January 2, 2007, Magistrate Judge Rice granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In reaching that conclusion, the court concluded that (1) the police possessed probable cause to arrest Morrison; (2) that even if the defendants did violate Morrison\u2019s constitutional rights, they were entitled to qualified immunity; and (3) that Morrison\u2019s municipal liability claim against the City of Reading, brought pursuant to <em>Mo-nell v. Department of Social Serv., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), was without merit because (a) there was no constitutional violation; and (b) there was no evidence of deliberate indifference. On January 31, 2007, Morrison filed a timely Notice of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">On appeal, Morrison argues that the Magistrate Judge erred in (1) concluding that the defendants\u2019 possessed probable cause to arrest him and (2) dismissing his <em>Monell </em>claim against the City of Reading \u201cin the face of evidence showing that the City has a policy or custom of providing insufficient training to its officers with respect to ... the use of identification procedures like the show up at issue here.\u201d We review the Magistrate Judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Saldana v. Kmart Corp., </em>260 F.3d 228, 231-32 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">A. Probable Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">To prevail on his section 1983 claim, Morrison was required to prove that the police arrested him without probable cause. <em>Groman v. Township of Manala-pan, </em>47 F.3d 628, 634 (3d Cir.1995). Pursuant to <em>Wright v. City of Philadelphia, </em>409 F.3d 595, 602 (3d Cir.2005), \u201c[a]n arrest was made with probable cause if \u2018at the moment the arrest was made ... the facts and circumstances within [the officers\u2019] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that [the suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964)). Where a police officer possesses \u201cknowledge of a credible eyewitness ... a reasonable jury could not find that [he] lacked knowledge of sufficient facts to establish probable cause to arrest.\u201d <em>Merkle v. Upper Dublin Sch. Dist., </em>211 F.3d 782, 790 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Here, there is no dispute that Ms. Schwambach positively identified Morrison. However, Morrison contends that the identification did not provide probable cause because, at the time of arrest, Officer Shultz could not have deemed Ms. Schwambach\u2019s identification as reliable. To determine whether a showup identification is reliable, courts examine the identification procedure in light of the totality of the circumstances. In particular, courts must consider: (1) the witness\u2019s original opportunity to observe the suspect; (2) the degree of attention during the initial observation; (3) the accuracy of the initial description; (4) the witness\u2019s degree of certainty when viewing the suspect at the confrontation; and (5) the lapsed time between the crime and the identification procedure. <em>See, e.g., Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>(1972); <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>454 F.3d 131, 139 (3d Cir.2006). These factors suggest that Schwambach\u2019s identification was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">First, the record shows that Schwam-bach observed the suspects at a relatively close proximity for approximately ten minutes before engaging in a verbal confrontation with the individual she ultimately identified as Morrison. Additionally, the fact that she made multiple calls to the police, while she continued to observe the suspects, suggests that she was sharply focused at the time of her initial observation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Schwambach\u2019s certainty that Morrison was the suspect she had observed, as well as the relatively short period of time between her initial observation and the \u201cshowup,\u201d also suggest reliability. In her deposition testimony, Schwambach stated that she was able to immediately and without hesitation identify Morrison as the suspect she had observed. Similarly, Schwambach\u2019s identification at the showup occurred \u2014 at most \u2014 within forty-five minutes after she first observed the two suspects. Finally, it is significant that Ms. Schwambach was well-known to the police department as a neighborhood crime activist who had a history of providing reliable information.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Notwithstanding Schwambach\u2019s identification, Morrison argues that Shultz made multiple omissions and errors in his Affidavit of Probable Cause that collectively undermine the existence of probable cause. In <em>Wilson v. Russo, </em>212 F.3d 781 (3d Cir.2000), we instructed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">a plaintiff may succeed in a \u00a7 1983 action for false arrest made pursuant to a warrant if the plaintiff shows, by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) that the police officer \u2018knowingly and deliberately, or with a reckless disregard for the truth, made false statements or omissions that create a falsehood in applying for a warrant;\u2019 and (2) that \u2018such statements or omissions are material, or necessary, to the finding of probable cause.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asr\"><em>Id. </em>at 786-87 (citation omitted). To determine whether any such errors or omissions are \u201cmaterial, or necessary, to the finding of probable cause\u201d supporting the warrant, we must ask whether the affidavit when amended to correct those misstatements or misleading omissions still provides probable cause. <em>Id. </em>at 786-89. We are satisfied that Shultz\u2019s affidavit provided probable cause if so corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The primary \u201cerrors\u201d that Morrison points to are two statements that imply that both Officer Gresh and Figueroa identified Morrison as one of the two individuals involved in criminal activity. Specifically, the affidavit stated that (1) \u201cThe driver, Raphael Figueroa, said the suspect pointed a gun at him and demanded he drive from the area\u201d and (2) \u201cOfficer Steve Gresh, who was in the area, witnessed the suspect jumping out of the van there.\u201d Both statements are confusing because Officer Shultz used the term \u201csuspect\u201d to refer to Morrison specifically and more generically to describe the unidentified individuals the police were pursuing. The resulting language arguably suggests, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>correctly, that Figueroa and Gresh were able to identify Morrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Similarly, Morrison identifies a number of omissions that he contends are material to whether Shultz possessed probable cause. Specifically, Morrison notes the following facts that Shultz failed to include in the affidavit: (1) that Schwambach\u2019s identification of Morrison as the passenger was inconsistent with Shultz\u2019s belief that Morrison had been the driver; (2) that Shultz\u2019s description of the passenger was inconsistent with Morrison\u2019s actual appearance; and (3) that Shultz\u2019s description of the clothing of the man he was chasing differed from Schwambach\u2019s description and both their descriptions were different from the clothing Morrison was found to be wearing when police arrived at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">As an initial matter, we are not convinced that the errors and omissions that Morrison identifies were made/omitted with reckless disregard for the truth or were knowingly and deliberately false or misleading. Reading the affidavit as a whole, the \u201cerroneous\u201d statements seem like the result of sloppy drafting by Shultz. We need not determine that issue, however, because even making all of the changes Morrison would have us make, the affidavit still provides cause for Morrison\u2019s arrest. With regard to the two arguably erroneous statements in the affidavit, the inability of Figueroa and Gresh to identify Morrison does not detract from the reliability of Schwambach\u2019s identification which, standing alone in the affidavit, is sufficient to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The omissions Morrison cites pose a more interesting question. Omissions are made with knowing and deliberate or reckless disregard \u201cif an officer withholds a fact in his ken that \u2018[a]ny reasonable person would have known that this was the kind of thing the judge would wish to know.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson, </em>212 F.3d at 788 (internal citation omitted). Although a positive identification can be sufficient to establish probable cause, \u201cindependent exculpatory evidence or substantial evidence towards a witness\u2019s own reliability, known by the arresting officers, could outweigh the identification such that probable cause would not exist.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>212 F.3d at 790. Here, Morrison does cite several exculpatory facts that Shultz failed to include in the affidavit. Ultimately, however, they are insufficient to outweigh a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">First, some of the omissions simply are not material. As Magistrate Judge Rice noted in his Memorandum Opinion, a reasonable jury would view any discrepancies related to what Morrison was wearing as immaterial, especially given that \u201cBing himself had changed out of what he was seen in by Schwambach into pajamas by the time of the showup.\u201d Similarly, we do not find the supposed \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d between Shultz\u2019s description of the passenger and Morrison\u2019s actual appearance material. Shultz identified Morrison as the driver, not the passenger, and his description of the driver matched Morrison\u2019s actual appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">We need not explore whether the fact that Shultz identified Morrison as the driver, whereas Schwambach identified him as the passenger, was material. Pursuant to <em>Wilson, </em>an omission is only reckless or deliberate where the information omitted was within the officer\u2019s knowledge. <em>Wilson, </em>212 F.3d at 788. Here, Shultz testified that he was unaware that Schwambach had identified Morrison as the passenger. Morrison did not provide any evidence contradicting that statement. Accordingly, Shultz\u2019s omission was not reckless or deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">Additionally, while Morrison insists that Schwambach\u2019s identification was unreliable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>because she identified him as the \u201cpassenger,\u201d contrary to Shultz\u2019s belief that he was the \u201cdriver,\u201d the argument that this represents a conflict is based on the assumption that the police had knowledge at the time of the arrest that the \u201cpassenger\u201d and \u201cdriver\u201d descriptions emanated from a simultaneous viewing of the two men in the car by Schwambach and Shultz. There is no evidence, however, that the police had such knowledge at the relevant time. They thus had no way of knowing if a conflict existed. Regardless, even if we assume that a discrepancy does exist and included that information in the affidavit, we are well satisfied that probable cause nonetheless existed based upon Ms. Schwambach\u2019s identification after her face to face encounter with Morrison.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-12\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The parties consented to jurisdiction before the Honorable Timothy R.

There is some discrepancy in the record regarding the spelling of Officer Shultz\u2019s last name. Magistrate Judge Rice consistently referred to him as Officer \"Schultz.\u201d Based upon his Affidavit of Probable Cause, we will assume for purposes of this opinion that \u201cShultz\u201d is the proper spelling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">. Bing stated in his confession that he was not handcuffed during the showup. Morrison testified that Bing was indeed handcuffed. As the Magistrate Judge noted, Bing being handcuffed would likely have worked to Morrison's advantage in that it would suggest that Bing, rather than Morrison, was the actual suspect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b139-10\">. Significantly, however, Shultz never identified Morrison as the passenger. In essence, this inconsistency is an extension of Shultz's belief that Morrison was the driver, rather than the passenger.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\">. Admittedly, the record is silent regarding the extent to which Shultz was familiar with the circumstances surrounding Schwam-bach\u2019s original observation of the two suspects before he arrested Morrison and utilized Schwambach\u2019s identification in his affidavit of probable cause. However, probable cause may be based on the collective knowledge of all law enforcement officers involved in an investigation. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Belle, </em>593 F.2d 487, 497 n. 15 (3d Cir.1979) (\"The collective knowledge of the investigating officers is measured in determining probable cause.\u201d). Accordingly, we presume that Shultz was aware of the circumstances of Schwam-bach\u2019s identification, which she had related to other police officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b143-13\">. Morrison also argues that the Magistrate Judge erred in dismissing his municipal liability claim, brought pursuant to <em>Monell v. Department of Social Serv., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Inasmuch as Morrison did not suffer any constitutional deprivation, there is no need to address whether the Magistrate Judge erred by dismissing his claim against the City.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
