We agree. However, Allen did not object at that time, or at any time during the sentencing hearing. Thus, he forfeited the issue and we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Cannel, </em>517 F.3d 1172, 1175-76 (9th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Evans-Martinez, </em>448 F.3d 1163, 1166 &amp; n. 1 (9th Cir.2006). We must, therefore, ask: was there error; if so, was it plain; if so, did it affect substantial rights; and, finally, did it \u201c \u2018seriously affect[] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u2019 \u201d? <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>see also Evans</em>\u2014Martinez, 448 F.3d at 1166; <em>United States v. Rodriguez\u2014</em>Rodriguez, 441 F.3d 767, 772 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Here there was error, and it was plain. Moreover, Allen\u2019s substantial rights were affected. He received a sentence that was thirteen months longer than he would have received if the sentences had run concurrently. In addition, given the main focus of the hearing \u2014 the false statement offense \u2014 and the district court\u2019s specific request for the government\u2019s position, we cannot say that the sentence would have been the same anyway. Finally, given the importance of plea agreements, and the need to assure defendants and the public that they will be strictly enforced,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we exercise our discretion to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing before a different judge. <em>See United States v. Camarillo-Tello, </em>236 F.3d 1024, 1028 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Mondragon, </em>228 F.3d 978, 981 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Johnson, </em>187 F.3d at 1135-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">VACATED and REMANDED for re-sentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b663-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
