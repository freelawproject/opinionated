Rodgers further contends that due to counsel\u2019s failure to effectively cross-examine the victim on this issue or concerning a police report describing the perpetrators as \u201cunidentified,\u201d the trial court refused to admit the written statement or police report into evidence. Due to the additional overwhelming evidence against Rodgers, including a videotaped confession that Rodgers does not challenge on appeal, Rodgers has not shown any deficiencies in his trial counsel\u2019s actions that prejudiced his defense. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). As a result, Rodgers has not established that the state court\u2019s denial of relief \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1) &amp; (2). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
