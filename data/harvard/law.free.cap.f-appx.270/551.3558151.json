R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b576-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-20\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-21\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002). The regulations state that a motion to reopen removal proceedings must be filed no later than ninety days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). A review of the administrative record demonstrates that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely. Petitioners\u2019 final administrative order of removal was entered on January 12, 2006. Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen was filed on March 9, 2007, more than ninety days after the date on which the final order of removal was entered. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-22\">The regulations also state that a party may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). A review of the administrative record demonstrates that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen for exceeding the numerical limitations because this is petitioners\u2019 second motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition in part is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">To the extent that petitioners seek review of the BIA\u2019s denial of their request to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen proceedings, this court lacks jurisdiction over this petition for review. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002). Respondent\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss in part is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b576-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
