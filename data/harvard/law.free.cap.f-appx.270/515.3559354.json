We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In No. 05-70400, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Kaur\u2019s motion to reopen exceeded the numerical limitations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (a party may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In No. 05-73897, although the BIA should have construed Kaur\u2019s motion as a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>see Ray v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 582, 585 n. 3 (9th Cir.2006) (claims of ineffective assistance require the introduction of new facts, and are properly raised in a motion to reopen, not a motion to reconsider), the error is immaterial because the BIA correctly determined that Kaur failed to comply with the requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 824 (9th Cir.2003) (for the BIA to grant a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, petitioner must: (1) provide an affidavit describing agreement with counsel in detail; (2) inform counsel of the allegations and afford counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) report whether a complaint of ethical or legal violations has been filed with the proper authorities and if not, why not).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b539-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
