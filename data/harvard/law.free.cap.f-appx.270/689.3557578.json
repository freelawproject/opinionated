We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, and review de novo claims of due process violations. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-24\">Even if Orozco-Solis\u2019s counsel failed to inform him of his right to petition for review of its August 12, 2002 decision dismissing his appeal, Orozco-Solis did not argue the immigration judge erred in denying his original request to <em>terminate </em>proceedings, or otherwise identify a plausible ground of relief from removal, so his claim to ineffective assistance of counsel fails. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003) (alien must show plausible grounds of relief from removal in order to establish prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b713-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
