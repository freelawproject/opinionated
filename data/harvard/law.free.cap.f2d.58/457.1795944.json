The registration of such marks is prohibited by the language of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905 (15 USCA \u00a7 85), which reads: \u201c * * * That no mark which consists merely * \u2019* \u201c in words * * *' descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods * '\u201c * shall be registered under the terms of this subdivision of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-19\">Appellant\u2019s principal argument is that \u201cFeatherweight\u201d applied to concert\u00e9 roofing blocks, which by the very nature of the material composing them are necessarily heavy, is such a manifest exaggeration' as not to be descriptive or misdeseriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-20\">It is our opinion that the decisions below were well founded and sound in principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-21\">\u201cFeatherweight\u201d is a common English word, the first meaning of which, as given in the latest edition of Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, is \u201ca very light weight.\u201d The same authority recites that, when used in relation to sports, such as horse-racing, boxing, and wrestling, the word implies the lightest class of jockeys, boxers, or wrestlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-23\">While concrete roofing slabs are naturally heavy, undoubtedly there are degrees of weight dependent upon different factors, and we can conceive of no impression which an observer would derive from seeing the word on such article except the impression that, comparatively speaking, the article was of very light weight. Hence the word as appellant proposes to use it seems obviously descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-24\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
