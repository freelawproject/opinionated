An alloy steel containing carbon, manganese from about 1.30% to about 1.60% and molybdenum from about .20% to about .30%.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-24\">\u201c2. An alloy steel containing carbon from about .12% to about .30%, manganese from about 1.30% to about 1.60% and molybdenum from about .20% to about .30%.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-25\">\u201c3. An alloy steel containing carbon from about .15% to about .20%, manganese from about 1.30% to about 1.60% and molybdenum from about .20% to about .30%.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-26\">\u201c4. An alloy steel containing carbon from about .15% to about .20%, manganese over 1.30% and molybdenum from about .20% to about .30%.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-27\">The reference relied upon is: Sargent et al., 1,401,926, December 27, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-29\">The patent to Sargent et al. relates to an alloy steel, composed of carbon, manganese, and molybdenum. In their specification, the patentees stated: \u201cThe steel alloy which we provide contains no more than about .80% carbon, from about 1.15% to 3% manganese, and <em>from a fraction </em>of 1% ,to 1.25% molybdenum. The remainder of the alloy is iron with the exception of impurities, such as sulphur and phosphorus, which are usually found in steels. While the invention <em>contemplates alloy steels of the rcmge of analysis just stated, </em>the preferred steel contains from \u00bb about .30% to .50% carbon, about 1.25% manganese and from about .25% to .75% molybdenum.\u201d (Italies.ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-30\">It is argued by counsel for appellant that, although the patent to Sargent et al. discloses an alloy steel composed of the same ingredients as those contained in appellant\u2019s product, it specifies proportions quite different from those disclosed and claimed by appellant; that the patent \u201cpermits a very wide range for each ingredient, and <em>that the proportion of each ingredient of applicant\u2019s steel falls within such wide range of the cor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>responding ingredient of the patent.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">It is further contended by counsel for appellant that it appears from an affidavit of record that appellant\u2019s steel possesses different properties, and is adapted for uses for which the patentees\u2019 preferred steel is wholly unfit, and that this is true of all of the other steels \u201cwithin the range\u201d of the Sargent et al. patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">It appears from the affidavit of Walter G. Hildorf that appellant\u2019s alloy steel is used in the manufacture of \u201ccups, cones and rollers for roller bearings and other articles. * * \u25a0'* Prior to the invention of this Lothrop alloy steel, roller bearings were made of a nickel molybdenum or other nickel alloy steel, which was veiy expensive on account of the high price of nickel and factors incident to manufacturing operations. The Lothrop alloy steel is rapidly superseding and will in time entirely supersede sueh high priced nickel alloy steel in the manufacture of roller bearings by The Timken Roller Bearing Company, which produces probably upwards of 90% of all taper roller bearings made in this country.\u201d The affidavit also stated that: \u201cPor the purpose of comparison, I attach hereto three sets of photomicrographs, of two alloy steels, one of which, marked Steel I is of the formula C .18, Mn 1.43, Mo .24 and thus conforms to the Lothrop application, while the other alloy steel marked Steel II is of the formula C .15, Mn 2.90, Mo .23 and thus represents the Sargent &amp; Weitzenkom patent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Other illustrations were presented in the affidavit showing analyses of alloy steel within the limits of the Sargent et al. patent, together with illustrations of formulas referred to as being within the limits of appellant\u2019s ap- \u25a0 plication, for the purpose of showing the differences in the alloy steels produced from the various formulas referred to by the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">It may be observed in this connection that, although the witness stated that a formula consisting of carbon .15 per cent, and different proportions of manganese and molybdenum came within the Sargent et al. patent, he did not point out that the alloy steel marked \u201cSteel I * * * of the formula C .18, Mn 1.42, Mo .24,\u201d and other alloy steels, which, he stated, came within the range of appellant\u2019s application, also came squarely within the limits of the Sargent et al. patent. Furthermore, appellant is claiming nothing more than an alloy steel containing, in varying proportions, carbon, manganese, and' molybdenum. He, too, covers a rather wide range for each ingredient, admittedly within the \u201crange of the corresponding ingredients of the patent.\u201d The claims do not cover the alleged' discovery of a new use for alloy steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">In view of these facts, our decision in the ease of In re Pilling, 44 F.(2d) 878, 879, 18 C. C. P. A. 703, is applicable to the issues here. We there said: \u201cThe spread of the formula in each ease covers the same territory, and there is therefore no invention of one over the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">For the reasons stated, the decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
