The doors are not shown, but, as stated by the Board of Appeals, from the position of the hinges disclosed, it is apparent that they are of the conventional type.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Appellant discloses a structure designed to serve as a cabinet for a stove.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">The issue in the case was stated by counsel for appellant in his brief as follows: \u201cThe issue in this case is whether it involved invention to take a cabinet form known for centuries and modify it to make a cloak for a cooking stove, known at least for an hund.ed years, under all of the circumstances including the tireless efforts of the stove manufacturers to arrive at designs for stoves more acceptable than the existing forms, with the component elements before their eyes but without perceiving the solution of the problem, together with an immediate and substantially universal acceptance of the fruits of the inventor\u2019s efforts by the industry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">Counsel for appellant concedes that the adaptation of an old cabinet to a new use, no matter how convenient, useful, or beautiful it may be in its new use, is not invention. It is contended, however, that the following language of the Supreme Court in the case of Smith- v. Whitman Saddle Co., 148 U. S. 674, 679, 13 S. Ct. 768, 37 L. Ed. 606, has particular application to the issues here: \u201cIf, however, the selection and adaptation of an existing form is more than the exercise of the imitative faculty and the result is in effect a new creation, the design may be patentable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">In order to be understood, the quoted ex-s eerpt should' be read in connection with other pronouncements in the court\u2019s opinion. In discussing the law pertaining to mechanical, as well as design, patents, the court quoted with approval the following from the ease of Northrup v. Adams, 12 O. G. 430: \u201cTo entitle a party to the benefit of the act, in either ease there must be originality and the exercise of the inventive faculty. In the one, there must be novelty and utility; in the other, originality and beauty. Mere mechanical skill is insufficient. There must be something akin to genius \u2014 an effort of the brain as well as the hand. The adaptation of old devices or forms to new purposes, however convenient, useful, or beautiful they may be in their new role, is not invention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">It may be, as argued by counsel for appellant, that the involved design differs somewhat from the designs disclosed in the references. However, we are of opinion that those differences are not substantial; that appellant\u2019s design does not produce a substantially different {esthetic effect; and that it required nothing more than the skill of the artisan, or the designer, to so modify the references as to obtain appellant\u2019s design.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-18\">We think the tribunals of the Patent Office reached the right conclusion, and the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
