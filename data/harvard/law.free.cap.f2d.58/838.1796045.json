These decisions of the Commissioner reversed decisions by the Examiner of Interferences, who dismissed the oppositions and held that appellant was entitled to register the marks for which it had applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">As both appeals involve substantially the same questions, they will be considered in one opinion. By stipulation of the parties, both appeals were merged in a single record.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Appeal No. 2893.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">In this appeal, appellant seeks registration, under the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, of the notation \u201cModem Mechanics\u201d; the first word being placed above the second, and both being inclosed within an elliptical border or line, used as a title for magazines. Appellee sets up prior adoption and use of the notation \u201cPopular Mechanics\u201d as a title for a monthly magazine, and claims prior ownership of said mark and registration of the same on November 17, 1914, registration No. 101,201.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">The Commissioner in his opinion correctly states that: \u201cBoth parties have taken testimony and it satisfactorily appears that the opposer was long prior by many years \u2014 over a quarter of \u2019a century- \u2014 in the field in the adoption and use of its mark, that it has used it widely, and has established a circulation of its magazines which at the present time is substantially half a million copies, that it has spent considerable sums in advertising and promoting the sale of its magazine, and the opposer is, in consequence, in possession of a valuable good will. Damage is further predicated by opposer upon the similarity of the applicant\u2019s mark to opposer\u2019s corporate name. There is evidence of actual confusion of the goods of the applicant with those of the opposer. * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">Without passing upon the deseriptiveness of appellant\u2019s mark, the Commissioner held that confusion will result from the use of the two marks upon the respective magazines, and therefore sustained the opposition of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-17\">Appellant in its brief, and upon oral argument, contends that the word \u201cMechanics\u201d is descriptive and cannot be exclusively appropriated as a trade-mark. In its brief it states: \u201cs The applicant contends that the opposer has no exclusive trade-mark in the word \u2018Mechanics\u2019 at common law or by statute for the reason that \u2018Mechanics\u2019 is a descriptive name and not a proper subject for an exclusive trade-mark, but rather a word \u2018publiei juris,\u2019 incapable of exclusive pre-emption by any individual or corporation. * \u201c * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-19\">If this contention be correct, it would seem clear that the addition of the word \u201cModem\u201d would not render appellant\u2019s mark nondeseriptive, but, if anything, would make appellant\u2019s mark more descriptive than the single word \u201cMechanics,\u201d and therefore it would' not be registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-20\">If, on the other hand, the word \u201cMechanics\u201d be not descriptive, as applied to the title of a magazine, then we are 'clear that there would be confusing similarity between the title \u201cModern Mechanics\u201d upon one magazine and the title \u201cPopular Mechanics\u201d upon another.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-21\">In such ease, since appellee is the owner of a trade-mark registration of the notation \u201cPopular Mechanics,\u201d it must prevail, pursuant to the provisions of section 5 of said Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905 (15 TJSCA\u00a7 85).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-22\">We find no error in the decision of the Commissioner, sustaining the opposition of appellee and adjudging that appellant is not entitled to the registration which it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-23\">Appeal No. 2894.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-24\">The facts in this appeal are similar to those involved in appeal No. 2893, with the exception that the mark here sought to be registered by appellant consists of the words \u201cModern Mechanics And Inventions\u201d; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>word \u201cModem\u201d being placed over tbe word \u201cMechanics,\u201d and the words \u201cAnd Inventions\u201d under the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">In our opinion, the addition of the words \u201cAnd Inventions\u201d to1 the words \u201cModern Mechanics\u201d does not render the mark less descriptive than the words \u201cModem Mechanics\u201d alone, and we believe there is confusing similarity between the words \u201cPopular Mechanics\u201d and the words: \u201cModem Mechanics And Inventions,\u201d when applied to magazines.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">For the reasons stated in considering appeal No. 2893, the decision of the Commissioner in this appeal must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The decisions of the Commissioner of Patents in appeals Nos. 2893 and 2894 are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
