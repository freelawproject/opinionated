A sample of the \u2022coal so colored was offered in evidence, and is before us. It further appears from the testimony that, in a publication issued in ..September, 1928, appellee\u2019s mark was described as \u201cpurple\u201d in color, but that appellee did not furnish such description and had no part in the publication; that the coloring matter so applied was unsatisfactory because it was not durable, whereupon other experts were employed to develop a durable material which was accomplished; this second materi\u2022al, the eolor of which is conceded to be a shade \u2022of red, being first applied to coal by appellee in December, 1929. A sample of said coal so \u2022colored was also offered in evidence and is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">It is well established that, in an opposition proceeding, the Patent Office tribunals \u25a0may dispose of any question relating to the proposed registration that might properly be \u2022considered in an ex parte case. California Cyanide Co. v. American Cyanamid Co., 40 F. (2d) 1003, 17 C. C. P. A. 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Upon the oral argument before us, while it was conceded that, should we find that appellant\u2019s mark was not a valid trade-mark irrespective of the confusion-in-trade clause, we might properly so hold and affirm the decision of the Commissioner upon that \u25a0ground, counsel for both parties urged that this question be not here determined, for the reason that they were not prepared to argue 'before us the question of whether or not the marking of coal with eolor, without) forming a distinctive and uniform design, is an exception to the rule that eolor alone cannot be the subject of a valid trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">It appears to us that neither party hereto has any distinctive design applied to its coal, because it seems clear that by the method of spraying which both parties use there is no uniformity of design whatever, and the spots appearing upon one body of coal will not be the same as the spots appearing upon another, applied by the same party, and therefore it would seem that, under the general rule that color alone may not be relied upon for validity, neither of the parties has a valid trade-mark. .</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">However, for the purposes of this ease alone, assuming, without deciding, that colored spots applied to coal may be a valid trade-mark, we have no hesitation in finding that the mark of appellant so nearly resembles the mark used by appellee, prior to the first use by appellant of its mark, both being applied to identical goods, as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">If such a mark is subject to ownership, then it is owned by appellee, and for the reason stated appellant\u2019s mark should hot be registered. If appellee does not own its mark, then neither does appellant own its mark, and neither could be legally registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">Much has been said in the briefs of the parties, and upon oral argument, as to the technical definitions of purple and red. Appellant contends that, because red is found at one end of the spectrum and purple at the other, there is no similarity between them. As heretofore indicated, the Examiner found that the eolor used by appellee, prior to appellant\u2019s use of its red mark, was purple; the Commissioner found that it was red. <em>We </em>have carefully examined the eolor which was first used by appellee, as shown by the sample in evidence,, and find it unnecessary to determine whether the color so shown should be denominated a shade of red or a shade of purple. It is sufficient to say that, in our opinion, whatever the correct name of the color may be, it is, when applied to coal, confusingly similar to the eolor red.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">That appellee for a -time discontinued the use of its mark while experimenting for a more durable color material, and resumed its eolor marking of coal subsequent to appellant\u2019s first use, we think is immaterial. This did not constitute abandonment of its* mark. Saxlehner v. Eisner &amp; Mendelson Co., 179 U. S. 19, 21 S. Ct. 7, 45 L. Ed. 60. Neither do we think the fact that there was some difference between the color of appellee\u2019s later and earlier marks is material, because the color last used by appellee is within the range of eolor for which it would be entitled to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tection if the color first used was a valid trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">We might have contented ourselves with holding, without further discussion, that our recent decision in the case of A. Lesehen &amp; Sons Rope Co. v. American Steel &amp; Wire Co., 55 F.(2d) 455, 19 C. C. P. A.-, governs the ease at bar, because it was there held by a majority of the court that a mark consisting of a silver strand in wire rope was likely to cause confusion with a red strand in wire rope. We think there is greater similarity between the marks in the case at bar than existed in the marks involved in the ease above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b466-8\">GRAHAM, Presiding Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AoU\">(specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">I concur in the conclusion on the ground that the mark of applicant is not such a mark as is entitled to registration under the law. My views on this subject are set forth quite fully in the special concurring opinion in A. Lesehen &amp; Sons Rope Co. v. American Steel &amp; Wire Co., 55 F.(2d) 455, 19 C. C. P. A.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
