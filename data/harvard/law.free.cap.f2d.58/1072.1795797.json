Clarke, mother of William E. Clarke, deceased, under the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of March 4, 1927 (44 Stat. 1424, U. S. C., Supp. V, title 33, e. 18, \u00a7\u00a7 901-950, 33 USCA \u00a7 901 et seq.), made generally applicable to the District of Columbia by tbe Act of May 17, 1928 (45 Stat. 600, D. C. Code, title 19, e. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-21\">On Sunday, March 30, 1930, tbe day of' tbe accident resulting in Clarke\u2019s death, he-was in the employ of the N. Auth Provision-Company, a corporation engaged in the provision and garage business in tbe District;, bis duties being to act as day man, ear washer, and helper in tbe company\u2019s publie garage. On tbe morning of that day a ear belonging to William A. Schwartz, a mechanic in the employ of the company and a fellow employee of Clarke\u2019s, had broken down in-Virginia. Through the medium of a note left at the garage in the morning, Schwartz sought permission from the superintendent of the garage, Ered H. Stalfart, to use the towing ear of the company to tow in the disabled car. Tbe note was found by Stalfart later in the day, when he put thereon his \u201cO. K.\u201d About 5 o\u2019clock in the \"afternoon Schwartz (who was off duty that day)returned to the garage, found the approved' note, and asked Clarke, whose duties for the day were about to end (the night watchman having arrived), to help him (Schwartz) tow in the car. Schwartz testified: \u201cI told him I had my ear broke down in Virginia and bad to tow it in and I asked him to come along out there and pull it in. * * * I told him I had got permission from Mr. Stalfart to use a service car.\u201d Clarke and Schwartz then drove out to the Schwartz ear and started to tow it back, Clarke driving tbe towing ear. The towrope broke. Clarke drove on some distance, apparently not knowing that tbe rope had broken, when bis car stalled, and, while he was standing beside it and endeavoring to overcome ihe difficulty, was struck by a passing ear and fatally injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-22\">Stalfart testified that Clarke was hired as a washer; that his duties included \"anything that he was capable of doing, at tbe garage or elsewhere.\u201d Asked if it was part of Clarke\u2019s duties to tow in ears, he replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>\u201cYes, sir; it was.\u201d Asked whether the permission he gave Schwartz to use the tow car carried with it authority to have a driver, he replied in the negative. He was then asked how Schwartz could tow the car in. He replied that he could take a friend; that it was not objectionable for him to make use of Clarke. Asked if he had contemplated making a charge for the. service rendered to Schwartz, he replied: \u201cIf Schwartz had towed his car in, if my personal car had been towed in, or any other employee\u2019s, a charge would have been made, <em>* * </em>*'; I pay for my work and Schwartz pays, and every other employee pays for what he gets. There would have' been a personal charge made, irregar dless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">Stalfart was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-7\">\u201cDo you consider Clarke was merely- accommodating this man or rendering service to the company by going out with the service car? Answer. It would be pretty hard to answer that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-8\">\u201cQuestion. If you cannot answer it\u2014 that is the thing we have to figure out, you know. Would you permit him to do it on his own time then, if one of your fellow employees had been in distress? Answer. If he had gone out on the company\u2019s time, there would have been, or Schwartz would have paid, a charge for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-9\">\u201cQuestion. For his time? Answer. He would have paid a towing charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-10\">\u201cQuestion. He would have paid a towing charge? Answer. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-11\">\u201cQuestion. What would that consist of? What would make up the amounts of that towing charge, if you were figuring it? Answer. According to the number of miles, how -far he had to go for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-12\">\u201cQuestion. Would you charge for the time of the man that went out and got it in, in addition to the use of the car? Answer. I never have charged that way for towing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-13\">\u201cQuestion. You charge mileage, then, and that covers the expense of towing? Answer. Yes; it depends more on the distance, on the basis of mileage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-14\">\u201cQuestion. You charge on the basis of mileage? .Answer. Yes; the same as anyone else makes charges of that character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-15\">It further appears that on other occasions Clarke had worked overtime, but that he received no extra compensation for the service; that no employees in the garage received overtime pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-16\">Was there substantial evidence before the deputy commissioner that Clarke at the time of his injury was performing services \u201carising out of and in the course of\u201d his employment? If so, the decree must be affirmed. New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Hoage (App. D. C.) 46 F.(2d) 837, 59 W. L. R. 91; Hoage v. Murch Bros. Const. Co. (App. D. C.) 50 F.(2d) 983, 59 W. L. R. 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-18\">That the service performed by Clarke at the time of his injury was within the general scope of his employment is plain. Did the evidence justify a finding that at the time of his injury he was acting in the capacity of an employee ? The tow car was an agency-of the emploj'er, and Schwartz was expressly authorized to use it on this occasion. While Stalfart testified that authority to use-the tow truck did not carry with it authority to have a driver, he also stated that it was not objectionable for Schwartz to make use of Clarke\u2019s services. He later testified that if Clarke had gone out on the company\u2019s time, \u201cSchwartz would have paid a charge for it\u201d; that'the custom was to charge mileage, \u201cand <em>that covers the expense of </em>towing.\u201d We attach no particular importance to the-fact that Clarke\u2019s regular duties at the garage had about ended for the day, because the evidence discloses that he was frequently required to work overtime and that he received no extra compensation therefor. When Schwartz sought Clarke\u2019s assistance, he informed Clarke that he had obtained permission to use the service ear. While Schwartz-testified, in answer to a question on cross-examination, that Clarke\u2019s assistance was a personal favor to Schwartz, he did not testify that he made such a statement to Clarke. His testimony on this point was: \u201cI asked him to come along to drive one of the ears-, help me tow it in. I told him I had got permission from Mr. Stalfart to use a service-car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-19\">When Schwartz informed Clarke that he had obtained permission from Stalfart to. use the service ear of the company to tow in his car and requested Clarke to accompany him and perform a service which Clarke had frequently performed in towing other ears,, we think the circumstances were such as to justify Clarke in assuming that in acceding to Schwartz\u2019s request he would be performing a service for his employer. Had a similar service been performed for one other than an employee, the charge, according to Stalfart\u2019s testimony, would have been based on-mileage, and that would have covered \u201cthe expense of towing,\u201d including the driver\u2019s services. As an employee, Clarke must have known that every employee \u201cpays for what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>he gets.\u201d He therefore would have been justified in assuming that Schwartz would have to pay for the tow service based on mileage, and that this tow service would have entitled Schwartz to have a driver furnished for the tow car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">We are constrained to affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
