This method of pleading is in accordance with the Alabama practice. Evidence for the plaintiff was to the effect that the injury occurred after the switch engine had coupled onto a car which was destined to move in intrastate commerce and was on its way to pick up another car which was destined to move in interstate commerce; the intention being to place both ears on a transfer track, where each would be made up into a train for transportation to its destination.. During the course of plaintiff\u2019s testimony he said that, after he was thrown from the top of the ear by reason of a derailment, and while he was under the ear, he observed that frog points at an adjacent switch were worn, that a rail was broken, and that the roadbed had rotten ties in it; and, further, that he had noticed these defective conditions before the occasion of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The assignments are aimed at the refusal of the court to give to the jury defendant\u2019s request to charge that the verdict should he against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendant. In support of these assignments it is arguzd, first, that plaintiff\u2019s evidence disclosed no right of action under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, and, secondly, that, according to his own testimony, plaintiff had assumed the risk of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">In our opinion the evidence was sufficient to sustain a right of recovery under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act. At the time of plaintiff\u2019s injury the switch engine was on its way to get a car and put it in interstate transportation. It is immaterial that the switch engine, while making this movement, had attached to it a ear that was to move in intrastate commerce. The situation is not different than it would have been if the switch engine had been proceeding without any ear attached to it to get the interstate car. Norfolk <em>&amp; </em>Western Ry. Co. v. Earnest, 229 U. S. 114, 33 S. Ct. 654, 57 L. Ed. 1096, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 172; Erie R. R.. Co. v. Welsh, 242 U. S. 303, 37 S. Ct. 116, 61 L. Ed. 319. In Shanks v. D., L. &amp; W. R. R.. Co., 239 U. S. 556, 36 S. Ct. 188, 189, 60 L. Ed. 436, L. R. A. 1916C, 797, the test of employment in interstate commerce is stated to-be whether the employee at the time of injury-.\u201cwas * * * engaged in interstate transportation, or in work so closely related to it as to be practically a part of it.\u201d Applying-that test to the facts of this case, we think the-plaintiff at the time of his injury was engaged in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Aside from requesting a verdict against the plaintiff and in favor of defendant, no request was submitted by defendant invoking the doctrine of assumption of risk, but all' its special requests related to the question whether plaintiff\u2019s employment and the work of the switch engine had to do with interstate-commerce. There does not seem to have been any contention at the trial that plaintiff was barred from recovery under the doctrine of assumption of risk; but, because of the almost limitless defenses that might have been relied on under the Alabama practice of pleading in short by consent, we assume that there was such a contention. The most) that defendant can contend for is that, before his-injury, the plaintiff, who so far as appears was not capable of deciding whether the railroad track was reasonably safe, knew that the-frog points were worn, and that the roadbed was not in perfect condition because it contained some rotten cross-ties. This knowledge was not enough to entitle the defendant to a peremptory instruction, because it may well be that, notwithstanding his knowledge, the plaintiff did not appreciate the dangers of the situation. Whether he did or not was at most a question for the jury to decide. Central of Georgia Ry. C.o. v. Davis (C. C..
