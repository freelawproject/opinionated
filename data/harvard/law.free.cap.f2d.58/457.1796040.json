The mark is used on shaving cream and consists of the profile of the head and shoulders of a man, with the compound word \u201cPeau-Doux,\u201d and underneath the same the following: \u201c(Po-Do).\u201d The mark is said to have been used since March 1, 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The appellee opposes the registration, relying upon its registration of the trade-mark \u201cPeaudouee\u201d for skin cream, and the continuous use of the same in -interstate commerce since October, 1895. This registration is No. 250,012, dated November 27, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The opposer alone took testimony, and it satisfactorily appears that the opposer used its mark, as provided by law, long prior to appellant\u2019s entrance into the field. The applicant filed, as a part of its application, a disclaimer of the word \u201cPeau-Doux,\u201d except \u25a0 as used in its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">We agree with the Commissioner in his - decision that the goods of opposer and applicant are of the -same descriptive properties, and that confusion would result if applicant\u2019s mark were registered. Hence registration should be denied. It would be a work of supererogation for us to repeat here what we have said so many times. California Packing Corp. v. Tillman &amp; Bendel, 40 F.(2d) 108, 17 C. C. P. A. 1048; Sun-Maid R. G. of California v. American Grocer Co., 40 F.(2d) 116, 17 C. C. P. A. 1034; Harris v. Plough Chem. Co., 54 F.(2d) 967, 19 C. C. P. A.-.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">It is argued that the word \u201cPeau-Doux\u201d has been disclaimed, except in conjunction with this mark. This is of no importance. The confusion will continue, as Justice Robb, of the-Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, said in Fishbeck Soap Co. v. Kleeno Mfg. Co., 44 App. D. C. 6, while \u201cthe disclaimer woiild slumber in the archives of the Patent Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">It is vigorously argued by appellant\u2019s counsel that opposer cannot be heard to oppose the registration of appellant\u2019s mark, for the reason that opposer\u2019s mark is descriptive, not the subject of exclusive ownership, and was not entitled to registration. This raises the question of the validity of opposer\u2019s registered mark. It is the holding of this court that the validity of the opposer\u2019s mark will not be inquired into in opposition proceedings. Celotex Co. v. Millington, 49 F. (2d) 1053, 18 C. C. P. A. 1484; E. Daltroff &amp; Cie v. Vivaudou, Inc., 53 F.(2d) 536, 19 C. C. P. A.-.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
