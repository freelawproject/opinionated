Accordingly, we will consider only the claims above enumerated. Claims 20, 50, and 107 are sufficiently illustrative. They read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-22\">\u201c20. In an engine, the combination of a speed sensitive member, a valve gear, and means for regulating a supply of fuel, and said valve gear, by the action of said speed sensitive member, and means for varying the effective action of said speed sensitive member on said valve gear and fuel supply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-23\">\u201c50. In a steam engine having a valve motion cut-off a water supply for the boiler thereof, and means for operatively automatically controlling the said valv\u00a7 motion cutoff and water supply in accordance with the rate of speed of the engine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-24\">\u201c107. In a device of the character described, in combination, a source of fluid under pressure, an engine operated thereby, a valve gear mechanism, means for controlling-the supply of fuel, a speed sensitive device- and interconnecting means adapted to actuate said valve gear mechanism and said supply of fuel accordingly, independently of the-pressure of such fluid, and means for setting said interconnecting means for varying the-action by said speed sensitive device upon, said valve gear mechanism.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-25\">The references are: Prall 426,060, April-22, 1890; Christensen, 542,702, July 16,. 1895; Hoadley, 586,384, July 13, 1897; Thomson, 733,093, July 7, 1903; Drompp,. 782,902, February 21, 1905; Clark, 807,419,.

As we see it the extension of the idea of speed control to embrace other mechanism, normally manually controlled, as to the broad conception at least, is obvious, though it might require invention to work out a practical solution of this broad idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">\u201cThe Le Blanc patent shows a steam engine in which the water, fuel and air supply is controlled by speed responsive means. In discussing this patent appellant asserts that when running light a large quantity of fuel, water and air will be supplied the boiler and that under load the reverse will be true. As wo read the patent the reverse is true as to both assertions. See lines 44 to 48, page 2. This patent clearly shows an embodiment of the idea of controlling the fuel, air and water automatically from the speed of the engine and we see nothing broadly patentable in incorporating this form of control in an engine of a particular type such as a locomotive engine nor in one whieh has a speed controlled link motion such as in appellant\u2019s prior patent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">\u201cThe Lovegrove patent shows it old to control a damper in, accordance with engine speed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\u201cMaeFarren controls a throttle by speed responsive mechanism,and regulates the cutoff mechanism indirectly through steam pressure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">\u201cThe Muehka patent shows it old to interconnect the feed water control and valve gear. We see nothing inventive in controlling the valve gear of this patent by speed responsive mechanism such as used in appellant\u2019s patent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">\u201cThe remaining references show it old to interconnect various controls and are in the main merely cumulative. We see no reason for discussing them individually.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">It is vigorously contended by counsel for appellant that the Patent Offiee tribunals were wrong in holding that it was obvious to combine the various references; that the involved combination is new and useful; and that, therefore, appellant is entitled to a patent. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">The question to be determined is whether appellant\u2019s combination, new and useful though it may be, involves invention. If it does, appellant is entitled to a patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">We have given careful consideration to the various contentions made by counsel for appellant. However, we are of opinion that the involved combination was plainly suggested by the references, and that nothing more than ordinary mechanical skill was required to produce it. Holding these views, we deem it unnecessary to discuss other issues presented by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-16\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
