The post cards are provided with lines of perforation so that they may be easily detached from the book. Each post card is preaddressed to a stated firm. The record sheets which lie between the post cards have on one face blank spaces designed to be used as a want list. The books are supplied to customers of the firm for the use of the customer in making orders, keeping a record of the same, and for keeping a want list.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-25\">The references relied upon are:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-26\">Todd, 789,395, May 9, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-27\">Lewis, 972,550, October 11,1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-28\">Post card of Tolman Laundry, filed 1916.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-29\">The board pointed out that Lewis uses a folded sheet so that he can address a post card as well as place a duplicate order on it; that preaddressed cards were old in the art, as shown by the exhibit from the Tolman Laundry; that there was no invention in using a preaddressed card and omitting the lower half of the folded sheet, as was done in Todd; and that patentable novelty cannot be predicated on printing, but that it must reside in physical structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-30\">Since we agree with the conclusion and the reasons assigned therefor by the Board of Appeals, its decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-31\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
