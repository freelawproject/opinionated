L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), par. 2,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where an insurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>failed to pay, within ninety days, interest under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on a decision ordering G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 35, disability payments, but where the payment of such interest was not specifically ordered in the decision. We conclude that the employee is not entitled to the penalty award, and affirm so much of the decision of the reviewing board (board) of the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) reversing and vacating the employee\u2019s penalty award under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1). We vacate, however, so much of the decision vacating the employee\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and remand the matter to the reviewing board for a determination whether the employee is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees where there is a final order dismissing the insurer\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\"><em>Facts. </em>The facts are not in dispute, and are taken from the parties\u2019 agreed statement of facts dated March 18, 2004, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>uncontested procedural history recited in the reviewing board\u2019s decision. The employee, Charles L. Johnson, filed a claim with the DIA in September, 2000, requesting temporary total disability benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34. Pursuant to an administrative judge\u2019s decision dated June 28, 2002, the insurer, T.I.G. Insurance Company (TIG), was ordered to pay \u00a7 34 benefits at the rate of $423.49 from June 4, 2000, through December 4, 2000, and partial disability benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, at the rate of $231.49 from December 5, 2000, to date and continuing. Neither Johnson\u2019s original claim nor the decision mentioned G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50, interest. The decision was not appealed and neither party requested an amended decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">TIG issued a check, dated July 10, 2002, to Johnson for $19,156.04. This check was for the payment period December 5, 2000, to July 10, 2002. On July 17, 2002, Johnson\u2019s attorney wrote to TIG, raising several issues, including TIG\u2019s failure to pay interest under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50. On July 23, 2002, Johnson\u2019s attorney again wrote to TIG, indicating that \u00a7 50 interest was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">In October, 2002, Johnson filed with the DIA claims under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50 (requesting interest), \u00a7 8(1) (requesting a penalty), and \u00a7 13A (requesting attorney\u2019s fees). TIG then filed a claim under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14, requesting costs and penalties against Johnson for allegedly bringing his \u00a7 8(1) penalty claim without reasonable grounds. In November, 2002, TIG issued a check for $2,029.99 to Johnson\u2019s attorney with the notation \u201cWC CLAIMANT\u2019S ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES.\u201d In early December, 2002, Johnson\u2019s attorney returned that check to TIG\u2019s attorney, with a letter stating that no attorney\u2019s fees were presently owed and, given that the check amount was equal to the interest due to Johnson, requesting that a check in that amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>be sent to Johnson as interest due. Subsequently, TIG sent a check in that amount as payment for interest due Johnson under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">After payment of the interest, Johnson\u2019s claims for a \u00a7 8(1) penalty and for \u00a7 13A attorney\u2019s fees and TIG\u2019s \u00a7 14 claim were assigned for a conference. On April 10, 2003, an order under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, issued denying both of Johnson\u2019s claims and TIG\u2019s counterclaim. Johnson timely appealed, requesting a hearing before an administrative judge, but TIG did not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In a decision dated December 13, 2004, and relying upon a prior decision of the reviewing board that established the terms of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50, as self-operative, see <em>Drumm </em>v. <em>Viole Florist, </em>16 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 335, 337 (2002) (\u201cthe employee need do nothing in order to receive interest on unpaid compensation due\u201d), the administrative judge found that the statutory \u00a7 50 interest payment was within the terms of the June 28, 2002, decision, such that the penalty for late payment was applicable. The administrative judge awarded Johnson a $10,000 penalty under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), and attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A. TIG appealed the decision to the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">In a decision dated December 29, 2005, the reviewing board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s December 13, 2004, decision, ruling that the self-operative nature of the G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50, interest requirement was insufficient without specific language in the June 28, 2002, decision to render it a part of \u201cthe terms\u201d of that decision, and thereby trigger the G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1) penalty provision. In reaching this result, the reviewing board relied on <em>Megazzini </em>v. <em>Bell Atl., </em>19 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 167 (2005), which had not been decided at the time the December 13, 2004, decision was issued. In addition, the reviewing board reversed Johnson\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5), based on its reversal of Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 8(1) penalty award. The reviewing board did not consider, however, Johnson\u2019s claim for \u00a7 13A attorney\u2019s fees based on the conference order\u2019s denial of TIG\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Johnson has appealed to this court, arguing that the administrative judge was correct in holding that the self-operative nature of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50, is sufficient, even absent any language referring to the interest requirement in the hearing decision itself, to render it part of \u201cthe terms\u201d of the hearing decision under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1); and, in the alternative, that even if the reviewing board was correct as to the G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), claim, Johnson is nonetheless entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5), solely on the basis of the denial of TIG\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\"><em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cWe exercise de nova review of questions of statutory construction . . . and we must overturn agency decisions that are not consistent with governing law.\u201d <em>McDon-ough\u2019s Case, </em>448 Mass. 79, 81 (2006). Nonetheless, \u201c[t]he interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with primary responsibility for administering it is entitled to substantial deference.\u201d <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993). \u201cWhile the duty of statutory interpretation remains with the courts, we will not substitute our judgment for that of an administrative agency if its interpretation of a statute is reasonable and its findings are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Oakes\u2019s Case, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 84 (2006). See <em>Eastern Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 678, 683 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\"><em>Interpretation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), par. 2. </em>The penalty clause in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), par. 2, reads, in pertinent part: \u201cAny failure of an insurer to make all payments due an employee under the terms of an order[] [or] decision . . . shall result in a penalty of. . . ten thousand dollars if [payments are] not made within ninety days.\u201d See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Although Johnson asks us to construe \u00a7 8(1) as including the self-operative interest of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50, within \u201cthe terms of an order[J [or] decision,\u201d we are mindful that \u201c[a]s a penalty provision, [\u00a7 8(1)] must be strictly construed.\u201d <em>DeLano </em>v. <em>Milstein, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 923 (2002). \u201cA statute designed to enforce the law by punishing offenders, rather than simply by enforcing restitution to those damaged, is in the nature of a penal statute.\u201d <em>Collatos </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>396 Mass. 684, 686 (1986). The $10,000 penalty under \u00a7 8(1), par. 2, is in the nature of a penal statute. This penalty does not provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>restitution to the employee, but penalizes a late payment even though, as in this case, the insurer may eventually make that payment to the employee. See <em>Eastern Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 619, 629 (2001) (\u201cthe penalty provisions [of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1)] ... are enacted not to confer rights on employees, but instead to persuade insurers to make timely payments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">In light of the use of the language \u201cunder the terms of\u201d in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), par. 2, we agree with the reviewing board that \u00a7 8(1), par. 2, applies only to payments due an employee under the specific terms stated in an order or decision. Because the June 28, 2002, decision did not specifically award interest pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50, Johnson was not entitled to a penalty under \u00a7 8(1), par. 2. The plain language of \u00a7 8(1), par. 2, requires that a penalty be assessed only where an insurer fails to make payments due under the terms of an order or decision. If the order or decision does not specify that payment is due pursuant to \u00a7 50, or any other statute, no penalty under \u00a7 8(1), par. 2, may be assessed for the failure to make such payment. See <em>Eastern Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra </em>at 630 (\u201c\u00a7 8[1] does not apply to <em>all payments due,\u201d </em>so that where a payment \u201carises by operation of [a] statute[,] . . . [it] is not one of the \u2018payments due\u2019 referred to in \u00a7 8[1]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">As noted by the reviewing board, this interpretation is consistent with the legislative history of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50. In 1991, \u00a7 50 was amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 77, to require that the interest under \u00a7 50 \u201cshall be required by such order or decision,\u201d whereas the version of \u00a7 50 prior to that amendment stated only that the interest \u201cshall be paid by the insurer.\u201d \u201cThe [Legislature are presumed to understand and intend all consequences of their own measures.\u201d <em>Rambert </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>389 Mass. 771, 774 (1983), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>2 Met. 118, 124 (1840). The language of the amended version of \u00a7 50 correlates with the penalty clause language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), par. 2, which was added at the same time in 1991, in that \u00a7 50 requires that interest be awarded in the order or decision, and \u00a7 8(1) looks to the terms of that order or decision to determine whether there has been a failure to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\"><em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5), an employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>who successfully defends against a G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14, claim is entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. See <em>Richard\u2019s Case, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 701, 705-706 (2004) (employee entitled to \u00a7 13A[5] attorney\u2019s fees for successfully defending an insurer\u2019s \u00a7 14 claim even though employee\u2019s claim for benefits was ultimately denied). \u201cNo further analysis is required under the statute.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We therefore remand the matter to the reviewing board to consider Johnson\u2019s G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5), claim in light of his successful defense against TIG\u2019s claim under \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The decision of the board is affirmed insofar as it reverses and vacates the penalty award. The decision is reversed insofar as it vacates the award of attorney\u2019s fees, and the matter is remanded to the board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-13\">The penalty clause in G.
