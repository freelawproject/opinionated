In Superior Court, the Driscolls sought declaratory relief regarding the scope of coverage under their policy. After a trial based on an agreed statement of facts and the admission of certain evidence in lieu of testimony, a judgment entered declaring that the damage to the Driscolls\u2019 property was covered under the terms of the policy. Providence\u2019s appeal followed; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">1. <em>Facts. </em>Upon inspecting their Webster rental property to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>prepare it for a new tenant, the Driscolls discovered damage at that property, including outward-leaning outside walls, ceiling cracks, a two-inch drop in the roof, and other problems. The Driscolls timely submitted a claim to their insurance company, Providence. Providence denied the claim on the basis of its expert\u2019s opinion that the damage was caused by faulty roof design, a cause that is excluded from coverage in the Driscolls\u2019 policy. Unsatisfied with Providence\u2019s determination, the Driscolls hired their own engineer, who inspected the house and determined that faulty design had combined with the weight of snow from the prior winter to result in the property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">After trial, the judge ruled that the property damage was covered by the Driscolls\u2019 insurance policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge, as fact finder, accepted the engineers\u2019 opinions that \u201cthe precipitating cause of the damage to the Driscolls\u2019 property was the lack of stabilization devices, such as collar ties, in the attic, and that the damage is not related to settling or shrinkage.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, she found \u201cthat the weight of snow and ice from the winter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>1995-1996, . . . when coupled with the original construction design of the roof, caused most of the damage to the Driscolls\u2019 rental property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>As noted, we will not disturb the judge\u2019s factual findings in this appeal. (See notes 2 and 3, <em>supra.) </em>Our task is to determine the effect of the insurance contract under the circumstances found. \u201cThe interpretation of an insurance policy is a \u2018question of law for the trial judge, and then for the reviewing court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clendenning </em>v. <em>Worcester Ins. Co., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 658, 660 (1998), quoting from <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Cambridge Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 671, 673 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The Driscolls have a so-called \u201call risk\u201d policy. See <em>Bettigole </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 272, 272 (1991). The policy broadly identifies the \u201cCovered Causes of Loss\u201d as follows under paragraph A.3.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201cRISKS OF DIRECT PHYSICAL LOSS unless the loss is: a. Excluded in Section B., Exclusions; orb. Limited in Paragraph A.4., Limitations . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Given the policy\u2019s wide breadth of coverage, the insurer bears the burden of showing that the insured\u2019s claim falls within an exclusion. See <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Mut. Ins. Co., </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 818, 820 (2003). Here, Providence points to the collapse exclusion of paragraph B.2.i. as the applicable bar to coverage. This exclusion states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">\u201c[w]e will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">\u201ci. Collapse: Collapse, except as provided in the Additional Coverage for Collapse. But if loss or damage by a Covered Cause of Loss results at the described premises, we will pay for that resulting loss or damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">In turn, the provision for \u201cAdditional Coverages\u201d for collapse, paragraph A.5.d., states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">\u201cWe will pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>from risks of direct physical loss involving collapse of a building or any part of a building caused <em>only by </em>one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201c(1) The \u2018specified causes of loss\u2019 . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The phrase \u201cspecified causes of loss\u201d is explained under the \u201cProperty Definitions\u201d contained in paragraph H.6 as meaning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">\u201cFire; lighting; explosion, windstorm or hail; smoke; aircraft or vehicles; riot or civil commotion; vandalism; leakage from fire extinguishing equipment; sinkhole collapse; volcanic action; falling objects; <em>weight of snow, ice or </em>sleet; water damage. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Taken together, the collapse exclusion, paragraph B.2.\u00cd., and the \u201cAdditional Coverages\u201d provision for collapse, paragraph A.5.d., mean that Providence only insures certain kinds of collapse, namely, those due <em>only </em>to the causes listed in the latter paragraph. Here, no reading of the judge\u2019s findings could lead to a conclusion that <em>only </em>the weight of the snow and ice caused this damage, <em>even if </em>the damage constituted a \u201ccollapse.\u201d Therefore, the \u201cAdditional Coverages\u201d provision is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">We are therefore left to determine whether the collapse exclusion applies. We disagree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the damage here amounted to a collapse. On this point, we view as controlling the opinion in <em>Clendenning </em>v. <em>Worcester Ins. Co., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 660-661. In that case, due to hidden damage caused by insects, portions of the plaintiffs home were in danger of collapse. <em>Id. </em>at 659. Prior to any collapse, the homeowner razed those portions of the house before the home insurer could inspect it. <em>Ibid. </em>The insurer argued that the homeowner was not entitled to recover for property damage (other than that produced by a workman who had jumped onto the roof of a side porch, causing some support beams to give way) because the insured structure itself never actually collapsed. <em>Id. </em>at 659-660. Agreeing with the insurer, we held that \u201ccollapse\u201d included \u201cboth a temporal element of suddenness (though the noun may accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>modate a gradual loss of structure) and a visual element of altered appearance that comprises a structural collapse, distinct from the degenerative process causing the collapse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660. We added that \u201ccollapse, within the meaning of the policy, is a perceptible event or state caused by a specific degenerative process .... There are no degrees of collapse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661. See <em>Dreiblatt </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>264 F.3d 126, 129-131 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Providence points out in its brief that the Driscolls\u2019 roof was still in place, any destruction had not run its full course, a change of only a few inches of roof sag was perceptible, and \u201cthere was no evidence of a sudden collapse.\u201d Providence correctly notes that \u201c[n]o one in the case alleged a total collapse.\u201d Indeed, applying the <em>Clendenning </em>collapse definition to the facts of this case, it becomes clear that the collapse exception does not apply to the damage. The judge found that various types of damage had occurred: the outside walls leaned outward, cracks had appeared in the ceiling and interior walls, and there was a two-inch drop in the roof. None of these rises to the level of a <em>Clendenning </em>collapse. See <em>Clendenning </em>v. <em>Worcester Ins. Co., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 660-661.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Put simply, the coverage in the Driscolls\u2019 policy is broad. Although the \u201cAdditional Coverages\u201d for collapse provision does not apply, neither does the underlying collapse exclusion. The Driscolls\u2019 claim, unlike the <em>Clendenning </em>claim, did not require a finding that a collapse occurred in order for a loss to be covered. In <em>Clendenning, </em>the policy expressly excluded damage caused by insects except as may have been hidden and which resulted in a collapse of the structure. <em>Clendenning </em>v. <em>Worcester Ins. Co., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 659-661. Here, the physical damage caused by the weight of snow and ice is nowhere excluded, and to be covered, damage so caused does not require a collapse under the Driscolls\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Furthermore, no other exclusions apply. This includes the exclusion for settling, cracking, shrinking, or expansion under paragraph B.2.k.(4),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which the judge specifically and correctly found did not occur, and the exclusion for faulty workmanship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>or construction under paragraph B.3.c.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The latter exclusion does not apply because it is preceded by the following language: \u201cWe will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any of the following. But if loss or damage by a Covered Cause of Loss results, we will pay for that resulting loss or damage.\u201d Covered causes are, according to paragraph A.3. discussed above, all causes except those excluded in section B (or limited by paragraph A.4.). The judge found that <em>both </em>faulty design and the weight of snow and ice caused the damage. The latter is a covered cause of loss which is not excluded, and therefore the faulty design exclusion does not bar coverage. See Couch on Insurance \u00a7 101:47 (3d ed. 2005) (\u201cunless there is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>express policy provision to the contrary, the requirement that the peril insured against be the proximate cause of the loss does not require that it be the sole cause of the loss. . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Unlike the exclusion in paragraph B.l.,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the exclusion in paragraph B.3. does not include an anticoncurrent cause provision, which would bar coverage for damage due to certain causes regardless of otherwise covered causes of damage. See <em>Jussim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. 24, 30-31 (1993) (suggesting that anticoncurrent cause language in policy would operate to exclude coverage). Contrast <em>Alton </em>v. <em>Manufacturers &amp; Merchs. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>416 Mass. 611, 613-615 (1993) (even if policy might have covered one cause of damage, coverage was prohibited where coverage for another cause was excluded regardless of other contributing causes). For all of these reasons, we find no error in the judge\u2019s determination that the damage to the Driscolls\u2019 rental property is covered by their policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\">There is no merit to Providence\u2019s claim that to the extent the judge relied on the report of the Driscolls\u2019 engineer, the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment. The parties agreed that the competing engineers\u2019 reports would be treated as testimony from which the judge was free to make credibility determinations. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996). See also <em>Mollahan </em>v. <em>McGrath, 357 </em>Mass. 229, 232 (1970), quoting from <em>Frati </em>v. <em>Jannini, </em>226 Mass. 430, 431 (1917) (\u201cWhen a case is heard on an agreement of the parties as to the evidence, \u2018the agreement merely takes the place of the evidence which otherwise would be introduced in the usual way, and either the jury renders a general verdict or the judge makes a general finding founded upon that\u2019 \u201d). Moreover, \u201c[t]he question on appeal from a decision on facts agreed as evidence is whether on all the evidence the decision was warranted.\u201d <em>Mollahan </em>v. <em>McGrath, 357 </em>Mass. at 232. We are of the view that it was.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">We reject as meritless Providence\u2019s argument that the testimony of the Driscolls\u2019 expert was not admissible because it failed to meet the requirements of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 25-26 (1994). See <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579 (1993). Not only is this claim raised for the first time on appeal and therefore waived, see <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Retardation, </em>446 Mass. 286, 298 n.27 (2006), but the parties agreed that the reports of their respective experts would be admitted for the judge to consider as evidence at their jury-waived trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crouse, </em>447 Mass. 558, 570 n.11 (2006) (\u201c[t]o the extent that the defendant\u2019s claim rests on the judge\u2019s failure to assume the role of gatekeeper to preclude the introduction of \u2018junk science\u2019 evidence, it is too late for the defendant to request a <em>Lanigan </em>hearing\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-13\">The limitations paragraph is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Paragraph B.2.k. excludes \u201cOther Types of Loss\u201d such as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201c(1) Wear and tear;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201c(2) Rust, corrosion, fungus, decay, deterioration, hidden or latent defect or any quality in property that causes it to damage or destroy itself;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201c(3) Smog;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201c(4) Settling, cracking, shrinking or expansion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">\u201c(5) Nesting or infestation, or discharge or release of waste products or secretions, by insects, birds, rodents or other animals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">\u201c(6) Mechanical breakdown, including rupture or bursting caused by centrifugal force; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">\u201c(7) The following causes of loss to personal property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\">\u201c(a) Dampness or dryness of atmosphere;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-13\">\u201c(b) Changes in or extremes of temperature; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATL\">\u201c(c) Marring or scratching.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">\u201cBut if loss or damage by the \u2018specified causes of loss\u2019 or building glass breakage results, we will pay for that resulting loss or damage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b372-15\">Paragraph B.3.c. excludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-16\">\u201cNegligent Work: Faulty, inadequate or defective:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-17\">\u201c(1) Planning, zoning, development, surveying, siting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-18\">\u201c(2) Design, specifications, workmanship, repair, construction, renovation, remodeling, grading, compaction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-19\">\u201c(3) Materials used in repair, construction, renovation or modeling; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac5\">\u201c(4) Maintenance;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-20\">\u201cof part or all of any property on or off the described premises.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The paragraph B.l. exclusion states: \u201cWe will not pay for loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by any of the following.
