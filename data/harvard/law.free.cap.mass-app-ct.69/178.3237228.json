(Dan\u2019s Paving). At issue is the insurer\u2019s liability for benefits awarded to a Dan\u2019s Paving employee, Kenneth G. Pillman (employee), who suffered an industrial injury subsequent to the attempted cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">On the assumption that no policy was in force, the employee sought and obtained benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 35, from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund (Trust Fund). The Trust Fund moved to add Dan\u2019s Paving to the proceedings, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Dan\u2019s Paving, in turn, moved to add the insurer. With these additional parties before him, an administrative judge conducted an evidentiary hearing with respect to the cancellation issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The administrative judge determined that the attempted cancellation was ineffective, and in a split decision, the board affirmed his decision. Upon consideration of the insurer\u2019s appeal to this court, we agree that the policy was not effectively canceled and that the insurer is liable for any benefits paid to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><em>Facts. </em>We begin with a summary of the administrative judge\u2019s findings, supplemented by our own observations of the documents admitted in evidence and relied upon by the administrative judge in his decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1999, the insurer issued a policy of workers\u2019 compensation insurance to Dan\u2019s Paving for the period August 23, 1999, to August 23, 2000. Thereafter, the insurer sought to cancel the policy, as of April 4, 2000, for nonpayment of premium. It did so by mailing a notice of cancellation, on March 20, 2000, to 39 Drake Road, Fitchburg, Massachusetts, as evidenced by a certificate of mailing receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Before the policy was issued, the agent who produced the policy met with the principal of Dan\u2019s Paving, Michael Mc-Gane, at a different address \u2014 526 Electric Avenue, Fitchburg \u2014 where Dan\u2019s Paving\u2019s operations were located. It was, however, the Drake Road address, which was McGane\u2019s residence address, that was given to the insurer as the mailing address for Dan\u2019s Paving.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the policy was issued, the Drake Road address appeared on page one of the policy\u2019s three-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>page declarations, which, collectively were entitled \u201cINFORMATION PAGE \u2014 NEW POLICY.\u201d The Drake Road address was listed as \u201cITEM 1\u201d under the heading: \u201cTHE INSURED AND MAILING ADDRESS.\u201d Also listed under \u201cITEM 1\u201d were the words \u201cOTHER WORKPLACES NOT SHOWN ABOVE: SEE EXTENSION OF INFORMATION PAGE.\u201d The \u201cEXTENSION OF INFORMATION PAGE ITEM #1\u201d was located at page three of the declarations. There, beside the words \u201cADDNL\u201d and \u201cLOCATION NUMBER 002,\u201d the Electric Avenue address was listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The notice of cancellation was never received by Dan\u2019s Paving or McGane, who had moved his residence and had not given a new address to the insurer. Within a few days, the insurer\u2019s mailing was returned as undeliverable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The following notation was then made on the returned envelope: \u201c4-6-00 \u2014 Per comment on the CLP policy, agt. has no new address for the insured \u2014 Did not re-send cane.\u201d The insurer made no attempt to resend the notice to the Electric Avenue address.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\"><em>Decisions below. </em>On the basis of the above facts, the administrative judge determined that the attempted cancellation was not effective, \u201cas the insurer did not exercise due diligence.\u201d Although he did not identify any particular, supporting authority, he concluded that when the cancellation notice was returned, it was incumbent upon the insurer to mail a subsequent cancellation notice to the \u201cadditional address\u201d listed in the policy. He therefore ruled that the policy remained in effect at the time of the employee\u2019s injury<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and provided coverage for any benefits he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">On appeal, a majority of the reviewing board panel agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>with the result reached by the administrative judge, arriving at that conclusion by way of statutory analysis. The board opined that the operative cancellation statute was G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 187C, which generally governs the cancellation of insurance contracts in the Commonwealth when no other specific statute is applicable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After parsing the language of that statute, the board concluded that, when the notice was returned as undeliverable, the insurer was required to resend it to the other address contained in its records.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We agree with the board that the insurer was required to comply with G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 187C, as amended through St. 1990, c. 287, \u00a7 2, in order to cancel the voluntary workers\u2019 compensation policy at issue in this case. That statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201cA company issuing any policy of insurance which is subject to cancellation by the company shall effect cancellation by serving the notice thereof provided by the policy and by paying or tendering, except as provided in this and the following section, the full return premium due thereunder in accordance with its terms without any deductions. Such notice and return premium, if any, shall be delivered in hand to the named insured, or be left at his last address as shown by the company\u2019s records or, if its records contain no such address, at his last business, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>residence or other address known to the company, or be forwarded to said address by first class mail, postage prepaid, and a notice left or forwarded, as aforesaid, shall be deemed a sufficient notice. No written notice of cancellation shall be deemed effective when mailed by the company unless the company obtains a certificate of mailing receipt from the United States Postal Service showing the name and address of the insured stated in the policy.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Tracking the language of the statute, the initial and overarching requirement is that the insurer must \u201cserve notice\u201d upon the insured. The statute then specifies the ways in which notice may be served: by delivery in hand to the named insured, by leaving it at the named insured\u2019s last address as shown by the company\u2019s records, or, if its records contain no such address, at the named insured\u2019s last business, residence, or other address known to the company. Alternatively, the statute permits notice to be forwarded by first class mail, postage prepaid, to \u201csaid address,\u201d i.e., the last address as shown by the company\u2019s records, or, if its records contain no such address, the named insured\u2019s last business, residence, or other address known to the company. If a notice is \u201cleft or forwarded, as aforesaid,\u201d it \u201cshall be deemed a sufficient notice.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 187C.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The insurer contends that it fulfilled the requirements of the statute by sending its notice to the Drake Road address, arguing that the Drake Road address was Dan\u2019s Paving\u2019s \u201clast address as shown by the company\u2019s records.\u201d Contending that the sufficiency of a notice of cancellation must be determined as of the time of mailing, <em>Liberty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 263, 265 (1979), the insurer maintains that the propriety of that notice was unaffected by the insurer\u2019s later knowledge that the address it used no longer was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Essential to the insurer\u2019s position is the premise that the \u201clast address as shown by the company\u2019s records\u201d means \u201cmailing address,\u201d and the further premise that only the Drake Road address was Dan\u2019s Paving\u2019s mailing address (the Electric Avenue address being a \u201clocation address\u201d and not a mailing address). For reasons that are somewhat different from those expressed by the board, we think this analysis is problematic and conclude that the insurer did not satisfy the statutory requirements for canceling the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u201c[I]n construing a statute, its words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning according to the approved usage of language.\u201d <em>Taylor\u2019s Case, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 499 (1998), quoting from <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 741, 746-747 (1945). In ordinary parlance, the word \u201clast\u201d means \u201cmost up-to-date\u201d \u2014 and the word \u201caddress\u201d means \u201ca place where a person or organization may be communicated with.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 15, 702 (11th ed. 2005). Therefore, a reasonable reading of the statute is that an insurer attempting to cancel a policy of insurance must send notice to the most up-to-date place where the insured might be reached as contained in the insurer\u2019s records, i.e., the \u201clast address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">If, as reflected by the written terms of the policy, the insurer and the insured plainly have agreed to a particular, designated address for communications to the insured, there is some practical force to the insurer\u2019s position that the designated address should be considered to be the \u201clast address as shown by the company\u2019s records.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If, however, the insurer\u2019s records contain more than one address and the policy does <em>not </em>clearly identify the place where notices will be sent, then all addresses in the company\u2019s records potentially fall within the statutory category of \u201clast address.\u201d In such a case, we think it is not sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>under the statute for the insurer to send notice to only one such address and, after learning that the address utilized no longer is valid, to ignore other such addresses in its possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In the present case, the policy documents before us are equivocal, at best, as to the intended purposes of the two Usted addresses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Both the Drake Road and Electric Avenue addresses appear in the declarations, albeit on different pages, as part of \u201cITEM 1,\u201d under the general heading entitled, \u201cTHE INSURED AND MAILING ADDRESS.\u201d Thus both may be said to be mailing addresses. Similarly, both the Drake Road and Electric Avenue addresses also may be said to be location addresses. The Electric Avenue address is listed as \u201cOTHER WORKPLACE!] NOT SHOWN ABOVE,\u201d thus implying that both it and the previously designated Drake Road address are workplace addresses. Moreover, the Electric Avenue address is described as an \u201cADDNL\u201d location \u2014 \u201cLOCATION NUMBER 002.\u201d Inferen-tiaUy, the Drake Road address is location number one.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Because the purposes for which the two addresses were listed in the policy cannot meaningfully be differentiated, the insurer, in effect, possessed two \u201clast addresses\u201d for Dan\u2019s Paving. That being so, when the insurer elected to send notice of cancellation only to the Drake Road address and later learned that this address no longer was viable, we think it then was required to send another notice to the alternative \u201clast address\u201d in its records.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The insurer expresses concern about potential situations where many addresses are listed in a policy. We think, however, that it is not an unreasonable application of the statute to require that, if the parties\u2019 agreement does not clearly and unambiguously identify the place where communications are to be sent to the insured, then the insurer must send another notice of cancellation if it learns that an earlier attempt at notice was ineffective, and there is another plausible mailing address contained in its records.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Such an approach is in keeping with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, as illustrated by the various alternative notification methods set out in its provisions. The statute plainly reflects the Legislature\u2019s appreciation of the serious consequences that may flow from the cancellation of an insurance policy. Even though the statute does not go so far as to require actual receipt by the insured as a condition of cancellation, the statute\u2019s manifest intent is to cause the insurer to make reasonable efforts to communicate to the insured that the protection afforded by the policy is about to be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In a case involving the attempted cancellation of a workers\u2019 compensation policy, it is particularly important to effectuate the statute\u2019s purpose, because of the essential role that insurance plays in the compensation process. See generally 9 Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 150.03, at 150-17 (2006). Given the ramifications of cancellation upon the employer, the employees, the contributors to the Trust Fund, and the public at large, it is not too much to insist upon conscientious compliance with the statute. See <em>Armstrong\u2019s Case, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 693 (1999) (strictly construing cancellation requirements applicable to assigned risk policies).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The decision of the board ordering that the insurer is liable under its policy for benefits owed to the employee is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The administrative judge had previously allowed a motion to bifurcate the proceedings in order to resolve the coverage issue before hearing the remaining issues in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\">These documents include only a short excerpt from the policy \u2014 three sheets comprising the so-called \u201cInformation Page\u201d or declarations. We do not know whether the printed terms of the policy were available to the administrative judge or the board; in any event, they are not contained in the appellate record. As no one has called to our attention any potentially relevant language in the policy text, we must proceed on the assumption that none exists.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-14\">How this came to pass was in dispute. The agent testified that, after calling Dan\u2019s Paving to solicit its business, he met with McGane at the Electric Avenue address. He recalled that Dan\u2019s Paving\u2019s old policy \u2014 the one in effect before he became involved \u2014 listed the Drake Road address as the mailing address for the insured. He believed that he confirmed with McGane that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>he wished to keep that mailing address, and that he also confirmed the \u201clocation address\u201d at Electric Avenue. McGane testified to the contrary \u2014 stating that he informed the agent that the Electric Avenue address was to be used for billing, as was his custom. This testimonial conflict was not resolved by the administrative judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b206-11\">The envelope bore a stamp indicating that forwarding had expired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b206-12\">The injury did not occur until October 6, 2000, which was a little more than one month after the policy period would have expired. The insurer does not dispute, however, that the policy would have continued in effect beyond the policy period, absent proper cancellation or notice of termination on its expiration date. See <em>Frost </em>v. <em>David C. Wells Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 305, 306-309 (1982) (construing G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 63).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Under the board\u2019s precedents, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 187C, applies to the cancellation of workers\u2019 compensation policies written on a voluntary basis, requiring that notice of cancellation of such policies be given to the insured employer. See <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Northbound Train, Inc., </em>18 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 294, 302-303 (2004), and cases cited. This requirement augments that specified in the workers\u2019 compensation act, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 63, which provides that notice of cancellation must be given to the rating organization authorized by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 52. See, e.g., <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Evergreen Constr. Co., </em>13 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 62, 65-66 (1999); <em>Dembitzski </em>v. <em>Metro Flooring, Inc., </em>13 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 348, 354-355 (1999). See also <em>Trudeau\u2019s Case, </em>280 Mass. 429 (1932) (applying a related section, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 187D, in workers\u2019 compensation cases). In cases involving assigned risk policies, the board, construing G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65B, requires that the employer receive the cancellation notice. See <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Northbound Train, Inc., </em>18 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. at 303 n.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The dissenting board member would have reversed on the ground that the statute\u2019s requirements were fulfilled when the insurer mailed the notice of cancellation to \u201cthe name and address of the insured stated in the policy\u201d and obtained a confirmatory certificate of mailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\">We note that no issue is presented with respect to the tender of any return premium. Although the Trust Fund previously raised such an argument, it no longer presses it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The statute provides further that notice is ineffective unless the company obtains a certificate of mailing receipt showing the name and address of the insured stated in the policy. As the administrative judge found, the company did, in fact, obtain such a certificate. That does not end the inquiry, however. Obtaining a certificate of mailing does not satisfy the statute if the notice is not otherwise compliant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\">A consequence of reading the statute in this way is that, even if a cancellation notice sent to that address is returned as undeliverable, the insurer will have served notice in accordance with the statute, assuming that the insurer did not know at the time of mailing that the address no longer was valid. If the insurer did know at the time of mailing that the agreed-to mailing address no longer was valid, then its records would not have contained the insured\u2019s \u201clast address.\u201d The insurer then would have been required to resort to the insured\u2019s \u201clast business, residence or other address known to the company\u201d in order to satisfy the third clause of the second sentence of \u00a7 175C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Again, we note that the record does not contain a complete copy of the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\">As previously noted, there was conflicting testimony at the hearing below, unresolved by the administrative judge, concerning discussions between Mc-Gane and the agent about the mailing address for Dan\u2019s Paving.
