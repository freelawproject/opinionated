A judge of the Superior Court reversed an employee retirement classification decision by the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB), which had determined that Tabroff was properly classified as a Group 1 rather than a Group 4 employee, pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(2)(g). We agree that Tabroff should be classified in Group 4 and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\"><em>Background. </em>On March 14, 2002, Tabroff formally requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the board to change his classification from Group 1 to Group 4 pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(2)(g), for purposes of retirement benefits. Group 4 includes in this context \u201cemployees of a municipal gas or electric generating or distribution plant who are employed as linemen, electrical switchboard operators, . .'. and supervisors of said employees who shall include managers and assistant managers.\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(2)(g), as amended, St. 1993, c. 139. After reviewing his \u201cjob description, job title, the Electric Light organizational chart,\u201d and governing statute, the board determined that Tabroff was properly classified as Group 1. Tabroff appealed this decision to the division of administrative law appeals (DALA).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">An administrative magistrate of DALA made extensive findings of fact regarding Tabroff s job description and the Peabody Municipal Light Plant (PMLP) organizational responsibilities, as well as conclusions of law, which were then adopted, without modification, by the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB). The facts are not in dispute, and they may be summarized as follows. Since January, 1982, Tabroff has been employed at the PMLP, and, since June, 1988, he has held the position of Supervising Electrical Engineer. The pertinent portion of his job description states that his job falls \u201c[ujnder general supervision of the Manager and Assistant Manager; responsible for planning, organizing, providing direction, control, and supervision of the Power Resource Management Division. . . . Operate high voltage circuit breakers and switches as required. Serve on call twenty four (24) hours a day to address emergency electrical or environmental situations or serious malfunctions of substations, distribution, and transmission systems, including the supervision of Linem[e]n (Trouble-men), Power Plant Equipment Maintenancemen and Electric Meter Installers.\u201d The official organizational chart of the PMLP shows that Tabroff has direct supervisory responsibilities over a \u201cco-op student engineer\u201d and five dispatchers, all of whom are Group 1 employees for the purposes of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 <em>3(2)(g). </em>The direct supervisors of linemen (troublemen) during normal business hours are the PMLP Manager, the PMLP Assistant Manager, and the Supervisor of Electrical Distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The organizational chart, however, does not represent the du<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ties contained in Tabroff s job description. The organizational chart appears to represent supervisory responsibilities only during regular business hours and nonemergency situations. Despite this organizational chart, Tabroff\u2019s job description required him to directly supervise linemen (troublemen) during nonbusiness hours and emergency situations. As the administrative magistrate found, the exercise of these on-call supervisory responsibilities have occurred \u201c[o]n many occasions over the last twenty (20) years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The administrative magistrate concluded that the board was correct in classifying Tabroff as a Group 1 employee, having determined that \u201cneither [Tabroff\u2019s] title nor job description include the supervision of linemen/troublemen as part of his regular duties. Thus, although he may supervise Group 4 employees in emergency situations, he is not \u2018employed as\u2019 a supervisor of the type of personnel enumerated in Group 4.\u201d CRAB adopted and affirmed the decision of the administrative magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Tabroff filed a complaint in Superior Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, appealing and seeking to vacate CRAB\u2019s decision, and requesting that his classification be changed from Group 1 to Group 4. In granting Tabroff s motion for judgment on the pleadings, the judge reclassified Tabroff as a Group 4 employee. Relying on G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c), the judge determined that CRAB\u2019s decision was erroneous as matter of law. Distinguishing the case from <em>Gaw </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 250 (1976), the judge reasoned that Tabroff\u2019s job description specifically states that he supervises Group 4 linemen/troublemen and that \u201c[i]t makes no difference whether this supervision occurs during the normal business hours\u201d or in emergency situations during nonbusiness hours. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>Massachusetts courts give great deference to decisions of administrative agencies. See <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>425 Mass. 523, 525 (1997); <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 374, 375 (2000); <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 257 (1996). An administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute has long been relied on by Massachusetts courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u201cbecause of the agency\u2019s experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge.\u201d <em>Retirement Bd. of Taunton </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 914, 915 (2002). See <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commn., </em>447 Mass. 814, 821 (2006), quoting from <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1995) (\u201c[a] state administrative agency in Massachusetts has considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing\u201d); G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). We should not disturb an administrative agency\u2019s decision unless we determine \u201cthat the substantial rights of any party have been prejudiced\u201d based on one of the reasons set forth in G. L. c. 30(A), \u00a7 14(7).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The deference normally accorded to an administrative agency\u2019s decision is no longer appropriate when that agency commits an error of law, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c), or its decision is unsupported by substantial evidence, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Here, CRAB found that Tabroff s official job description included the requirement that he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cServe on call twenty four (24) hours a day to address emergency or environmental situations or serious malfunctions of substations, distribution, and transmission systems, <em>including the supervision of Linem[e]n (Troublemen), Power Plan Equipment Maintenance and Electric Meter </em>Installers\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">CRAB also found that (1) Tabroff was the only employee who had responsibility for all environmental matters concerning the PMLP; (2) he was required to exercise these responsibilities every hour of every day; and (3) \u201con many occasions over the last twenty (20) years, [Tabroff] has been required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>supervise line construction and substation maintenance personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">CRAB relied primarily on the <em>Gaw </em>decision in reaching its conclusion that Tabroff was not entitled to be reclassified as a Group 4 employee. In <em>Gaw, </em>the court held that inclusion in Group 4 would not \u201capply to employees who <em>serve </em>as linemen and the like or as their supervisors, but rather to \u2018employees\u2019 of such a plant \u2018who are <em>employed\u2019 </em>in those capacities (emphasis supplied).. . . The test for eligibility is largely the employee\u2019s title or job description.\u201d <em>Gaw </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 256, quoting from G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(2)(g). Gaw was a manager with at least one layer of supervisors between him and the linemen/troublemen. Although he occasionally supervised these Group 4 employees, he was not \u201cemployed as\u201d a supervisor of them and this responsibility was not reflected in his job description. <em>Id. </em>at 252-253, 256. CRAB found that the facts of this case were similar to those of <em>Gaw </em>in all pertinent respects. CRAB also found that neither Tabroff\u2019s job title nor job description included supervision of linemen/troublemen as part of his \u201cregular\u201d duties and that his \u201cregular\u201d duty was to supervise Group 1 employees. \u201cThus, although he may supervise Group 4 employees in emergency situations, he is not \u2018employed as\u2019 a supervisor of the type of personnel enumerated in Group 4.\u201d This was error. CRAB found Tabroff s duties during \u201cnormal business hours\u201d to be determinative for purposes of reclassification, concluding that his \u201cregular dut[y]\u201d was to supervise Group 1 employees. CRAB misunderstands what the court in <em>Gaw </em>meant when it determined that eligibility for Group 4 was based largely on \u201cthe employee\u2019s title or job description.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256. Unlike Tabroff, Gaw was not \u201cemployed as\u201d a supervisor of the type of Group 4 personnel enumerated in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(2)(g). While Gaw would occasionally supervise such personnel, such supervision was not part of his job description and not within the statutory meaning of \u201cemployed as.\u201d Furthermore, neither <em>Gaw </em>nor G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(2)(g), require or imply that the phrase \u201cemployed as\u201d is limited to regular business hours. CRAB\u2019s conclusion in this case ignored the fact that Tabroff s job description required him to be \u201con call twenty four (24) hours a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>day to address emergency electrical or environmental situations . . . including the supervision of Linem[e]n (Troublemen),\u201d who are unquestionably Group 4 employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The fact that this supervision would occur during \u201cnonbusiness hours\u201d or during emergency situations is irrelevant. Simply stated, because Tabroff s job description indicates that he, at times when necessary, supervises Group 4 employees, he is entitled to Group 4 classification. Therefore, to the extent that CRAB\u2019s determination was a finding of fact, it was not supported by substantial evidence and cannot stand. To the extent that CRAB\u2019s determination was a ruling of law, it was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Section 14(7) of G.
