In this appeal from the order denying his motion for a new trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant claims that his right to the effective assistance of counsel was impaired by his attorney\u2019s conflict of interest. Although we disagree with the trial judge\u2019s rationale for denying the motion, i.e., that the defendant consented to his attorney\u2019s continuing representation, we affirm on other grounds. We conclude that the circumstances created a potential, but not an actual, conflict of interest and that the defendant is not entitled to relief because he has not demonstrated prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant was charged with intimidating a witness, see G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, and threatening to commit a crime, see G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2, as a result of events occurring during the September, 2004, criminal trial of his brother, Ian Ag-banyo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As established by the Commonwealth in its case against the defendant, during Ian\u2019s trial, Ian and Charles confronted two police witnesses who had been observed talking to each other while under a sequestration order. Later, when Ian was found guilty, Charles softly told one of the officers, \u201cYou\u2019ll get yours.\u201d Charles then waited outside the court house until the officers appeared, made menacing gestures, and yelled at them. Among other things, he yelled, \u201cI\u2019m going to get you,\u201d and \u201cI come to your house, you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">As a result of these events, criminal complaints issued from the East Brookfield Division of the District Court Department charging both Ian and Charles with witness intimidation and threatening to commit a crime. Because of the relationship of that court and its personnel to the underlying matter, Charles\u2019s trial counsel moved for a change of venue. The motion was allowed, resulting in the transfer of the case to the Worcester Division of the District Court Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">On August 4, 2005, Ian and Charles, separately represented, were tried together in a jury-waived trial. That morning, while the defendant was waiting in the holding area for the proceedings to begin, his privately-retained trial counsel informed him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>that she had accepted an offer of employment from the Worcester County district attorney\u2019s office. Although the record contains differing accounts as to the extent of their conversation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is undisputed that this was the first time that the defendant learned that trial counsel had sought and obtained such employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">This development was disclosed to the trial judge, who then conducted a brief colloquy with the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>fendant signified his consent to continued representation by trial counsel, the judge proceeded with the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The Commonwealth presented its case through the testimony of three witnesses: the two police witnesses from Ian\u2019s trial, and an attorney who was with the officers when they encountered the defendant outside the court house. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel cross-examined all three of these witnesses, focusing on discrepancies in their accounts. Ian\u2019s attorney also cross-examined the police officers, but did not cross-examine the attorney witness. The defense then presented two witnesses: the attorney who represented Ian in the earlier case, and the mother of Ian\u2019s children, who also had been present at Ian\u2019s trial. The judge found Charles guilty on the charge of threatening to commit a crime and not guilty on the charge of witness intimidation, and found Ian guilty of witness intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The defendant appealed his conviction, obtained a stay of appellate proceedings, and pursued his motion for a new trial. The trial judge denied the motion without holding an evidentiary hearing, finding that the defendant, \u201ca college educated person, a person with prior experiences in the Massachusetts Court system, a person not suffering from any mental or physical disability, expressed his consent to the continuing representation by [trial counsel]\u201d and that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s consent was not coerced, nor the product of any confusion on the part of the defendant.\u201d Although the judge also stated that he \u201cassumefd] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>without deciding\u201d that this was a case of \u201cgenuine\u201d or actual conflict of interest and that therefore the defendant did not need to show any prejudice in order to obtain relief, the judge made a finding that, based upon his reading of the transcript, \u201cthe defendant was not prejudiced in any way by the continued representation by [trial counsel].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We begin by addressing the issue of the defendant\u2019s consent, which was the stated ground for the judge\u2019s decision. \u201cUnder art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, a defendant has the \u2018right to the full and undivided loyalty of his attorney. A defendant is entitled to the untrammeled and unimpaired assistance of counsel free from any conflict of interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>435 Mass. 274, 282 (2001), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. 16, 20 (1986). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>434 Mass. 670, 688 (2001). Nevertheless, even in a case of an actual, as distinct from a potential, conflict of interest, \u201ca defendant may consent to continued representation by his attorney \u2018so long as his consent is voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>425 Mass. 382, 392 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>395 Mass. 495, 498, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 906 (1985). However, the trial judge has an affirmative duty to conduct a colloquy to insure that the defendant is informed adequately of the risks and potential dangers of the conflict and to obtain the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment on the record that he understands this information. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra </em>at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">In the present case, the judge\u2019s exchange with the defendant (much like the colloquy held to be inadequate in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra </em>at 387 n.3) failed to cover important points. The judge neglected to inquire into the defendant\u2019s understanding of the possible conflict, to advise the defendant that he had a constitutional right to an attorney free of divided loyalties, to invite the defendant to raise or discuss any concerns that he might have, to inform the defendant that he could consult with another attorney before deciding what to do, or to offer a continuance to permit the defendant to investigate his options or obtain new counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>ibid., </em>and cases cited. Given these deficiencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>in the colloquy, we cannot conclude that the defendant \u2014 whatever his language ability and educational background \u2014 gave his consent voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">We think, however, that the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial may be sustained on alternative grounds. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ilges, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 503, 515 (2005). Although we certainly do not condone trial counsel\u2019s belated disclosure of a situation that could have been relevant to the defendant\u2019s choice of representation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we are of the opinion that seeking and accepting a position with the district attorney\u2019s office created a potential, rather than an actual, conflict of interest. That being so, to obtain relief from his conviction, the defendant was required to show prejudice; this he has not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">\u201cOur decisions have distinguished between actual and potential conflict of interest. To demonstrate an actual conflict, the defendant must prove that a genuine conflict existed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>434 Mass. at 688, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>376 Mass. <em>777, </em>781 (1978). If the defendant shows a genuine conflict, \u201cart. 12 does not require the defendant to show that the conflict resulted in actual prejudice or that it had an adverse effect on his counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fogarty, </em>419 Mass. 456, 459 (1995), and cases cited. However, where a defendant demonstrates only a potential conflict, the defendant\u2019s conviction will not be reversed except on a showing of actual prejudice. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">\u201cAn \u2018actual\u2019 or \u2018genuine\u2019 conflict of interest arises where the \u2018independent professional judgment\u2019 of trial counsel is impaired, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>either by [her] own interests, or by the interests of another client.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. at 20. \u201cThe burden is on the defendant to prove, without mere conjecture or speculation, both the existence and the precise character of the alleged conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, supra </em>at 694. Unsubstantiated claims of divided loyalties will not suffice. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">In the present case, because trial counsel was not employed as a prosecutor at any time during her representation of the defendant, she was never in the position of owing conflicting professional duties to the defendant and to the district attorney\u2019s office. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soffen, </em>377 Mass. 433, 437-438 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leo, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 283, 285-286 (1981). It remains to be considered, however, whether her future employment at the district attorney\u2019s office created a substantial risk that her representation of the defendant \u201cwould be materially and adversely affected by [her] financial or other personal interests.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Milley, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 689 (2006), quoting from Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 125 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">According to the defendant, trial counsel\u2019s future position \u201ccreated enormous economic, political and social pressure . . . not to upset her new employers and colleagues by aggressively defending this case.\u201d In particular, the defendant posits that trial counsel could not vigorously cross-examine the police witnesses, lest they become personally antagonized, refuse to cooperate with her when she assumed her new job, and enlist their colleagues to do the same. Thus, the defendant contends, trial counsel\u2019s personal interest in her future success as a prosecutor conflicted with her ability to represent him zealously and effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">We think, however, that the defendant\u2019s unsubstantiated assumptions about the behavior of both the police witnesses and trial counsel are too speculative to establish an actual conflict of interest. The possibility that police witnesses, familiar with the adversary system, would take personal offense at counsel\u2019s cross-examination and subsequently retaliate by sabotaging her work as a prosecutor is remote, at best, and the likelihood that counsel would \u201cpull her punches\u201d to avoid this possibility is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>even more remote.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, we view the situation as presenting only a potential conflict, requiring the defendant to demonstrate that, in fact, trial counsel did not effectively represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">We are not alone in rejecting the position that defense counsel\u2019s future employment as a prosecutor creates a per se, actual conflict of interest. See, e.g., <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Bunnell, </em>33 F.3d 1193, 1198-1199 (9th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1024 (1995); <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>196 Cal. App. 3d 1253, 1257-1258 (1987); <em>People </em>v. <em>Doggett, </em>255 Ill. App. 3d 180, 185-186 (1993); <em>Catala </em>v. <em>State, </em>168 Md. App. 438, 460-461 (2006).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because of its close factual similarities, we find <em>Garcia </em>to be particularly instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">In <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Bunnell, supra </em>at 1194-1195, defense counsel announced on the morning of trial that, at the end of the case, he was commencing a position with the prosecuting district attorney\u2019s office. Although the defendant in <em>Garcia </em>was found to have effectively waived his right to conflict-free counsel, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit also opined that the attorney had no actual conflict of interest, as there was \u201cno . . . active representation of competing interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198. The court further observed that \u201c[w]e generally presume that the lawyer is fully conscious of the overarching duty of complete loyalty to his or her client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198-1199, quoting from <em>Burger </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>483 U.S. 776, 784 (1987). \u201cGiven the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>inherently transitory nature of representation in the area of criminal law, as well as the potentially unlimited reach of the guilt-by-association logic [the defendant] would have us apply, we must significantly rely on the integrity of counsel in evaluating such potential conflicts.\u201d <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Bunnell, supra </em>at 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Like the court in <em>Garcia, </em>we are unpersuaded that there was a substantial risk that an attorney in trial counsel\u2019s position would be unable to represent the defendant to the best of her abilities. Not only do we think that attorneys generally can be relied upon to act with integrity, we also find it implausible that counsel deliberately would turn in a weak performance when doing so would only demonstrate to her prospective colleagues that she was either unskilled or unethical.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">It follows that, because the defendant has not shown an actual conflict of interest, he may obtain relief from his conviction only \u201cif he demonstrates a potential conflict which materially prejudiced his defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. at 24. \u201cActual prejudice is measured against the standard in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), as in cases involving ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croken, </em>432 Mass. 266, 272 (2000). In other words, the defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s conduct fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\u201d and that, as a result, the defendant \u201clikely [was] deprived ... of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra. </em>When the complained-of conduct constitutes an exercise of strategic or tactical judgment, the defendant must demonstrate that his attorney\u2019s performance was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d when undertaken. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edward, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 521, 524 (1993), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>409 Mass. 266, 273 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">We observe at the outset that the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance is substantially undercut by the fact that trial counsel secured the defendant\u2019s acquittal of the more serious charge of intimidation of a witness. Moreover, like the judge, we have reviewed the transcript of the defendant\u2019s trial and see no indication that the defendant was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s continued representation. To the contrary, the record reveals that she \u201cvigorously and skillfully represented the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>fendant at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croken, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 922 (2003). Counsel cross-examined the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, including the police officers, to elicit inconsistencies in their testimony, and she then used those inconsistencies to argue that the officers fabricated their charges in retaliation for being accused of violating the sequestration order at Ian\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Although trial counsel did not specifically question the officers about their alleged violation of the sequestration order, that subject already had been mined during cross-examination by Ian\u2019s attorney. It was not ineffective for counsel to avoid needless repetition, particularly in the context of a bench trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Drew, 447 Mass. 635, 650 (2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 2269 (2007). Other claimed deficiencies also are not indicative of ineffective assistance. Trial counsel\u2019s recommendations that the defendant proceed jury-waived and that he not testify at trial were tactical choices not shown to be manifestly unreasonable. And counsel\u2019s failure to object to alleged hearsay did not deprive the defendant of any substantial ground of defense, as the testimony in question was either admissible or harmless. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>412 Mass. 375, 392 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The defendant\u2019s final argument, that the judge abused his discretion by not holding an evidentiary hearing prior to denying the motion for a new trial, is also without merit. In his motion for a new trial, the defendant included an alternative request for relief \u2014 that he be afforded a hearing \u201cto determine the precise nature and extent of trial counsel\u2019s conflict.\u201d However, he gave no explanation of the factual issues that he wished to pursue or the witnesses that he wished to examine. On appeal, the defendant takes a different position, claiming that a hearing was required so that he could \u201cexamine other areas of potential prejudice not obvious from the transcript.\u201d Evidently, this would have involved examining trial counsel under oath on topics such as why she adopted certain strategies and whether she discussed the defendant\u2019s case during her interviews with the district attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">In view of the fact that the defendant\u2019s appellate argument was not made below, we will not disturb the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion to decide the motion without a hearing. See generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, </em>442 Mass. 341, 348 (2004). Moreover, because no credible or persuasive theory of prejudice was evident from the trial record or the information presented in the defendant\u2019s motion and affidavits, it appears, in any event, that holding a hearing would have accomplished nothing. <em>Id. </em>at 348-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-17\">Appellate counsel for the defendant was not trial counsel in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b872-8\">The appeal before us is a consolidated appeal from the defendant\u2019s conviction and the order denying his motion for a new trial; however, the only issues presented are those raised in the new trial motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b872-9\">To avoid confusion, we refer to Charles Agbanyo as \u201cthe defendant\u201d or \u201cCharles\u201d and to Ian Agbanyo as \u201cIan.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The defendant supported his motion for a new trial with his own affidavit, which averred, inter alla, that trial counsel initiated the discussion by telling him that she could not represent him anymore after trial that day. When he asked why, she informed him for the first time that she had taken a job as a prosecutor with the Worcester County district attorney\u2019s office. She then asked him how he felt about her representing him that day. He told her to \u201cdo the best she could.\u201d However, as the affidavit indicated, he was angry and upset and did not know what else to say. The defendant also averred that trial counsel did not advise him as to what his options were if he did not want her to represent him at trial. Although she had met with him approximately one or two weeks prior to the day of trial, trial counsel never told the defendant that she had been interviewing with or had been offered a job by the Worcester County district attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The defendant also submitted an affidavit from his appellate counsel, which stated that he had made inquiries of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel and had received electronic mail messages (e-mail) in response. In these e-mails, which were appended to the affidavit, trial counsel wrote that she began interviewing for the position at the district attorney\u2019s office in June, 2005, and started her new position in September, 2005. She did not indicate when she received the job offer, even though the defendant\u2019s appellate counsel asked her to provide this information. Trial counsel acknowledged in the e-mail that she informed the defendant about her new position on the day of trial, and stated further that she told him that he could hire another attorney and had the option of not moving forward with the case. She also noted that she successfully had represented the defendant in other criminal cases, that she had prepared for trial, and that, while she explained to the defendant that it was his decision whether to continue to use her services, she expressed confidence in her ability to represent him. According to trial counsel, the defendant agreed to let her go forward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b873-8\">The colloquy, in its entirety, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-9\">The court: \u201cMr. Agbanyo, you\u2019ve been made aware that [your trial counsel] has an arrangement to become employed by the office of the district attorney?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-10\">The defendant: \u201cThat [ric] what she told me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-11\">The court: \u201cThe middle district.

The Supreme Judicial Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, finding an actual conflict between counsel\u2019s \u201cfinancial interest in not antagonizing his firm\u2019s client by a vigorous cross-examination designed to discredit him, and his duty to consider only [the defendant\u2019s] best interests in deciding whether and how to cross-examine [the witness].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168.

In that case, relied upon by the defendant, the court did not decide whether defense counsel\u2019s upcoming employment with the county attorney\u2019s office presented an actual or potential conflict. <em>Id. </em>at 871-872. The court held, however, that the defendant was entitled to habeas corpus relief because, without conducting an adequate inquiry into the nature of the conflict, the trial judge denied motions filed by both the defendant and defense counsel (and supported by the prosecutor) seeking permission for defense counsel to withdraw because of ethical concerns. <em>Id. </em>at 867, 873-874.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
