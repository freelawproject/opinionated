The BHA commenced the summary process action after Bridgewaters pleaded guilty to a series of criminal charges stemming from his assault on his brother, Eric Bridgewa-ters (Eric). Bridgewaters\u2019s principal claim on appeal is that the BHA and the Housing Court failed to consider his entitlement to a reasonable accommodation for a mental illness that produced the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>Since April 1, 2000, Bridgewaters has been a tenant under a written lease in the BHA\u2019s public housing complex located at 129 Elm Hill Avenue in the Dorchester section of Boston. Among other things, Bridgewaters agreed in the lease to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">\u201c[c]onduct [himself] ... in a manner which will not disturb any other resident\u2019s or neighbor\u2019s peaceful enjoyment of their accommodations, will not harass, injure, endanger, threaten or unreasonably disturb any other resident . . . and which will be conducive to maintaining the development in a decent, safe and sanitary condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">The lease also provided for termination if Bridgewaters engaged in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-11\">\u201c[a]ny criminal or other activity which threatens the health or safety of another resident or a BHA employee, or which threatens their rights to peaceful enjoyment of public housing premises, or which threatens the health or safety of any person residing in the immediate vicinity of the public housing premises [or] [a]ny violent . . . criminal activity on or off the BHA property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(1)(6) (2000); G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>On January 10, 2004, Bridgewaters was involved in a physical altercation with his partially paralyzed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> twin brother, Eric, who was a tenant in a separate unit of the 129 Elm Hill Avenue development. According to Eric, he and Bridgewaters were arguing about childhood favoritism, slights, and insults, when suddenly Bridgewaters threw a glass of water in his face, then threw him \u201cto the floor, kicked him in the eye and forehead and stomped and kicked him repeatedly about the neck and back.\u201d As the trial judge noted in his \u201cMemorandum of Decision and Order on Defendant\u2019s Motion for Relief from Judgment,\u201d the beating was so severe that Eric \u201csuffered paralysis in his other leg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The police were called and came to the scene. Bridgewaters met the responding officers outside the apartment building, hoping \u201cto tell his side of the story before the officers spoke to Eric.\u201d Among other things, Bridgewaters informed the police that Eric\u2019s injuries were self-inflicted and that he had only punched Eric once, in self-defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, as noted by the judge in his memorandum, Eric\u2019s medical records indicated injuries that were \u201cconsistent with Eric\u2019s testimony that he was kicked in the eye, forehead, neck and back.\u201d The police arrested Bridgewaters, and following a plea or admission to sufficient facts, he was found guilty of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, see G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A; assault and battery, see G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A; and assault and battery on a person with a disability, see G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13K.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Relying on the lease provisions dealing with criminal activity, the BHA commenced a summary process action seeking to evict Bridgewaters from the complex. Bridgewaters did not file a written answer to the BHA\u2019s complaint. At trial, he represented himself, although he had been represented by counsel earlier, and offered testimony in which he recounted his version (or versions) of what had happened on the night in question. Throughout the trial, Bridgewaters insisted that some of Eric\u2019s injuries were self-inflicted and that any injuries he himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>inflicted were the product of self-defense. Bridgewaters also testified that Eric was lying about the attack or exaggerating the magnitude of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">On four occasions during the trial, Bridgewaters testified that he suffered from bipolar disorder and manic depression<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and had not been taking his prescribed medication at the time of the assault. Although Bridgewaters had not asked before or during the trial for a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d for his mental health issues,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial judge inquired at one point whether the matter should be referred to the Boston Tenancy Preservation Program (TPP).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the attorney for BHA stated that, because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the severity of Bridgewaters\u2019s assault, it was not interested in preserving Bridgewaters\u2019s tenancy. As a result, the judge concluded that the TPP process could not be invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Ultimately, the judge found \u201cthat [Bridgewaters] violated a provision of his lease by committing a crime on the public housing development grounds that threatened the health and safety of another resident.\u201d Accordingly, he granted the BHA possession of Bridgewaters\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">After trial, Bridgewaters obtained counsel and filed a \u201cMotion to Alter/Amend Or Reconsider Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law and Order for Judgment, Or Provide Relief from Judgment.\u201d The motion, brought under Mass.R.Civ.P. 59, 365 Mass. 827 (1974),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> sought relief from the Housing Court\u2019s judgment, arguing that Bridgewaters was entitled to a reasonable accommodation from application of the BHA\u2019s rules and policies because he was handicapped by mental disabilities, specifically bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. The judge denied the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-7\">\u201cMotion is DENIED. Issue not raised at trial or before; even if it were, <em>Peabody Properties[, Inc.] </em>v. <em>Sherman[, </em>418 Mass. 603 (1994),] controls. [Bridgewaters] took guilty plea to violent acts, no reasonable accommodation [would] be required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Bridgewaters then filed a similar motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), which also raised, for the first time, the issue of a defective notice to quit. The claimed defect was a statement in the notice that it was \u201ceffective immediately\u201d when the lease and the fair housing laws required a \u201creasonable period of time\u201d to vacate. In a thoughtful memorandum analyzing all the posttrial claims Bridgewaters had raised, the judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">On appeal, Bridgewaters maintains that he is a disabled individual entitled to reasonable accommodations in the application of BHA rules and procedures and that his eviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>without an attempt to accommodate his disability constitutes discrimination in violation of several Federal and State laws, including the Federal Rehabilitation Act (Rehabilitation Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (2000); the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (Fair Housing Act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B) (2000); the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 et seq. (1990); the Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(6) and (7A); and art. 114 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. He also maintains that the notice of termination was defective and that the judge abused his discretion in denying relief pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.R 60(b)(1). We find no error and therefore affirm.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">2. <em>Analysis. </em>\u201cWhen reviewing the trial judge\u2019s decision, we accept his findings of fact as true unless they are clearly erroneous, and we give due regard to the judge\u2019s assessment of the witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>Andover Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>Shkolnik, </em>443 Mass. 300, 306 (2005) <em>(Andover Hous. Authy.), </em>citing Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996). However, \u201cwe scrutinize without deference the legal standard which the judge applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass. 619, 621 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">a. <em>Reasonable accommodation. </em>Several Federal and State laws prohibit the BHA from discriminating against a tenant on the basis of his or her mental disability. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 et seq.; G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(6), (7A). Under fair housing laws, discrimination includes a landlord\u2019s \u201crefusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B). See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(7A)(2) (same language).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">The thrust of Bridgewaters\u2019s posttrial motions and his appeal is that his mental illness is a handicap controllable by medication. He claims that he attacked his brother because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>was not taking any medication. Now back on appropriate medication and more closely supervised by his doctors and therapists, he urges that he is entitled to a reasonable accommodation, namely, a second chance from the BHA. Bridgewaters further claims that the BHA\u2019s failure to investigate the viability of his proposed reasonable accommodation constitutes discrimination under the fair housing and antidiscrimination laws. He insists that he properly asserted an affirmative defense at trial based on his handicap and that the trial judge erred in failing to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The parties spend a large amount of time in their briefs discussing the merits of Bridgewaters\u2019s request for a reasonable accommodation. They dispute whether Bridgewaters is indeed disabled. They argue about BHA\u2019s knowledge of Bridgewaters\u2019s alleged disability. They also argue how, if at all, exceptions to the fair housing and antidiscrimination laws for threatening or egregious behavior should apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The difficulty with these arguments is that all except the last proceed in the absence of an evidentiary record sufficient to support them. Although \u201crefusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford [a handicapped] person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling,\u201d is discrimination prohibited by State and Federal law, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B); G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(7A)(2), typically \u201c[t]he determination whether a requested accommodation is reasonable is fact specific and will be resolved on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Andover Hous. Authy., </em>443 Mass. at 307.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While Bridgewaters mentioned his mental health problems at trial and in posttrial submissions, see notes 3 &amp; 4, <em>supra, </em>the arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>raised in the appellate briefs were not the subject of trial testimony or other evidence of the type that is always necessary if abstract claims are to become fact-based contentions that a court can resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">From Bridgewaters\u2019s standpoint, though, the problem is deeper, for decided cases show that his conduct was of a kind and quality that relieved the BHA of its customary obligation to explore reasonable accommodations. An understanding of that conclusion requires a brief review of several \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d cases in the employment and housing areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">First, in <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>United Airlines, Inc., </em>421 Mass. 55 (1995) <em>(Garrity), </em>the Supreme Judicial Court faced an airline customer service representative\u2019s claim that her alcoholism had led her to violate company rules and to engage in conduct detrimental to her employer\u2019s interests. She further claimed that the employer had discriminated against her in violation of G. L. c. 151B by discharging her for her conduct without considering reasonable accommodations to deal with her illness. <em>Id. </em>at 59-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Proof of Garrity\u2019s discrimination claim required her to prove that she was handicapped, that she had been fired because of her handicap, and that in spite of the handicap, she was qualified for her job, i.e., that she was a \u201cqualified handicapped person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 1(16), 4(16). The court agreed that Garrity was handicapped by alcoholism and that she had been fired because of that handicap. <em>Garrity, supra </em>at 61. Following the lead of several Federal decisions, however, the court concluded that, as matter of law, she could not demonstrate that she was qualified for the job. <em>Id. </em>at 61-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">In reaching that decision, the court considered the basic purpose of laws prohibiting handicap discrimination and agreed with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia when it said that Federal laws prohibiting handicap discrimination are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-9\">\u201cdesigned to put individuals with disabilities on equal footing with nondisabled people in regards to the hiring, promotion, and discharge decisions of the federal govem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>ment and its grantees. [Those laws are] not designed to insulate them from disciplinary actions which would be taken against any employee regardless of his status.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 62-63, quoting from <em>Wilber </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>780 F. Supp. 837, 840 (D.D.C. 1992). Against that backdrop, the court announced that it would follow the lead of several Federal decisions to the effect that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-6\">\u201ca handicapped employee who engages in conduct significantly inimical to the interests of his employer and in violation of the employer\u2019s mies is not an \u2018otherwise qualified\u2019 person within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. We conclude that such a person is not a \u2018qualified handicapped person\u2019 within the meaning of G. L. c. 15 IB and therefore is not entitled to the protection of that statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">More recently, in <em>Mammone </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>446 Mass. 657 (2006) <em>(Mammone), </em>the court reached the same conclusion in the case of an employee who was discharged after serious misconduct that he alleged was the result of his bipolar disorder. The court observed that its decision in <em>Garrity </em>\u201cconfirmed the commonsense notion that an employee is not \u2018qualified\u2019 for a particular job \u2014 i.e., cannot perform the essential functions of that job, even with reasonable accommodation \u2014 if he or she takes part in \u2018egregious misconduct\u2019 in the workplace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667. It then stated that an employee\u2019s ability to perform in satisfactory fashion in the future if provided with a reasonable accommodation was not a relevant consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-9\">\u201c[Ejgregious workplace misconduct disqualifies] an employee from protection of the statute without regard to whether that employee could at some future date conform her behavior to acceptable standards. The statutory definition does not require otherwise. An employee who has committed egregious workplace misconduct (conduct so inimical to an employer\u2019s interest that any employee would be fired for the same acts) has precluded himself from \u2018performing the essential functions of the position,\u2019 with or without a reasonable accommodation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Both <em>Garrity </em>and <em>Mammone </em>dealt with claims of employment discrimination, not housing discrimination of the type Bridge-waters alleges here. But <em>Andover Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>Shkolnik, </em>443 Mass. 300 (2005), dealt with a claim that a public housing authority had discriminated against two tenants against whom it brought eviction proceedings without first engaging in efforts to provide them with a reasonable accommodation for their handicap. One of the tenants had mental health issues and had repeatedly engaged in behavior that substantially disturbed the neighbors. <em>Id. </em>at 301-302.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The court affirmed a Housing Court decision awarding possession to the housing authority. In the process, the court observed that the term \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d did not appear in either the State or Federal fair housing statutes, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(2) and G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(7A)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 310. The term did appear, however, in the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, to which, in the court\u2019s view, the fair housing statutes were analogous. <em>Ibid. </em>For that reason, the court said, it saw</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">\u201clittle reason not to consider whether a [tenant] is a \u2018qualified\u2019 handicapped person in the context of a housing discrimination claim \u2018because many of the issues that arise in the \u201cqualified\u201d analysis, also arise in the context of the \u201creasonable modifications\u201d or \u201cundue burden\u201d analysis.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\"><em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Bercovitch </em>v. <em>Baldwin Sch., Inc., </em>133 F.3d 141, 154 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Turning to definitions, the court said that \u201c[i]n the public housing context, a \u2018qualified\u2019 handicapped individual is one who could meet the authority\u2019s eligibility requirements for occupancy and who could meet the conditions of a tenancy, with a reasonable accommodation or modification in the authority\u2019s rules, policies, practices, or services.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Quoting from <em>Garrity, </em>421 Mass. at 63, the court also noted that \u201c[a]n employee is not \u2018a \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 15 IB and therefore is not entitled to the protection of that statute\u2019 if he engages in conduct \u2018significantly inimical to the interests of his employer and in violation of the employer\u2019s rules.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">In the more recent <em>Mammone </em>case, the court explained its <em>Andover Hous. Authy. </em>decision in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>\u201cIn <em>Andover Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Shkolnik, </em>443 Mass. 300, 310 (2005), this court implied that <em>Garrity </em>is not confined to cases of alcoholism or substance dependency. In that case, we affirmed the dismissal of a housing discrimination counterclaim brought under G. L. c. 151B by elder residents of a public housing unit who were being evicted for various violations of the housing authority\u2019s rules and policies. None of these violations was a direct threat to the safety of the elder resident or other residents of the public housing complex. Assuming arguendo that one of the residents was handicapped \u2014 suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, depression, and a host of other mental and physical ailments \u2014 and that the housing violations stemmed from this handicap, the court turned to whether the resident met the definition of a qualified handicapped person. Citing <em>Garrity </em>for the proposition that an employee is not a qualified employee \u2018if he engages in conduct \u201csignificantly inimical to the interests of his employer and in violation of his employer\u2019s rules,\u201d \u2019 <em>Andover Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Shkolnik, supra, </em>we reasoned that, \u2018[i]n the public housing context, a \u201cqualified\u201d handicapped individual is one who could meet the authority\u2019s eligibility requirements for occupancy and who could meet the conditions of a tenancy, with a reasonable accommodation . . . .\u2019 <em>Id. </em>[at 310].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-5\"><em>Mammone, </em>446 Mass. at 674 n.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">We think that the analysis of \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d in <em>Andover Hous. Authy. </em>and in <em>Mammone </em>expresses the court\u2019s decision to utilize in the housing context a framework for determining \u201cqualified handicapped persons\u201d analogous to the framework it utilizes in the employment context. See <em>Peabody Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>418 Mass. at 607-608. There is no suggestion in the text or history of the governing statutes that the antidiscrimination provisions of the fair housing laws were designed to insulate individuals with handicaps from the consequences of activities that would be grounds for termination of tenants without handicaps. Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">\u201c[t]he primary concern of public housing authorities is the safety of their tenants. ... It follows that a public housing authority must have the discretion to seek to terminate a lease based on criminal activity . . . that constitutes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>threat to public safety. . . . Tenants of public housing developments . . . represent some of the most needy and vulnerable segments of our population, including low-income families, children, the elderly, and the handicapped. It should not be their fate, to the extent manifestly possible, to live in fear of their neighbors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-5\"><em>Lowell Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>Melendez, </em>449 Mass. 34, 40 (2007). For that reason, the Federal and State fair housing statutes provide for eviction of tenants who engage in violent activity threatening \u201cthe health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other tenants.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(1)(6) (2000). See G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">We therefore conclude that an individual who engages in conduct that violates a housing authority\u2019s rules and that is significantly inimical to an authority\u2019s obligation to provide a physically safe environment for its tenants is not a \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d entitled to an authority\u2019s general obligation to provide reasonable accommodations for its handicapped tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Under that standard, Bridgewaters was not a \u201cqualified handicapped person.\u201d His violent assault on his brother left the latter with significant physical injuries. His conduct was a crime of which he had been found guilty, without contest. His conduct occurred on BHA property and in his brother\u2019s unit, not his own. And his conduct, arising, as the judge was entitled to believe it did, from a replay of childhood slights and insults, amounted to such a gross overreaction to trivialities that a reasonable housing administrator could view a recurrence of his violent outburst as a likely prospect.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">We recognize that some decisions in other jurisdictions point in a different direction. See, e.g., <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Sugar River Mills Assocs., </em>820 F. Supp. 636, 639-640 (D.N.H. 1993); <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Housing Authy. of Boulder, </em>909 F. Supp. 814, 821-823 (D. Colo. 1995). Those cases, however, did not involve individuals who had been convicted of criminal assaults against cotenants in authority property, and neither involved an approach to the definition of \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d analogous to the definition adopted by our Supreme Judicial Court. We also recognize the impact that eviction may have on individuals who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>may already be at society\u2019s margins, but loss of employment may likewise have a severe impact. However, nothing in the public housing laws \u201crequires that a dwelling be made available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damages to the property of others.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(9) (2000). A housing authority, in sum, is not required to accommodate the problems and difficulties of one tenant whose housing choices are limited at the expense of others laboring under similar constraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">b. <em>Remaining issues. </em>In his second posttrial motion, Bridge-waters sought relief from judgment pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1), contending that his failure to more fully develop at trial a defense based on reasonable accommodation amounted to excusable neglect and that the BHA\u2019s termination notice was defective. On appeal, he contends that the Housing Court judge abused his discretion when he denied that motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The judge analyzed the motion in a thoughtful and comprehensive manner, evaluating each of the factors set out in <em>Berube </em>v. <em>McKesson Wine &amp; Spirits Co., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 426, 430-431 (1979).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Insofar as failure to develop a reasonable accommodation defense is concerned, the judge decided that although Bridgewaters satisfied the first <em>Berube </em>factor by promptly asserting a posttrial claim for relief, he satisfied none of the other five factors. The judge\u2019s conclusions were surely within the range of reason and evinced no abuse of discretion on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Finally, Bridgewaters\u2019s claim that the termination notice was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>defective is derived from a statement in the notice that the eviction was \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d as the lease and G. L. c. 139, \u00a7 19, permitted, despite the fact that Federal law, specifically 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(1)(4)(A) (2000), and 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 966.4(I)(3)(i)(B) (2007), gives a tenant a reasonable period of time, not to exceed thirty days, to vacate a unit. Because the issue was not raised before or during trial, or even in Bridgewaters\u2019s first posttrial motion, the motion judge, who had also been the trial judge, correctly ruled that the issue had been waived. See <em>New Bedford Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>Olan, </em>435 Mass. 364, 372 (2001). Moreover, Bridgewaters received the notice to quit on February 10, 2004, but the BHA did not commence the summary process action until March 22, 2004. Therefore, even if the notice were defective, Bridgewaters received the full benefit of the thirty-day notice to vacate period.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">\n<em>Orders dated August 3, 2004, and September 20, 2005, denying postjudgment motions, affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Eric suffered a stroke as a child, which paralyzed the left side of his body.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Bridgewaters alleged, even at trial, that Eric had bitten him.
