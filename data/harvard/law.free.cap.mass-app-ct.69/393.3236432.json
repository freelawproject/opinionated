Polito, is entitled to arbitrate whether good cause existed to terminate his services as an assistant superintendent of the Peabody school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\"><em>Facts. </em>Polito was hired in June, 2004, as an assistant superintendent of schools in Peabody pursuant to a written agreement (agreement). The agreement was drafted by the committee and provided that his employment commenced on July 1, 2004, and continued until June 30, 2007, a three-year term. Paragraph 4 of the agreement, entitled \u201cDischarge,\u201d states;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u201cDuring the term of this Agreement, [Polito] shall be subject to discharge for good cause and shall be entitled to notice and procedural safeguards provided school principals under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, including the right to file for arbitration as provided therein. In the event such a filing for arbitration occurs, the parties agree that the arbitration process shall be governed by said G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, excepting that the arbitrator\u2019s remedial authority shall be limited to an award of back pay damages for the balance of the contract term after the discharge and shall not include authority to reinstate [Polito].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The committee terminated Polito\u2019s employment in late 2004. He attempted to invoke the arbitration term contained in the agreement in order to arbitrate whether he had been terminated for \u201cgood cause.\u201d He wrote to the commissioner of the Department of Education (commissioner), as instructed by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41 (sometimes referred to as the statute), asking him for a list of arbitrators. In a letter dated December 15, 2004, the commissioner declined to do so. The commissioner reasoned that Polito did not qualify for statutory arbitration under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 41 or 42, which provide that various supervisors, such as principals and assistant principals, who have been in their positions for three consecutive years cannot be dismissed or demoted except for good cause, and are entitled to arbitrate dismissal or demotion decisions. The commissioner declined to address whether the position of assistant superintendent was covered by the statute, finding that because Polito had not been in his position for three consecutive years at the time of his termination, he was not eligible for arbitration under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Prior to signing the agreement, there was no discussion between Polito and the committee about what would happen if the commissioner declined to provide a list of arbitrators. After the commissioner\u2019s letter, Polito invited the committee to enter into a process to jointly select an arbitrator to hear the dispute. The committee declined that invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The parties agree that this dispute is appropriate for resolution by summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There are no genuine issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The dispute between the parties concerns the interpretation of the \u201cDischarge\u201d provision in the agreement and its relationship to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 <em>41.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Polito argues that the \u201cgood cause\u201d protection and the right to arbitrate that protection under the agreement was intended to apply from the first day of the employment period. He also argues that the reference to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, was intended to incorporate only its procedural and not its substantive provisions. The committee argues, on the other hand, that by referencing G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, the parties intended to incorporate both its procedural and substantive provisions. Specifically, the committee maintains that Polito should receive the same procedural and substantive rights offered to school principals under the statute. Polito, according to this argument, would only be entitled to \u201cgood cause\u201d protection and the right to arbitrate that protection after three consecutive years of employment in the position of assistant superintendent. Finally, the committee argues that allowing arbitration of Polito\u2019s termination would be contrary to public policy, as established by the Education Reform Act of 1993, St. 1993, c. 71, and therefore unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>1. <em>Disputed, contract provision. </em>\u201cWe must interpret the words in a contract according to their plain meaning.\u201d <em>Dickson </em>v. <em>Riverside Iron Works, Inc., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 53, 55 (1978). We are also required to determine the objective intent of the parties in making the contract. <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, \u201c[w]e must put ourselves in the place of the parties to the instrument and give its words their plain and ordinary meaning in the light of the circumstances and in view of the subject matter.\u201d <em>deFreitas </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>342 Mass. 474, 477 (1961), quoting from <em>McQuade </em>v. <em>Springfield Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>333 Mass. 229, 233 (1955). We apply general principles of contract law to determine whether the agreement calls for arbitration. <em>Mugnano-Bornstein </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 347, 350 (1997). \u201c[A] party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed ... to submit.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Local 285, Serv. Employees Intl. Union, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Nonotuck Resource Assocs., </em>64 F.3d 735, 738 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The \u201cDischarge\u201d provision provides: <em>\u201cDuring the term of this Agreement, </em>[Polito] shall be subject to discharge for good cause and shall be entitled to notice and procedural safeguards provided school principals under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, including the right to file for arbitration as provided therein\u201d (emphasis added). The plain meaning of this provision is that Polito could be discharged only for \u201cgood cause\u201d and would have the right to arbitrate the determination of \u201cgood cause\u201d from the first day to the last day of the contract term. If we were to construe the \u201cDischarge\u201d provision as providing Polito \u201cgood cause\u201d protection and enforcement by arbitration only after he had served three consecutive years in the position, it would render meaningless the phrase, \u201c[d]uring the term of this Agreement.\u201d \u201cA contract should be construed in such a way that no word or phrase is made meaningless by interpreting another word or phrase, because the interpretation should favor a valid and enforceable contract . . . rather than one of no force and effect.\u201d <em>Lexington Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>All Regions Chem. Labs, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 712, 713 (1995). Rendering that phrase meaningless would in turn render the entire provision meaningless, which could hardly have been the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The committee argues that the parties intended that Polito be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>afforded the same rights afforded to school principals under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, but this interpretation is not consistent with the language of the \u201cDischarge\u201d provision. Significantly, under the statute, the remedy for a determination that a termination has occurred without \u201cgood cause\u201d is reinstatement. Here, the \u201cDischarge\u201d provision specifically removes that power from the arbitrator and allows him only to award money damages, to the extent of unpaid salary. This language clearly evidences an intention of the parties, and particularly the committee as the drafter, to incorporate only certain aspects of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, while specifically rejecting others.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The \u201cDischarge\u201d provision directs that the arbitration process shall be governed by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41. The statute provides that \u201c[t]he commissioner shall provide the parties with the names of three arbitrators who are members of the American Arbitration Association.\u201d The commissioner refused to provide the list of arbitrators because he believed that Polito was not entitled to arbitration under the statute. The commissioner\u2019s belief, however, does not excuse the committee\u2019s obligation to arbitrate Polito\u2019s claim. Polito\u2019s right to arbitration is grounded in the agreement, not in the statute. \u201cWhere the parties to a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights and duties, a term which is reasonable in the circumstances will be supplied by the court.\u201d <em>Fay, Spofford &amp; Thorndike, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 336, 342 (1979). The parties need only directly request the American Arbitration Association to provide a list of member arbitrators and to jointly choose an arbitrator from that list. This method of choosing an arbitrator is not inconsistent with the terms of the agreement, and by resolving this unanticipated procedural gap, the substantive rights of the parties are not adversely affected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">2. <em>Public policy. </em>The committee argues that it is against public policy, specifically the Education Reform Act of 1993, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>enforce an employment contract that provides an assistant superintendent the right to be discharged only for \u201cgood cause\u201d from the first day of his term of employment. The committee relies on <em>Downing </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 779 (2001), and <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Kingston Sch. Comm., </em>360 F. Supp. 2d 212 (D. Mass. 2005), neither of which are analogous to the issues before us. <em>Downing </em>v. <em>Lowell, supra </em>at 782-784, involved the rights of a tenured principal under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, while <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Kingston Sch. Comm., supra </em>at 216-219, involved a principal who was not tenured. Although the principals in both cases had an employment contract, they were also subject to the procedural and substantive jurisdiction of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41. Here, Polito\u2019s rights are grounded entirely in his agreement and not in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The committee erroneously conflates the \u201cgood cause\u201d protection granted to Polito with that granted to principals under the statute. Under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, a principal terminated without \u201cgood cause,\u201d as determined by the arbitrator, can be reinstated into his position. Polito, on the other hand, can be awarded nothing more than money damages, to the extent of unpaid salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The Education Reform Act of 1993 legislated that principals could only attain a limited form of tenure after being employed for three consecutive years. After this initial three-year period, \u201cgood cause\u201d protection would allow them to be reinstated to their position for the balance of their then current contract. The \u201cDischarge\u201d provision in the agreement, and specifically Poli-to\u2019s right to arbitration, with its limited remedy, has nothing to do with the public policy concerning tenure contained in the Education Reform Act of 1993. See <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 490, 493-494 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We have determined that the meaning of the agreement\u2019s \u201cDischarge\u201d provision was to provide Polito with the right to be terminated only for \u201cgood cause\u201d; that he had the right, by reference, to notice and other procedural safeguards provided principals under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41; and that he had the right to arbitrate the determination of \u201cgood cause\u201d during the entire contractual term. The remedy under such an arbitration is limited to an award of money damages if no \u201cgood cause\u201d is found. The parties can jointly choose an appropriate arbitrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>to hear this dispute. The terms of Polito\u2019s employment contract are not contrary to the public policy embodied in the Education Reform Act of 1993. The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>material fact and where the moving party is entitled to judgment as matter of law.
