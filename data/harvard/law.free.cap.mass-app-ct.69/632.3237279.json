L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, the Massachusetts Tips Act, as amended in 1983, see St. 1983, c. 343, prior to its further amendment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>2004. The matters of first impression before us arise from invoices that Northeastern University (Northeastern) sent between 1994 and 2002 to customers of its Weston conference facility known as the Henderson House. Food and beverage service for certain functions held at the Henderson House, including wait staff and bartenders, was provided by Chartwells,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> through a contractual arrangement it had with Northeastern.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">When Northeastern invoiced those who had engaged Henderson House for such functions, it included on the invoices what it called a \u201cservice charge,\u201d calculated as a percentage of the food and beverage service provided. Viewing the \u201cservice charge\u201d as a facilities fee not in the nature of a tip or gratuity, Northeastern used the proceeds for the upkeep of Henderson House and did not remit to the Chartwells service employees any portion of the \u201cservice charge\u201d that it collected. That is the nub of the matter now before us: the plaintiffs, as Chartwells wait staff and bartenders for Henderson House functions, claim that Chartwells and Northeastern are jointly and severally hable under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, for not having remitted to the service employees proceeds of the service charges that were billed as such by Northeastern.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Section 152A, as in effect at all relevant times, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">\u201cNo employer or other person shall solicit, demand, request or accept from any employee engaged in the serving of food or beverage any payment of any nature from tips or gratuities received by such employee during the course of his employment, or from wages earned by such employee or retain for himself any tips or gratuities given directly to the employer for the benefit of the employee, as a condition of employment; and no contract or agreement between an employer or other person and an employee providing for either of such payments shall afford any basis for the granting of legal or equitable relief by any court against a party to such contract or agreement. <em>If an employer or other person submits a bill or invoice </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>indicating a service charge, the total proceeds of such charge shall be remitted to the employees in proportion to the service provided by them. </em>Whoever violates any provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars and the court may require such employer or other person to make restitution for any tips or gratuities accepted or retained by him in violation of this section.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Reduced to essentials, the plaintiffs claim that, under a straightforward reading of this statute, Northeastern, an \u201cother person,\u201d \u201csubmitted]\u201d to its Henderson House customers \u201cinvoice[s] indicating a service charge\u201d and that the statute requires \u201cthe total proceeds of such charge ... be remitted to [them] in proportion to the service provided by them.\u201d Northeastern takes the position that its mere choice of words \u2014 \u201cservice charge\u201d \u2014 cannot alone subject it to liability under the statute when, taking the facts in the light most favorable to Northeastern on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, it did not intend to charge for anything in the nature of a gratuity, the Chartwells waitstaff and bartenders did not anticipate a gratuity, and those engaging Henderson House for functions who inquired about the service charge learned that it was not in the nature of a gratuity. Chartwells in turn rejects the notion that it has any liability under the statute for the reason, if no other, than that it submitted no invoices indicating such a service charge and had no involvement with or control over Northeastern\u2019s invoicing or disbursement practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We conclude that the term \u201cservice charge\u201d as used in the statute includes the \u201cservice charge\u201d that Northeastern invoiced its customers, and that Northeastern but not Chartwells has liability under the statute for retention of service charge proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\"><em>Background. </em>The plaintiffs brought their complaint in 2002, alleging violation of the Tips Act (count I), as well as a number of common-law claims. In August, 2003, all parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on count I, and Chartwells\u2019s motion was allowed. As to the remaining motions, the judge concluded that material issues of fact were in dispute concerning whether Henderson House customers reasonably believed that the \u201cservice charge\u201d appearing on their invoices was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>gratuity; in his view, summary judgment was thereby precluded for both the plaintiffs and Northeastern as to invoices that specified a \u201cservice charge\u201d in so many words. In June, 2004, Northeastern and the plaintiffs filed renewed motions for summary judgment. A second judge allowed Northeastern\u2019s motion in part, for the time period beginning in March, 2002, when Northeastern substituted the term \u201cfacilities charge\u201d for \u201cservice charge.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 motions were otherwise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The second judge, at the parties\u2019 joint request, subsequently reported both decisions to us pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 64(a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996). Because it is apparent that this interlocutory matter \u201cpresent[s] serious questions likely to be material in the ultimate decision,\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy. Retirement Bd., </em>412 Mass. 770, 772 (1992), quoting from <em>John Gilbert Jr. Co. </em>v. <em>C.M. Fauci Co., </em>309 Mass. 271, 273 (1941), and that our decision \u201cif not completely dispositive of the matter, at least disposes of a central issue material to the ultimate decision,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 773, we review the substantive issues raised in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\"><em>Facts. </em>The material facts for purposes of summary judgment on the limited grounds urged on appeal are not in dispute. As already noted, Northeastern had a contractual arrangement with Chartwells whereby the latter would provide food and beverage service for functions at Henderson House. Chartwells paid the wait staff and bartenders in its employ who provided these services on an hourly rate basis, using its higher \u201cnon-tipped\u201d wage scale intended for those employees who did not receive substantial gratuities. Chartwells invoiced Northeastern for the food and beverage service provided at Henderson House functions, and Northeastern invoiced those who engaged Henderson House for functions that included food and beverage service.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Beginning in 1994, Northeastern included on its customer invoices an item which it denominated a \u201cservice charge,\u201d calculated as a percentage of the amount billed for food and beverage service. Initially, the rate was five percent, but it in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>creased over the years until in 2001 it was eighteen percent. Northeastern consistently intended to and did use the proceeds from the service charge for the upkeep of Henderson House; Northeastern never intended to nor did it remit the proceeds from the service charge to the Chartwells employees who provided food and beverage services at Henderson House. Northeastern did not intend what it denominated on its invoices as a \u201cservice charge\u201d to be a charge in lieu of tip or gratuity, nor did it make other representations to that effect. Chartwells did not bill, collect, distribute, or retain any service charge relating to Henderson House functions, nor did it have any control over Northeastern\u2019s administration of such charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In March, 2002, Northeastern received notice from the Attorney General\u2019s office that a complaint had been filed alleging that Northeastern had failed to remit service charge proceeds to the wait staff and bartenders as required by G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A. Northeastern thereupon revised its customer invoices by omitting the term \u201cservice charge\u201d and substituting the term \u201cfacilities surcharge.\u201d The Attorney General took no further action on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\"><em>The claim against Northeastern. </em>\u201cWe interpret a statute according to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983). \u2018[T]he primary source of insight into the intent of the Legislature is the language of the statute,\u2019 <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983), and that is our starting point. <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 242 (1985). Statutory language should be given effect consistent with its plain meaning. Where, as here, that language is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the W. Roxbury Div. of the Dist. Court Dept., </em>439 Mass. 352, 355-356 (2003).\u201d <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Superior Ct. Dept. of the Trial Ct., </em>446 Mass. 123, 124 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Northeastern maintains that the meaning of the term \u201cservice charge\u201d as used in \u00a7 152A is unclear and ambiguous, pointing both to the absence of any statutory definition of the term and to the Legislature\u2019s use of the same term, freighted with different meanings, in other unrelated statutes. The reading that Northeastern offers to remove the alleged ambiguity in the term \u201cservice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>charge\u201d would limit its application to only those instances where the invoiced charges, even if called \u201cservice charge[s],\u201d are <em>in fact </em>charges in the nature of a tip or gratuity. Under such a reading, whether specific invoiced charges are in fact charges in the nature of a tip or gratuity would be ascertained on a case-by-case basis depending on the intent of the invoicing entity as to such charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We read the statute differently. Viewing the term \u201cservice charge\u201d in the context of the Tips Act as a whole, and doing so \u201cconsonant with sound reason and common sense,\u201d <em>DiGiacomo </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 343, 346 (2006), we discern neither a lack of clarity nor any ambiguity. From first to last, the statute makes plain that payments in the nature of tips or gratuities \u2014 certainly those paid or assessed in connection with food or beverage service \u2014 belong to the employees. The terms \u201ctips\u201d and \u201cgratuities\u201d are, moreover, words of ordinary meaning and are commonly understood. In context, so is the term \u201cservice charge.\u201d Whether a payment is made directly to the service employee or made indirectly to others on the employee\u2019s behalf \u2014 as would happen when a customer adds a tip to a credit card total or pays an invoice indicating a \u201cservice charge\u201d \u2014 the statute requires that the proceeds be remitted to the service employees. The terms \u201ctip,\u201d \u201cgratuity,\u201d and \u201cservice charge,\u201d as used in \u00a7 152A, are synonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">By its plain language, \u00a7 152A requires that payments received on invoices submitted by \u201can employer or other person,\u201d insofar as they \u201cindicat[e] a service charge,\u201d be paid over to the service employees. We take the statutory phrase \u201cindicating a service charge\u201d as meaning, in context, invoiced charges that are named, designated, denominated, labeled, or otherwise called a \u201cservice charge\u201d on the invoice that is submitted. Cf. <em>Tiffany </em>v. <em>Sturbridge Camping Club, Inc., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 173, 180 n.10 (1992). Otherwise put, the statutory language reflects legislative intent to regard any fee that the invoicing entity chooses to call a \u201cservice charge\u201d on an invoice for food or beverage service as being the functional equivalent of a tip or gratuity, thereby subjecting the fee to the statute. \u201cThe statute is unambiguous and must be construed as written.\u201d <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Mass. 283, 286 (1996). It applies to tips, gratuities, and fees that are called \u201cservice charges\u201d in aid of a clear purpose: letting employees keep these payments. \u201cThis is not a case where following the statute\u2019s literal meaning would lead to a result contrary to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Shamban </em>v. <em>Masidlover, </em>429 Mass. 50, 54 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The difficulty for Northeastern, of course, is that this plain-language construction can result in the imposition of liability on invoicing entities, such as itself, that may innocently have called a fee a \u201cservice charge\u201d when a gratuity or tip was not at all what they had in mind. On this basis, Northeastern would have us eschew the literal construction, insisting that it cannot have been any part of the Legislature\u2019s purpose to set such a \u201ctrap for the unwary,\u201d one, moreover, that would result in a \u201cwindfall\u201d for already fully-paid service employees. This purported trap can be avoided, Northeastern suggests, if we were to read into the statute a simple limitation, namely: only those invoiced fees called \u201cservice charges\u201d that can be shown to have been intended as tips or gratuities by the invoicing entity may trigger liability under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The trouble with this suggestion is that it requires us to add words to the statute that the Legislature did not see fit to put there. This we may not do, particularly where we can make good sense of the statute without doing so. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the W. Roxbury Div. of the Dist. Ct. Dept., </em>439 Mass. at 355. Where \u201cthe language of the statute is clear, it is the function of the judiciary to apply it, not amend it.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 79, 82 (1999). The Legislature no doubt could have written the statute in the way that Northeastern would prefer, putting the burden on service employees to prove in each instance that a particular \u201cservice charge\u201d was in fact intended by the \u201cemployer or other person\u201d as a tip or gratuity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Doing so would surely have accorded greater protection to the innocent \u201cemployer or other person\u201d and would have made recovery under the statute more onerous a task. But the Legislature did not strike the balance that way, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>instead taking the uncomplicated approach of imposing liability whenever the invoicing entity, for whatever reason, chooses to call a fee a \u201cservice charge\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and then keeps the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">We do not, of course, read a statute literally when doing so would bring about an absurd result, see <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982), but that is not the situation here. Instead, it is the literal reading that reaches a result in conformity with evident legislative intent, even if it does so at the occasional expense of the invoicing entity that stumbles upon use of the wrong term. To be sure, from time to time service employees may reap seemingly unfair benefits from an invoicing entity\u2019s honest misstep, but such situations do not require that the statute be differently construed. In striking the balance as it did, in devising a type of \u201cstrict liability\u201d to achieve its goal \u2014 letting employees keep tips, gratuities, and fees called \u201cservice charges\u201d \u2014 the Legislature must be presumed to have factored into its calculus the risk of such results. \u201cWe cannot substitute our judgment for that of . . . the Legislature.\u201d <em>Church </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>370 Mass. 598, 602 (1976). That being said, we do not in any event embrace Northeastern\u2019s characterization of itself as having been ensnared in a trap for the unwary. The version of the statute at issue had been in effect since 1983 and specifically addresses food and beverage service. Northeastern is a sizeable and sophisticated institution. As the second motion judge observed, \u201ca fee called a \u2018service charge\u2019 assessed to a person renting a banquet hall where food and drinks are served, where such a charge is calculated as a percentage of that person\u2019s food and beverage purchases alone, bears a striking resemblance to a flat gratuity fee assessed to large groups at a typical restaurant. Couple this observation with the fact that for some significant amount of time this fee was in the general range of 12% to 18% of a party\u2019s food and beverage purchases, and the similarity becomes even more apparent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Lastly, although Northeastern endeavors to support its suggested reading of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, by reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>subsequent 2004 amendment of the statute, we have no need to parse that later version of the statute. \u201cWhere the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms yields a workable result, we need not resort to extrinsic aids of interpretation such as legislative history.\u201d <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 Mass. at 286. Even were we to do so, however, it would avail Northeastern little since we see nothing in the preceding or subsequent versions of the statute that would recommend Northeastern\u2019s suggested construction of the applicable version of \u00a7 152A.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\"><em>The claim against Chartwells. </em>The plaintiffs argue that the judge erred in allowing Chartwells\u2019s motion for summary judgment, stressing that they were Chartwells employees and that liability under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, has much to do with the employment relationship. The plaintiffs call our attention in this regard to the contract between Chartwells and Northeastern, which requires Chartwells to comply with all governmental laws, rules, statutes, and regulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiffs analogize G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, to G. L. c. 151B, which provides that employers can be held liable to employees for sexual harassment of which they were or should have been aware, even though the acts were committed by a third party who was neither an agent of the employer nor under its control. See <em>Modern Continental/Obayashi </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>445 Mass. 96, 107-108 (2005), and cases cited. Consistent with legislative intent to protect servers, the plaintiffs claim, it is Chartwells\u2019s responsibility as the employer to ensure that \u00a7 152A is not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">We do not read the statute so broadly.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While the Legislature clearly intended to protect the servers, the burden of doing so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>falls upon the entity that \u201csubmits a bill or invoice indicating a service charge.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A. The Legislature recognized that this entity is not always the direct employer; the statute therefore reads, \u201cNo employer <em>or </em>other person shall solicit . . . tips or gratuities .... If an employer <em>or </em>other person submits a bill or invoice indicating a service charge, the total proceeds . . . shall be remitted to the employees . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Ibid. </em>The Legislature\u2019s use of \u201cor\u201d between \u201cemployer\u201d and \u201cother person\u201d indicates that it contemplated that two separate entities could be liable \u2014 the employer and any other entity that submitted bills or invoices. Under a plain reading of \u00a7 152A, we do not see how Chartwells can be made to bear the burden of ensuring that Northeastern remits to the plaintiffs the service charge proceeds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order dated January 7, 2004, is affirmed insofar as it allows Chartwells\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The remainder of the order is vacated. So much of the order dated December 20, 2004, as denies in part Northeastern\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment on count I is affirmed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 renewed cross motion for summary judgment on count I is vacated and a new order shall enter allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for the time period prior to Northeastern\u2019s substitution of the term \u201cfacilities charge\u201d for \u201cservice charge\u201d upon bills and related documents presented to Henderson House customers.

In those cases, Chartwells distributed the money to the servers through its payroll system. Further, it is undisputed that Chartwells had no control over the service charge proceeds, which Northeastern deposited directly upon receipt into an operational account for Henderson House.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The propriety of the order insofar as it allows Northeastern\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment for the time period commencing in March, 2002, when the term \u201cfacilities charge\u201d was substituted for \u201cservice charge,\u201d is not before us.
