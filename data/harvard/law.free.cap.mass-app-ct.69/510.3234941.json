(2000), in Superior Court under a \u201csavings\u201d clause, see 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 767, is calculated under Federal law, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 (2000), or under Massachusetts law, pursuant to G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8. We agree with the Superior Court judge and conclude that the Federal statute applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><em>Background.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This case arises from the sinking of a fishing vessel \u2014 the Italian Gold \u2014 during bad weather on the high seas on September 5, 1994. The surviving spouses of the crew members lost on the voyage filed suit against Rose\u2019s Oil Service, Inc., for wrongful death<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under DOHSA. They brought their suits in Superior Court pursuant to the DOHSA \u201csavings\u201d clause. See 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 767. The DOHSA \u201csavings\u201d clause provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of any State statute giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death shall not be affected by this Act.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 767. \u201cAs interpreted by the Supreme Court, this section operates as a \u2018jurisdictional saving clause,\u2019 allowing State courts to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over DOHSA claims and to \u2018apply such state remedies as [are] not inconsistent with substantive federal maritime law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Curcuru </em>v. <em>Rose\u2019s Oil Serv., Inc., </em>441 Mass. 12, 15-16 (2004), quoting from <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, 477 </em>U.S. 207, 221, 224 (1986). Ultimately, after extensive litigation, appeal, and a remand, judgments after rescript entered in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In the present appeal, the narrow question is whether the trial judge erred in applying the Federal postjudgment interest rate (2.07 percent) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, as opposed to the Massachusetts postjudgment interest rate (8.14 percent) pursuant to G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>The decision in <em>Militello </em>v. <em>Ann &amp; Grace, Inc., </em>411 Mass. 22 (1991), provides significant guidance. In that case, the plaintiff brought suit in Superior Court against the defendant under the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333 (1988),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and was awarded damages for violation of the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688 (1988), and for unseaworthiness and cure under general maritime law. <em>Id. </em>at 23. The clerk of the Superior Court then added prejudgment interest to the damages pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B (1990 ed.). <em>Id. </em>at 24. On appeal, the defendant argued that both prejudgment and postjudgment interest should have been assessed according to Federal law, not Massachusetts law. <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Judicial Court, citing the need for consistency with Federal law, agreed and held that in \u201cmaritime cases brought under the saving to suitors clause,\u201d courts must follow the Federal statute in assessing prejudgment and postjudgment interest. <em>Id. </em>at 28-29. See <em>Budish </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>417 Mass. 574, 578 n.6 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We see no reason to deviate from the rationale set forth in <em>Militello. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 DOHSA claims are maritime claims. See <em>Curcuru </em>v. <em>Rose\u2019s Oil Serv., Inc., </em>441 Mass. at 14 (\u201ca DOHSA claim is an \u2018admiralty claim\u2019 \u201d). The plaintiffs brought their claims in State court under the DOHSA \u201csavings\u201d clause which \u201c \u2018bears a marked similarity\u2019 to the savings clause of \u00a7 1333(1) and has the same [ejffect on a State court\u2019s exercise of concurrent jurisdiction. <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, </em>[477 U.S. 207,] 222-224 <em>[(1986)]. As </em>such, cases interpreting <em>the </em>\u2018saving to suitors\u2019 clause of \u00a7 1333(1) provide guidance with respect to the interpretation and application of the DOHSA savings clause.\u201d <em>Curcuru </em>v. <em>Rose\u2019s Oil Serv., Inc., </em>441 Mass. at 16 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Because the Supreme Judicial Court has articulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>a \u201cneed for consistency with Federal law ... in maritime cases\u201d where interest awards are at issue, <em>Militello </em>v. <em>Ann &amp; Grace, Inc., </em>411 Mass. at 28, and has instructed that case law pertaining to \u00a7 1331(1) should inform our interpretation of issues in cases under the DOHSA savings clause, postjudgment interest on the plaintiffs\u2019 DOHSA judgments should be calculated pursuant to Federal law under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\n<em>Judgments after rescript affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Because of the narrow issue presented, only the facts and background pertinent to this appeal have been included. For an extensive procedural and factual history of this case, see <em>Curcuru </em>v. <em>Rose\u2019s Oil Serv., Inc., </em>441 Mass. 12 (2004), and <em>Curcuru </em>v. <em>Rose\u2019s Oil Serv., Inc., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 200, cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 558 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Rose\u2019s Oil Service, Inc., performed repairs on the Italian Gold in April and July of 1994, just prior to the accident. The surviving spouses alleged Rose\u2019s Oil Service, Inc., negligently performed the repairs, which conduct was said to be a substantial cause of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u201cThis statute provides in part as follows: \u2018The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of: (1) Any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.\u2019 The \u2018saving to suitors\u2019 clause allows plaintiffs to bring maritime claims at law rather than in admiralty before either a Federal District Court (if the plaintiff meets the requirements for Federal diversity jurisdiction) or a State court. Under this clause, the State courts have concurrent jurisdiction to decide in personam admiralty claims like those made by the plaintiff. See <em>Madruga </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>346 U.S. 556, 561 (1954); <em>Keough </em>v. <em>Cefalo, </em>330 Mass. 57, 60 (1953).\u201d <em>Militello </em>v. <em>Ann &amp; Grace, Inc., </em>411 Mass. at 23 n.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
