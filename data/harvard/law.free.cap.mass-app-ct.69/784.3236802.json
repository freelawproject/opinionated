Killeen, damages in the amount of $1.26, trebled to $3.78, for violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, as amended by St. 1983, c. 343, a statute regulating the manner in which employers distribute tips they collect on behalf of their employees, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the amount of $153,717.77.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The plaintiff worked as a server at banquets and functions in the defendant\u2019s hotel, the Westin Copley Place, for more than fourteen years. During that period, she worked at an average of 400 events per year. At each of these events, the plaintiff was supervised by one or more banquet captains, who were responsible for supervising the servers and doing whatever else was necessary to ensure smoothly run functions. From time to time, the captains assisted in actual service of food and beverages, but food and beverage service was a minor component of their over-all mission. At all times material to the litigation, the defendant customarily assigned captains to supervise more than one function simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The defendant routinely added a fourteen percent service or gratuity charge to the food and beverage charges for each function. From 1983 through August, 1995, the defendant distributed an equal share of an event\u2019s service charge to each employee, including the captains, who had worked at the event. As a result, when working multiple functions simultaneously, banquet captains would receive a larger portion of the gratuities than the servers who actually served food and beverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">In September of 1997, this action was commenced to chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>lenge the defendant\u2019s tip allocation procedures.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the complaint, the plaintiff claimed that captains should not have received distributions from the service charges the defendant collected because G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> limited recipients to those who engaged in \u201cthe serving of food or beverage\u201d to event patrons and the captains did not provide \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of the statute. In addition to alleging that the defendant\u2019s tip distribution policy violated the statute, the plaintiff claimed that the policy (1) was a breach of contract; (2) was a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the employment relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant; (3) amounted to fraud; (4) constituted conversion; and (5) was an intentional interference with an advantageous relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Ultimately, the case proceeded to a jury-waived trial that bifurcated liability and damages. In the liability phase, the trial judge found that captains did provide \u201cservice\u201d to banquet patrons and were entitled to share in the service charges the defendant collected. The judge also found, however, that the defendant\u2019s custom and practice of allowing banquet captains who simultaneously worked at multiple functions to collect a proportionate share of the service charges generated by each function violated the statute\u2019s \u201cproportionality\u201d provision (see note 4, <em>supra). </em>Based on that conclusion, the judge also concluded that the defendant\u2019s practice violated the covenant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>good faith and fair dealing implicit in an at-will employment relationship and amounted to conversion and unjust enrichment. The judge dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claims of fraud, interference with an advantageous relationship, and breach of an express contract. Finally, and although the defendant had abandoned the challenged practice in 1995, some two years before the action began, the judge, sua sponte, issued a declaratory judgment pursuant to G. L. c. 231A stating that the defendant\u2019s practice of giving \u201cbanquet captains working simultaneously scheduled or overlapping functions a single share from the 14% gratuity pool of each one of the multiple functions supervised by that captain or captains while only compensating servers from the tip pool worked by that server unlawfully violates the proportionality provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">At the subsequent damage phase of the trial, the plaintiff, who had sought damages ranging from approximately $78,000 to $127,000, was only able to prove that she had been harmed by the defendant\u2019s practice on one occasion and that the damages for that one occasion amounted to $1.26. Because she believed that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, required an award of treble damages, the judge ordered entry of judgment in the amount of $3.78. The judge also awarded the plaintiff $153,717.77 in costs and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">On this appeal, the defendant challenges the judge\u2019s decision to treble the damages and to award costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">2. <em>Trebling damages pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150. </em>General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 150, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 182, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny employee claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of [G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A,] may . . . institute and prosecute in his own name and on his own behalf... a civil action for injunctive relief and any damages incurred, including treble damages for any lost wages and other benefits.\u201d In her findings and conclusions following the damage phase of the trial, the judge stated, \u201cIt would not appear from a reading of the statute that such a trebling is discretionary.\u201d Accordingly, she trebled the $1.26 basic award to $3.78. Subsequently, however, the Supreme Judicial Court held in <em>Wiedmann </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>v. <em>The Bradford Group, Inc., </em>444 Mass. 698, 708-710 (2005),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that treble damages under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, are discretionary, not mandatory, stating that its conclusion was similar to that in <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. 165, 178-179 (2000), interpreting a similar provision in G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 IB. The court pointed out that multiple damages are essentially punitive damages and are appropriate where \u201cconduct is \u2018outrageous, because of the defendant\u2019s evil motive or his reckless indifference to the rights of others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wiedmann </em>v. <em>The Bradford Group, Inc., </em>444 Mass. at 710, quoting from <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. at 178.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because <em>Wiedmann </em>holds that trebling is not mandatory under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, and because the judge made no finding on the question whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201coutrageous\u201d or showed a \u201creckless indifference to the rights of others,\u201d we must \u201cvacate the award of treble damages and remand the issue for the judge\u2019s reconsideration whether treble damages are warranted.\u201d <em>Wiedmann </em>v. <em>The Bradford Group, Inc., </em>444 Mass. at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">3. <em>Award of attorney\u2019s fees. </em>General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 150, is an exception to the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d which requires each party to bear its own litigation costs. See generally <em>Police Commr. of Boston </em>v. <em>Gows, </em>429 Mass. 14, 17 (1999). In pertinent part, \u00a7 150 provides: \u201cAn employee . . . who <em>prevails </em>in [an action for a violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A,] <em>shall be </em>entitled to an award of the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorney fees\u201d (emphases added). G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In opposing the fee award in this case, the defendant claims that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to recover anything more than \u201cnominal\u201d damages means that she should not be viewed as the \u201cprevailing party\u201d for purposes of a fee award and, even if she should be, the award in this case is not \u201creasonable.\u201d We consider those claims in succession.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>a. <em>Prevailing party. </em>In <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103 (1992), the United States Supreme Court explored the question whether a civil rights litigant who is awarded nominal damages is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d and entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (2000), the Federal fee-shifting statute. \u201c[A] plaintiff \u2018prevails,\u2019 \u201d the Court held, \u201cwhen actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111-112. See <em>Mendoza </em>v. <em>Licensing Bd. of Fall River, </em>444 Mass. 188, 210 (2005). Because \u201c[a] judgment for damages in any amount, whether compensatory or nominal, modifies the defendant\u2019s behavior for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit by forcing the defendant to pay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay,\u201d the Court concluded that one who recovers nominal damages is a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, </em>506 U.S. at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The Court went on to say, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">\u201c[ajlthough the \u2018technical\u2019 nature of a nominal damages award or any other judgment does not affect the prevailing party inquiry, it does bear on the propriety of fees awarded under \u00a7 1988. Once civil rights litigation materially alters the legal relationship between the parties, \u2018the degree of the plaintiff\u2019s overall success goes to the reasonableness\u2019 of [the] fee award .... Indeed, \u2018the most critical factor\u2019 in determining the reasonableness of a fee award \u2018is the degree of success obtained.\u2019 ... In some circumstances, even a plaintiff who formally \u2018prevails\u2019 under \u00a7 1988 should receive no attorney\u2019s fees at all. A plaintiff who seeks compensatory damages but receives no more than nominal damages is often such a prevailing party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 114-115. In the aftermath of <em>Farrar, </em>numerous Federal decisions have declined to award attorney\u2019s fees to litigants who recovered only nominal damages in civil rights litigation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">The defendant urges that the analytical approach taken by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>these cases provides an ample basis for refusing to award the plaintiff any fees at all in this case. The defendant\u2019s argument, however, ignores a critical difference between the governing statutes. The Federal statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, is permissive, providing that \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d See <em>Gay Officers Action League </em>v. <em>Puerto Rico, </em>247 F.3d 288, 293 (1st Cir. 2001). As noted earlier, the fee provision in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, is mandatory and requires award of a reasonable fee to one who \u201cprevails\u201d in an action to which the statute applies. The award of compensatory damages to the plaintiff, though modest, altered the legal relationship between her and the defendant, made her the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the litigation, and, therefore, required an award of legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">b. <em>Reasonable fees. </em>Finally, then, we turn to the fee the judge awarded here. \u201cThe basic measure of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees is a \u2018fair market rate for the time reasonably spent preparing and litigating a case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Bologna, </em>417 Mass. 199, 203 (1994), quoting from <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 326 (1993). See <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 322 (1982). This approach to fee calculations is known as the \u201clodestar\u201d approach, <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. at 325; <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. at 321-322, and the results it produces \u201cshould govern unless there are special reasons to depart from them.\u201d <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. at 322. See <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. at 325; <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Bologna, </em>417 Mass. at 203. In this area, as in others, much is left to the discretion of the trial judge, for she typically \u201cis in the best position to determine how much time was reasonably spent on a case, and the fair value of the attorney\u2019s services.\u201d <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. at 324. See <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Bologna, </em>417 Mass. at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The proper method for determining the lodestar was explained succinctly in <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Bologna, </em>417 Mass. at 203-204:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-7\">\u201cThe first component of the basic measure amount is the amount of time reasonably expended on the case. The judge should begin his inquiry with the amount of time documented by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. <em>Stratos, supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>322-323. Then the judge decides whether this amount of time was reasonably expended. <em>Id., </em>and cases cited. The judge should not only consider the plaintiff\u2019s financial interests at stake but also the plaintiff\u2019s other interests sought to be protected by the statute in question and the public interest in having persons with valid claims under the statute represented by competent legal counsel. See <em>[i]d. </em>at 323. The second component of the basic measure amount is the amount of a reasonable hourly rate. This amount should be the average rate in the community for similar work by attorneys with the same years\u2019 experience. <em>Stratos, supra </em>at 323-324, and cases cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In deciding whether the documented time was reasonably expended the judge may, in addition to considering the interests at stake, also consider many of the factors articulated in <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388-389 (1979), i.e., the nature of the case and the issues presented, the time and labor required, the amount of damages involved, and the result obtained. Those factors have been used for years as guides to assessment of reasonable fees in Massachusetts cases, see <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>National Shawmut Bank, </em>284 Mass. 563, 569 (1933), and continue to be useful guides to determining time reasonably spent when applying the lodestar methodology. See, e.g., <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Bologna, </em>417 Mass. at 203. See also <em>Siegel </em>v. <em>Berkshire Life Ins. Co., </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 698, 706 n.8 (2005) (noting that \u201c[ujnder the lodestar method, [these] other, formerly separate considerations, see, e.g., <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. at 388-389, come into play indirectly\u201d). Compare <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. at 322-323 (applying the Federal <em>Johnson </em>factors, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-719 [5th Cir. 1974],<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to the lodestar approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Assigning an appropriate weight to the various factors is sometimes difficult, and that difficulty is perhaps greatest when assigning a weight to the results achieved in the litigation. As noted earlier, the judge \u201cshould not only consider the plaintiff\u2019s financial interests at stake but also the plaintiff\u2019s other interests sought to be protected by the statute in question and the public interest in having persons with valid claims under the statute represented by competent legal counsel.\u201d <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Bologna, </em>417 Mass. at 203. See <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. at 323 (\u201cThe financial benefit to the plaintiff, and the general benefit to public interests, are relevant considerations . . .\u201d). Consequently, when a plaintiff\u2019s victory, although <em>\u201cde minimis </em>as to the extent of relief[,] . . . represents] a significant legal conclusion serving an important public purpose,\u201d <em>Diaz-Rivera </em>v. <em>Rivera-Rodriguez, </em>377 F.3d 119, 125 (1st Cir. 2004), the fee award need not be proportionate to the damages recovered. See <em>id. </em>(discussing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988); <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. at 323. See also <em>Riverside </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>477 U.S. 561, 573-574 (1986); <em>Gay Officers Action League </em>v. <em>Puerto Rico, </em>247 F.3d at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">At the same time, realistic assessment of the benefits the litigation actually produced is always necessary when attempting to determine what litigation costs are appropriate, for neither costs nor benefits are free-floating variables. In determining time reasonably spent on a matter, the court must be mindful of \u201cthe difficulty of the case\u201d and \u201cthe results obtained,\u201d <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. at 323; see <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 436 (1983) (\u201cthe degree of success obtained\u201d a factor in lodestar analysis); <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, </em>506 U.S. at 114, and \u201ccompensable hours may be reduced if the time spent was wholly disproportionate to the interests at stake.\u201d <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. at 323. As stated by the Federal courts in cases awarding attorney\u2019s fees, no fee should \u201cbe awarded for services [employed pursuing an] unsuccessful claim,\u201d <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. at 435, unless the court finds that \u201cthe unsuccessful claims are \u2018sufficiently interconnected\u2019 with [the] claims on which [the] plaintiff pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>vails.\u201d <em>Peckham </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Ins. Co., </em>895 F.2d 830, 842 (1st Cir. 1990). See <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>supra; <em>Krewson </em>v. <em>Quincy, 74 </em>F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 1996). And, as the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. at 437, \u201c[w]hen an adjustment is requested on the basis of either the exceptional or limited nature of the relief obtained by the plaintiff, the . . . court should make clear that it has considered the relationship between the amount of the fee awarded and the results obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">In this case, the judge did not use the lodestar method to calculate the attorney\u2019s fees she awarded, and she did not specifically focus on whether the hours spent on the case were spent reasonably. See <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 461, 476-477 (2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 2905 (2007). She noted that the fees the plaintiff sought \u201cwere disproportionate to the damage award\u201d and, therefore, questioned \u201cwhether there ought to be a reduction in the requested fee amount.\u201d But, citing <em>Linthicum, </em>she answered that question in the negative because, she found, the case was complex; the plaintiff\u2019s victory, although nominal, had a significant impact on the service industry as a whole; the attorney had requested no compensation for time not reflected on his billing records; the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s hourly rate was at the low end of an appropriate range; and the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys were skilled and experienced in this type of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">We think that the judge\u2019s election to use the <em>Linthicum </em>factors directly, and not as guides to determining whether the hours spent on the case were reasonable, caused her to focus with insufficient precision on the amount of time it was reasonable for the plaintiffs counsel to have spent on this case in light of the results the plaintiff obtained. As to complexity, the judge noted that the case had required two trials, each lasting four days. In addition, the judge said that \u201cmuch effort was required in the discovery phase, together with time required to try to analyze the data and attempt to utilize it to support the plaintiff\u2019s claims.\u201d But the plaintiff\u2019s primary claim at the first trial was that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, prohibited the captains from participating in any distribution of service charges, a claim the court rejected. And at the second trial, the plaintiff\u2019s effort to prove damages somewhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>between $78,000 and $127,000 netted a base award of $1.26. To be sure, the plaintiff\u2019s case on damages was hindered by the unavailability of certain records the hotel had routinely destroyed pursuant to its record retention policy. However, the judge noted that the plaintiff could have relied on extrapolations from the defendant\u2019s existing records to prove damages with a fair degree of precision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Instead of doing so, the judge observed, the plaintiff \u201copted to merely guess.\u201d Her \u201cestimate\u201d of damages \u201cwas little more than her subjective belief that she was the victim of an unlawful policy resulting in lost gratuities exceeding $70,000,\u201d and her \u201cestimate\u201d of the number of occasions when she worked at events that overlapped with others was \u201cflawed.\u201d So viewed, a significant part of the case\u2019s complexity sprang from claims on which the plaintiff failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">As to the impact of the litigation on the service industry, the judge said that the \u201ccase was not only factually complex but [also] significant to those in the service industry. That the plaintiff prevailed was important not only for her own claim but for others similarly situated (even though this particular defendant, to be fair, did in fact change its system prior to the litigation). However, what the defendant did by choice is now required by judicial fiat. This was no small feat on the part of an attorney representing a waitress against the interests of a major hotel chain.\u201d That said, nothing in the record suggests that any other employers ever used the defendant\u2019s challenged system for paying captains who supervised overlapping events or, if they did, how widespread the practice was. Also, the defendant itself, as the judge noted, had abandoned that system two years before the litigation began. And, to the extent that the decision affected other people in the plaintiff\u2019s position in the service industry, those other people, like the plaintiff herself, were adversely affected by the decision in the liability phase of the case, where the plaintiff did not prevail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>on what had initially been her principal claim that captains should not share in the tip pool at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">There is no doubt that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney was experienced and well credentialed. But the judge\u2019s finding that the attorney had in effect \u201cdiscounted\u201d his fee application by \u201cwaiving\u201d his right to claim a fee for hours spent on the case \u201cwhich in his own estimation were not adequately recorded, i.e., not contemporaneously recorded,\u201d gives insufficient weight to the principle that \u201c[t]he fee applicant bears the burden of documenting in detail the hours expended and of establishing the market rate,\u201d <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. at 477, and that a discount may be appropriate when an attorney includes in a fee request hours for which there is no contemporaneous documentation. See <em>Handy </em>v. <em>Penal Institutions Commr. of Boston, </em>412 Mass. 759, 768-769 (1992).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If undocumented hours are not a proper ingredient of a fee award, omitting them from a fee request does not produce a \u201cdiscounted\u201d request. See generally <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, supra </em>at 476-477.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">In sum, we think that the judge\u2019s analysis of the plaintiff\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees considered with insufficient precision the relationship between the fee requested and the results the litigation achieved, that is, whether the amount of time spent on the case was reasonable in light of those results. To be sure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>neither the amount of the fee, standing alone, nor the relationship between the fee and damages awarded, by itself, is a basis for vacating the fee award. See, e.g., <em>Twin Fires Investment, LLC </em>v. <em>Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co., </em>445 Mass. 411, 427-432 (2005). See also <em>Gay Officers Action League </em>v. <em>Puerto Rico, </em>247 F.3d at 296. However, when a fee request appears on its face dramatically disproportionate to the results the litigation produced, as it does here, the judge must focus with precision on the relationship between the time invested and the results achieved in order to insure that the \u201ctime spent was [not] wholly disproportionate to the interests at stake.\u201d <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. at 323. In this case we think that a second look at the fee application in light of the principles articulated above is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">4. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal. </em>The plaintiff has requested an award of fees in connection with this appeal. Since she has not prevailed here, appellate attorney\u2019s fees are not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Paragraph 3 of the judgment, which trebles the amount of damages to $3.78, and paragraph 4 of the judgment, which assesses attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the amount of $153,717.77, are vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-8\">We note that the trial judge\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact, Memorandum and Order on Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Calculation of Damages As Well As Assessment of Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs\u201d states that the award of fees and costs totals $153,717.55. However, the judgment entered awards $153,717.77, twenty-two cents more. The difference is likely a typographical error; we refer to the judgment amount in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b811-9\">The trial judge explained that result in the following fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-10\">\u201c[A] captain working ten small functions at the same time with three servers will share [one fourth] of the tip from each function. Assuming that the gross invoice for each function is $600 [and] assuming further that the service charge is 14% the captain will receive $21 from each function or $210 for the ten functions, while each server would only get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>$21. General Laws [c.] 149, \u00a7 152A, requires proportionality. Accordingly, applying this principle, thirty-one employees should share a tip pool of . . . $840 divided by 31 employees equals $27.10 for each server and the captain.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\">The action was commenced by Astor D.

See <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, </em>384 Mass. 444, 456-457 (1981), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>456 U.S. 947 (1982). The twelve gained currency in other Federal circuits and ultimately obtained approval by the United States Supreme Court. See <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 429-430 &amp; n.3 (1983). In <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, supra, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court said that several of these factors were appropriate to consider when using the lodestar method and assessing the reasonableness of time spent on a case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Perhaps for that reason, the judge stated that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was \u201cmeritorious\u201d and that her inability \u201cto meet her burden of proof was a problem of evidence and not necessarily a reflection of the merits of the case.\u201d This sounds as if the judge were suggesting that a different approach to the evidence would have led to a better result. Yet the judge did not relate that suggestion to her analysis of the degree of success for which counsel was to be compensated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\">As for the rate the attorney charged, the judge found that \u201cattorneys of similar experience and expertise in the greater Boston area would likely charge rates in the range of $250-$350 per hour for this work.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s attorney charged $265 per hour, an amount within that range. Later, though, the judge said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">\u201c[t]he plaintiff notes that the United States Attorney\u2019s Office has compiled an extensive matrix, called the \u2018Laffey Matrix.\u2019 Under this matrix which the Federal Courts have used to ascertain reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in \u2018fee shifting\u2019 cases, the appropriate hourly fee for attorneys with the experience of these plaintiff\u2019s attorneys is more than $115 per hour more than [the] rate currently sought by plaintiff\u2019s counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">The judge apparently used the \u201cLaffey Matrix\u201d in forming her judgment that the attorney had \u201cdiscounted\u201d his fee application. However, the \u201cLaffey Matrix\u201d yields an hourly rate $30 per hour higher than what the judge found was the Boston market rate, or, more precisely, the range of market rates, for similar services by lawyers with similar experience and qualifications. The relationship between Boston market rate and the \u201cLaffey Matrix\u201d is unclear.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
