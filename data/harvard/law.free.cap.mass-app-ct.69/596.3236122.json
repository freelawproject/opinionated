L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C(a), commission of a drug offense within a school zone in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, and possession of a controlled substance in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. On appeal, he argues that (1) G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, does not impose strict liability for drug violations occurring within 1,000 feet of a <em>preschool, </em>and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>judge therefore erred in denying his motion for a required finding because the Commonwealth failed to prove that he knew the boundaries of the preschool near where he committed the offense; and (2) the judge erred in refusing to give an entrapment instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><em>Factual background. </em>We discuss the facts leading to the defendant\u2019s arrest, reserving some details for our discussion that follows. Because our analysis of the defendant\u2019s right to an entrapment instruction requires us to evaluate whether \u201cthere is <em>any </em>evidence\u201d of entrapment, regardless of its credibility (emphasis in original), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracey, </em>416 Mass. 528, 536 (1993), our narrative is taken from both the uncontradicted facts and the defendant\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">During the summer of 2004, the Berkshire County drug task force conducted an undercover operation at the Triplex theater parking lot in Great Barrington. The operation resulted in the arrest of nineteen individuals, including the defendant. Detective Felix Aguirre (the detective) served as the sole undercover agent for the operation. He had worked as an undercover narcotics officer since December of 1998, when he graduated from the police academy, having been specially trained there in the investigation of illegal narcotics. At the time of trial, he had effected over 800 undercover purchases of such drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">When the undercover operation in question commenced in June of 2004, the detective began frequenting the parking lot in order to familiarize himself with the people who passed time there. The defendant was one of those people; in the summer of 2004, he was seventeen years old and had just completed his junior year of high school. He lived in the town of Otis with his mother and stepfather, and three to four times per week would ride his bicycle approximately one hour to spend time with friends in the theater parking lot, where they would \u201chang out,\u201d play hacky sack, and smoke marijuana. The defendant did not speak with the detective one-on-one prior to June 30, but two to three weeks earlier they had become acquainted in a larger group of people. The defendant knew the detective as Jos\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">On June 30, 2004, the defendant left his home between 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. and rode his bicycle to the Triplex parking lot. Although he usually brought food on his trip, he for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>got to do so and had not eaten anything that morning. After arriving at the Triplex, the defendant smoked marijuana with some friends and \u201cwas high.\u201d The detective approached the defendant and engaged him in conversation for approximately one hour. During their conversation, the detective asked the defendant \u201cif [he] had any smoke,\u201d which the defendant interpreted to be a query as to whether he \u201cwanted to go smoke\u201d marijuana. The detective then said \u201clet\u2019s take a walk.\u201d This statement did not seem strange to the defendant, as he and his friends never smoked in the parking lot, but instead walked behind the lot or toward the railroad tracks to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">When the two began walking together, the defendant thought that \u201c[he] was going to head up past the Triplex [to the area where he and his friends usually smoked]. And [the detective] was walking the other way, so I turned in that direction and started following. ... I thought we were going to go smoke, but I was kind of confused because we usually went the other way.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The detective walked onto Elm Street, taking a left into an area that was within the statutory school zone. The defendant followed. The detective asked the defendant \u201chow much [he] had,\u201d to which the defendant responded \u201ca little bit.\u201d The detective then presented a twenty dollar bill, rendering the defendant \u201cconfused\u201d because he thought their mutual intention was to smoke. Because he was hungry, the defendant took out the small quantity of marijuana he had and gave it to the detective, who, in turn, handed him a twenty dollar bill. The defendant then purchased a burrito with the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The incident took place at a location that, at its shortest distance, was 426.5 feet from the First Congregational Church. The church housed the Great Barrington Cooperative Preschool, a licensed and accredited privately owned facility that serves children from two years and nine months to kindergarten age.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The defendant had not previously sold marijuana to anyone, did not do so subsequently, and had no criminal record. He was arrested on September 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>Knowledge of the location of the preschool. </em>Relying on a novel interpretation of the school zone statute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, the defendant argues that the Commonwealth was required to prove that he knew (or should have known) the location of the preschool. The defendant contends that the strict liability component of the statute cannot be applied to preschools, a location that the Legislature added to the statute several years after its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Originally, \u00a7 32J was enacted, see St. 1989, c. 227, \u00a7 2, \u201cto create drug-free school zones.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652 (1992). By its original terms, the statute punishes certain drag offenses occurring within 1,000 feet of an elementary, vocational, or secondary school. In challenges to the statute following its 1989 enactment, the Supreme Judicial Court determined that while a defendant must have an intent to commit the predicate drug offense, there is no mens rea requirement with respect to where the offense is committed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>413 Mass. 224, 229 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucou-let, supra </em>at 650. That court concluded that \u201cit matters not whether the drug dealer has knowledge of the location and existence of a qualifying school.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>442 Mass. 118, 125 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Since the statute\u2019s enactment, the Legislature has twice \u201cexpanded the zone of safety to include other places where children would likely be present,\u201d adding in 1993, see St. 1993, c. 335, the area \u201cwithin one hundred feet of a public park or playground,\u201d and in 1998, see St. 1998, c. 194, \u00a7 146, the area within 1,000 feet of an \u201caccredited preschool\u201d or an \u201caccredited headstart facility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, supra. </em>Notwithstanding these additions to the statute, the Legislature never amended the last sentence, which still states that the \u201c[l]ack of knowledge of <em>school </em>boundaries shall not be a defense\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Citing these changes to the statute, the defendant argues that strict criminal liability only applies when the location where the offense is alleged to have occurred includes a qualifying school as originally set forth in the statute. He contends that with respect to the later enumerated locations, including preschools, the Commonwealth must prove an intent to commit the offense within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>that specific area. According to the defendant, the failure to include the locations set out in the expanded safety zones within the last sentence of the statute exempts offenses that occur in those zones from strict criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Neither the decisional law nor the apparent legislative intent supports the defendant\u2019s interpretation. Cases discussing G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, make clear that the purpose of the statute is to keep children safe from \u201cthe potential infection of drugs\u201d by creating safety zones where children may be present. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Roucoulet, <em>supra </em>at 651, quoting from <em>State </em>v. Ivory, 124 N.J. 582, 594-595 (1991). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Klusman, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 919, 920 (1999). Viewing the statute as an exercise of the Legislature\u2019s broad authority to protect the general welfare, specifically children, the court has held that the Legislature properly forwent any element of sci-enter with respect to whether a defendant had an intent to commit the predicate offense within any specific area. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, supra </em>at 229; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, supra </em>at 650-651. The amendments do no more than expand that zone of safety to additional places where children are likely to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument also fails because the imposition of strict liability pursuant to G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, does not turn on the last sentence of the statute. While the language in that sentence was certainly looked to by the court when it initially considered whether the statute imposes strict liability, it was not the sole determinant. Indeed, the court made clear that even absent specific language, criminal statutes may be construed, and have been construed, to permit conviction without proof of mens rea. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>413 Mass. at 229. Section 32J provides no exception to that long-standing rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Even if we were to conclude that the last sentence of the statute determines whether strict liability is permissible with respect to the locations added after the statute\u2019s initial enactment, the result would not change. We agree with the trial judge, who in his denial of the defendant\u2019s posttrial motion to set aside his guilty verdicts stated: \u201c[T]he generic term \u2018school\u2019 encompasses all forms of licensed or [accredited educational entities, and would certainly include preschool and day care facilities. It would make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>little sense for the Legislature to add a knowledge requirement for the sale of drugs near a preschool or day care facility, but not for schools educating older children. . . . The statute is not ambiguous as the only reasonable interpretation would include preschools and day care facilities within the term \u2018schools.\u2019 See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>442 Mass. [at] 125.\u201d The Commonwealth was not required to prove the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the boundaries of the preschool in order to convict him of violating G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><em>Entrapment as to distribution. </em>At trial, counsel for the defendant requested a jury instruction on entrapment based principally upon evidence that the detective initiated the solicitation of the defendant, who was under the influence of marijuana at the time he spoke with, and passed marijuana to, the detective. The request was denied. The defense of entrapment traditionally involves government inducement of criminality by an individual who was not predisposed to commit the crime. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gendron, </em>18 F.3d 955, 961-962 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1051 (1994). The concept is premised upon the principle that while \u201c[i]t is socially desirable for criminals to be apprehended and brought to justice and there is nothing whatever wrong or out of place in setting traps to catch those bent on crime[,] the state cannot tolerate . . . having its officers, who are charged with the duty of enforcing the law, instigate crime by implanting criminal ideas in innocent minds and thereby bringing about offenses that otherwise would never have been perpetrated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvard, </em>356 Mass. 452, 459 (1969), quoting from Perkins, Criminal Law 921 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">An entrapment instruction is required when there is evidence of a government agent\u2019s intentional, persistent, and repeated conduct that goes beyond mere solicitation or request that the defendant participate in a criminal act. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reme-dor, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 694, 703 (2001). Though the threshold showing required for such an instruction is low, the defendant must point to more than mere solicitation by government officials. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracey, </em>416 Mass. 528, 536 (1993). When determining whether the defendant has produced evidence sufficient to warrant an entrapment instruction, \u201c[t]he inquiry is whether there is <em>any </em>evidence sufficient to raise the defense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>even if the evidence is unsubstantial and even if the evidence comes solely from the defendant\u2019s testimony\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Ibid. </em>If a defendant submits evidence of inducement, \u201cthe burden rests upon the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the predisposition of the defendant to commit the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Although it is a legitimate question whether the defendant was induced by the detective to distribute marijuana,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we conclude that the judge did not err in denying an entrapment instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Remedor, supra </em>at 703-704. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shuman, </em>391 Mass. 345, 352 (1984). We recognize that the detective was a skilled and specially trained detective with substantial experience making undercover purchases of illegal narcotics, while the defendant was a seventeen year old high school- student who was hungry and under the influence of marijuana at the time he made the illegal sale to the detective. Further, the defendant asserts that he was not predisposed to sell drugs. We accept the defendant\u2019s argument in this regard, and that the delivery to the detective was the sole occasion on which he provided another with drugs with a return of money. However, for purposes of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32C(a) and 32J, \u201c[distribute\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>defined as \u201cto deliver.\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1971, c. 1071, \u00a7 1. \u201cDeliver,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201cto transfer, whether by actual or constructive transfer, a controlled substance from one person to another . . . .\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>421 Mass. 547, 550 n.4 (1995), quoting from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 475 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201c[i]n criminal law, a person \u2018distributes\u2019 a dangerous drug when he sells, transfers, gives or delivers to another, or leaves, barters or exchanges with another, or offers or agrees to do the same\u201d). See also <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 301-303 (1932). Based upon the defendant\u2019s testimony, he had shared marijuana with his friends earlier that day, and intended to share what he had in his pocket with the detective. Such sharing constitutes distribution within the meaning of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s own testimony indicates that he was predisposed to distributing marijuana. As he agreed to go on \u201ca walk\u201d with the detective so that both of them could smoke some of the marijuana in his possession, he was not induced by the detective to engage in the act of distribution. There was no error in denying an entrapment instruction with regard to the charge of distribution of a class D substance, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><em>Entrapment as to the school zone charge. </em>Whether the judge erred in refusing to provide an entrapment instruction on the separate charge of commission of drug violation within a school zone, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, is a distinct question analytically. The argument that the defendant was entrapped into committing the school zone offense was raised at trial<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but was not briefed or argued as a distinct issue in this direct appeal. Because insuf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ficient attention has been paid to the issue in this appellate record, we decline to review it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Nevertheless, we take this opportunity to comment that while the traditional indicia of entrapment discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracey, supra </em>at 536, and noted earlier, apply to ordinary crimes, the school zone statute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, is not an ordinary crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The hallmarks of entrapment articulated in <em>Tracey </em>may therefore not be exhaustive, at least when considering the defense as it applies to G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, on facts such as those pertaining here. However, as we have said, on this record we will not address the question whether the detective\u2019s act of leading the defendant into the school zone was government behavior sufficient to entitle the defendant to an entrapment instruction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In view of the detective\u2019s training and experience, his responsibility for this operation, and his extensive surveillance of activities at the parking lot, it may be inferred that he knew where the defendant and others smoked marijuana, and where they did not go. Despite his denial, it may also be inferred that the detective knew where the school zone was located.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The court has described the types of government conduct that could constitute entrapment as including \u201caggressive persuasion, coercive encouragement, lengthy negotiations, pleading or arguing with the defendant, repeated or persistent solicitation, persuasion, importuning, [or] playing on sympathy or other emotion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracey, supra </em>at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">This list may not be exhaustive. In some cases lacking any indication of the types of government conduct noted in <em>Tracey, </em>an entrapment instruction was given, and the unsuccessful argument by the defendant on appeal went to whether he or she was entitled to a judicial finding of entrapment as matter of law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvard, supra </em>at 460 (although the defendant was not entrapped as matter of law, an entrapment instruction was given for a defendant who had a good deal of familiarity with narcotics: \u201c[o]n the basis of this evidence it was for the jury, not the court, to say whether [the undercover agent] was leading an innocent person into a career of trafficking in narcotics on which otherwise he would not have embarked\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 648-651 (although the defendant physician was not entrapped as matter of law, \u201c[t]he defense of entrapment [was] appropriately raised\u201d where the defendant, without ever conducting a physical examination or taking a medical history of the undercover agent posing as a patient, provided him with prescriptions for controlled substances, gave him such substances in unlabeled \u201cSaran Wrap,\u201d stated \u201cthat she had opium and hashish in her home,\u201d and gave him \u201ca quantity of cocaine\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Throughout the trial, the defendant\u2019s lawyer attempted to show that the detective led the defendant to the school zone location where the distribution took place, and that the defendant was \u201cconfused\u201d because he and his friends did not normally walk to this area to smoke marijuana. Moreover, when requesting the entrapment instruction, counsel supported his argument with references to both the fact that the defendant was under the influence of marijuana at the time he was approached by the detective, and the fact that the detective led the defendant to the particular location. Although the argument regarding entrapment contained in the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of his motion to stay imposition of sentence refers only to the defendant being under the influence of marijuana at the time of the incident, his motion after discharge of jury refers to the judge\u2019s refusal to instruct on entrapment despite evidence that \u201cthe undercover police officer suggested the defendant walk with him, brought him to a spot within a school zone and then offered him $20.00 for the small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>amount of marijuana he had.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b630-10\">The Supreme Judicial Court has pointed out that the statute \u201cresembles other criminal statutes which punish an underlying violation committed with mens rea and consider the offense aggravated by a fact of which the defendant may not have express knowledge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>413 Mass. at 230.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b630-11\">We are well aware that conviction under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, requires no proof of intent. Nonetheless, if, as the Supreme Judicial Court has indicated, the purpose of the school zone statute is to \u201ccreate drug-free zones of safety where children could be, learn and play free from the potential infection of drugs,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. at 651, we find it unsettling that a violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, occurred in this case because the defendant followed a police officer into a school zone.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b630-7\">Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsK\">(concurring in the result). Although it appears that there is sufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed and distributed a controlled substance, I reluctantly concur in affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of that substance within a school zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The defendant\u2019s second claim of error is framed as a failure to give an entrapment instruction. While entitlement to an entrapment instruction usually requires evidence of persistent and repeated conduct on the part of the government agent, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 652 (1972), the strict liability school zone offense is not a typical crime. If a defendant intends the distribution, and whether by inadvertence or inten-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>tian the distribution occurs within a school zone, the case is an ordinary school zone case. Here, however, the detective was conducting an undercover narcotics operation, and was highly experienced in his trade. He knew that the defendant did not go to the school zone to smoke marijuana but, to the contrary, would go elsewhere. The detective led the defendant to the school zone, and it was predominately his acts, not those of the defendant, that made for an enhanced penalty offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The school zone statute provides that \u201c[ljack of knowledge of school boundaries shall not be a defense to any person who violates the provisions of this section,\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, thus permitting the imposition of strict liability for drug offenses occurring within 1,000 feet of a school. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Klusman, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 919, 920 (1999). While the Supreme Judicial Court has held that the theory of \u201csentencing entrapment\u201d should not be considered by a fact finder in determining whether a defendant was entrapped into selling a greater quantity of narcotics than he allegedly otherwise would have sold in order to increase the severity of his sentence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>421 Mass. 686, 692-693 (1996), our courts have never decided whether the entrapment defense could be applicable in a case, such as this, where a defendant is led into a particular strict liability offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I believe that had such an instruction been requested specifically here, the defendant would have been entitled to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Moreover, in his memorable speech to United States Attorneys, Justice Jackson, when he was the United States Attorney General, cautioned against the great \u201cdanger of abuse of prosecuting power.\u201d <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>487 U.S. 654, 728 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>(1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting), quoting from R. Jackson, The Federal Prosecutor, Address Delivered at the Second Annual Conference of United States Attorneys, April 1, 1940. In the instant circumstances, even if an entrapment instruction had been allowed, I believe that an enlightened prosecutor should not have sought a conviction for the school zone offense. A government official (i.e., police officer) induced the defendant to enter a danger zone that exposed him to an enhanced penalty. This conduct is particularly outrageous because the young man went along with an experienced police officer, who undoubtedly was aware of the consequences of drug activities ip a school zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">This case is made all the more troubling by the fact that because of the government\u2019s actions, a teenage defendant with no known involvement in drag sales other than this isolated incident, and for whom there is no indication of drug use other than marijuana, was subjected to a greatly enhanced penalty, including incarceration for two years, due to his conviction under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. Possible collateral consequences of conviction faced by this young defendant may be substantial. \u201c[Sjociety has created a vast network of collateral consequences that severely inhibit an ex-offender\u2019s ability to reconnect to the social and economic structures that would lead to full participation in society. These structural disabilities often include bars to obtaining government benefits, voting disenfranchisement, disqualification from educational grants, exclusion from certain business and professional licenses, and exclusion from public housing.\u201d Thompson, Navigating the Hidden Obstacles to Ex-Offender Reentry, 45 B.C. L. Rev. 255, 258 (2004) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In closing, I recommend that prosecutors read the full text of Justice Jackson\u2019s remarks; I also think that trial judges have some responsibility not to be a part of what appears to be an unconscionable prosecution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The defendant had become acquainted with the detective two or three weeks prior to the date of the event giving rise to the school zone violation at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Courts in other jurisdictions have found that strict liability crimes do not preclude an entrapment instruction. See, e.g., <em>Albaugh </em>v. State, 721 N.E.2d 1233, 1236 (Ind. 1999) (entrapment defense applicable to strict liability crime of operating a vehicle while intoxicated); <em>Kansas </em>v. Swafford, 20 Kan. App. 2d 563, 567-568 (1995) (though there was no \u201coutrageous government conduct\u201d as matter of law, this defense, which is \u201can offshoot of entrapment,\u201d could be applicable to a school zone charge); <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>822 So. 2d 780, 784-785 (La. App. 2002) (though defendant failed to prove that he was entrapped into selling cocaine within a drug-free school zone, the defense could be raised to this charge).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
