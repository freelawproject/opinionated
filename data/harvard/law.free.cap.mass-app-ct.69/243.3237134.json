The declared purpose of such designations is \u201cthe promotion of . . . water-dependent industrial uses,\u201d pursuant to the following objectives set forth in 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 25.01(2) (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">\u201c[Wjhat remains of the industrialized coast should be preserved to the maximum extent practicable in order to meet the long term, cumulative space needs of the water-dependent industries which these areas are so well-suited to accommodate. As a matter of state policy, it is not desirable to allow these scarce and non-renewable resources of the marine economy to be irretrievably committed to, or otherwise significantly impaired by, non-industrial or nonwater-dependent types of development which enjoy a far greater range of locational options.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">\u201cAccordingly, within [designated port areas] it is the intent of the [coastal zone management] Program to encourage water-dependent industrial use and to prohibit, on tidelands subject to the jurisdiction of [G. L.] c. 91, other uses except for compatible public access and certain industrial, commercial, and transportation activities that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>can occur on an interim basis without significant detriment to the capacity of [designated port areas] to accommodate water-dependent industrial use in the future.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><em>Administrative proceedings. </em>The present controversy involves the Mystic River designated port area in Charlestown (the DPA), whose boundaries were designated in 1978. It arises from the petitions of the owners of five properties in the DPA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (all seeking to develop their properties for nonwater-dependent uses, notably residential condominium complexes), who requested that OCZM conduct what is known as a \u201cboundary review\u201d to determine whether their lands should remain within the DPA or be removed therefrom.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After completing the requested boundary review, OCZM issued its decision in a boundary review dated October 9, 2002, which concluded that the Schrafft Center at 529 Main Street should no longer continue to be included within the DPA<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; that the other four properties all met the designation standards set forth in the regulations for remaining in the DPA; that two of those properties, 425 Medford Street and the Charlestown Commerce Center (the CCC) at 30-50 Terminal Street, should remain in the DPA; but that 465 Medford Street and the Nancy Sales property at 261-287 Medford Street should be excluded from the DPA upon the owners\u2019 satisfactory compliance with certain specified conditions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On December 16, 2002, the director of OCZM (director) (charged under the regulations with making the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>determination) effectively adopted the conclusions and recommendations of the boundary review as his designation decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><em>Proceedings below. </em>That decision triggered three separate suits that were consolidated in Superior Court. United States Gypsum Company (Gypsum), owner of 200 Terminal Street,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and La-Farge North America, Inc. (LaFarge), owner of 285 Medford Street (both located within the DPA), brought essentially identical complaints seeking reversal of the conditional exclusion from the DPA of 465 Medford Street and the Nancy Sales property, on the grounds that the director exceeded his authority in excluding those properties and that his decision was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The complaint of Donato Pizzuti, as trustee of the realty trust that owned the CCC, demanded the same relief as the other plaintiffs but also sought a boundary review leading to exclusion of the CCC from the DPA; challenged, as a deprivation of due process, the denial of an exclusion for the CCC in the proceedings under review; and asserted that the CCC\u2019s continued inclusion in the DPA constituted a regulatory taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In a lengthy decision (on review under G. L. c. 30A), a Superior Court judge specially assigned to hear the consolidated actions denied Gypsum\u2019s and LaFarge\u2019s respective motions for summary judgment and Pizzuti\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and allowed the defendants\u2019 cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment. Concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the director of OCZM had discretion so to act, the judge rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that the director exceeded his authority in excluding 465 Medford Street and the Nancy Sales property from the DPA; that the designation decision was not supported by substantial evidence<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; and that it should be reversed to the extent that it excluded those properties once the conditions imposed by the director were met.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">On appeal, Gypsum presses its contention that the director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>had no discretion and no authority to exclude the two properties from the DPA and that the decision to do so lacked substantial evidence. LaFarge, focusing only on the Nancy Sales property (contiguous to its own), argues that the decision to exclude it was unsupported by substantial evidence. Intervener Conservation Law Foundation maintains that the director lacked any discretion to remove or exclude properties from the DPA, and that his decision subverts the purpose of the OCZM regulations. Pizzuti has pressed all of his arguments, including denial of due process and regulatory taking.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">We agree with the plaintiffs that the exclusion of 465 Med-ford Street and the Nancy Sales property from the DPA was in excess of the director\u2019s discretionary authority under the regulations and was unsupported by substantial evidence, but we affirm the director\u2019s decision as to all claims raised regarding the CCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>The director\u2019s authority. </em>We acknowledge the familiar, frequently applied standard governing judicial review of an agency\u2019s interpretation of the regulations it administers: the agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its own rule is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>to great weight, and \u201cwe must apply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action\u201d being challenged. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>385 Mass. 651, 654-655 (1982), quoting from <em>Colella </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>360 Mass. 152, 156-157 (1971). Nonetheless, despite an appropriate judicial attitude of deference, \u201c[ojnce an agency has seen fit to promulgate regulations, it must comply with those regulations,\u201d <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 425, 427 (1983), and the \u201ccourts will not hesitate to overrule agency interpretations of rules when those interpretations are arbitrary, unreasonable, or inconsistent with the plain terms of the rule itself.\u201d <em>Manor </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Cedar Junction, </em>416 Mass. 820, 824 (1994), quoting from <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> An agency\u2019s \u201cconsiderable leeway in interpreting a statute [or regulation] it is charged with enforcing\u201d disappears if \u201ca statute [or regulation] unambiguously bars the agency\u2019s approach.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 633 (2005), quoting from <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 595-596 (1992). The \u201crationale for judicial deference ceases to apply where ... the agency has failed to adhere to its own . . . regulatory framework . . . [or] [made] a decision without sufficient evidentiary support.\u201d <em>Cobble </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Social Servs., </em>430 Mass. 385, 395 (1999). That is the situation before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The DPA designation regulations clearly state that \u201c[a]n area of land reviewed under [the regulations] <em>shall be included or remain in a DPA </em>... if CZM finds that the area is in substantial conformance with the . . . criteria governing suitability to accommodate water-dependent industrial use, as appropriate to the harbor in question\u201d (emphasis added). 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 25.04(2) (1994). It is undisputed that 465 Medford Street, the Nancy Sales property, and the CCC were found by OCZM to \u201cmeet the designation standards [set forth] at 301 CMR 24.04(2),\u201d which \u201cestablish[ed] the suitability of the subject properties ... to remain in the DPA.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 25.03(5) (1994) similarly provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\u201cWithin 60 days after the close of the public comment [on the boundary review], the Director shall issue a final written designation decision stating whether the area(s) under review <em>shall be included </em>within a DPA, <em>in accordance with the designation standards </em>set forth at 301 CMR 25.04\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Taken together in their plain meaning (and construing \u201cshall\u201d in its common obligatory rather than permissive sense, see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>District Atty. for the N. Dist., </em>342 Mass. 212, 215 [1961]), these regulations mandate the inclusion of a property in the DPA when it meets the designation standards. They do not even hint that the director has any discretion to <em>exclude </em>an area that otherwise falls within designation criteria. That plain meaning is reinforced by the admonition in \u00a7 25.05(2) authorizing the OCZM to \u201cmake minor adjustments of an existing DPA boundary . . . [but] such adjustments generally should not result in a net reduction in the total area of the DPA.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is further buttressed by the stated purposes of DPA regulations \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>encourage water-dependent industrial use and to prohibit . . . other uses\u201d (with exceptions not relevant to the uses the owners plan at 465 Medford Street and the Nancy Sales property), so that \u201cwhat remains of the industrialized coast should be preserved to the maximum extent practicable.\u201d 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 25.01(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">These several complementary regulatory provisions clearly circumscribe and limit the director\u2019s discretion in matters of designation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. at 427. He nonetheless relied on language contained in the third sentence of \u00a7 25.03(5) to support his exercise of discretion in this case. That language states: \u201cThe [director may qualify, limit, or otherwise condition the designation decision in any manner that serves the purposes of these regulations . . . .\u201d The director, the judge, and the appellees have all asserted at various stages of this case that this discretion to \u201ccondition\u201d a designation decision encompasses any condition that arguably ultimately benefits the over-all DPA,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> including conditioning a property\u2019s exclusion from the DPA as was done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>We do not think that the grant of limited discretion can reasonably be so broadly read. As a matter of normal syntax, the discretion to condition applies to \u201cthe designation decision\u201d that is specified in the first sentence of \u00a7 25.03(5) \u2014 the \u201cfinal written designation decision stating whether the area(s) under review <em>shall be included within a DPA, in accordance with the designation </em>standards\u201d (emphasis added). It would be an extraordinary distortion of ordinary meaning to transform the discretion to condition a decision designating a property that must be included or remain in the DPA because it meets the designation criteria (as in the case of each property here) into discretion to do precisely the reverse, i.e., to exclude otherwise includable property, entirely and forever, from the regulatory framework intended to further the fundamental goal of protecting scarce coastal zone resources, with a result that tends to minimize, not maximize, the shrinking industrialized coast and undermines, not serves, the explicit purposes of the DPA regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Nor do the usual and ordinary meanings of the operative words appearing in \u00a7 25.03(5) (meanings which we apply when construing otherwise undefined language of a regulation or statute, <em>Warcewicz </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>410 Mass. 548, 550 [1991]) support the interpretation championed by the director and upheld by the judge below, but inconsistent with the plain terms and purposes of the DPA regulations. All three operative words (\u201cqualify,\u201d \u201climit,\u201d and \u201ccondition\u201d) connote restrictions on, or a degree of modification of, an antecedent object or state<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u2014 here the final \u201cdesignation decision stating whether ... [a property] shall be included within a DPA, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>accordance with the designation standards.\u201d 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 25.03(5). They would not, in ordinary usage, appear to encompass a <em>complete </em>change or replacement, particularly one which constitutes the very opposite of the antecedent decision, i.e., exclusion from the DPA rather than inclusion, and which is incompatible with the express public purpose of preserving our diminishing coastal zone from irretrievable commitment to non-water dependent development.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In short, we conclude that the judge erred in upholding what amounted to unfettered discretion on the part of the OCZM director, with respect to the conditioning of the designation of properties within the DPA so as to exclude 465 Medford Street and the Nancy Sales property from the DPA.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Although we must give due deference to an administrator\u2019s \u201cexpertise and experience,\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, the principle of deference does not extend to judicial abdication, <em>Finklestein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. at 478, particularly when the exercise of that expertise and experience is fundamentally at odds with overarching public policy, here that of protecting and preserving the Commonwealth\u2019s marine economy and nonrenewable coastal resources to the maximum extent practicable. As the Supreme Judicial Court recently stated in an analogous context, \u201c[t]he rights of the public in Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>monwealth tidelands [and coastal resources] . . . cannot be relinquished by departmental regulation, regardless of the fact that the department has proffered potentially worthy public policy rationales in this regard.\u201d <em>Moot </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. </em>Protection, 448 Mass. 340, 353 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">2. <em>Substantiality of the evidence. </em>Even were we persuaded that the director had the discretionary authority he claimed under the DPA regulations, his decision would have to be supported by substantial evidence to pass judicial muster. See <em>Cobble </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Social Servs., </em>430 Mass. at 390; note 13, <em>supra. </em>We disagree with the motion judge on this point, because the record reveals that the director\u2019s conditional exclusion decision was not so supported.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">It was generally undisputed during the proceedings below that the inadequacy of the existing transportation infrastructure was a major problem facing the DPA (the businesses within the DPA creating significant truck traffic that congests the relatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>narrow Medford Street, which is better suited for residential use). The poor trucking facilities and annoyance to the neighboring community have been a matter of concern for decades, and as long ago as 1990, city of Boston planners studied and proposed roadway improvements in the area. It was, therefore, not illogical for OCZM and its director to conclude that a dedicated transportation corridor diverting industrial traffic off Medford Street into a two-way industrial road with a direct connection to the highway would provide substantial long-term benefits to the current and future industrial uses in the DPA. Overcoming two identified significant obstacles to construction of the roadway \u2014 paying for an engineering study and design for the transportation corridor and obtaining the right to build it over the Flatley trustees\u2019 land at 425 and 465 Medford Street \u2014 was the rationale for OCZM\u2019s and the director\u2019s exclusion decision here challenged. As the judge summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">\u201cEssentially, while concluding that 465 Medford Street and the Nancy Sales Property met the designation and standards to be included within the DPA, OCZM in its Boundary Review decided that the need for this new transportation corridor is so important to the future of the DPA that it would agree to exclude these two properties from the DPA if their owners would take specific steps [i.e., funding the design study and granting an easement] that would increase the likelihood of such a corridor being built.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The judge concluded that there was evidence to support the director\u2019s \u201creasonable decision . . . [and that the] conditions he extracted from the owners of 465 Medford Street and the Nancy Sales Property significantly increased the likelihood that the critical industrial roadway would be built sooner rather than later,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and that the remaining businesses in the DPA would economically be healthier in the long run as a result.\u201d We agree with the plaintiffs, however, that the director\u2019s decision fails the substantial evidence test.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The director\u2019s designation decision failed to address the single most important issue regarding construction of a new roadway: the financing of its cost, which had been estimated to be $5 million in 1990 and, with inflation, at least $20 million in 2005. The record contains no evidence even suggesting that the Legislature, the Governor, the city of Boston, any public agency, or any private entities would be currently willing or able to pay for the roadway\u2019s construction, or would be willing or in a position to do so at any future time. Even if the owners of 465 Medford Street and the Nancy Sales property met the conditions imposed by the director as the price of their exclusion from the DPA, construction of the industrial roadway at any foreseeable time in the future remains speculative at best in the absence of any commitment of public or private funds. As even the judge noted, \u201c[tjhere certainly remains the possibility that [the director\u2019s] effort to \u2018jump start\u2019 the construction of this roadway will fail for lack of public funds, or that the effort will not bear fruit for many years.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In sum, there was no evidence \u2014 let alone substantial evidence \u2014 that the industrial roadway deemed important enough by the director to take the drastic step of excluding otherwise suitable properties from the DPA will ever be constructed, for want of financing, in the reasonably near, or even in the remote, future. The director\u2019s decision thus failed the test of \u201crational probability.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> He was not presented with a choice between two fairly conflicting views. On this record, there were not conflicting views about the clearly stated purposes of the DPA regulations to preserve water-dependent industrial uses and prohibit other uses within the DPA to the maximum extent practicable; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>nor about the subject properties meeting all of the DPA criteria (they did); nor about the director\u2019s decision having the conceded effect of exacerbating the traffic situation; nor about the absence of any reasonably foreseeable source of financing for the industrial roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The judge\u2019s characterization of the decision\u2019s making the roadway a reality \u201csooner rather than later,\u201d with benefit to the DPA \u201cin the long run,\u201d was impermissibly and reversibly vague and speculative, because the evidence supporting those imprecise predictions pointed to no \u201cappreciable probability\u201d that the roadway would ever be built.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The judge accordingly erred in failing to reverse the director\u2019s designation decision to the extent it excluded 465 Medford Street and the Nancy Sales property from the DPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">3. <em>The Charlestown Commerce Center. </em>Our ruling as to those two properties affirmatively resolves the first of CCC owner Piz-zuti\u2019s alternative demands, for reversal of the decision excluding those properties from the DPA. As to his primary prayer \u2014 the reversal of that part of the designation decision which continued the inclusion of the CCC in the DPA, the judge correctly held that there was \u201cmore than substantial evidence\u201d in the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>trative record establishing that the CCC met the four regulatory criteria for inclusion within the DPA, as specified in 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 25.04(2) and (3) (1994). Pizzuti\u2019s contention that his due process rights were violated by the OCZM\u2019s failure to include him in the \u201cnegotiations\u201d that led to the exclusion of 465 Medford Street and the Nancy Sales property was correctly rejected by the judge as being without factual or legal basis (the agency having fully complied with its notice and comment obligations under its regulations), and is, in any event, effectively rendered moot by our reversal of that exclusion decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Finally, we agree with the judge\u2019s holding that the continued inclusion of the CCC within the DPA does not constitute an unconstitutional regulatory taking that must be annulled.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Piz-zuti\u2019s claim to have been deprived of all \u201ceconomically viable use\u201d of his land by virtue of its inclusion is without merit, because he failed to support his motion for judgment on the pleadings<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> with <em>any </em>facts (in the form required by Mass. R.Civ.P. 56(e), 365 Mass. 824 [1974]), and rested only on the allegations of his unverified complaint and the conclusory assertions in his memorandum supporting his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Moreover, as OCZM and the judge observed, the facts in the administrative record demonstrate that Pizzuti could not prove a takings claim as to the CCC (even were he entitled to \u201cindependent\u201d de nova judicial review), because the DPA regulations permit twenty-five percent of the property (and, under certain conditions, up to thirty-five percent) to be used for nonwater dependent and nonindustrial purposes (so long as they are not incompatible with activities characteristic of a working waterfront).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.02 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">On this record (even viewed in the light most favorable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>him), Pizzuti could not establish that inclusion of the CCC in the DPA constituted a categorical taking by depriving him of all economically beneficial use. See <em>Zanghi </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Bedford, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 82, 83-87 (2004), and cases cited. Compare <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 1019 n.8 (1992) (acknowledging that loss of even ninety-five percent of use of property in consequence of regulatory restrictions is not deprivation of \u201call\u201d use for taking purposes).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Pizzuti argues that he has a valid taking case even if there were not a complete denial of all beneficial use on his property (under the multifactor inquiry of <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 123-134 [1978], used to determine if a regulation has gone \u201ctoo far\u201d and become an unconstitutional taking). That claim was also correctly rejected by the judge. In the <em>Penn Cent. Transp. </em>case, the United States Supreme Court identified three principal factors to guide the inquiry: the economic impact of the regulation; the extent to which it has interfered with the owner\u2019s \u201cdistinct investment-backed expectations\u201d; and the character of the government actions.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 124.

See <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Envtl. Mgmt., </em>439 Mass. 738, 745-749 (2003).

It was also reasonable for him to conclude that, despite the apparent need, little progress was being made towards its construction. The Director, adopting the findings of the Boundary Review, essentially found that public funds for the construction of the roadway were unlikely until three issues were resolved: (1) a state agency must purchase the rights to the rail line; (2) the transportation corridor must be studied and designed; and (3) the Flatley Trusts must allow the corridor to be built over their land. Finding that the first issue was already being addressed by the Commonwealth and Massport, [the Director] essentially traded the DPA designation of 465 Medford Street and the Nancy Sales Property in order to resolve the latter two issues. As a condition of being excluded from the DPA, the owners of these two properties were required to pay for an engineering study, design, and plans for the construction of the new roadway and the Flatley Trusts were required to grant rights over their properties at 425 and 465 Med-ford Street and the Schrafft Center to accommodate the new roadway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">\u201cReasonable persons may differ as to whether the Director was wise to have made this trade without any commitment of public funds to build the roadway. . . . [T]he substantial evidence standard does not require that the Director have made the best possible trade or pursued the wisest strategic course. It is enough that he rendered a reasonable decision based on the evidence available to him. Here, <em>there is evidence to support the Director\u2019s conclusion that the conditions he extracted from the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>owners of465 Medford Street and the Nancy Sales Property significantly increased the likelihood that the critical industrial roadway would be built sooner rather than later, and that the remaining business in the DPA would economically be healthier in the long run as a result\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">As to Pizzuti\u2019s separate due process and taking claims, the judge concluded that there was also substantial evidence to support the designation decision that the CCC remain in the DPA; that there had been no denial of Pizzuti\u2019s due process rights; and that Pizzuti was seeking an end run around the strictures of administrative review by seeking a de nova evidentiary hearing on the issue of inclusion of the CCC in the DPA, but had not demonstrated a regulatory taking.

The parties have provided no supplemental arguments regarding the impact of this development on the appeal, the issues raised by which we must fully address in any event as to the remaining properties involved.

The director acknowledged that his exclusion of the two properties would result in a six percent reduction of the DPA\u2019s land area, which he deemed an acceptable cost to improve the transportation infrastructure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The director recognized that the regulations \u201cdo impose important limitations\u201d on his discretion (which limitations, however, he regarded as only establishing \u201ca presumption of suitability for a property to remain in or be removed from DPA,\u201d a concept that finds no basis in the language of the regulations). He acknowledged that, even under his view of his discretionary authority, (1) the designation standards establish a high presumptive threshold that any proposed discretionary action must overcome; (2) the purposes of the regulations must be advanced significantly by any exercise of discretion; and (3) any discretionary action must clearly demonstrate that it will substantially improve the ability of the DPA to serve the purposes for which it was designated. He then determined, in essentially conclusory fashion, that \u201cthe opportunity to significantly improve the transportation infrastructure of the DPA\u201d by his conditional exclusion decision would be a \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d to the DPA and would \u201cclearly advance the Commonwealth\u2019s interest for which the DPA was originally established.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The OCZM and the appellees rely on a \u201cCommentary\u201d to the designation standards, appearing at 301 Code Mass.

It cannot rationally be read to support the exclusion of otherwise includable properties, which would contravene not only the explicit purposes of the regulations, but also the rest of the Commentary, which expressly supports the encouragement of water-dependent industrial use as against other uses after the \u201cconsideration of all relevant factors affecting overall suitability [of the geographic area under review] to accommodate water-dependent industrial use.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">See American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1479 (3d ed. 1992) (\u201cqualify . . .

The judge, for his part, merely concluded in summary fashion that the director acted within his \u201csignificant degree of discretion\u201d (as defined by the director\u2019s overly broad interpretation of the regulations), but provided no meaningful analysis for that conclusion, nor any discussion of the scope of the director\u2019s asserted discretion. The recently enacted special legislation excluding the Nancy Sales property from the DPA might be seen as reflecting at least one affected property owner\u2019s skepticism regarding the legal validity of the director\u2019s position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Our courts, following G.
