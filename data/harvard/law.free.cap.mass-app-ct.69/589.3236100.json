L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34, and carrying a firearm without a license, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a). He appeals, claiming that the trial judge erred by (1) not granting his motion for a required finding of not guilty, and (2) providing the jury with erroneous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>misleading instructions regarding the elements of constructive possession and the burden of proof. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><em>Facts. </em>On October 15, 2004, at approximately 2:20 a.m., State Troopers Daniel Tucker and Adam Mathieu were on patrol in separate cruisers in the city of Holyoke. They were parked next to each other at a gasoline station when they noticed a Mitsubishi Gallant sedan with a loud exhaust and a broken headlight. Trooper Mathieu activated his cruiser\u2019s lights and proceeded to pull the vehicle over, while Trooper Tucker followed closely behind as backup. As they approached the vehicle, Trooper Mathieu observed five occupants in the car, two in the front seat and three in the back seat. After obtaining the operator\u2019s license and registration, Trooper Mathieu discovered that the license had been suspended. He also detected a \u201cstrong smell of marijuana coming from within the vehicle.\u201d The troopers requested each occupant to leave the vehicle, one by one, through the passenger-side door.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The defendant was seated in the back seat, behind the driver, with two individuals to his right. Trooper Tucker positioned himself at a vantage point that allowed him to watch the remaining occupants, while Trooper Mathieu removed the occupants from the vehicle. After the other two back seat occupants had been removed from the vehicle, the defendant slid over behind the front passenger seat, preparing to leave. At this point, the defendant \u201cwouldn\u2019t take his eyes off\u201d Trooper Tucker. Trooper Tucker testified that this was alarming because \u201cany time someone gets removed from a vehicle, all the other occupants are worried about what\u2019s happening to them[,] not what the other trooper is doing.\u201d Trooper Tucker then positioned himself at the rear of the vehicle and saw the defendant \u201cshoving his feet underneath the seat, so [Tucker] couldn\u2019t see,\u201d with his \u201cleft toe to his right heel and he put them both underneath the [front passenger] seat sideways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">After the defendant was removed from the vehicle, Trooper Tucker discovered a marijuana blunt<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the floor area where the defendant\u2019s feet had been. Upon looking further underneath the front passenger seat, Trooper Tucker discovered a metal handgun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>with a brown handle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The firearm was located directly under the front passenger seat approximately \u201chalfway between the front passenger and the rear passenger.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">All five occupants were placed under arrest. The defendant was charged with carrying a firearm without a license, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), possession of a class D substance (marijuana), G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34, and leaving a firearm in a vehicle, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131C.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">At the close of both the Commonwealth\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s cases, the trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial judge erred by not granting his motion because there was insufficient evidence as matter of law to support the jury\u2019s verdict beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the jury instructions were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\"><em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>We review the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty to determine \u201cwhether the evidence received, viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is sufficient so that the jury \u2018might properly draw inferences, not too remote in the ordinary course of events, or forbidden by any rule of law, and conclude upon all the established circumstances and warranted inferences that the guilt of the defendant was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Pope, 406 Mass. 581, 584 (1990), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 588 (1983). \u201cCircumstantial evidence is competent to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadworny, </em>396 Mass. 342, 354 (1985), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>cert. denied, 477 U.S. 904 (1986), and cases cited. An inference drawn from circumstantial evidence \u2018need only be reasonable and possible; it need not be necessary or inescapable.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>373 Mass. 329, 341 (1977).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 533 (1989). The Commonwealth proceeded under a theory of constructive possession for both charges, which \u201crequires proof that the defendant had \u2018knowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sann Than, </em>442 Mass. 748, 751 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sespedes, </em>442 Mass. 95, 99 (2004). \u201cThe Commonwealth may prove that the defendant had knowledge of the contraband by circumstantial evidence, if the evidence warrants a reasonable inference to that effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>409 Mass. 675, 686 (1991). \u201cPresence alone cannot show the requisite knowledge, power, or intention to exercise control over the [contraband], but presence, supplemented by other incriminating evidence, \u2018will serve to tip the scale in favor of sufficiency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132, 134 (1977), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Birmley, </em>529 F.2d 103, 108 (6th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The Commonwealth did not, and could not, rely solely on the defendant\u2019s presence in the vehicle to support the theory of constructive possession. See <em>Alicea </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>410 Mass. 384, 387 (1991) (\u201c[discovery of secreted contraband in a vehicle with a defendant, without more, is not sufficient to warrant an inference of . . . knowledge\u201d). Instead, the Commonwealth points to the defendant\u2019s \u201calarming\u201d eye contact with Trooper Tucker, his suspicious foot-shoving, and his proximity to the contraband as probative evidence of his knowledge, ability, and intention to exercise dominion and control over both the firearm and the marijuana blunt. See <em>id. </em>at 388 (\u201cdefendant\u2019s change in demeanor [during police search of vehicle] supports the inference that he knew that there was something incriminating to be found\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deagle, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 567-568 (1980) (\u201cPossession may often be inferred from proximity conjoined with knowledge; but the reasonableness of such an inference depends upon the circumstances\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitlock, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 514, 519 (1995) (evidence of \u201cattempts to conceal or dispose of contraband . . . permit an infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ence of unlawful possession\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 490, 497-498 (1991), and cases cited therein. The defendant primarily relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>401 Mass. 745, 748 (1988), where evidence that the defendant and passenger \u201cben[t] forward in unison\u201d when the police activated their sirens was, without more, held to be insufficient to support an inference that the defendant placed the gun under the passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Here, though, there is more. Trooper Mathieu detected the smell of marijuana in the vehicle and a marijuana blunt was found, in plain view, on the ground where the defendant was located. Further, the defendant, who stared at Trooper Tucker in an odd and alarming manner, was seen shoving his feet underneath the front passenger seat, the location where the firearm was recovered. These circumstances, when taken together, are capable of warranting an inference of constructive possession.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Alternatively, the defendant attempts to distinguish between the marijuana blunt and the gun by arguing that even if there were sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the marijuana charge, it was insufficient to support the firearm charge. In support, the defendant cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delarosa, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 623, 625 (2000), wherein the defendant was arrested in his vehicle with a brown paper McDonald\u2019s bag containing cocaine. A subsequent search of a hidden compartment in an apartment the defendant had access to yielded several more McDonald\u2019s bags containing cocaine, as well as a handgun. <em>Id. </em>at 626. This court held that while there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant constructively possessed the cocaine found in the hidden compartment, which was similar in purity and packaging to the cocaine in the defendant\u2019s vehicle at the time of his arrest, the evidence was insufficient to support the firearm conviction, because \u201c[wjhile it seem[ed] likely the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>defendant knew the gun was in the compartment, there [was] insufficient evidence that he intended to or did exercise dominion or control over it. It was not in the [vehicle] or on the defendant\u2019s person at the time of his arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Unlike <em>Delarosa, </em>the firearm here was found in the vehicle and in close proximity to the defendant. While the marijuana blunt was found in plain view on the rear floor behind the front passenger seat, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>423 Mass. 747, 752 (1996) (\u201c[kjnowledge may be inferred when the contraband is found in plain view in an area over which the defendant has control\u201d), the gun was found directly under the front passenger seat where the defendant had been seen shoving his feet. The defendant\u2019s conduct allowed the jury to infer a \u201cpersonal connection\u201d between the defendant and the firearm, an element lacking in <em>Delarosa, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\"><em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant also claims that the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions on the elements of constructive possession and the burden of proof were erroneous and misleading. Specifically, the defendant claims that the instructions on the element of intent to exercise dominion and control with regard to the firearm charge were erroneous. As counsel did not object to the instructions at trial, we review to determine whether there was a \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 7 (2001). A reviewing court examining jury instructions for error must \u201cconsider the charge, taken as a whole, and assess the possible impact of the alleged error on the deliberations of a reasonable juror, i.e., whether a reasonable juror could have used the instruction incorrectly.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 27 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The trial judge prefaced her instructions by telling the jury: \u201cYou should consider all of these instructions as a whole, you may not ignore any instruction nor should you give special attention to any one instruction.\u201d She then correctly outlined the three elements of marijuana possession, patterning her charge after Instructions 3.051, 3.11, and 5.52 of the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (1997).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Turning to the firearm charge, she again outlined the three elements of the crime, defin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ing the term firearm and explaining what constitutes \u201cknowing possession.\u201d She also repeated much of the constructive possession charge from her marijuana instruction, but omitted mention of the element of intent. This omission, however, was sufficiently cured when she directly addressed this element in her supplemental instructions: \u201cTo show possession, there must be evidence justifying a conclusion that the defendant also had the power and the intention to exercise control over the firearm; only then may the defendant be considered to have possessed the firearm.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sana Than, </em>442 Mass. at 752-755.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The defendant also contends that the judge wrongfully placed the burden of proof on him, requiring reversal. In answering a jury question, the judge mistakenly stated that \u201c[t]he defendant has to prove with respect to the firearms charge beyond a reasonable doubt all three elements of the offense . . . .\u201d When, shortly thereafter, she was made aware of her misstatement, she gave a curative instruction: \u201cIt\u2019s been pointed out to me that I actually said at one point that the defendant has the burden to prove something or other. That is absolutely completely wrong, it is a mistake. And if I said that I certainly meant it to say, which is absolutely the law, that the Commonwealth has the burden of proof.\u201d She also correctly instructed the jury on the issue of the burden of proof at numerous other points during her earlier instructions. This single, isolated slip of the tongue, which the judge quickly corrected, did not under these circumstances create juror confusion or constitute a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\">\u201cBIunt\u201d is a term used to describe a cigar from which the tobacco has been removed and replaced with marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Trooper Lori Gillis conducted a fingerprint analysis on the firearm but was unable to locate any identifiable fingerprints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-9\">After all five occupants were removed, Trooper Tucker conducted an extensive search of the vehicle and recovered a bag of marijuana under the front passenger seat, and a loose bud of marijuana below the radio in a pop-out storage area by the front seat.
