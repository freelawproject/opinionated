L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H, and accosted or annoyed a person of the opposite sex, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. We conclude that there was insufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s convictions, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-15\"><em>Background. </em>The Commonwealth presented evidence that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>July 2, 2005, the complainant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> went to a public swimming pool in Springfield, accompanied by a friend. While in the pool, she noticed the defendant, a stranger, staring at her. When the complainant began to leave, the defendant asked her why she was leaving. The complainant ignored the defendant and left the pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The following day, while walking to a store near her home, the complainant encountered the defendant a second time. As she passed by a house, he leaned out a window, removed his hat, and said he would buy her candy. The complainant had not previously seen the defendant in the neighborhood. The defendant did not follow her to the store, but when she returned, he was standing outside the same house and \u201csinging that he fell in love with a little girl.\u201d He asked the complainant if she had bought what he told her to buy. She crossed the street to her home, and as she proceeded up the stairs, the defendant watched her. Both encounters made the complainant feel \u2018 \u2018uncomfortable. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Subsequent investigation revealed that in 1984, the defendant had been convicted of a sex offense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for which registration later came to be required pursuant to the sex offender registration statute, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178Q, and that the defendant had not registered as a sex offender. The relevant statute was enacted in 1999, but applies retroactively to all persons convicted of sex offenses after August 1, 1981. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. See <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418, 423-424 (2001). Steven Cartney, a keeper of the records for the Sex Offender Registry Board (SORB), testified that sex offenders convicted prior to the statute\u2019s enactment, and for whom the SORB had addresses, were informed by mail of their obligation to register. Because the SORB did not have an address for the defendant, it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>mail him a notification. However, notices of sex offender registration requirements were published in Massachusetts newspapers in 2001 or 2002.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 2, 2002, the defendant was \u201cplaced in violation\u201d for failure to register with the SORB.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He was arrested on July 6, 2005, and a two-count complaint charging him with failure to register as a sex offender and accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex was issued the following day. As of the date of trial on October 14, 2005, the defendant had not yet registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Defense counsel moved for required findings as to both charges. Those motions were denied. On appeal the defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that (1) his failure to register with the SORB was knowing, as required by G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H, and (2) his language or acts were disorderly, as required by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\"><em>Defendant\u2019s failure to register. </em>According to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H(a), as appearing in St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2, \u201c[a] sex offender required to register pursuant to this chapter who knowingly: (i) fails to register . . . shall be punished in accordance with this section.\u201d The defendant does not dispute that his 1984 conviction subjects him to the registration mandates of the statute, but argues that the Commonwealth failed to introduce evidence sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his failure to register with the SORB was knowing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">It is a settled rule of statutory construction that all words in a statute must be given meaning. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>426 Mass. 206, 224-225 (1997). Therefore, \u201c[t]he insertion of [the word \u2018knowingly\u2019 into the statute] cannot be treated as immaterial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horsfall, </em>213 Mass. 232, 237 (1913). \u201cWhen the word \u2018knowingly\u2019 is used in a criminal statute, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u2018commonly imports a perception of the facts requisite to make up the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fondakowski, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 939, 940 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Altenhaus, </em>317 Mass. 270, 273 (1944). Thus, where the statute under which the defendant was charged defines the offense as \u201cknowingly . . . failing] to register,\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H, the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant knew of the requirement that he register but did not do so despite this knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">While the defendant\u2019s knowledge may be proven by circumstantial evidence, the proof must be specific to <em>this </em>defendant, rather than to the general population or some subset thereof. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellamano, </em>393 Mass. 132, 136 (1984) (\u201cWe have held that where \u2018knowledge ... is an essential element of the offence charged, proof of that knowledge is a prerequisite to conviction. The knowledge of the defendant is personal to him and the statute recognizes no substitute\u2019 \u201d), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holiday, </em>349 Mass. 126, 128 (1965); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosenberg, </em>379 Mass. 334, 338 (1979). Absent a defendant\u2019s conscious disregard of the information necessary to provide him with the requisite knowledge, the Commonwealth cannot meet its burden merely by establishing that the knowledge was available to the defendant. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Altenhaus, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boris, </em>317 Mass. 309, 315 (1944); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thureson, </em>371 Mass. 387, 390 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">It warrants noting that, like the Massachusetts statute, the sex offender registration laws of at least five other States impose liability specifically when a sex offender knowingly fails to register. Alaska Stat. \u00a7 11.56.840 (2006); Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7 4120 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2006); Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77-27-21.5(14) (Supp. 2006); Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-472.1 (Supp. 2006); Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.44.130(1) (Supp. 2007). Of these States, those that have addressed the statutes\u2019 respective knowledge requirements have made clear that the State must prove that the defendant knew of his duty to register but failed to do so. See <em>Dailey </em>v. <em>State, </em>65 P.3d 891, 895 (Alaska Ct. App. 2003) (\u201cto convict [the defendant], the State had to prove both that [he] was aware of the circumstances giving rise to his duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>to file sworn quarterly written verifications and that he knowingly refrained from performing that duty\u201d); <em>Kitze </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>23 Va. App. 213, 217 (1996) (\u201cA knowing and intentional failure to register is punishable . . .\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>75 Wash. App. 827, 832 (1994) (\u201cLack of notice of the duty to register constitutes a defense to the crime of knowingly failing to register as a sex offender \u2014 but only for the first such offense\u201d because thereafter the arrest for failure to register serves as notice). Similarly, California\u2019s sex offender registration statute prescribes punishment for wilful violations thereof, and proof of guilt thereunder \u201crequires <em>actual knowledge </em>of the duty to register.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Sorden, </em>36 Cal. 4th 65, 69 (2005), citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>25 Cal. 4th 744 (2001). See Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 290(g) (Deering 1985 &amp; Supp. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">While G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H, and the other sex offender registration statutes discussed above plainly require proof of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the registration mandate, constitutional due process requirements provide additional support for our construction of the knowledge requirement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>446 Mass. 583, 597-598 (2006) (statutes are to be interpreted to avoid unconstitutionality). In <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>California, </em>355 U.S. 225 (1957), the United States Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of a Los Angeles ordinance making it illegal for convicted felons to remain in the city for more than five days without registering with the chief of police. The Supreme Court reversed the appellant\u2019s conviction under the ordinance, holding that \u201cactual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">With these principles in mind, we review the evidence in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>case, doing so in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). The Commonwealth first argues that the defendant\u2019s receipt of actual notice of his duty to register at the time of his arrest is sufficient to satisfy the statute\u2019s knowledge requirement because his failure to register was a \u201ccontinuing offense.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the Commonwealth did not pursue this theory at trial,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> instead focusing on the defendant\u2019s alleged knowledge of his duty to register <em>prior </em>to his arrest. Even had the Commonwealth adequately presented its theory, we point out that July 6, 2005, is listed on the complaint as the sole offense date, and no range of dates is provided. \u201cWhen [a continuing] offense is charged, the time period specified in the indictment is an integral part of the crime, and evidence of acts committed outside this period is generally not admissible to prove the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Megna, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 511, 513 (2003). On this record there is no evidence that on the day of his arrest the defendant received notice of the registration requirement. The mere fact of his arrest, without evidence that he was informed that day precisely what he was arrested for, is not enough. We also note that the complaint did not issue, and that the arraignment was not held, until the day following the arrest. Thus, knowledge growing out of the arrest was not shown to have been gained by the defendant prior to July 7, 2005, the day after the date of offense listed on the complaint. In sum, the defendant was not charged or convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>a failure to register after July 6, 2005. \u201cIt is elementary in the criminal law of this Commonwealth that \u2018[t]he offence must not only be proved as charged, but it must be charged as proved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collardo, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1013, 1014 (1982), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ancillo, </em>350 Mass. 427, 430 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The Commonwealth next asserts that the defendant\u2019s prear-rest knowledge of his duty to register may be inferred from evidence introduced at trial regarding the publication of notices informing sex offenders of their duty to register. In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence showed that on certain dates in 2001 and 2002, the SORB published notices in at least fourteen newspapers in the Commonwealth, including the Springfield Union News, Boston Globe, and Boston Herald, stating that individuals convicted of sex offenses on or after August 1, 1981, were required to register with the SORB. However, there was no evidence that the defendant read any newspaper, much less that he did so with some regularity. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the defendant was even in the Commonwealth at any of the times when the notices were published, or that the notices\u2019 contents were communicated to him in any other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The Commonwealth points to evidence that 600 sex offenders registered with the SORB in response to, or at least after, the newspaper notices, and cites <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>California, </em>355 U.S. at 229, for the proposition that \u201cproof of the probability of [actual] knowledge\u201d is sufficient to prove the defendant\u2019s knowledge as required for a conviction for failure to register. The reference to 600 registrants is, alone, insufficient to prove anything, let alone that the defendant here was informed by a published notice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of notices published in Massachusetts newspapers was insufficient to permit an inference beyond a reasonable doubt in this case that the defendant read such a notice and was therefore informed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>his duty to register. The defendant\u2019s conviction for knowingly failing to register as a sex offender must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><em>Accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex. </em>The defendant next argues that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to prove that his conduct was disorderly, as required for a conviction for accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. In relevant part, the statute provides punishment for \u201cpersons who with offensive and disorderly acts or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, as appearing in St. 1983, c. 66, \u00a7 1. Thus, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant\u2019s conduct was both offensive and disorderly. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lombard, </em>321 Mass. 294, 296 (1947). The defendant argues that his conduct was not disorderly. As pertaining to the \u201caccost or annoy\u201d provision of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, disorderly acts or language are \u201cthose that involve fighting or threatening, violent or tumultuous behavior, or that create a hazardous or physically offensive condition for no legitimate purpose of the actor, whether the resulting harm is suffered in public or in private.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. 229, 233 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the defendant\u2019s conduct was disorderly both because it was physically offensive and because it was threatening.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the Commonwealth was required to prove \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s behavior was offensive and disorderly to a reasonable person,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>446 Mass. 778, 781 (2006), we reason that context is critical in analyzing convictions under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, and must evaluate whether there was sufficient evidence to find that the defendant\u2019s conduct was threatening or physically offensive to a young woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The Commonwealth asserts that, despite an absence of physical contact between the defendant and the complainant, the \u201c \u2018sexual overtones\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s behavior and words were sufficient to prove that his conduct was \u2018physically offensive\u2019 to a young woman.\u201d Our courts have not articulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the specific requirements for a physically offensive condition. When words are not defined in a statute, we assign them \u201ctheir usual and accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 920 (2003). In discussing \u201coffensive acts or language,\u201d as that phrase is used in the accost or annoy provision of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, the Supreme Judicial Court has stated that \u201c[offensive acts are those that cause \u2018displeasure, anger or resentment; esp., repugnant to the prevailing sense of what is decent or moral.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, supra </em>at 781, quoting from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1113 (8th ed. 2004). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whiting, supra </em>(providing the same definition for offensive conduct). Conduct is physical when it is \u201cof or relating to the body.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 935 (11th ed. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">While the Commonwealth acknowledges that the facts of the cases finding physically offensive words and actions are distinguishable from the instant facts, it asserts that the spirit of those cases supports a finding of physical offense here. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, supra, </em>relied upon by the Commonwealth, and the one case we are able to identify that permitted an accost or annoy conviction based on the defendant\u2019s physically offensive conduct, elucidates the distinction between the instant defendant\u2019s actions and those rising to the level of physical offense. In <em>Cahill, </em>the defendant, who was training the victim as a cashier at the store where they were both employed, \u201cforced his unwanted attentions on [the victim],\u201d asking her out on dates more than twenty times, \u201coccasionally touching her back,\u201d sometimes \u201cgrazfing]\u201d his body against hers, and often staring at her. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, supra </em>at 779. When the victim declined to telephone the defendant as he had requested her to do, \u201che approached [her] in an angry and confrontational manner [and] came close to her face.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>After this encounter, \u201c[t]he victim felt panicky and afraid for her safety outside the workplace.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The following month, the defendant approached the victim from behind, \u201cgrabbed [her] around the neck really tight with both arms around [her] shoulders and neck,\u201d and said, \u201cI love you.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This incident left the victim feeling \u201cfrightened,\u201d and she experienced difficulty \u201cconcentrat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ing at work, and had to take medication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780. Though such a degree of severity of physical offense may not be required in order for words and actions to constitute physically offensive conduct under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, the substantial distinction between the defendant\u2019s actions in <em>Cahill </em>and the instant defendant\u2019s actions cautions against imposition of criminal liability here.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The Commonwealth also relies upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LePore, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 543 (1996), in which the defendant removed the screen from the bedroom window of a ground floor apartment wherein a young woman lay sleeping, and had smoked two cigarettes outside this window by the time two police officers came upon him. We held that there was sufficient evidence to convict the defendant of being a disorderly person pursuant to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because his acts constituted physically offensive conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 549. As <em>LePore </em>makes clear, physical contact with a victim\u2019s person is not necessary to render one\u2019s actions physically offensive. Nonetheless, given the definitions of \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d noted above, as well as the discussions of physically offensive conduct in both <em>LePore </em>and <em>Cahill, </em>some significant physically offensive conduct on the part of the defendant, comparable to removing the screen from one\u2019s window, is required to impose criminal liability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such conduct is lacking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the defendant stared at the complainant at the swimming pool and asked her why she was leaving when she began to leave. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>was no evidence that the defendant said anything further to the complainant on that day, that he attempted to stop her from leaving the pool, or that he followed her when she left. The following day, the complainant passed by a house across the street from her own, the defendant\u2019s head emerged from a window of that house, he removed his hat, and he offered to buy her candy. The defendant did not follow the complainant to the store, but when she returned from the store, he was outside the house in which he had stood previously. As she walked by, the defendant sang a song about falling in love with a little girl, the complainant crossed the street to her house, and the complainant\u2019s friends confirmed the complainant\u2019s suspicion that the defendant was looking at her.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">There is no evidence that the defendant attempted at any time to come near the complainant\u2019s person, restrict her movement, or otherwise create physical offense. As unwelcome and unsettling as the defendant\u2019s conduct may have been to the complainant, his words and actions, without more, were insufficient to create a physically offensive condition as required by the statute. Indeed, while the complainant may have found the defendant\u2019s conduct and actions somewhat offensive in that they made her feel uncomfortable, the evidence was insufficient for a finding of <em>physically </em>offensive conduct. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. at 233-234 (declining to find that the defendant\u2019s hanging of threatening and sexually degrading posters of his former girlfriend at her school created a physically offensive condition); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. at 918, 920 (finding statute violated where the defendant \u201cused sexually explicit language toward\u201d five girls, \u201cpulled up his shirt and started rubbing his chest,\u201d and \u201cpulled down his pants,\u201d causing the girls to feel \u201cscared,\u201d \u201cconfused,\u201d \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d \u201cfrightened,\u201d and \u201cafraid,\u201d and to run for safety).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The Commonwealth also asserts that the defendant\u2019s actions were inherently threatening, particularly given the alleged \u201csexual overtones\u201d implicit in his words and actions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Though the term \u201cthreat\u201d is not statutorily defined, for purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>offense of threatening to commit a crime under G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2, it includes \u201can expression of intention to inflict a crime on another and an ability to do so in circumstances that would justify apprehension on the part of the recipient of the threat.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Troy T., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 520, 524 (2002), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, </em>421 Mass. 176, 183 (1995). Thus, for example, a defendant\u2019s conviction for being a disorderly person was upheld when his angry tirade through a court house included threatening words and actions, including screaming \u201cwatch out\u201d while pointing his finger in the face of a prosecutor for whom he had an established history of disdain, stating that a particular judge is \u201cf \u2014 ed now,\u201d and telling a court house employee to \u201c[rjemember what happened in Oklahoma\u201d and that \u201c[tjhis is a bomb ready to explode.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 723-724, 728-729 (2000). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Mottola, 10 Mass. App. Ct. 775, 778-779 (1980) (defendant charged with accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex after he followed a ninth grader to school, \u201casked her if she would like to pose for photographs,\u201d and told her \u201cthat he was going to wait for her after school and that if she did not cooperate, he would harm her\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u201cIn analyzing a putative threat, we eschew a technical parsing of the words used and instead consider the entire context in which a statement is made, including the defendant\u2019s actions and demeanor at the time, and prior communications between the defendant and the recipient.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Troy T., supra </em>at 528. \u201c[I]t is the intent to threaten rather than the intent to carry out the threat that is dispositive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. at 235, citing <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>422 U.S. 35, 46-47 (1975) (Marshall, J., concurring). Thus, a threat can be made without deployment of words explicitly stating one\u2019s intent to do harm, so long as the circumstances support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>complainant\u2019s fearful response. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, supra </em>at 234. Given this principle, \u201c[s]exually explicit language, when directed at particular individuals in settings in which such communications are inappropriate and likely to cause severe distress, may be inherently threatening.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Relatedly, even absent evidence that a threat will be immediately followed by physical violence, \u201csexually explicit and aggressive language\u201d may constitute the type of threatening language necessary to satisfy the \u201cdisorderly acts or language\u201d requirement of an accost or annoy conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 235. Thus, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court upheld an accost or annoy conviction given the threatening nature of the defendant\u2019s actions. In that case, the defendant broke into his former girlfriend\u2019s high school at night and hung several documents styled as missing person posters there. In addition to the word \u201cMISSING,\u201d the posters contained a large photograph of the former girlfriend, her name, and numerous sexually explicit and extremely offensive statements about her. <em>Id. </em>at 230-231. The defendant\u2019s actions caused the victim to feel \u201cvery upset,\u201d \u201cafraid,\u201d and \u201cviolated,\u201d and she \u201csuffered from nightmares\u201d after the incident. <em>Id. </em>at 231. The court stated that \u201c[o]bjectively, a reasonable person could, as the victim and her guidance counselor did, legitimately fear that the flyer was a veiled threat that the named victim would indeed become a \u2018missing person\u2019 or that some sexually violent harm would befall her, particularly where the defendant had threatened to hit her during their brief relationship, and telephoned her to express his anger about their breakup.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In this case, however, it was not reasonable to infer from the defendant\u2019s actions and words that he intended the complainant to fear that harm would befall her. There was no aggressive or invasive move by the defendant toward the victim. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LePore, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 548-549; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. at 920. Indeed, absent from the Commonwealth\u2019s argument is any clear indication of what it believes the defendant was threatening to do. And though the complainant testified that she felt \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d she did not state, nor was there more than a modicum of evidence, that she was placed in fear. Though the defendant\u2019s words and ac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>tians were no doubt unsettling to the complainant, and \u201cmight warrant heightened concern . . . , the fact remains that not all noxious and disturbing remarks are criminal threats.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Troy T., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support the defendant\u2019s convictions for knowingly failing to register as a sex offender, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H, and accosting or annoying a person of the opposite sex, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. The judgments are reversed, the guilty findings are set aside, and a judgment of not guilty is to be entered for the defendant on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\">According to the transcript, the complainant testified at the trial on October 14, 2005, that she was eighteen years old and in the seventh grade. The arrest report, entered in evidence by the defendant, lists the complainant\u2019s birth date as August 24, 1992, and further states that she was twelve years of age. On appeal, neither party\u2019s brief makes reference to the complainant\u2019s age, though the Commonwealth states that she was in the seventh grade at the time of the incidents giving rise to the charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The record does not definitively disclose the crime of which the defendant was convicted. A witness for the Commonwealth stated that he \u201cbelieve[dj\u201d the offense was rape and abuse of a child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The evidence indicates that in 2002, such notices were published three times in each of at least fourteen Massachusetts newspapers. It is unclear what notices were also published in 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\">The record contains no explanation of the term \u201cplaced in violation.\u201d We assume it reflects that the defendant was identified in the SORB database as a person unregistered despite a requirement that he register.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b37-10\">The defendant also claims that the single justice committed an abuse of discretion in denying his motion for a stay of execution of his sentence pending determination of his appeal. Notwithstanding our holding, we are not persuaded that there was an abuse of discretion by the single justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Even when knowledge, wilfulness, or some other mens rea is not explicitly required by a sex offender registration statute, some jurisdictions have applied the <em>Lambert </em>rationale to require proof of actual knowledge or the probability thereof for a conviction under a sex offender registration statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Giorgetti, </em>868 So. 2d 512, 519-520 (Fla. 2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>140 N.C. App. 1, 12 (2000) (\u201calthough ignorance of the law is no excuse, and the statute at issue does <em>not </em>require the State to prove intent, due process requires that the defendant have knowledge, actual or constructive, of the statutory requirements before he can be charged with its violation\u201d); <em>Varnes </em>v. <em>State, </em>63 S.W.3d 824, 831 (Tex. Ct. App. 2001) (\u201cdue process requires actual notice or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the reasonable probability of actual notice before violation of a registration statute can be prosecuted against an individual\u201d). Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>185 Misc. 2d 519, 526 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2000) (\u201c[T]he People do not need to allege or prove that a sex offender charged with failure to register acted knowingly or intentionally. However, . . . it is nevertheless plain that before a defendant can be prosecuted for failure to register, he must first be given the statutorily mandated notice of his duty to register as a sex offender. Such notice is also likely required by due process of law\u201d). But see <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>83 Ohio St. 3d 404, 420 (1998) (\u201cThe act of failing to register alone, without more, is sufficient to trigger criminal punishment. . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b40-11\">\u201cA continuing offense is an indivisible, unlawful general practice that exists throughout the time span alleged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Megna, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 511, 513 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b40-12\">The only evidence offered to support such a theory consisted of Cartney answering \u201cyes\u201d in response to the prosecutor asking \u201c[a]nd is [the defendant] as far as you know in violation today?\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s opening statement did not address the defendant\u2019s knowledge, and the prosecutor\u2019s closing focused solely on prearrest knowledge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\">At trial, there was no testimony regarding what percentage of unregistered sex offenders this 600-person figure represented. At oral argument, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney represented that there were an additional 16,000 sex offenders who, though similarly required, did not register. These numbers would suggest that 3.75 percent of those required to register did so after the notices appeared in Massachusetts newspapers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The Commonwealth does not argue that the defendant\u2019s acts or language were disorderly in any of the alternative ways articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. at 233.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Though physically offensive conduct can form the basis of both a disorderly person offense under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, and an accost and annoy offense under the same statute, the elements of the two crimes are somewhat different. Nonetheless, given their clear similarities and genesis in the same statute, the Supreme Judicial Court has looked to at least one case discussing the former when analyzing the sufficiency of evidence for a conviction under the latter, and we do the same here. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>446 Mass. at 782-783.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Given the context-specific nature of a determination whether a defendant accosted or annoyed a person of the opposite sex, it would be imprudent for us to attempt to articulate a bright-line rule as to what is or is not \u201cphysically offensive.\u201d Future cases will no doubt assist in further clarifying the contours of this component of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b45-7\">When discussing this argument in its brief, the Commonwealth misstates some of the evidence. First, it says that while at the pool, the defendant made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u201cprovocative comments\u201d to the complainant. However, the defendant\u2019s only statement to the complainant that day was his inquiry as to why she was leaving. Second, the Commonwealth says that the complainant \u201cran into her house\u201d the following day after the defendant stared at her, yet there is no evidence in the record that the complainant\u2019s return to her house was at all expedited. Finally, the Commonwealth states that the defendant \u201cfollowed her to her stairs.\u201d However, the testimony at trial indicates that the defendant remained across the street from the complainant\u2019s home, and thus did not follow her to the stairs of her house.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
