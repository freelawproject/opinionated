The defendant, Daniel Corcoran, knocked on the front door of Nancy Stevens\u2019s home in East Providence, Rhode Island, in the fall of 2000. She was 79 years old and lived alone. The defendant asked her whether she was interested in selling her home, stating, \u201c[Tjhis is the kind of house I always wanted.\u201d He asked to see the house, and she let him in and showed him around. They talked in her kitchen for about one-half hour, and he left.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-15\">About one week later, the defendant made the first of several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>more visits to Stevens\u2019s house. On these visits he conversed about jewelry, induced Stevens to show him her jewelry, and familiarized himself with the interior of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Some time after the defendant\u2019s first visit, Stevens checked her jewelry box and noticed that her pin, broach, bracelet, and ring were missing. Stevens had never previously told anyone where she kept her jewelry. She did not immediately report the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The following April or May of 2001, Stevens visited a gift and consignment shop located in Seekonk, Massachusetts, known as Lost Treasures. While browsing through the store, Stevens saw her pin and bracelet displayed for sale, and she called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Returning with the Seekonk police, Stevens identified her bow-shaped diamond ring and gold bracelet set with three emeralds and two diamonds. The owner of the shop told a detective on the scene that the man from whom he had purchased the jewelry was named Dan, had been to the store earlier that day, and was expected to return at 5 p.m. The police waited for Dan\u2019s return. When he did return, the owner of the shop identified him as the man who had sold him Stevens\u2019s jewelry. When approached by the detective, the defendant provided his name and a driver\u2019s license, and denied having sold any jewelry to the shop owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The defendant was subsequently charged with two counts of receiving stolen property under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 60. A jury returned guilty verdicts on both counts. The record does not indicate whether he was ever charged with larceny in Rhode Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The defendant moved for a new trial based on the claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to move for a required finding of not guilty or, alternatively, for failing to request a jury instruction on the inconsistent nature of evidence \u201cproving\u201d that the defendant stole the jewelry. The judge ordered a new trial, relying on language in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Janvrin, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 917, 918 (1998), and determined that, because \u201cproof of [his] theft excluded [him] as a receiver of stolen goods,\u201d the defendant was deprived of a substantial defense by counsel\u2019s failure to request jury instructions or a directed finding. The Commonwealth appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>It is well-established that convictions for both stealing and receiving the same items on the same occasion cannot be maintained against one individual. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>128 Mass. 60, 61 (1880).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following and relying on <em>Haskins, </em>decisions of our courts addressed the problem of inconsistent jury verdicts on larceny and receiving stolen goods by either setting aside one indictment, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 990, 991 (1983), or dismissing one indictment in lieu of granting a new trial, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nascimento, </em>421 Mass. 677, 684-685 (1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">We are confronted with different circumstances here because only the offense of receiving stolen goods was charged. The jury, presented with a charge of receipt, returned with a conviction of receipt where the evidence also supported theft, albeit not within the borders of the Commonwealth. We have previously faced the question whether a jury is prohibited from finding a defendant guilty of receipt where the prosecution has presented evidence of theft (or vice versa). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Obshatkin, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 4-5 (1974), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Janvrin, supra. </em>Because these two decisions contain conflicting language that has caused confusion and difficulty in the current case, we endeavor today to clarify the rule to be used from this point forward.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We briefly present the facts and outcomes of <em>Obshatkin </em>and <em>Janvrin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>In <em>Obshatkin, </em>the defendant was charged with receipt of two stolen bicycles and was found guilty. He claimed on appeal that, because prosecutors presented evidence equally supporting his guilt as to larceny, he could not be found guilty of receipt under the <em>Haskins </em>doctrine. We rejected that contention, holding that although one cannot be convicted of both theft and receipt of the same goods, where evidence shows equally that the accused committed either of two distinct crimes, the proper judicial response is to issue \u201cclear and precise instructions to the jury rather than for the direction of a verdict for the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Obshatkin, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>349 Mass. 430, 435-436 (1965). See generally J.R. Nolan &amp; LJ. Sartorio, Criminal Law \u00a7 159 (3d ed. 2001). <em>Ob-shatkin </em>thus distinguishes on the one hand between facts sufficient as a matter of common experience to conclude a person to be a thief and on the other hand a legal determination, i.e., a conviction of larceny. It therefore allows a defendant to be charged only with receiving stolen property, and convicted thereof, even though the evidence shows he may also be the thief.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Janvrin </em>presented facts and arguments similar to <em>Obshatkin. </em>Barbara Janvrin stole a gun from an acquaintance\u2019s home, and was found on a city bus carrying the stolen gun. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Janvrin, </em>44 Mass. at 917. She was charged with both larceny and receiving stolen property. After she was tried and convicted only on the receiving charge, the Commonwealth entered a nolie prosequi as to the larceny charge. On appeal, although neither party had raised or argued the issue, we set aside Janvrin\u2019s conviction of receiving stolen property, using the following language: \u201c[T]he guilty receiver of stolen goods cannot ... be the thief; nor can the thief be guilty of the crime of receiving stolen goods which [she herself] has stolen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 918, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellamano, </em>393 Mass. 132, 134 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We conclude that <em>Janvrin </em>requires correction insofar as it holds that a person cannot be convicted as the receiver of stolen goods if the evidence supports a finding that he or she is in fact the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>thief, even when there is no conviction for the theft.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We hold today, affirming our decision in <em>Obshatkin, </em>that where evidence would support a conviction of larceny, it does not prevent an alternative conviction of receipt of stolen goods arising from the same events if the evidence supports that conviction as well.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The fact finder is free to reject the evidence tending to prove theft and to infer receipt from the fact of possession, if it so chooses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Stated from a different perspective, a conviction of receipt does not require the Commonwealth to preclude the possibility that the defendant was the thief as an element of the offense. Thus to the extent that <em>Janvrin </em>has come to stand for the proposition that a defendant could not be convicted solely as a receiver because the evidence showed that defendant may be, or is in fact, the thief, that decision is overruled.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">As a consequence of this decision, defendants are not entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>to a jury instruction stating that where proof of larceny exists, a conviction of receipt of stolen property cannot enter (and vice versa); nor is a directed verdict warranted on that basis. We continue to maintain, as has been the law of the Commonwealth for more than a century, that a person cannot be convicted of both larceny and receipt of the same goods. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 746 (2006), and cases cited.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A defendant may, however, be indicted for both crimes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellamano, </em>393 Mass. at 134 n.4.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When a defendant is indicted on charges of both larceny and receipt, the jury will be presented with evidence tending to show either or both of the crimes so that the jury can weigh the evidence and decide between the two charges, or acquit on both. In situations in which the Commonwealth cannot (as in this case, due to jurisdictional limitations) or simply chooses not to pursue a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>charge of larceny, despite evidence tending to prove that crime, it may nonetheless proceed, and secure a conviction, based on receipt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McArthur, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 596, 598-599 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The interpretation of <em>Janvrin, </em>which defendant\u2019s counsel is charged with having failed to assert, was demonstrably at odds with the overwhelming thrust of Massachusetts case law, as detailed above. We conclude that the defendant is not entitled to a new trial, because he was not deprived of an \u201cavailable, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). The evidence clearly supported the jury verdict and there was no error of defense counsel which \u201cso upset the adversarial balance between defense and prosecution that the trial was rendered unfair and the verdict rendered suspect.\u201d <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 369 (1993), quoting from <em>Kimmelman </em>v. <em>Morrison, 477 </em>U.S. 365, 374 (1986).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> An analysis of effective assistance \u201cfocusing solely on mere outcome determination, without attention to whether the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable, is defective.\u201d <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Fretwell, supra </em>at 369.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In any event, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>given our decision today, a new trial would be of no benefit to the defendant as the judge would be precluded from issuing any jury instruction based on <em>Janvrin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We vacate the order granting a new trial and affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In <em>Haskins, </em>two defendants were found simultaneously guilty of larceny of a cow (\u201cand but one larceny of that cow\u201d) and receipt of the same stolen cow. <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Judicial Court declared a mistrial because the convictions were legally inconsistent. Further, the court found that an entry of nolle prosequi on one charge, after the conclusion of the trial, did not cure the inconsistency because it allowed the prosecutor, rather than the jury, to determine the defendant\u2019s guilt as between the two offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 62.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\"><em>Nascimento </em>and subsequent decisions amended the rule announced in <em>Haskins </em>by concluding that a judge\u2019s dismissal of one indictment is an adequate cure where a jury returns inconsistent verdicts. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. at 991 (setting aside indictment on charge of receipt where jury found defendant guilty of both receipt and theft, and had not been instructed that they must acquit on receipt if they find defendant guilty of theft).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, considering a similar question, noted that \u201cwhether a defendant may be convicted for the receipt ... of stolen goods when the evidence discloses that he was in fact the thief\u201d is \u201ca query of the type that intrigues the legal mind but is a source of bafflement and some impatience to the average layman.\u201d See <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Trzcinski, </em>553 F.2d 851, 852 (3d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 919 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\">See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Trzcinski, </em>553 F.2d at 854 (\u201cin a case where only possession is charged, whether the defendant has committed the larceny is not the determinative fact \u2014 rather, it is whether he has been convicted of that crime\u201d). In that case, a conviction of receipt of stolen goods was allowed to stand despite evidence that the defendant was, in fact, the thief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Although not before us in this case, the obverse would be equally true, so long as there is but one conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The crime of larceny consists of stealing the property of another. G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30(1). Receiving stolen goods consists of buying, receiving or aiding in the concealment of stolen property. G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 60. The same facts cannot lead to the conviction of a single defendant for both crimes because a conviction of receipt of stolen goods requires that the property already be stolen at the time of receipt. Our decision in <em>Obshatkin, </em>which prescribes a preventative jury instruction in lieu of post-verdict dismissal of one conviction if and when two are returned, creates no right to the same instruction when only one crime is charged. The purpose of dismissing one conviction when both are returned, or of the preventative jury instruction to avoid two convictions in the first place, is to prevent \u201cpyramiding] penalties.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaddis, </em>424 U.S. 544, 550 n.15 (1976). \u201cIt follows that the thief s identity does not affect the offense \u2014\u2022 it is, as the Supreme Court said, \u2018irrelevant.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Trzcinski, supra </em>at 855, quoting from <em>Gaddis, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\">We note that <em>Janvrin </em>has never been cited by this or the Supreme Judicial Court for its holding on this issue. To the contrary, decisions concerning the \u201cinconsistency\u201d of larceny and receipt have sidestepped <em>Janvrin. </em>See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellamano, </em>393 Mass. at 134; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 745-748 (2006). Janvrin\u2019s detour from preceding case law may have sprung from its atypical procedural history: (1) the larceny charge against Janvrin was brought but never acted upon or tried, and was nol pressed after the conclusion of the trial; (2) the parties did not brief or argue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the \u201cinconsistency\u201d issue; and (3) the Commonwealth conceded error on the issue in a letter submitted to the court after argument during which the panel raised the issue sua sponte. Similar factors underlie decisions to overrule prior case law of our court. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montalvo, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 85, 87 (2000) (overruling to some extent <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 355 [1998]); <em>Carmel Credit Union </em>v. <em>Bondeson, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 561 (2002) (overruling one interpretation of certain language in <em>Mutual Bank for Sav. </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1059 [1982]). We note that <em>Janvrin </em>is most often cited for propositions not relevant to this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 400-401 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giontzis, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 450, 461 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brien, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 309, 310 (2006). With the exception of adjusting the narrow point of law discussed here, we leave the decision undisturbed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b154-12\"><em>\u201cCommonwealth </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>128 Mass. 60, 61-62 (1880) (convictions on separate counts of larceny and receiving stolen goods constitute a verdict that is inconsistent with itself); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nascimento, </em>421 Mass. 677, 683 (1996) (inconsistent in law for defendant to be convicted both of stealing property and of receiving the same property); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>422 Mass. 261, 262 n.1 (1996) (convictions on both indictments would have been inconsistent); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>48 Mass.
