We vacate the order and remand this matter to the single justice for the appointment of screening counsel to determine whether and in what forum further efforts should be made to restore the defendant\u2019s appellate rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On December 11, 2002, after a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of trafficking in cocaine in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(\u00bf)(4). He filed a timely notice of appeal and, thereafter, was assigned court-appointed appellate counsel. The appeal was docketed in this court on March 18, 2003. On April 22, 2003, counsel filed a motion for an enlargement of time in which to file the defendant\u2019s brief, which was allowed to July 1, 2003, with the notation \u201cno further enlargements.\u201d Counsel failed to file the brief as scheduled. Instead, he filed an additional motion for enlargement of time on July 2, 2003, the day after the brief was due. That motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">According to the affidavit filed by the defendant in support of his motion to reinstate, counsel did not disclose to the defendant that he had failed to file a brief within the time allowed. Rather, as shown by a handwritten letter sent to the defendant at the Old Colony Correctional Center on July 8, 2003, counsel advised the defendant that the appeal should be discontinued. Counsel wrote: \u201cThis is to confirm our conversation regarding your direct appeal. I am recommending that you voluntarily dismiss the direct appeal, as I have examined the transcripts of trial and can find no substantial error or issue to raise. I also will file a motion for a new trial for you to raise the ineffective assistance of counsel issues relative to a failure to file a motion to suppress and other shortcomings at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">On July 10, 2003, counsel filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, accompanied by his own affidavit and that of the defendant. Counsel\u2019s affidavit stated that he had \u201cmade a thorough review of the transcript of the defendant\u2019s trial and the law applicable thereto,\u201d \u201cfully discussed this case and the grounds for appeal with the defendant,\u201d and \u201cinformed the defendant of the consequences of dismissing his appeal.\u201d It stated further that the defendant, \u201cafter consultation and review with [counsel], has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>elected to dismiss his appeal.\u201d The defendant\u2019s affidavit stated that he \u201cwish[ed] to dismiss this appeal,\u201d and that \u201cwithdrawal [was] made voluntarily and without threats or other inducements with respect to this decision.\u201d The motion was allowed, and the appeal was dismissed \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d Counsel never filed a motion for new trial as promised in his letter to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">On August 24, 2005, the defendant, acting pro se, moved to reinstate the appeal. In a supporting affidavit, the defendant averred that he \u201cunwittingly waived [his] right to [a]ppeal . . . due to the mis[]information of [a]ppellate counsel\u201d; that counsel never disclosed that he had failed to file the brief within the time allotted; that the defendant made numerous unsuccessful attempts to contact counsel before finally receiving the contents of the record; and that the defendant only recently learned that counsel had never filed a motion for new trial as promised. In support of his motion, the defendant also included a few short excerpts from the trial transcript where his trial counsel had made objections, and alluded to trial counsel\u2019s failure to file a pretrial motion to suppress evidence, but he did not argue the merits of any of these potential issues or provide any factual context in which they could be evaluated.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Unquestionably, it is a highly significant feature of this case that the defendant participated in the dismissal of his appeal. However, before considering the impact of that fact, we begin by setting out the general analytical framework governing a defendant\u2019s claim that he entirely lost his right of direct appeal as a result of acts or omissions of counsel after the appeal had entered in an appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The Commonwealth would have us consider the issue under the two-prong <em>Saferian </em>test generally applicable to allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89 (1974), i.e., whether counsel\u2019s performance fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected of an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d and whether such deficiency \u201clikely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96. Thus, under the Commonwealth\u2019s analysis, the defendant in this case would be precluded from obtaining relief if only because he has not fulfilled the second prong of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>Saferian </em>test by showing that he was deprived of the opportunity to present potentially meritorious appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">There is, however, a recognized distinction between the typical case of ineffective assistance of counsel governed by <em>Safer-ian </em>and a case where counsel\u2019s shortcomings during the appellate process have altogether deprived a defendant of review on direct appeal. As articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>425 Mass. 182, 184 (1997), in the latter situation, the defendant is not required to specify or argue the appellate issues that he would raise were his appeal reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In <em>Frank, </em>without the defendant\u2019s consent, counsel failed to file an appellate brief, resulting in the dismissal of the defendant\u2019s direct appeal. Emphasizing that a defendant has a clear statutory right to a direct appeal and a constitutional right to counsel in prosecuting that appeal, <em>ibid., </em>the court applied Federal constitutional standards applicable not only in cases where the defendant had no counsel at all on appeal, but also in cases where counsel\u2019s failures essentially waived the defendant\u2019s opportunity to make his appellate case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">As <em>Frank </em>explained, the court was presented with the \u201cvery variant of the right to counsel [on] appeal\u201d that had been addressed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Evitts </em>v. <em>Lucey, </em>469 U.S. 387 (1985), where the Supreme Court fully restored appellate rights lost to a criminal defendant as a result of counsel\u2019s failure to meet various procedural requirements. Accordingly, the case was not to be analyzed under the usual standards relating to ineffective assistance of counsel, but as one where the defendant essentially was deprived of appellate representation altogether. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, supra </em>at 184. As the <em>Frank </em>court stated: \u201cWhatever the standards for effective assistance of counsel on appeal, \u2018[i]n a situation like that here, counsel\u2019s failure was particularly egregious in that it essentially waived respondent\u2019s opportunity to make a case on the merits; in this sense, it is difficult to distinguish respondent\u2019s situation from that of someone who had no counsel at all.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Evitts </em>v. <em>Lucey, supra </em>at 394 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\"><em>Frank </em>went on to address the question of relief, determining that the case should be remanded for the appointment of a new attorney, who would be permitted to press the defendant\u2019s claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>by prosecuting the appeal, by filing a motion for a new trial, or both.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, supra </em>at 185. In other words, as in <em>Evitts, </em>the court fully restored the defendant\u2019s appellate rights, and did so without consideration of the strength or weakness of his underlying appellate arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">More recently, this court had occasion, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kegler, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908 (2006), to apply <em>Frank </em>in the context of an appeal from the denial by a single justice of this court of a defendant\u2019s motion to reinstate a direct appeal, where the defendant\u2019s appellate rights were lost because of counsel\u2019s neglect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We concluded that counsel\u2019s complete failure to press the defendant\u2019s direct appeal, resulting in its dismissal, \u201ceffectively deprive[d] the defendant of his right of direct appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kegler, supra </em>at 908. By way of remedy, we examined the merits of the defendant\u2019s appellate issues, concluding that \u201cthe issues raised would not warrant reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Significantly, in <em>Kegler, </em>the defendant was represented, and the underlying appellate claims were fully briefed. Thus, we were in a position to review the defendant\u2019s appellate issues in a single proceeding, along with the defendant\u2019s appeal from the single justice\u2019s order denying reinstatement, as if the underlying issues were before us on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We clarify, however, that in other circumstances, the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>propriate disposition would be to permit the defendant to pursue postconviction proceedings as ordered in <em>Frank, supra </em>at 185.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We further clarify that nothing in <em>Kegler </em>should be taken as detracting from the holding in <em>Frank, </em>that due process requires that a defendant who actually or constructively has been denied his right to counsel on appeal must be placed in the same position that he would have occupied were he presenting his direct appellate claims in the ordinary course. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, supra </em>at 185. He is not to be subjected to a stricter standard of review; nor is he required to establish any colorable appellate issue as a prerequisite to recovering his lost appellate rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We turn now to the present case, considering whether it falls within the parameters of <em>Frank </em>\u2014 again leaving for later discussion the significance of the defendant\u2019s facial acquiescence in the dismissal of his appeal. We conclude that, the defendant\u2019s acquiescence aside, this is one of those exceptional cases in which the defendant effectively was denied his right to counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Here, the defendant\u2019s appellate attorney never filed a brief, missing both the original deadline established by Mass.R.A.P. 19(a), as amended, 430 Mass. 1606 (1999), as well as the extended deadline set out in his first motion for enlargement time. His second motion to enlarge the time for filing, filed after the second deadline had been missed, was denied. The defendant\u2019s appeal, at that point, was subject to dismissal under the procedures set forth in our Standing Order 17A. Faced with the potential for compulsory dismissal attributable to his own neglect, counsel shortly thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 29(b), accompanied by his affidavit indicating that he made a \u201cthorough review\u201d of the case, and that there were no colorable appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In major respects, the present case is like <em>Penson </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75 (1988). In <em>Penson, </em>counsel filed a motion to withdraw in which he also stated that his client had no potentially meritorious appellate issues. Specifically, defense counsel in <em>Penson </em>averred that \u201che ha[d] carefully reviewed the . . . record on appeal\u201d and \u201cfound no errors requiring reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78. On that basis, defense counsel was permitted to withdraw, and the defendant\u2019s appeal was considered by the Ohio Court of Appeals \u201cwithout the assistance of any advocacy for the [defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Relying on <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 738 (1967), the Supreme Court in <em>Penson </em>held that defense counsel\u2019s actions amounted to a constructive denial of the right to counsel. <em>Pen-son </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 80 (\u201ca criminal appellant may not be denied representation on appeal based on appointed counsel\u2019s bare assertion that he or she is of the opinion that there is no merit to the appeal\u201d). While the Court acknowledged that, in some circumstances, it may be appropriate for counsel to withdraw for want of legitimate appellate claims, <em>Anders </em>sets out clear procedural safeguards that must be observed in such situations to protect a defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>Penson </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 80. In particular, <em>Anders </em>requires appellate counsel to submit a brief \u201creferring to anything in the record that might arguably support [an] appeal.\u201d <em>Penson </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 80, quoting from <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, supra </em>at 744. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Court in <em>Penson </em>concluded that defense counsel\u2019s conclusory submission was insufficient to meet these requirements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Penson </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In the present case \u2014 again deferring consideration of the complexity created by the defendant\u2019s participation in the dismissal \u2014 we likewise conclude that defense counsel\u2019s affidavit was insufficient to discharge his constitutional obligations. Had appellate counsel wished to extinguish the defendant\u2019s right of direct appeal on the sole basis that no colorable claims were present, he was obligated to do so through the medium of a brief that meets the requirements articulated in <em>Anders </em>and its Massachusetts analogue, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moffett, </em>383 Mass. 201, 208 (1981) (adopting <em>Anders </em>principles as a matter of State constitutional law).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">As <em>Penson </em>explained, not only does such a brief</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">\u201cassist the court in determining that counsel has carefully reviewed the record for arguable claims, but, in marginal cases, it also provides an independent inducement to counsel to perform a diligent review: The danger that a busy or inexperienced lawyer might opt in favor of a one sentence letter instead of an effective brief in an individual marginal case is real, notwithstanding the dedication that typifies the profession. If, however, counsel\u2019s ultimate evaluation of the case must be supported by a written opinion referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal, the temptation to discharge an obligation in summary fashion is avoided, and the reviewing court is provided with meaningful assistance. In addition, simply putting pen to paper can often shed new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>light on what may at first appear to be an open-and-shut issue.\u201d (Citations and quotations omitted.) <em>Penson </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 81 n.4.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">There is, however, the additional important factor present here, and not present in <em>Penson, </em>to which we finally turn: the defendant also submitted an affidavit indicating that he assented to the dismissal of his appeal, and that \u201cwithdrawal [was] made voluntarily and without threats or other inducements with respect to this decision.\u201d As noted in <em>Frank, </em>\u201c[t]here may be cases in which the loss of appellate rights was due to the deliberate and counseled choice of the defendant, and, in those cases, the defendant must abide by that choice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, supra </em>at 185 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Here, however, the defendant claims in his motion to reinstate that his decision to agree to the dismissal was based on the \u201cmis[]information of [a]ppellate counsel.\u201d In essence, the defendant argues that his appellate attorney deceived him about the procedural status of his case and induced him to agree to a dismissal to mask his representative\u2019s own procedural missteps \u2014 and to insulate counsel from any adverse consequences that might otherwise have resulted from those errors. He also argues in his brief that counsel never informed him of the option of filing a so-called \u201cMoffett\u201d brief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moffett, </em>383 Mass. at 207-209. Stated simply, the defendant asserts that he should not be bound by his affidavit in support of voluntary dismissal because it was not made with full knowledge of essential facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Without question, if the defendant were induced to agree to dismissal of his appeal based upon misrepresentations or material omissions by counsel, we would deem his consent to be involuntary. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>395 Mass. 495, 506-507, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 906 (1985) (waiver of rights must be knowing and intelligent to be deemed voluntary). Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>involuntary consent, in combination with the facts surrounding the appellate proceedings overall, would lead to the conclusion that the defendant had been functionally without representation on appeal, requiring reinstatement of his appellate rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion to reinstate was denied without comment. Thus, we cannot determine from the record before us that the voluntariness issue was examined by the single justice, and that he exercised his discretion to decide that issue adversely to the defendant. Nor can we determine whether the single justice\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s motion rested upon the principles set forth above and, in particular, the principle that a motion based on a valid claim of involuntariness cannot properly be denied on the ground that the defendant failed to show potentially meritorious issues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In other words, because we are uncertain as to the basis of the single justice\u2019s ruling, we are not in a position to conclude that his order can be affirmed as a proper exercise of his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Moreover, in the very unusual circumstances presented here \u2014 where the defendant\u2019s claim of involuntariness is supported not only by his own affidavit, but by the procedural history of the case, including the timing and content of counsel\u2019s letter recommending dismissal \u2014 we think that additional scrutiny is warranted. This is not a case where the defendant has made a bald allegation, unsupported by other facts, that his voluntary dismissal was actually involuntary. In such a case, a single justice undoubtedly would have discretion to credit the defendant\u2019s original, facially valid affidavit in support of voluntary dismissal over a later, self-serving affidavit in support of reinstatement. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 663 (1998). Here, however, because the record contains objective evidence of irregularities supporting the conclusion that the defendant effectively was deprived of the right to counsel on appeal, further inquiry is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">We therefore remand the case to the single justice for the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>pointment of screening counsel to review both the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of the defendant\u2019s appeal and the trial record, so that the defendant may decide, with the assistance of counsel, whether further attempts should be made to restore his appellate rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As <em>Frank </em>suggests, the choice of forum and procedural mechanism will be for the defendant and his counsel to make. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>425 Mass. at 185. Various options, alone or in combination, could include renewing the defendant\u2019s motion to reinstate his direct appeal in this court, with or without additional affidavits or other written submissions on the voluntariness issue<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; filing a motion under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), in the trial court as a vehicle for obtaining an evidentiary hearing on the question of voluntariness; or moving, under rule 30(b), for a new trial as a means to obtain review of trial court errors, if the issues might be better developed by means of a motion for a new trial, rather than on direct appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, supra </em>at 185, citing to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowie, </em>404 Mass. 119, 122-123 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order of the single justice is vacated. The case is remanded to the single justice for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">By leaving the choice of forum and procedural mechanism to counsel, the relief ordered in <em>Frank </em>expanded upon the principles set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowie, </em>404 Mass. 119, 122-123 (1989), which held that a motion for new trial, pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), may, in certain circumstances, provide an adequate alternative remedy to reinstatement of a direct appeal where a defendant contends that he lost his appellate rights as a result of counsel\u2019s neglect. We recently had occasion to comment upon <em>Cowie </em>in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trussell, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 452 (2007), in which we affirmed the allowance by a single justice of this court of the defendant\u2019s motion to file a late notice of appeal. As we explained in <em>Trussed, </em>proceeding by way of a motion for a new trial can be a circuitous method of restoring appellate rights; reinstatement of a direct appeal normally has the advantage of fostering judicial economy. <em>Id. </em>at 458-459.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In <em>Kegler, </em>despite four previous enlargements of time for filing the defendant\u2019s brief, and an order of conditional reinstatement, counsel failed to file a brief on time or even to apprise the court of his reasons for failing to do so. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kegler, supra </em>at 907.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-6\">We reached a similar conclusion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trussell, supra, </em>in which we discussed the standards applicable to motions for enlargement of time to file a notice of appeal in criminal cases. In <em>Trussell, </em>we acknowledged the due process requirements underlying <em>Frank </em>and <em>Evitts, </em>stating that \u201c[i]n criminal cases ... the Federal Constitution, as the <em>Evitts </em>case reveals, acts as a brake on [the principles of] finality\u201d on which Mass.R.A.P. 4(c), as amended, 378 Mass. 928 (1979), and 14(b), as amended, 378 Mass. 939 (1979), rest. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trussell, supra </em>at 457. We therefore concluded that these rules were to be given a construction in criminal cases different from that given in civil cases, and we affirmed the reinstatement of the defendant\u2019s appeal in circumstances where the failure to file a notice of appeal within the time limits prescribed by our rules was the result of acts or omissions of counsel to which the defendant did not assent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">We recognize that, subsequent to <em>Frank, </em>the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470 (2000), holding, in the specific, unusual context of defense counsel\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal following the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, that the defendant would not be entitled to relief without demonstrating \u201cprejudice.\u201d However, the Court used that term in a limited sense, requiring the defendant to show only that counsel\u2019s deficient performance actually caused the forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s appeal, i.e., that but for counsel\u2019s deficient failure to consult with him about his wishes, he would have timely appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 484-485. At the same time, the Court reaffirmed that the defendant need not specify the points he would raise were his right to appeal reinstated, much less show that they would have merit. <em>Id. </em>at 485-486.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\">To remedy the constitutional violation, the United States Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Ohio Court of Appeals and remanded the case to that court, where counsel was to be appointed for the defendant to represent him in his appeal. <em>Penson </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 89.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\">The United States Supreme Court has now clarified that the States may endeavor to craft constitutionally acceptable alternatives to the <em>Anders </em>procedure. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 276 (2000). However, the Court has not abandoned the core principles of <em>Penson: </em>(1) a conclusory statement that there are no colorable appellate issues is not a constitutionally adequate basis for terminating a defendant\u2019s rights on direct appeal, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robbins, supra </em>at 280-281; and (2) the actual or constructive denial of counsel on appeal must be remedied without a showing of prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 286.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In the present case, the concerns identified in <em>Penson </em>are substantial, as the timing of the motion to dismiss, coming as it did on the heels of a missed briefing deadline and counsel\u2019s inability to secure an additional enlargement of time, calls into question counsel\u2019s objectivity in pursuing voluntary dismissal. The Commonwealth has not identified, and we are not aware of, any conceivable strategic justification for seeking a voluntary dismissal of a direct appeal in a case such as this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\">It is possible, for example, that the single justice may have denied the motion for reinstatement because of his belief that a motion for a new trial was an adequate and available method for the defendant to establish that he had not voluntarily agreed to dismiss the appeal. However, as we discuss below, <em>Frank </em>suggests that the choice of a mechanism for vindicating an involuntary loss of appellate rights lies with the defendant and his counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\">We note in this regard that the pro se defendant made repeated requests in this court that counsel be appointed to represent him in the present appeal. Initially, he was informed that, if he established his indigency, he would be appointed screening counsel. Then, after providing proof of indigency, his request for representation was denied on the ground that he had no right to counsel for an appeal of this nature, by analogy to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conceicao, </em>388 Mass. 255 (1983) (holding that an indigent defendant does not have an absolute right to appointed counsel in preparing or presenting a motion for a new trial).
