It arises out of a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief filed in July, 2005, by Frank A. and Kim A. (collectively, parents) against the Commissioner of the Department of Mental Retardation (DMR), seeking to prevent the DMR from transferring their then twenty-two year old daughter, Molly, from her long-time residential placement at Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center (Crotched Mountain) in New Hampshire to another facility in Massachusetts that the DMR deemed appropriate and less costly, a transfer that the parents maintain would offer Molly inadequate care and would violate the DMR\u2019s statutory, regulatory, and constitutional obligations to her. A Superior Court judge allowed the DMR\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed all three counts of the parents\u2019 complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We now affirm that judgment as to counts I and HI and reverse as to count H.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>From the materials submitted to the judge in conjunction with the parties\u2019 summary judgment motions, the material facts relevant to the disposition of this appeal are as follows.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Molly, born on March 2, 1983, suffers from Rett\u2019s Syndrome (Rett\u2019s), a progressively debilitating disorder akin to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>autism that afflicts only females and is often associated (as it is in Molly\u2019s case) with enfeebling symptoms, including profound mental retardation (Molly has the cognitive function of a twelve month old child), legal blindness, impaired hearing, inability to speak, constant hand-wringing, and seizures. Molly cannot feed herself or attend to any of her personal or hygienic needs unassisted. Unlike many Rett\u2019s patients, she can walk independently, although haltingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Since 1994, Molly has resided in a skilled nursing unit at Crotched Mountain in Greenfield, New Hampshire, where she has remained to this day. Crotched Mountain is a private residential facility providing a wide array of rehabilitative services for persons who are mentally retarded, vision and hearing impaired, and otherwise seriously disabled. Molly has received physical, speech, occupational, and music therapies, and (most relevant to the instant case) has had a \u201cone-on-one\u201d aide assigned to her at all times. As a legal resident of Bedford, Massachusetts (where she lived with her mother, Kim A.),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Molly has been provided special educational services through the Bed-ford school district and the Massachusetts Department of Education, which placed her at Crotched Mountain and were responsible for funding her stay and services there through her twenty-second birthday, pursuant to G. L. c. 71B, usually called \u201cChapter 766\u201d (of the Acts of 1972). Under G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5, those eligible for special education services receive funding for such services through the public school system of their legal residence until they graduate from high school or turn twenty-two years old. Under G. L. c. 7IB, \u00a7\u00a7 12A-12C (turning twenty-two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>statute), upon turning twenty-two (as Molly did on March 2, 2005), the recipient \u201cages out\u201d of the public school system and becomes eligible for adult services funded by the DMR.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">A year before Molly\u2019s twenty-second birthday, a DMR transition coordinator, Barton Price, became involved with Molly and her parents to plan and facilitate the transfer of responsibility for her services from the Bedford school system to the DMR. The parents hoped that the DMR would permit Molly to remain at Crotched Mountain, where she had made unusual progress for a woman her age afflicted with Rett\u2019s.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the DMR briefly considered Crotched Mountain as an appropriate facility to provide adult services to Molly, for a number of reasons it soon began focusing on alternative placements within the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On October 5, 2004, it sent to the parents at Molly\u2019s Bedford address (where it mistakenly thought the parents resided together) an \u201cindividual transitional plan\u201d (ITP) for Molly, as required by the turning twenty-two statute, G. L. c. 7IB, \u00a7 12C. The bulk of the ITP, which was drafted by Price, described Molly\u2019s ailments (including the fact that she \u201ccontinues to have periodic seizures\u201d) and needs. It concluded with an unelaborated observation that Molly \u201cwill be unable to remain at [Crotched Mountain] beyond her 22nd birthday on March 2, 2005\u201d; the clear implication that she would then be transferred to an appropriate residential placement in Massachusetts yet to be determined; and the alarming (to the parents) statement that, if no suitable placement was found for Molly by that time, she would be sent to the Bedford residence with unspecified DMR \u201csupport.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The ITP included instructions on how to file an administrative appeal should the parents \u201creject\u201d the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Dissatisfied with the ITP, on November 19, 2004, the parents filed a timely appeal to the bureau of transitional planning of the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), pursuant to 101 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.03 (1999).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> About one month later, they received a letter from the EOHHS acknowledging receipt of the appeal, but never received a response to their appeal in the form of a written ruling affirming or modifying the ITP, as required by the regulation. During this period and into early 2005, the DMR did, however, continue to work with the parents regarding Molly\u2019s placement in an appropriate adult facility. On February 23, 2005, after a number of meetings among the DMR representatives, the parents, and the staff at Crotched Mountain,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Mary Beth Coyne, the DMR\u2019s area direc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>tor for central Middlesex County, informed the parents that the DMR would not fund Molly\u2019s continued stay at Crotched Mountain past her twenty-second birthday.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">During February and March, 2005, the parents visited or considered several Massachusetts facilities suggested by the DMR as appropriate residential placements, but found each one unsatisfactory, primarily because they would or could not provide the constant one-on-one care and twenty-four hour nursing services the parents believed were essential to Molly\u2019s welfare and safety. March 2, 2005, Molly\u2019s twenty-second birthday, came and went without resolution of the issue. On March 24, 2005, the DMR sent a \u201crevised\u201d ITP to the parents that added to the list of Molly\u2019s medical problems but left the statement of her needs unchanged. It reiterated that Molly would not be able to stay at Crotched Mountain beyond her twenty-second birthday (although she already had for three weeks, at the DMR\u2019s expense) and that she would be sent home with DMR \u201csupport . . . until an appropriate residential placement can be developed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The parents continued to believe that the ITP, even as revised, was incomplete and did not comply with the DMR regulations. On June 3, 2005 (within the ninety-day administrative appeal period), the parents rejected the revised ITP and again appealed, once more stressing the necessity for twenty-four hour per day, one-on-one care because of Molly\u2019s seizure disorder and drop attacks, which \u201chave increased in number and length over the past year.\u201d On the record provided this court, no response appears ever to have been made to the parents\u2019 second ITP appeal, and no further proceedings thereon occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Subsequent to the DMR\u2019s issuance of the revised ITP, in late March, 2005, the DMR sent two representatives, Dr. Allen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>C. Crocker and Sharon Oxx, a registered nurse, to Crotched Mountain to review Molly\u2019s care plan and determine if her needs could be served in a community setting with less intensive care than the parents were demanding.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They observed Molly \u201cin a number of settings\u201d for an undisclosed period of time and met for approximately two hours with senior Crotched Mountain staff who supervised or cared for Molly. Based on his visit, Dr. Crocker concluded that Molly\u2019s \u201cseizures ... are evidently mild, infrequent and not disabling\u201d and the issue of falls \u201calso do[es] not appear to be important,\u201d so that Molly could do well in a small group home with a two-to-one patient-staff ratio and intermittent nursing visits. He also noted that in his experience, the overwhelming majority (eighty per cent) of Rett\u2019s patients, in fact, live at home with their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Oxx opined that Molly was \u201cnot as medically fragile\u201d as the parents maintained; that her seizure disorder was infrequent and \u201cappears to be fairly well regulated\u201d; that over the prior twelve months, no reported incidents of injuries associated with seizures had been reported; that Molly did not need twenty-four hour nursing care or constant one-on-one staffing; and that her needs were in fact similar to those of the great majority of people the DMR served (in that she had no self-preservation skills, minimal daily living activities skills, and limited abilities to communicate) who thrived in community residential care programs, as could Molly.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Recognizing the likelihood of impasse and litigation, in the early spring of 2005, the parents retained counsel to represent them in their dealings with the DMR. Through the spring and early summer, counsel communicated to the DMR at greater length the parents\u2019 reasons for rejecting the suggested Massachusetts placements and elaborated on the parents\u2019 concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>for Molly\u2019s future care, but no agreements could be reached. On July 1, 2005, the DMR sent the parents\u2019 counsel a letter recapitulating the several alternative placements the DMR had suggested, mentioning several additional ones, requesting that the parents make a choice by July 8, 2005, so that the transition process could begin, and stating that the DMR would no longer fund Molly\u2019s continued stay at Crotched Mountain after July 31, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Counsel\u2019s response to the DMR, dated July 8, 2005, reiterated the parents\u2019 objections to the facilities and services proposed by the DMR because none of them provided the level of services Molly\u2019s health and safety required, most particularly \u201cconstant 1:1 staffing.\u201d For the first time, the parents asserted that Molly, having turned twenty-two and been funded by the DMR since her birthday, was now entitled to invoke the provisions of G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3 (transfer statute),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and lodged a formal request for an administrative transfer hearing and continued funding of Molly\u2019s current Crotched Mountain placement. The parents\u2019 counsel electronically mailed the DMR a second such request on July 12, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Receiving no official response from the DMR to either communication, and construing the DMR\u2019s silence as reflecting a threat imminently to terminate Molly\u2019s funding at Crotched Mountain and transfer her to an inadequate facility or home, the parents\u2019 counsel filed the underlying complaint on July 22, 2005, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> on the basis of three arguments. In count I, the parents asserted that the DMR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>was required to comply with the transfer statute, G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, and prevail at an adjudicatory hearing before effecting a transfer of placement, because the DMR had already begun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>funding Molly\u2019s stay at Crotched Mountain subsequent to her twenty-second birthday. They argued in count II that the DMR had failed to comply with its obligations under the turning twenty-two statute, as set forth in G. L. c. 7IB, \u00a7 12C, and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, which mandate that the DMR provide Molly with proper habilitative services. In support of their position, the parents relied on experts<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> who opined that Molly requires placement in a facility providing constant one-on-one care, chiefly because her seizures and falling risk pose a significant danger for her health and safety. The parents contended in count III that the DMR had also violated the procedural requirements established in the turning twenty-two statute and the DMR\u2019s own regulations, 101 Code Mass. Regs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u00a7 10.03, by providing them with an inadequate and noncompliant ITP and by failing to address and resolve their objections to the ITP.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>The parents contend that the Superior Court judge erred in denying their motion for summary judgment on count I and in allowing the DMR\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all three counts. Much of the basic standard governing appellate review of summary judgments has been set forth in note 5, <em>supra. </em>As applicable to count I, the additional relevant principles are that (1) a summary judgment motion will be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and responses to requests for admission under Rule 36, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,\u201d Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002); and (2) \u201cstatutory interpretation is a question of law for the court to decide,\u201d <em>Annese Elec. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>431 Mass. 763, 764 n.2 (2000), and can be appropriately resolved by summary judgment if there is no real dispute as to the salient facts, <em>Community Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 553 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">b. <em>Count I. </em>We agree with the judge\u2019s observation that \u201c[t]he issue at the heart of Count I is whether the Transfer Statute, G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, applies to Molly\u2019s situation ...[,] a question that [the parties agree] does not depend on [disputed] factual circumstances.\u201d We further agree with the judge\u2019s adoption of the DMR\u2019s position that (1) the turning twenty-two statute is the primary process by which individuals receiving special education services under Chapter 766 are moved into the adult services system; (2) the transfer statute, construed, as it must be, in harmony with the turning twenty-two statute, did not yet apply to Molly\u2019s situation because an individual service plan (ISP) had not yet been developed for her and such a plan is a precondition of eligibility for the transfer statute\u2019s procedural protections<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>; and (3) the DMR was consequently not obligated, as the parents demanded, to prove in an administrative hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>of the sort required pursuant to the transfer statute that Molly\u2019s adult placement would meet her \u201cbest interest\u201d \u2014 which, were the parents\u2019 position correct, would require a placement giving Molly <em>better </em>services than those she was receiving at Crotched Mountain.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The DMR\u2019s view \u2014 with which the judge agreed \u2014 is that it properly proceeded under the turning twenty-two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>statute, with its elaborate procedural structure for developing a transitional plan for an individual coming from special education into adult services,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> because the transfer statute only applies to individuals who have already completed the transition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>to adult services and have been receiving services from the DMR under an ISP; and because (as explained in notes 18 and 19, <em>supra), </em>the DMR has up to twelve months following an individual\u2019s twenty-second birthday to develop an ISP if an ITP has been developed for that individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Courts have long and consistently accorded \u201csubstantial deference to a reasonable interpretation of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its administration [and] enforcement.\u201d <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006). See <em>Amherst-Pelham Regional Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Department of Educ., </em>376 Mass. 480, 491-492 (1978) (upholding administrative interpretation of provisions of G. L. c. 71B). That deference requires, first, that we \u201capply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative [construction of a regulatory statute] and not declare it void unless its provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate,\u201d <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, 311 </em>Mass. 844, 855 (1977). Even more decisively, it enjoins that, \u201c[g]iven . . . two equally plausible readings of the statutory language, we [must] defer to the [agency\u2019s] reasonable interpretation .... [0]ur role ... is constrained ... by the [reasonable] choice of the agency.\u201d <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>447 Mass. 814, 821-822 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Accordingly, we must reject the parents\u2019 proffered statutory interpretation, which is based on a literal reading in isolation of the provision of the transfer statute that requires an adjudicatory proceeding if the \u201cguardian . . . for a mentally retarded person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>who is receiving residential services through [the DMR]\u201d objects to a proposed residential transfer of such person for whom an ISP has been developed. G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, inserted by St. 1986, c. 599, \u00a7 39. The parents\u2019 out-of-context reading contravenes the DMR\u2019s reasonable position that the turning twenty-two statute initially governs the transition of all disabled persons, including those suffering mental retardation, into adult services via an ITP; and that the transfer statute itself presupposes that a post-ITP ISP will be in place before a mentally retarded individual becomes eligible for the transfer statute\u2019s protections (see note 19, <em>supra).</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Moreover, the parents fail coherently to counter the DMR\u2019s plausible view of how the two statutes, which are clearly in pari materia, can be read \u201ctogether [as courts must] to make \u2018an harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Healey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>414 Mass. 18, 25 (1992), quoting from <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 585 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Further, the parents\u2019 statutory analysis violates several other principles of statutory construction. We do not interpret regulatory statutes in a manner that imposes procedural requirements on an agency that are not clearly mandated by the statutory language. See <em>Grocery Mfrs. of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 79-80 (1979). Nor do we construe \u201cstatutes embodying procedural requirements\u201d in such a way as to \u201ccreate] snares for the unwary.\u201d <em>EMC Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>433 Mass. 568, 574 (2001), quoting from <em>Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>374 Mass. 230, 233 (1978). Additionally, the parents\u2019 arguments neither address nor reflect the deference due the DMR\u2019s expertise in interpreting and administering the statutes at issue, to which expertise courts afford \u201csubstantial deference.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 633 (2005).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">More decisively, however, courts \u201cwill not adopt a literal construction of a statute if the consequences of such construction are absurd or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. 249, 251 (1996), quoting from <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982). We are bound to avoid an absurd or unreasonable result when statutory language is susceptible of a sensible, workable construction. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Norwood, </em>358 Mass. 253, 258 (1970). The parents\u2019 position, that the DMR is obliged to comply with the transfer statute once it voluntarily pays anything for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>individual\u2019s services after her twenty-second birthday, would, if accepted, have three such undesirable consequences. First, it would yield the discordant result that the transition of mentally retarded special education recipients to the DMR would be effected through a different procedure than that applicable to all other special education students moving from child to adult services \u2014 a result inconsistent with the generality of the turning twenty-two statute as applicable to all disabled persons receiving special education under Chapter 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Second, it would have (as previously explained, see note 18, <em>supra) </em>the effect of requiring the DMR to prove that moving disabled mentally retarded individuals from their childhood special education facilities to adult placements would produce not merely continued services at the same level, but \u201cimproved\u201d services. Such a financial consequence would conflict with the express limitation in G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 12C, inserted by St. 1983, c. 688, \u00a7 1, that services provided to former Chapter 766 recipients are \u201csubject to appropriation,\u201d as well as with the conditioning of such services under an ISP to \u201cthe availability of resources,\u201d 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.20(1) (2003).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Finally, and perhaps most contrary to public policy, accepting the parents\u2019 argument would undermine the cooperative approach to service delivery embodied in the statutes and the DMR regulations; would effectively penalize the DMR for its good faith decision not to uproot Molly precipitously, but rather continue to voluntarily fund Molly\u2019s stay at Crotched Mountain beyond her twenty-second birthday while the parties attempted to negotiate their differences; and would most likely create a disincentive for the DMR to engage in future dispute resolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>negotiations with and temporary funding arrangements for any similarly situated guardians and their wards.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In sum, the judge correctly granted summary judgment for the DMR on count I of the parents\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">c. <em>Count II. </em>The judge was not, however, as sure footed in his handling of count D, which alleged that the DMR did not comply with its obligations under the turning twenty-two statute and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights in that its proposed plan (the revised ITP) failed to provide Molly with the proper rehabilitative services to meet her needs \u2014- most importantly (to the parents) Molly\u2019s need for constant, twenty-four hour, one-on-one care to insure her physical safety because of her seizures and risk of falling. On this count, the judge concluded that the issue of the appropriate level and manner of services for Molly came down to a battle of experts,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which could be resolved in the DMR\u2019s favor by reason of its experts having opined that its decision to offer placements that would provide Molly with less intensive care than one-on-one was nonetheless a reasonable choice, because it was supported by evidence that the choice comported with accepted professional practice and standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The judge relied on a theoretically unimpeachable standard of appellate review \u2014 that when an agency has, in the discretionary exercise of its expertise, made a choice between two fairly conflicting but debatable views, and its choice reflects reasonable evidence (especially when supported by qualified experts), a court may not displace that choice or substitute its judgment for that of the agency. See <em>Conservation Commn. of Falmouth </em>v. <em>Pacheco, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 737, 740 n.3 (2000), and cases cited. The judge\u2019s reliance on that standard was, however, misplaced, because it applies to fully litigated proceedings where there have been sufficient agency findings, or equivalent factual bases, on which to exercise its statutory authority. In the summary judgment context, such reliance resulted in the disregard of the most axiomatic applicable principle: that summary judgment cannot be granted if the evidence properly before the motion judge<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> reveals a genuine issue of disputed material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the parents, we see as hotly disputed the most substantial issue separating the parties with respect to the DMR\u2019s undisputed service obligation to Molly: namely, whether the placements proposed by the DMR would provide the habilitative services necessary to insure her physical well-being and safety so as to maximize her potential for self-sufficiency. See G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7\u00a7 12A, 12C. We disagree with the judge\u2019s observation that the rival experts\u2019 opinions on that score differed only \u201cin matters of degree\u201d and merely reflected different \u201capplications of professional judgment\u201d and \u201cdiffering assumptions.\u201d There could not have been more pointed conflict between the parties\u2019 experts with respect to the critical factual question underlying that basic issue \u2014 whether Molly required twenty-four hour, one-on-one supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Doctor Crocker and nurses Shilo and Oxx opined for the DMR that Molly\u2019s seizures were mild, infrequent, not disabling, and fairly well-regulated, and that the risk of her injury from falling during a seizure did not appear to be important, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>been overestimated, and was not a serious reality. Consequently, they saw no need for constant one-on-one care for her. The parents\u2019 experts, Drs. Riviello, Wilson, and Daignault, on the other hand, described Molly\u2019s seizure disorder as \u201cintractable,\u201d with her seizures increasing in number, progressively worsening, and creating a serious risk of injury from falls. Providing Molly with round-the-clock, one-on-one supervision was, they concluded, potentially a matter of life and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">These opinions, which go to the very heart of the decision as to Molly\u2019s most appropriate placement, are not mere differences in degree, but rather represent polar views regarding the outcome-determinative, unresolved issue dividing the parties. That issue manifestly requires trial. The judge (and certainly this court) may not usurp the function of the factfinder by passing on the relative credibility of the rival experts, evaluating the comparative weight of their evidence, assessing whether the DMR\u2019s view of Molly\u2019s condition is more valid or plausible than that of the parents, or concluding that the parents are unlikely to prevail on this issue at trial. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>386 Mass. 367, 370 (1982). On this record, the allowance of summary judgment for the DMR on count II was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">d. <em>Count III. </em>The parents alleged in count III of their complaint that the DMR\u2019s revised ITP failed to comply with statutory requirements (particularly as to specifying the location and expected duration of services, G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 12C); and that the DMR failed to comply with its own regulations by not modifying or affirming that ITP within thirty days following their appeal. 101 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.03. The effect of these procedural defects, they contend (based on their proposed reading of 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 6.20[4][b], 6.23[3], 6.23[5][a]), is that there was no valid ITP in existence on and after March 2, 2005, while Molly was receiving the DMR funding. The net result is that the transfer statute should have been applied to Molly\u2019s situation, entitling her to an ISP within ninety days of her twenty-second birthday. Consequently, they argue, summary judgment on this count was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The parents devote less than two pages of their brief to this rather convoluted issue and rely on bare assertions regarding the meaning of the cited statutes and regulations, unaided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>precedential, or even analogous, supportive legal authority and contrary to Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, the revised ITP they attack \u2014 indeed, even the initial ITP \u2014 appears on its face to comply, if minimally, with the statute.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Further, nowhere do they suggest how a timely DMR-developed ISP would have differed in any meaningful way from the DMR\u2019s revised ITP \u2014 particularly in light of the express regulatory limitation on ISP-proposed services as being \u201csubject to the availability of resources.\u201d 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.20(1).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The greatest difficulty with count III, however, is that, in substance, it presents the same pure question of law \u2014 did the DMR act as the law requires in proceeding in Molly\u2019s case under the turning twenty-two statute rather than under the transfer statute \u2014 that the judge correctly resolved in the DMR\u2019s favor in granting summary judgment on count I.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>3. <em>Disposition. </em>The parents\u2019 complaint specifically requested declaratory relief as to the applicability of the transfer statute to any DMR transfer of Molly from Crotched Mountain and as to Molly\u2019s right to receive sufficient funding and services from the DMR for her continued safety and habilitation. The judge, however \u2014 perhaps in consequence of his \u201cpresumptions\u201d that the Commonwealth \u201cwill honor its obligations\u201d and that the DMR \u201cwill continue to work with Molly\u2019s parents toward a placement that is optimally suited to Molly\u2019s needs within the available program options and funding, and that satisfies accepted professional standards for meeting her developmental, medical, and personal safety needs\u201d \u2014 simply dismissed the parents\u2019 complaint after allowing the DMR\u2019s motion for summary judgment. When a complaint requests declaratory relief, the judge must declare the rights of the parties, even when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>relief is denied, <em>Animal Legal Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fisheries &amp; Wildlife Bd., </em>416 Mass. 635, 641 (1993), and even on motions for summary judgment, <em>146 Dundas Corp. </em>v. <em>Chemical Bank, </em>400 Mass. 588, 589 n.4 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is modified so as to declare that the provisions of the turning twenty-two statute, G. L. c. 7IB, \u00a7\u00a7 12A-12C, and not the transfer statute, G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, apply to Molly\u2019s transfer by the DMR from Crotched Mountain to another placement for the provision of such services and supports as are in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory criteria and requirements. In addition, for those reasons discussed <em>supra, </em>the judgment is affirmed in so far as it grants the DMR\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to counts I and III of the complaint. The judgment is reversed in so far as it grants the DMR\u2019s motion for summary judgment on count II, and the case is remanded for such further proceedings with respect to count II as are consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Count I alleged that the DMR had failed to comply with G.

L. c. 71B, \u00a7\u00a7 12A-12C (turning twenty-two statute), and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to provide Molly with habilitative services. Count m asserted that the DMR had violated several statutory and regulatory procedural requirements governing Molly\u2019s transition from die public school system to the DMR under the turning twenty-two statute and related regulations, 101 Code Mass.

Over a four-hour period, Shilo observed Molly, spoke with several of her caretakers at Crotched Mountain, and met with Kim A. Shilo was unable to secure the parents\u2019 permission to receive a copy of all of Molly\u2019s medical records, but did review certain portions supplied by Kim A. On the basis of reviewing these records and her visit at Crotched Mountain, Shilo concluded that Molly could successfully integrate into a community residential facility with a two-to-one staffing ratio, with closer, one-on-one supervision for certain activities of daily living, including eating, dressing, and toileting. Shilo opined that Molly did not need twenty-four hour nursing care and a one-on-one aide at all times, based on her \u201cfeeling\u201d that the incidence of Molly\u2019s seizures \u2014 the most significant reason advanced by the parents for one-on-one care because of the risk of serious injury resulting from a fall during a seizure \u2014 was not a \u201cserious realitfy]\u201d and that the safety risk such seizures posed had been \u201coverestimated.\u201d Shilo was familiar with Rett\u2019s and worked with three DMR clients suffering from it who, she claimed, did not need one-on-one care, although she provided no specifics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>about those clients that compared with Molly\u2019s needs and risks except for one who suffered up to forty-seven seizures per week (but who, unlike Molly, was not at risk for falling, because she was nonambulatory and in a wheelchair).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Coyne thereafter extended the deadline for a cutoff of DMR funding to April 14, 2005, and again to June 30, 2005, as the issue of Molly\u2019s placement continued to be debated and unresolved. During this period, Molly continued to reside at Crotched Mountain, where her stay was funded by the DMR as of, and after, March 2, 2005; as the result of an injunction eventually obtained from the Superior Court by the parents, Molly has remained there pending the final disposition of this litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Doctor Crocker is an acknowledged expert in the area of developmental disabilities in children (in which he has worked for fifty years); Rett\u2019s; the causes and prevention of developmental disabilities; and medical care for mentally retarded children and adults.

Given the EOHHS\u2019s apparent unwillingness to act on the parents\u2019 administrative appeal of the revised ITP, the appropriate vehicle for the parents\u2019 grievance should presumably have been an action in the nature of mandamus, pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 5, to require the EOHHS to respond in some fashion to the appeal (which response 101 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.03 appears to make a mandatory duty), see <em>Trust Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. (No. 1), </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 617, 621-622 (2000); and to allege that the general prerequisite for obtaining mandamus relief, that available administrative remedies have been exhausted, see <em>Karl V. Wolsey Co. </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Bedford, </em>324 Mass. 419, 422 (1949), could be dispensed with by reason of exceptional circumstances, in this case arguable futility. See <em>Athol Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>437 Mass. 417, 426 (2002). Neither occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"ApvX\">One would also have expected the DMR, for its part, to respond to the parents\u2019 complaint with certain affirmative defenses, including the parents\u2019 unjustified failure to have exhausted their administrative remedies, see <em>id. </em>at 426-427; the applicability of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction because of the need for the agency\u2019s expertise to resolve the specialized issues involved, see <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Local 1526, Am. Fedn. of State, County, &amp; Mun. Employees, </em>399 Mass. 341, 346-350 (1987); and the general lack of ripeness for judicial review because the agency had several reasonable choices available to it but had yet to make a final determination on the matter. See <em>Federman </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Marblehead, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 727, 729-730 (1994). The DMR\u2019s answer, however, contained no such averments. (We hasten to add that the application of these doctrines, which all serve the same purpose of \u201cpromoting proper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies,\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 290, 303 [1976], are within judicial discretion and are not \u201cjurisdictional\u201d [at least in the instant circumstances] in the sense that neither the Legislature nor decisional precedent has clearly made the agency\u2019s final resolution of the issues involved a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial review [such a jurisdictional challenge being open to review at any stage of the proceedings]. Contrast <em>Athol Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med.

But we do not intend thereby to suggest our sanctioning of their unorthodox litigation strategy or to assure the future availability of judicial review when established avenues of administrative process are short-circuited without good reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The parents submitted several expert opinions regarding Molly\u2019s condition and needs, in the form of affidavit and deposition testimony, in support of their motion for preliminary injunctive relief and in conjunction with the parties\u2019 subsequent cross motions for summary judgment. The most significant, for purposes of our review, can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Doctor James J. Riviello, Molly\u2019s treating neurologist for at least ten years, focused primarily on the risks associated with her continued \u201cintractable\u201d seizure disorder, noting that \u201c[t]he increased number of seizures which Molly is experiencing at the present time\u201d include \u201cdrop attacks\u201d which \u201cwill cause Molly to potentially fall to the ground and seriously injure herself\u201d and could even cause her death. He noted that because Molly is unable to identify the onset of seizures, she should have one-on-one supervision. He also advised that Molly \u201creside in a closely supervised environment, such as or similar to her current placement, Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center.\u201d He further cautioned that \u201c[djevelopmentally disabled individuals do not tolerate change well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Doctor Claire D. Wilson, Molly\u2019s treating pediatrician for twelve years, similarly recommended that Molly not be transferred from Crotched Mountain, unless to a placement with a similar level of care, stressing that \u201cher conditions have progressively worsened\u201d and that her physical safety is alone sufficient reason for the continued provision of one-on-one supervision because her drop seizures created a risk of \u201csignificant harm and [are] potentially life-threatening\u201d without a staff person with her at all times to identify the imminence of a seizure and then to activate a vagal stimulator that Dr. Riviello had implanted to curb the seizure activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Doctor John Daignault, an acknowledged expert in mental retardation, performed an independent evaluation of Molly at the behest of her parents and offered a detailed criticism of the DMR\u2019s proposed placements. Based upon his review of Molly\u2019s medical history and his observations of Molly, he emphasized the \u201cserious risks to Molly\u2019s safety\" from her \u201cfrequent seizures\u201d (which, he opined, were \u201ctruly [a matter] of life and death\u201d) and advised placing her in a facility with one-on-one care during the day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">An individual service plan (so denominated in G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, but called an \u201cindividual support plan\u201d in the DMR regulations thereunder, 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.20[1] [2003], both of which are interchangeably referred to herein as an ISP) is to be developed by the DMR for mentally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>retarded individuals under its jurisdiction, setting forth the services, resources, and strategies that will promote the individual\u2019s health and safety. 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.20(2). An ISP must identify \u201cthe setting,\u201d i.e., the location, where the services and strategies are to be provided or implemented. 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.23(4)(e)(3) (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The DMR\u2019s regulations place three particularly significant limitations on the agency\u2019s obligations regarding an ISP that are relevant to Molly\u2019s circumstances. First, the DMR\u2019s provision of services and supports to mentally retarded individuals (with an exception not claimed to be here applicable) are explicitly made \u201csubject to the availability of resources.\u201d 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.20(1). Second, the DMR has up to twelve months following a mentally retarded individual\u2019s twenty-second birthday to develop an ISP if an ITP has already been developed for that individual (as had been done for Molly, notwithstanding the parents\u2019 objections to Molly\u2019s ITP). 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.20(4)(b) (2006). Finally, there is no requirement that the DMR prosecute the adjudicatory administrative proceeding incident to a guardian\u2019s objection to a proposed transfer of a mentally retarded individual from one facility to another if such a transfer involves a \u201cchange in placement of an individual from a location providing residential services that the Department had begun funding on an interim basis on or before the individual\u2019s 22nd birthday,\u201d 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.63(1)(c)(3) (1996), the very situation of the DMR\u2019s involvement with Molly.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">These DMR regulations are presumptively valid, <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 91 (2006), and carry the force of law, <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 768, 775 (2006). Courts are consequently bound to uphold them in the absence of a persuasive demonstration that they are arbitrary and capricious, i.e., that there is no conceivable rational ground on which the regulation can be sustained. See <em>Arthur D. Little, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Cambridge, </em>395 Mass. 535, 553 (1985). The parents have made no effort to carry their formidable burden of establishing the absence of any conceivable ground on which the relevant DMR regulations can be accorded the judicial deference presumptively due them. They merely assert, in wholly conclusory fashion, that 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.63, in particular, is invalid, on the ground that a Superior Court judge so declared in a nonprecedential summary judgment decision, Grady vs. Campbell, Bristol Superior Court, No. 9401163 (May 24, 1995). That declaration, however, not only was (as is discussed infra) distinguishable, but also itself provided no coherent legal analysis for so holding. The parents\u2019 attempt to rely on such truncated reasoning is unavailing. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Application of the transfer statute to the turning twenty-two statute\u2019s process in the manner pressed by the parents \u2014 i.e., by compelling the DMR, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>before it could place Molly at any facility in Massachusetts to which the parents objected, to initiate an administrative hearing, pursuant to G.

L. c. 123B, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The statute establishes a bureau of transitional planning (BTP) and a transitional advisory committee (TAC). G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 12B. The BTP makes a preliminary determination as to which agency is to develop an ITP. G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 12C. If the TAC approves that determination, the designated agency develops an ITP in cooperation with BTP, the disabled individual, and the disabled individual\u2019s parent or guardian, if the disabled individual does not object. <em>Ibid. </em>Once an agency develops an ITP, it must be approved by the TAC before it may be put in effect. <em>Ibid. </em>All of these steps are intended to occur before the individual turns twenty-two. See <em>ibid. </em>The ITP is to specify \u201cthe habilitative services [which encompass all services \u2018directed toward the alleviation of limitations on major life activities of a disabled person, including .. . residential care,\u2019 G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 12A, inserted by St. 1983, c. 688, \u00a7 1] found ... to be necessary . . . ; the location in the least restrictive environment at which such services will be provided; and the expected duration for the provision of such services.\u201d G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 12C, inserted by St. 1983, c. 688, \u00a7 1. The statute\u2019s sole form of recourse for guardians who contest the DMR\u2019s proposed habilitative services is an administrative appeal of the ITP. See <em>ibid.; </em>101 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The disabled individual\u2019s ITP governs the provision and location of her adult services, G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 12C, until the relevant agency (here, indisputably, the DMR) shall \u201chave developed an individualized service plan [ISP] for the disabled person as specified on the ITP, and the services listed on the ITP are being provided.\u201d 101 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.06. The relevant agency has twelve months after an individual receiving residential support has turned twenty-two to develop such an ISP if the individual has an ITP which \u201ccalls for the individual\u2019s transition to another residential situation.\u201d 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.20(4)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The DMR\u2019s position, that the Legislature did not intend the transfer statute to override or be grafted onto the elaborate administrative process it created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>for all disabled individuals in the turning twenty-two statute, is supported by the provision of the transfer statute requiring the DMR to initiate an adjudicatory administrative process \u201c[i]f the individual service plan developed for the mentally retarded person by the department pursuant to its regulations cannot be fully implemented as a result of the guardian\u2019s objection to a proposed transfer [from one residential facility to another] . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, inserted by St. 1986, c. 599, \u00a7 39. That language demonstrates \u2014 or at least the DMR (and the judge) could rationally so construe it \u2014 that the Legislature presupposed that an ISP would be in place before an individual becomes eligible for the transfer statute\u2019s procedural protections. The transfer statute thus applies only to those individuals who have already completed the transition to the DMR and from an ITP to an ISP, are receiving adult services through the DMR under an ISP, and are being subsequently transferred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\">As authority for their argument, the parents rely on two decisions, Grady vs. Campbell, Bristol Superior Court, No. 9401163 (Aug. 31, 1994) <em>(Grady I), </em>and Grady vs. Campbell, Bristol Superior Court, No. 9401163 (May 24, 1995) <em>(Grady II), </em>a Superior Court case with what they deem strikingly similar circumstances. In that case, three individuals aged out of special education upon turning twenty-two, and their guardians, objecting to the DMR\u2019s suggested transfers of the individuals, sought an order from the court that the DMR hold an adjudicatory hearing under the transfer statute before transferring them. After one judge granted the guardians a preliminary injunction <em>(Grady I), </em>another judge allowed the guardians\u2019 summary judgment motion on the ground that the transfer statute did apply <em>(Grady II). </em>The case is, however, distinguishable from Molly\u2019s (in addition to being not binding on this court). As noted in <em>Grady II, </em>the DMR had at least two years during which it could have developed an ISP for the individuals but did not do so, and the individuals had been receiving \u201ctemporary\u201d funding from the DMR for well over a year following their twenty-second birthdays. More importantly, the court in <em>Grady II </em>did not address the issue of harmonizing the transfer statute with the turning twenty-two statute. We do not find the case analysis in <em>Grady I </em>or <em>Grady II </em>either relevant or persuasive in resolving the instant matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Although judicial deference to administrative \u201cexperience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge\u201d is explicitly enjoined only by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3, which is not here involved, \u201c[t]he fundamental premise of the administrative agency, and indeed the principal reason for the enormous growth of administrative agency power in the twentieth century, has been the conviction that the administrative agency, by virtue of its acquisition or [szc] expertise, is better able to make intelligent, effective, and continuing decisions in the public interest in its areas of delegated responsibility than either the legislature or the judiciary. . . . Increasingly courts expressed a willingness to defer to administrative expertise, to permit administrative agencies to make their unique contribution to the administrative process, and generally, not to interfere with the technical, specialized decisions reached by administrative agency experts.\u201d Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 1639 (1986). See <em>Matter of McKnight, </em>406 Mass. 787, 807 (1990) (\u201cThe tradition of judicial deference to agency decision making represents an important social policy decision that public agencies are generally in a better position than courts to make particular technical decisions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-20\">Reliance on agency expertise is built into the turning twenty-two statute by the regulations promulgated thereunder, which provide as the sole form of recourse for guardians who contest the DMR\u2019s proposed habilitative services (including transfers under an ITP) an administrative appeal to the Secretary of the EOHHS (or his designee), whose decision thereon \u201cshall be final.\u201d 101 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.03.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The parents\u2019 theory would effectively tie the DMR to service choices made for mentally retarded special education recipients by local school districts operating under quite different and more liberal financial standards than the DMR, namely, to provide special education children with a specified level of programs and services regardless of cost. See G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 2, inserted by St. 1991, c. 138, \u00a7 138 (the school \u201cshall ensure that all efforts have been made to meet such child\u2019s needs\u201d).

We cannot, however, conclude that the judge committed an abuse of discretion, <em>id. </em>at 312, by failing to have exercised his discretion in this respect, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 923 (1999), and cases cited, because neither party made a <em>Lanigan </em>challenge to the other\u2019s expert evidence. See <em>Cortes-Irizarry </em>v. <em>Corporacion Insular de Seguros, </em>111 F.3d 184, 188-189 (1st Cir. 1997). Had one been made by the parents, it might have succeeded, not so much by reason of the DMR\u2019s experts\u2019 lack of qualifications, but rather because their evidence largely failed to satisfy the requirements of Mass.R. Civ.P. 56(e), 365 Mass. 825 (1974), consisting mostly of conclusory opinions not based on admissible facts of personal knowledge (e.g., they based most of their opinions on extremely brief observations and on hearsay records and statements of third persons at Crotched Mountain, whereas the parents\u2019 principal experts testified to specific facts based on their first-hand knowledge gleaned from many years of personally treating and observing Molly). The very phenomenon that rival experts present conflicting views on summary judgment motions strongly implies that disputed issues of fact exist. See, e.g., <em>Wyler Summit Partnership </em>v. <em>Turner Bdcst. Sys., Inc., </em>235 F.3d 1184, 1192 (9th Cir. 2000) (\u201cWeighing the credibility of conflicting expert testimony is the province of the jury\u201d); <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>Simonds Indus, Inc., </em>337 F.

See generally Brunet, The Use and Misuse of Expert Testimony in Summary Judgment, 22 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 93 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The parents make a number of entirely conclusory legal assertions, including the contentions that the revised ITP was defective and a nullity (see note 26, <em>infra); </em>that the DMR\u2019s failure to act within thirty days of the parents\u2019 appeal vitiated the revised ITP entirely; that the DMR must be deemed to be the EOHHS Secretary\u2019s designee for purposes of ruling on ITP appeals under 101 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.03; and that there being no ITP in place when Molly turned twenty-two, she was entitled to an ISP as of that date and to the procedural protections against transfer afforded by G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\">See G. L. c. 7IB, \u00a7 12C. The requisite location is listed as Molly\u2019s family home in Bedford; the expected duration is stated to be \u201cuntil an appropriate residential placement can be developed\u201d; the rehabilitative services deemed appropriate by the DMR\u2019s transitional advisory committee are set forth at length; and the DMR is incontestably the agency responsible for the provision of such services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\">As the judge accurately observed, \u201cThe cost of services is a legitimate concern for the [DMR], . . . Unlike the Chapter 766 \u2018unfunded mandate\u2019 model under which the cost of Molly\u2019s Crotched Mountain placement was funded until age 22, DMR programming is subject to appropriation [by G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 12C]; the [DMR] must . . . serve the Commonwealth\u2019s [entire] developmentally disabled adult population with such resources as the Legislature provides.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\">In count III, the parents continued to protest the failure of the DMR (which they assume is the designee of the EOHHS Secretary for appeal purposes) formally to respond to their June, 2005, appeal of the revised ITP, by \u201ceither affirming or modifying the ITP\u201d within thirty days of their appeal, as provided in 101 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.03. They have not, however, demanded any specific relief with respect to that procedural failure. This is presumably because of their legally unsupported theory that the revised ITP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>was defective and the DMR\u2019s failure to \u201ccorrect\u201d its perceived deficiencies within thirty days extinguished that ITP, so that no ITP was in place when Molly turned twenty-two, and Molly was consequently entitled to the procedural protections accorded those who have an ISP.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">We agree with the DMR that any delay in responding to the parents\u2019 administrative appeal did not invalidate, per se, the ITP. See, e.g., <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of N. Attleborough, </em>353 Mass. 671, 679-680 (1968). Contrast, e.g., <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 609-610 (1983). We also agree with the DMR that such a regulatory violation should be deemed harmless error in any event, because the DMR\u2019s continued negotiations with the parents over Molly\u2019s placement clearly manifested to them the DMR\u2019s position as to the legality and propriety of proceeding in Molly\u2019s case under the revised ITP, which effectively constituted an affirmance of the ITP and represented a final decision (under the parents\u2019 view that the DMR was the EOHHS designee) that thereby terminated all administrative appeal proceedings under the regulation. That turn of events appeared to leave the parents with only resort to judicial relief to challenge the DMR placement proposals. That is precisely what they did in commencing the underlying litigation shortly after the expiration of the thirty-day decision-making period under the ITP appeal regulation; and it essentially represented the very action they would have had to take in an effort to obtain further relief had the DMR (or the EOHHS Secretary) timely responded to their administrative appeal of the revised ITP with an affirmance. (But see note 15, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Nevertheless, we agree with the parents that they were entitled \u2014 if only as a matter of efficient, public service oriented administrative process in this uncertain and emotionally charged situation \u2014 to a timely and more explicit explanation from the DM\u00dcR in justification of its revised ITP. Such a procedurally proper handling of the parents\u2019 objections conceivably could have yielded more cooperative interchanges and obviated judicial proceedings, or at least minimized the contested issues between the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
