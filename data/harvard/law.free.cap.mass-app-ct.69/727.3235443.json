Fappiano, 57 Mass. App. Ct. 1105 (2003).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">On November 16, 2005, Fappiano filed a motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence, to wit, that she was suffering from battered woman syndrome at the time of the trial, which condition rendered her incompetent to participate in her defense and which, if known at the time of trial, would have been a real factor in the deliberations of the jury. The denial of that motion forms the basis of this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>According to Fappiano\u2019s affidavit submitted in support of the motion for a new trial, prior to Alberto Torres, she had had romantic relationships with three other men: Robert Gosselin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Jeffrey Columbus,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Clyde Harper, Sr.,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> each of which included instances of physical, mental, and sexual abuse. Fappiano met Alberto Torres through Harper, when Torres and Harper were inmates together at the Hampden County house of correction. After Torres was released, he began living with Fappiano and her three children and began physically abusing Fappiano \u201calmost immediately.\u201d Torres and Fappiano both hit the children. Torres hit Shy-la on the leg with a belt, tied Jeffrey up with a telephone extension cord, and knocked Jeffrey off the kitchen chair where he was doing homework. Fappiano\u2019s affidavit states that on the day Clyde died, Torres slapped Clyde and stood with his foot on Clyde\u2019s back.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\u201cWhether an appeal is from the granting or the denial of a motion for a new trial, an appellate court will examine the motion judge\u2019s conclusion only to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986). \u201c \u2018The decision of the motion judge is entitled to special deference if that judge also was the trial judge [as is the case here].\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>422 Mass. 72, 77 (1996).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buck, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 760, 762 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In her motion, Fappiano claimed that she was entitled to a new trial because of newly discovered evidence, specifically, a long history of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse she endured which resulted in her suffering from battered woman syndrome.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>431 Mass. 212, 221 (2000), which was decided after Fappiano\u2019s trial, the Supreme Judicial Court discussed the relationship between a claim of battered woman syndrome and newly discovered evidence. In describing the syndrome, the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">\u201cBattered woman syndrome has been described as a \u2018 \u201cseries of common characteristics that appear in women who are abused physically and psychologically over an extended period of time by the dominant male figure in their lives.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>97 N.J. 178, 198 (1984). \u201cAmong the characteristics of such abused women are a decrease in self-esteem, an emotional dependence upon the dominant male and [a] type of psychological \u2018learned\u2019 helplessness arising out of an inability to predict or control the violence directed against them. Numbed by a dread of imminent aggression, these women are unable to think clearly about the means of escape from this abusive family existence; and this emotional paralysis is often reinforced by their traditional beliefs about the sanctity of home and family and their false hopes that things will improve.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>128 Misc. 2d 129, 132 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1985).\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 63, 66 (1987).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">In <em>Pike, </em>the defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree arising out of a plot, with her boyfriend, to break into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>the home of the victim, wait for him to arrive home, Mil him, and steal his car. <em>Id. </em>at 213. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, claiming she suffered from battered woman syndrome, which was newly discovered evidence because the syndrome prevented her from disclosing this evidence to her attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The court recognized the potential viability of such a claim, reasoning \u201cthat a common characteristic of battered women is a \u2018learned helplessness,\u2019 which manifests itself in an inability of the woman to perceive herself as abused, or to gain help by communicating the abuse to others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conaghan, </em>433 Mass. 105, 109-110 (2000) (divided court held that defendant, who had filed motion for new trial claiming she was incompetent due to battered woman syndrome when she tendered her plea to manslaughter four years earlier, was entitled to competency evaluation, pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15[a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">As she had \u201cthe inability to perceive herself as abused and to communicate the abuse to others,\u201d Fappiano argues that she was unable to disclose her past abuse to her attorney before trial and, consequently, was unable to assist counsel \u201cin preparing a defense that served her best interests.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Con-aghan, supra </em>at 109, quoting from <em>McMaugh </em>v. <em>State, </em>612 A.2d 725, 732 (R.I. 1992). In a supporting affidavit, her trial counsel stated that he had difficulty obtaining information from Fappi-ano because of her emotional state, and that she had significant gaps in her memory. He further stated that her inability to communicate precluded him from being aware that she was suffering from battered woman syndrome and, consequently, he did not defend her on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The judge rejected Fappiano\u2019s argument, noting that prior to trial Fappiano was examined on two separate occasions by two different court-appointed experts and in both instances was found to be competent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further, the judge, in denying Fappiano\u2019s motion, indicated that \u201cmy own observations of the defendant during her trial satisfied me that she was fully competent. She consulted [with] her trial attorney as various witnesses testified to matters critical to the issue of her culpability. Counsel consulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>with her just before he would conclude the examination of each witness and oftentimes the consultation would be followed by counsel asking several more questions of the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">While the judge\u2019s rejection of Fappiano\u2019s competency argument may be viewed as an implicit rejection of her contention that she suffered from battered woman syndrome,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we need not reach that issue, as we determine that any such evidence was not newly discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">\u201cA defendant seeking a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence must establish both that the evidence is newly discovered and that it casts real doubt on the justice of the conviction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>431 Mass. at 218. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001) (\u201cThe trial judge upon motion in writing may grant a new trial at any time if it appears that justice may not have been done\u201d). \u201c[T]he allegedly new evidence . . . must . . . <em>have been unknown to the defendant or his counsel and not reasonably discoverable by them at the time of trial </em>.... The defendant has the burden of proving that reasonable pretrial diligence would not have uncovered the evidence.\u201d (Emphasis original.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>446 Mass. 785, 798-799 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Fappiano has failed to \u201cestablish that the evidence was unknown to the defendant or trial counsel and not reasonably discoverable at the time of trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shuman, </em>445 Mass. 268, 271 (2005). She and her attorney were aware, prior to trial, of several instances of abuse involving Torres. In statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>given to the police shortly after the incident, Fappiano disclosed that Torres physically harmed her when she \u201cscared him once in the shower,\u201d and he hit her head against the wall on another occasion; Torres mainly subjected her to emotional abuse; and on the day of the incident she \u201cwanted to call 911\u201d but was afraid that Torres would hit her. These statements were admitted during the trial. In addition, at sentencing, counsel argued that Fappiano\u2019s \u201cchoice of <em>men </em>was poor, and that\u2019s putting it mildly\u201d; that she was \u201cweak because she doesn\u2019t have great self-esteem, and <em>men </em>she chose were not <em>men </em>who in any way were going to do positive things for them, their children or for Miss Fappiano\u201d (emphasis added). Counsel\u2019s choice of words at sentencing appear to indicate a wider knowledge of Fappiano\u2019s abuse history than was disclosed during the trial itself.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>431 Mass. at 217, 220 n.7 (defendant disclosed abuse for first time at motion for new trial, although she asked defense counsel prior to trial whether evidence of abuse \u201cwould make a difference in her case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Although the trial predated the <em>Pike </em>and <em>Conaghan </em>decisions, the significance of Fappiano\u2019s abuse history and the potential applicability of battered woman syndrome to this defendant were well known at the time.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lazarovich, </em>410 Mass. 466, 473-474 (1991), released seven years prior to Fappiano\u2019s trial, the Supreme Judicial Court assumed, without deciding, that evidence of battered woman syndrome may be relevant in prosecution for abuse by a mother of her child. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 23F, inserted by St. 1996, c. 450, \u00a7 248 (admissibility of past physical, sexual, or psychological abuse of defendant). Thus, at the time of trial, not only was there knowledge of the existence of abuse, but further evidence was \u201creasonably discoverable.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>446 Mass. at 798, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. at 306. Fappiano has failed to establish, as was her burden, \u201cthat reasonable pretrial diligence would not have uncovered the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>As <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>431 Mass. at 222, counsels, \u201cin appropriate cases, evidence of battered woman syndrome may constitute \u2018newly discovered\u2019 evidence, even though the condition may have existed prior to, or at the time of, trial.\u201d This is not such a case. The order denying the motion for a new trial is affirmed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-14\">Her live-in boyfriend, Alberto Torres, was also charged and, in a separate trial, convicted of numerous crimes, the most serious of which was murder in the first degree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>442 Mass. 554 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\">She was also convicted of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (belt) on Clyde Harper, Jr., G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A(b); two counts of wantonly or recklessly permitting another to commit an assault and battery on Clyde, causing bodily injury, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J; two counts of wantonly or recklessly permitting another to commit an assault and battery on her daughter Shy-la Harper, causing bodily injury, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J; wantonly or recklessly permitting another to commit an assault and battery on Jeffrey Columbus, causing bodily injury, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J; assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (belt) on Jeffrey, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A(b); assault and battery on Jeffrey, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A; and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (belt or woman\u2019s sandal) on Shy-la, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The facts pertaining to the abuse, as described in this court\u2019s memorandum and order pursuant to rule 1:28, are, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201c[T]he postmortem medical examination performed on Clyde revealed numerous recent as well as old injuries all over his body. . . . The injuries included lacerations, abrasions, pinch marks, whip-type marks, bruises, a broken femur and blunt force trauma to the abdomen [the cause of his death], . . . The Commonwealth also presented evidence, by way of eyewitness testimony and admissions, of Fappiano\u2019s persistent use of physical force on Clyde and her other young children as a method of disciplining them. The evidence indicates that, at various times prior to Clyde\u2019s death, she vigorously inflicted such discipline on her children with open-handed blows, by kicking, by striking them with her own belt, and by beating them with her shoe, all with sufficient exertion to leave visible marks on their bodies. . . . Indeed, there were pattern injuries on Clyde\u2019s body that matched the buckle of the belt identified at trial as the one Fappiano used to administer her discipline.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\">She also appeals from the denial of her motion for funds to hire an expert in forensic psychology and domestic violence. That motion improperly referenced G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27A-27G, rather than the appropriate mechanism provided by Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(c)(5), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1502 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>410 Mass. 680, 683-684 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swist, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 886 (1995). This misnomer resulted in the matter being incorrectly entered as an appeal to a single justice of the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D. The single justice ultimately reported the matter to a panel. The report, in these circumstances, was unnecessary. As the order denying the request for funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>was, in effect, an interlocutory order ancillary to the motion for a new trial, the defendant may appropriately challenge the order in the context of the appeal from the order denying the motion for a new trial. See <em>Celester </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>440 Mass. 1035, 1036 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b755-10\">In 1988, Fappiano met Robert Gosselin, with whom she had a son Christopher, and remained with him until 1990. After Gosselin punched her in the face, Fappiano obtained the first of several restraining orders against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b755-11\">In 1990, Fappiano began a relationship with Jeffrey Columbus, who raped her when she was pregnant with their son, also named Jeffrey, causing her to obtain a restraining order. She later agreed to marry Columbus, believing that it would be better for her and the baby, but he was \u201cvery rough\u201d towards the baby and did things such as \u201cgrab [Fappiano\u2019s] throat and put [her] in headlocks,\u201d and was verbally abusive towards both her and the baby. Fappiano became so frightened that she reported Columbus to a social worker, who had Fappiano placed in a women\u2019s shelter. After her eligibility in the shelter expired, she returned to live with Columbus, who continued to rape and verbally abuse her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b755-12\">After being placed in a homeless shelter, Fappiano moved in with Clyde Harper, Sr., with whom she began a relationship and became pregnant with their daughter Shy-la. During this time, Fappiano sought a divorce from Columbus and obtained another restraining order against him, which he violated, causing him to be sent to jail. Harper continually raped and physically beat Fappiano when they lived together, causing her to go to the hospital on multiple occasions for serious injuries. He was sentenced to jail for assaulting her, at which time she ended their relationship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\">We note that, to date, Fappiano has not been specifically diagnosed with battered woman syndrome by a licensed professional. Her denied motion for funds to retain an expert in forensic psychology and domestic violence was for that purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\">One of the designated forensic psychologists authored his report on June 19, 1997, and the other wrote his report on September 3, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\">While we do not reach the issue, it is difficult to reconcile the concept of \u201clearned helplessness,\u201d as it is currently defined in our case law, with the defendant\u2019s history of seeking help, yet repeatedly returning to abusive relationships. See notes 5, 6, and 7, <em>supra. </em>As psychiatric and psychological studies further examine battered woman syndrome, more light will undoubtedly be shed in this area, which may require, in the future, the law to conform with new medical findings and realities. It is conceivable that such findings could amplify upon the notion of \u201clearned helplessness,\u201d holding, for example, that the symptoms we today attribute to battered woman syndrome do not adequately and fully explain it. See Robinson, The Glue that Binds: Deconstruction of Walker\u2019s Battered Woman Syndrome, Domestic Violence Report (February/March 2000), reprinted in 2 Zorza, Violence Against Women 8-1 (2004). See also Dalton &amp; Schneider, Battered Women and the Law 224-225 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b759-6\">We note that in 1994, Fappiano was referred by a therapist at the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children to a psychologist whose report of October 28, 1994, outlined in detail her history and the past abuses she had suffered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\">In his affidavit, trial counsel indicates that \u201c[i]t was very difficult to obtain information from Ms. Fappiano as a result of her emotional state . . . [and that as] a result of her inability to communicate with me, I was not aware that she was suffering from Battered Woman\u2019s Syndrome.\u201d The judge need not have credited this given her own observations, as well as the competency evaluation of one of the designated forensic psychologists, see note 9, <em>supra </em>(\u201c[Ms. Fappiano] demonstrated a good grasp of the nature of her discussions with her attorney. She expressed confidence in his ability and commitment to her defense, and acknowledged that she has no difficulty understanding his advice and concerns [he] raises. Also, when asked about her own reasoning with regard to her defense, she demonstrated adequate judgment and decision-making ability\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Appellate counsel is not claiming that trial counsel was ineffective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\">As we conclude that the motion for a new trial was appropriately denied on the ground that the evidence submitted in support of it was not newly discovered, we cannot say that the judge abused her discretion when she concluded that the proposed expenditure of funds was unlikely to result in a meritorious ground for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
