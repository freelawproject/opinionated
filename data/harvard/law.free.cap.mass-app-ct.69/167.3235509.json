We discern no error in the determination that Pil\u00f3n suffered but a single injury. The board erred, however, in ordering the Insolvency Fund to reimburse Pil\u00f3n for the benefit of the successor insurer, because G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 1(2), prohibits the Insolvency Fund from making payments that benefit an insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">1. <em>Pilon\u2019s employment and injury. </em>There is no dispute that on June 3, 1998, while employed by R.S. Guerette Corporation (Guerette), Pil\u00f3n sustained carpal tunnel injury and nerve damage to his arms and hands due to constant use of vibrating demolition equipment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of Pilon\u2019s injury, Guerette was insured by Credit General Insurance Company (Credit General).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">On November 1, 1998, Pil\u00f3n began employment at Specialty Contracting Services, Inc. (Specialty). In the course of that employment, he again experienced pain and numbness in his elbows, wrists, and hands. Although one-half of Pilon\u2019s work at Specialty was in the office, he still used vibrating demolition equipment. In July, 1999, the pain made a \u201csudden recurrence\u201d and worsened to a point that on December 28, 2000, Pil\u00f3n could no longer write or drive. He had severe pain and some numbness in areas around his right elbow, hand, and the web area between his right thumb and index finger. He had similar, though less severe, pain on the left side. Pil\u00f3n ceased working for Specialty on December 28, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">At that time, AIM Mutual Insurance Company (AIM) was Specialty\u2019s insurer. From the beginning of Pilon\u2019s employment with Specialty until November 13, 2000, when AIM became Specialty\u2019s insurer, Specialty did not have workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Consequently, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund (Trust Fund)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was liable for any compensable injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Pil\u00f3n during the period that Specialty was uninsured. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">2. <em>Pil\u00f3n\u2019s claims and the insurer liable for his injury. </em>Where an employee suffers two or more compensable injuries that are causally related to a resulting incapacity, only one insurer is chargeable for the payment of compensation for the same disability. The successive insurer rule provides that the insurer covering the risk at the time of the most recent injury that bears causal relation to the disability claimed must pay the entire compensation. See <em>Fitzpatrick\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 298, 300 (1954); <em>Casey\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 572, 574 (1965); <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 592 (1982). The subsequent injury need not be a significant contributing cause to the incapacity. So long as it is to the \u201cslightest extent\u201d a contributing cause, the insurer at the time of the recent injury will be held liable to cover the entire incapacity. See <em>Rock\u2019s Case, </em>323 Mass. 428, 429 (1948). The determination whether there was a subsequent injury and whether it had causal connection to the ensuing incapacity is essentially a question of fact, <em>Costa\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass. 286, 288 (1955); see also <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 594, on which expert medical opinion is required. See <em>Casey\u2019s Case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The Insolvency Fund maintains that the administrative judge erred in finding that Pil\u00f3n\u2019s compensable incapacity was due only to the injury sustained on June 3, 1998, a determination that was upheld summarily by the board. Neither the board nor the administrative judge erred. Findings of fact, assessments of credibility, and determinations of the weight to be given the evidence are the exclusive function of the administrative judge. See <em>Chapman\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 705, 707 (1947). We will not disturb the judge\u2019s findings that are \u201creasonably deduced from the evidence and the rational inferences of which it was susceptible.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>On the evidence before him, the administrative judge did not err in concluding that Pil\u00f3n sustained but a single compensable injury, which occurred on June 3, 1998, when he was employed by Guerette, and that Pil\u00f3n\u2019s subsequent complaints were but a continuing manifestation of his original injury. Nor did the board err in summarily affirming that determination. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2); <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 257-258 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The evidence, including the medical notes and reports, did not compel the administrative judge, as matter of law, to find a new injury that was a contributing cause to Pil\u00f3n\u2019s ensuing incapacity. See <em>Chapman\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. at 707; <em>Costa\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass. at 288. Rather, the administrative judge could reasonably infer that the evidence merely demonstrated periodic recurrences of vibration-induced upper extremity problems caused by the June, 1998, injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The closest a medical expert came to describing a new injury was a 2001 progress note of Dr. Daniel Gottlieb which stated that Pil\u00f3n\u2019s \u201carm problems are work related either by causation or exacerbation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Doctor Gottlieb\u2019s note left open the possibility that work-related activity after 1998 may have only provided the occasion for the reappearance of symptoms rather than caused a new injury. See <em>Rock\u2019s Case, </em>323 Mass. at 429-430. The administrative judge was at liberty to accept or reject Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s opinion. See <em>Sutherland\u2019s Case, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 58, 61 (1974). Indeed, he adopted the report of Dr. Hillel Skoff, the impartial examiner required under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A. Doctor Skoff was the only medical expert who identified a time period for the cause of the incapacity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Based on his examination of Pi-Ion in 2002 and his review of several years\u2019 worth of medical records, Dr. Skoff concluded that the work performed during Pil\u00f3n\u2019s employment with Guerette was the cause of the disability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the administrative judge was warranted in finding that Pil\u00f3n sustained a single compensable injury while employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>by Guerette and that the successive insurer rule did not apply. The Insolvency Fund, which stood in the shoes of Guerette\u2019s insolvent insurer, was liable to pay benefits for Pil\u00f3n\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">3. <em>The reimbursement order. </em>Pil\u00f3n made an initial claim for benefits on June 13, 2001, alleging that he was injured while employed by Specialty during the period that Specialty was insured by AIM. He then filed a second claim for benefits on August 1, 2001, alleging an earlier work-related injury while employed by Guerette. Prior to final resolution of Pil\u00f3n\u2019s claim for benefits and a determination of the employer and insurer responsible, an administrative judge issued a conference order that required AIM to pay temporary total and temporary partial incapacity benefits to Pil\u00f3n. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subsequent to that conference order, the Insolvency Fund and the Trust Fund were added as parties, and Pil\u00f3n\u2019s separate claims for benefits were consolidated for hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As discussed previously, the administrative judge found the Insolvency Fund (standing in the shoes of Credit General as insurer of Guerette) responsible for payment of Pil\u00f3n\u2019s benefits. In connection with that finding, the administrative judge ordered the Insolvency Fund to reimburse AIM for the payments that AIM had made to Pil\u00f3n pursuant to the earlier conference order. The board affirmed the order of reimbursement with one adjustment: the Insolvency Fund would send the payment directly to Pil\u00f3n, who would then reimburse AIM.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">AIM argues that it should be reimbursed for temporary incapacity benefits that it paid to Pil\u00f3n because it appealed the conference order and the obligation was found ultimately to be that of Pil\u00f3n\u2019s prior employer, Guerette, and not of AIM. A prohibition on its reimbursement, AIM argues, would give final effect to that informal conference order and run contrary to the structure of the workers\u2019 compensation system, which is to provide an informal and expedited mechanism for the award of benefits. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A; 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.10 et seq. (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The question, however, is not whether AIM has a right of reimbursement against Credit General, Guerette\u2019s insurer, which it undoubtedly would were Credit General still solvent, but whether the Insolvency Fund must make good on that reimbursement. We agree with the Insolvency Fund that the order to reimburse AIM is an error of law, as it expressly contravenes G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 1(2). Whatever force AIM\u2019s argument may have as a matter of policy, the Legislature has decided otherwise and imposed a prohibition that neither the Department of Industrial Accidents nor this court may ignore.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The Insolvency Fund is not an insurer. See <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>412 Mass. 774, 776 (1992). Rather, it is a statutorily mandated nonprofit association created to provide limited protection to insureds and claimants in the event of insolvency of an insurer. See <em>ibid.; </em>G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 5. The statutory benefits provided by the Insolvency Fund are not to be extended beyond those expressly provided for in G. L. c. 175D. See <em>Ferrari </em>v. <em>Toto, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 483, 486 (1980), <em>S.C., </em>383 Mass. 36 (1981). The statutory limitation on the Insolvency Fund\u2019s obligation minimizes the financial burden on the insurance-buying public and conserves the Insolvency Fund\u2019s limited resources. \u201cThe [Insolvency] Fund\u2019s obligations and expenses are assessed to a broad range of insurers . . . [who] recoup the amounts which they pay into the Insolvency Fund by increasing their rates and premiums.\u201d <em>Clark Equip. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>423 Mass. 165, 167 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Subject to the limitations of G. L. c. 175D, the Insolvency Fund is obligated to pay \u201ccovered claims\u201d against an insolvent insurer. See G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 5(1)(a); <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Ladd, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 553, 555 (1995). All other claims not provided for in G. L. c. 175D must be denied. See G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 5(1 <em>)(d). </em>An express exclusion from the definition of \u201ccovered claim,\u201d and hence from the obligation of the Insolvency Fund, is any amount for \u201cthe benefit\u201d of an insurer. See G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 1(2); <em>Ferrari </em>v. <em>Toto, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 486. In consequence, the Insolvency Fund is precluded from reimbursing AIM, an insurer, for temporary incapacity benefits AIM paid to Pil\u00f3n.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>What the statute directly prohibits may not be circumvented by indirection. The statutory proscription against payments for the benefit of an insurer likewise prohibits the Insolvency Fund from reimbursing AIM by passing that payment through the employee.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Where Pil\u00f3n is the conduit of payment, the ultimate beneficiary is still an insurer in contravention of the statute. See <em>Ferrari </em>v. <em>Toto, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. at 486-487 (\u201cthe [Insolvency] Fund is excused from paying claims if the ultimate beneficiary is an insurance company . . . [as] the design of the [Insolvency] Fund [is] to indemnify injured persons, but not the insurance industry\u201d). Contrast <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund </em>v. <em>Ladd, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. at 557 (Insolvency Fund obligated to pay insured driver for unpaid claim despite payments from other sources because \u201c[n]ot one cent\u201d would go to other insurers). Such an indirect payment to AIM clearly thwarts the purpose of the Insolvency Fund, which is to indemnify injured persons and policyholders, not solvent insurers. See <em>Dufresne\u2019s Case, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 88-89 (2001). See also <em>McGuirl </em>v. <em>Anjou Intl. Co., </em>713 A.2d 194, 199 (R.I. 1998) (insolvency fund not obligated to reimburse insurer directly or indirectly).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We reverse that portion of the board\u2019s decision requiring the Insolvency Fund to reimburse AIM or Pil\u00f3n for temporary incapacity benefits. In all other respects, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Although Pil\u00f3n reported feeling pain as early as his second week at Guerette, he reported an injury on June 3, 1998, when the pain intensified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\">When Credit General later became insolvent, the Insolvency Fund stepped in its place to respond to Pilon\u2019s claim pursuant to G.

Viewed in these terms, the issue is not what caused a subsequent injury but whether there was a new injury at all. The administrative judge found little expert medical opinion to support a causal connection between Pil\u00f3n\u2019s disability and a new injury, and his finding of a single injury is not plainly wrong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Neither party chose to cross-examine Dr. Skoff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Both AIM and Pil\u00f3n appealed the conference order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">PiIon filed a third claim for benefits, alleging that he sustained an injury on or before November 12, 2000, while employed by Specialty and prior to Specialty being insured by AIM.

See G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 1(2); <em>Ferrari </em>v. <em>Toto, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. at 486.
