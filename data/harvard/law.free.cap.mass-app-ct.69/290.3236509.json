Ariel, brought an action against the defendants, the town of Kingston (town) and Brooks P. and Maria Steffy,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking damages for injuries the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>suffered as a result of a collision between her car and a car driven by Brooks P. Steffy. The plaintiff claims that two members of the Kingston police department were negligently directing traffic and that this negligence contributed to the collision. The town filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), on the ground that it was immune from suit and from liability pursuant to G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(A) and <em>(j).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> A </em>judge denied the town\u2019s motion to dismiss because she determined that one of the two grounds for immunity did not apply to the facts of this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><em>Facts. </em>The facts set forth in the complaint are as follows. On January 14, 2004, the plaintiff was a passenger in a vehicle driven by her daughter, Michelle Ariel. Michelle Ariel was traveling southbound on Cranberry Road in Kingston toward the intersection of Smith Lane and the Route 3 exit ramp. There were several damaged vehicles and emergency personnel already in the Smith Lane intersection because of an accident that had occurred earlier. Two members of the Kingston police department, Officers Robert J. Santos and James Sauer, were in the intersection directing traffic. When Michelle Ariel arrived at the intersection, she had a green traffic signal, so she proceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>through the intersection. In the intersection, Michelle Ariel\u2019s vehicle was hit on the driver side by a car driven by Brooks P. Steffy. The plaintiff claims that the accident was caused in part by Officers Santos and Sauer, who \u201cnegligently directed traffic at the intersection.\u201d The plaintiff further alleges that one of the officers \u201cwas affirmatively negligent by waving a motorist through a red light,\u201d and that both officers were acting within the scope of their employment at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 258, the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, sets forth the procedures for bringing claims against the Commonwealth, its municipalities, counties, and districts, and the employees of these entities (collectively the Commonwealth).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A statutory public duty rule was added to G. L. c. 258 by St. 1993, c. 495, \u00a7 57, and provides immunity to the Commonwealth from, among other things, claims based on the \u201cfailure to provide adequate police protection, prevent the commission of crimes ... or enforce any law,\u201d unless \u201cexplicit and specific assurances of safety or assistance, beyond general representations,\u201d are made and \u201cinjury result[s] in part from reliance upon those assurances,\u201d G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(A), (/)(l).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In ruling on the town\u2019s motion to dismiss, the motion judge considered the town\u2019s arguments for immunity under \u00a7 10(A) and (/) separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The town contends that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is essentially that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>the police officers failed adequately to perform their duty to direct traffic and to provide police protection. Therefore, the town argues that it is immune from suit and liability pursuant to G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 <em>10(h). </em>We agree that police officers\u2019 direction of traffic on a public way constitutes a form of providing police protection to the public for the risks involved in motor vehicle traffic. The exception to immunity contained in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(/)(1), see note 2, <em>supra, </em>requires that \u201cexplicit\u201d and \u201cspecific\u201d assurances of safety, beyond general representations, be made by an officer. The phrase \u201cexplicit and specific assurances\u201d requires \u201ca spoken or written assurance, not one implied from the conduct of the parties or the situation,\u201d and the \u201cterms of the assurance must be definite, fixed, and free from ambiguity.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>422 Mass. 406, 410 (1996). See <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Grafton, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 715, 725, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1040 (1998) (\u201c[the] claim is within the \u00a7 <em>10[K\\ </em>exclusion for police protection activities. Accordingly, we are bound to consider only the specific limitations to this exclusion enumerated by the Legislature, i.e., those contained in \u00a7 10[/][ 1 ] . . .\u201d). Police officers directing traffic are generally, and specifically here, not making \u201cexplicit and specific assurances\u201d of safety to the operators of individual motor vehicles. We therefore determine, as did the motion judge, that the town is immune from suit and liability under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(/z), for any claim that the officers\u2019 alleged negligence in directing traffic was a failure to provide adequate police protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The motion judge did not conclude her analysis after determining that the town was immune from suit under \u00a7 10(h). Instead, she also considered the town\u2019s additional argument that it was immune from suit and liability pursuant to G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 <em>10(f), </em>because the town was not the \u201coriginal cause\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The town argues that the cause of the accident and, therefore, the injuries was the dangerous nature of the intersection and the conduct of both Michelle Ariel and Brooks P. Steffy. The motion judge determined, however, that the town ignored the exception contained in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 <em>10(f)(2). </em>This exception provides that the grant of immunity contained in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 <em>10(f), </em>does not apply to \u201cany claim based upon the intervention of a public employee which causes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the injury to the victim or places the victim in a worse position than he was in before the intervention . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(/)(2). The motion judge determined that the affirmative acts of the officers superseded the directions of the traffic light and that the officers\u2019 intervention exacerbated the situation, causing harm to the plaintiff. The motion judge concluded that because the officers\u2019 actions fit into the \u00a7 10(/)(2) exception to the immunity conferred by \u00a7 10(/), the plaintiff could prove a set of facts in support of her claim and therefore survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Dismissal of her claim against the town was, correspondingly, not appropriate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The judge\u2019s denial of the town\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis that the \u00a7 10(/)(2) exception applied to its alternative basis for immunity under \u00a7 10(/) was error. \u201cThe immunities provided by \u00a7 10 operate in the alternative; even if one immunity contains an exception that would permit a claim to be brought, that claim is barred if any of the other immunities apply.\u201d <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>428 Mass. 684, 697 (1999). Compare <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Grafton, supra. </em>The various subsections of \u00a7 10 enumerate independent bases for immunity from suit. An exception to the immunity provided by any particular subsection does not create an independent cause of action, but rather limits the immunity afforded by the subsection. Because each of the immunities contained in \u00a7 10 operates in the alternative, the judge\u2019s analysis should have stopped with her determination the town was immune from suit and liability under \u00a7 10(/z) and that the exception set forth in \u00a7 10(/)(1), to which reference is made in \u00a7 <em>10(h), </em>does not apply. The analysis under \u00a7 100\") and <em>(f)(2) </em>was superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The order denying the town\u2019s motion to dismiss is reversed, and a new order allowing the motion shall be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-14\">Defendants Brooks P.
