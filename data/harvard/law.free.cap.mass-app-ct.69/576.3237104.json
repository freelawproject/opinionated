L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>19(b), </em>and assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, occurring in New Bedford on April 11, 2004. On appeal he claims error (1) in the admission of the victim\u2019s prior recorded testimony; (2) in the admission of other hearsay testimony; and (3) by ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to preserve constitutional error. We reverse the convictions because the prior recorded testimony should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">1. <em>Background. </em>On April 11, 2004, the victim, Mario Perez, was beaten and robbed outside of a bar in New Bedford where ,he had been drinking and had become intoxicated. His brother, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Francisco Perez, was with Mario<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for some of the evening, prior to the assault and then shortly thereafter. Francisco also had been drinking. The evidence of the incident, and the defendant\u2019s arrest, need only be summarized. Mario was beaten and mugged by two men at about midnight. Mario\u2019s wallet and two necklaces were taken. Francisco heard what was happening to his brother and ran to help. He observed Mario lying on the ground, and Francisco, Mario, and a few of their friends then chased the two muggers as they ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The muggers ran to a multi-family dwelling, went inside, and locked the door behind them. Mario and Francisco stayed outside the house until the police arrived. The police, after brief activity irrelevant to this discussion, proceeded to a third-floor landing where they found the defendant and one Angel Marcial crouching against a wall.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant and Marcial were arrested, and a search revealed that Marcial had Mario\u2019s wallet in his pocket. When the police led the defendant and Marcial outside, Mario and Francisco recognized them as the two men who had beaten Mario. Mario ran up to one of the officers, pointed to the defendant and Marcial and stated, \u201cThat\u2019s the two guys.\u201d Mario did this without being asked anything by any police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">2. <em>The victim\u2019s unavailability for trial. </em>The mugging took place on April 11, 2004. Mario testified at a probable cause hearing on July 6, 2004, and, at that time, lived on Washburn Street in New Bedford. The defendant was arraigned on October 12, 2004. On June 8, 2005, twelve days prior to trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion in limine seeking to introduce Mario\u2019s testimony from the probable cause hearing, asserting his unavailability, and claiming the prior recorded testimony exception to the general hearsay prohibition. In support of its motion, the Commonwealth submitted factual assertions, legal authorities, an affidavit of State police Trooper Curtis West, and two affidavits of an assistant district attorney (ADA). Upon review of the submissions and hearing representations of counsel, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>judge ruled that the Commonwealth had satisfied its burden to show Mario\u2019s unavailability, essentially finding that the following efforts by the Commonwealth constituted a good faith and diligent search for him. We summarize the Commonwealth\u2019s efforts, accepting all factual assertions as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In early 2005, the Commonwealth requested assistance from the Massachusetts State police in locating Mario for purposes of testifying at the trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Trooper West obtained a photograph of Mario from the New Bedford police department and went to Mario\u2019s last known address (Washburn Street) on several occasions. Trooper West researched the registration of a sport utility vehicle with Rhode Island license plates, which he had noticed outside of the Washburn Street address \u201con more than one occasion.\u201d The vehicle was registered to Francisco, with an address on Weldon Street in Providence, Rhode Island. Trooper West went to the Weldon Street address \u201cseveral times,\u201d knocking on the door and obtaining no response. During one such attempt he could hear music playing inside the residence, but no one responded to the knock. Displaying Mario\u2019s photograph, he spoke with neighbors and a representative of the property\u2019s management company, but no one could recall having seen Mario at the Weldon Street address.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Trooper West learned, at some point, that Mario had two outstanding arrest warrants issued from the New Bedford Division of the District Court Department, both of which were outstanding as of June 7, 2005, the date of Trooper West\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">As Trooper West was searching for Mario, the Commonwealth mailed summonses and letters to Mario at the Washburn Street address, but those communications were returned with the message of \u201cnot known at this address.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commonwealth eventually located Francisco by tracking a case pending against him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>also in the New Bedford Division of the District Court Department. On the Wednesday before the defendant\u2019s trial, the Commonwealth succeeded in serving Francisco in hand with a summons when he appeared in court on his own case.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Francisco complied with the summons and appeared at the Bristol Superior Court in New Bedford on the morning of June 20, 2005, the defendant\u2019s scheduled trial date. It was not until that morning that the Commonwealth spoke with Francisco about the whereabouts of his brother, Mario. Francisco then explained that Mario had moved to New Jersey, but Francisco said he did not know where, and further stated that Mario telephones him occasionally from New Jersey, but that Mario does not have his own telephone number and uses a friend\u2019s telephone to call.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">After hearing from the parties, and reviewing the Commonwealth\u2019s submissions, the judge found that \u201cthe Commonwealth has met its burden of demonstrating a good faith and diligent effort to locate the complaining witness, Mario Perez,\u201d and ruled that Mario\u2019s probable cause hearing testimony was admissible at the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>Our review of a judge\u2019s decision to admit prior recorded testimony based on the unavailability<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of a witness is instructed by the standard set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberio, </em>440 Mass. 245, 249, 250 (2003). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>385 Mass. 733, 740-747 (1982). Before the Commonwealth is allowed to introduce prior recorded testimony of a missing witness, the Commonwealth must demonstrate a good faith effort to locate and produce the witness at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 263 (2005). When former testimony is sought to be offered against a criminal defendant, the degree of good faith and due diligence required is greater than in other situations. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, supra </em>at 745, citing McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 253, at 613 (2d ed. 1972). As indicated in <em>Bohannon, supra, </em>citing <em>Newton </em>v. <em>State, </em>403 P.2d 913 (Okla. Crim. App. 1965), due diligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>implies more than partial notice and last minute activities. \u201cThe lengths to which [a party] must go to produce a witness . . . is a question of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Florek, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 414, 415 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>413 Mass. 252, 260-261 (1992). \u201cAlthough the Commonwealth does not have to exhaust every lead to meet its burden, substantial diligence is required.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Florek, supra </em>at 416. The fact that the witness is in another State, or for that matter, in another country, standing alone, is not sufficient to show unavailability. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>426 Mass. 555, 558 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">There is no list of specific efforts that the Commonwealth must make to secure the presence of a missing or recalcitrant witness so as to satisfy the unavailability prerequisite to the admission in evidence of the witness\u2019s prior recorded testimony. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, supra </em>at 263-264 (cases are fact-dependant). In this case it was incumbent upon the Commonwealth to satisfy the judge that the Commonwealth had made a good faith effort to locate and produce Mario. See <em>id. </em>at 264. The judge here was satisfied; she ruled that Mario\u2019s testimony was admissible, and admitted it. We disagree and conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support the judge\u2019s findings and ruling, and thus that the admission of the probable cause testimony was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">While we accept as true all that is reported by Trooper West and the ADA, the judge was placed at a decided disadvantage by a lack of detail as to the dates of actions reported as having been taken. It is, therefore, impossible to evaluate the timeliness of those efforts. The trooper\u2019s activities begin in \u201cearly 2005.\u201d No dates were specified for the trooper\u2019s unnumbered (\u201cseveral\u201d) visits to Mario\u2019s last known address on Washburn Street, and the same is true as to \u201cseveral\u201d visits to the address that was assumed to be Francisco\u2019s on Weldon Street in Providence. Similarly, while the ADA reports the mailing of summonses and letters (each in the plural) to Mario at the Washburn Street address, the dates of mailing and of notice back (\u201cnot known at this address\u201d) are unspecified.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Our reported decisions note various categories of actions that are relevant in the determination of the reasonableness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Commonwealth\u2019s efforts to find a missing witness. Included as potential avenues are searches of available public records from agencies, Federal, State, and local, with identity databases. The United States Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, the State Division of Employment Security, the State Registry of Motor Vehicles, State probation and court resources, municipal clerks, and voting officials are other examples. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siegfriedt, </em>402 Mass. 424, 426 n.2 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>413 Mass. at 255; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Florek, supra </em>at 415-416. Resources have included both Massachusetts and out-of-State resources and, while the Internet yet has not specifically been mentioned, the uses of telephones and answering machines have. The cases have placed emphasis upon communications with, and requests for assistance to, other law enforcement agencies both in and out of Massachusetts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Childs, supra </em>at 261; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Florek, supra </em>at 416. Influential in the cases is the inquiry about the missing witness to his family, friends, neighbors, employers, and others who are assumed as probable sources of information. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salim, </em>399 Mass. 227, 234 n.3 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Florek, supra </em>at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In this case the Commonwealth failed to use many potential and significant sources of information. Particularly glaring, and we think controlling, is the Commonwealth\u2019s lack of attention to Mario\u2019s family, especially his brother Francisco, until the very eve of trial. The brothers were together at the time of the incident. As it turned out, Francisco was an important source of highly relevant information that could have assisted in a more timely and reasonable effort to locate Mario and assure his presence at trial. While the Commonwealth\u2019s submissions indicate a single late victory in finally serving Francisco in hand with a summons when he appeared in the District Court on his own case, the date of that service is missing, as is the date of the record examination that resulted in the information that there was, indeed, a case pending against Francisco. There is no explanation why there were no earlier efforts to inquire of Francisco; if that had been done, valid search activity would have included law enforcement and other data sources in New Jersey. However, Francisco was ignored for far too long, un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>fairly burdening the judge with the difficult task of balancing her trial management responsibilities<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> against the constitutional issue of a live witness for purposes of cross-examination. The Commonwealth made an insufficient showing of a good faith effort to locate Mario and, accordingly, Mario\u2019s unavailability was not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The judgments are reversed, the verdicts set aside, and the matter is remanded for a new trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">We refer to the Perezes by their first names to avoid confusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Part of the defense was the testimony of Marcial (then serving a three-year sentence on a plea to the same charges) to the effect that the defendant accidentally encountered Marcial after he, alone, had assaulted Mario and taken his wallet. Marcial testified, essentially, that the defendant was unknown to him and just happened to follow him into the apartment building.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\">No more precise date was given. Furthermore, unless we specify to the contrary, no dates were provided to the judge for any of the Commonwealth\u2019s activities that were asserted to show a good faith and diligent search for Mario. Also, no precise number of visits by Trooper West to the New Bedford and Providence residences were provided to the judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Apparently, no effort was made to determine from the neighbors if Francisco was a resident at, or otherwise frequented, the Weldon Street property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The supplied affidavits did not specify the dates or number of summonses and letters mailed to Mario, the date of the tracking of Francisco\u2019s District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Court record, nor the date that the record became known to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b605-9\">The defendant does not contend that the prior recorded testimony would be inadmissible for any reason other than the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to demonstrate Mario\u2019s unavailability.
