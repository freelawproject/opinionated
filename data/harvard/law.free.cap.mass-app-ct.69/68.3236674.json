A private investigator, on sick leave from the New Bedford police department (department) \u2014 who had been hired by the family to surveil the suspect covertly and to attempt to obtain deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence \u2014 retrieved the saliva and sent it for DNA testing. Ultimately, the results provided the basis for a court-ordered DNA test, which implicated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>defendant (who had been unaware that the observant investigator had been on the case and was surveilling him).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">After a jury trial in Superior Court, the defendant was convicted of two counts of rape in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>22(b). </em>He raises two claims on appeal: that the motion judge erred in failing to suppress the results of the court-ordered DNA test; and that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument contained expressions of personal opinion on the weight of the evidence. We conclude that under the circumstances, the expectorating defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his spittle, or in the DNA evidence derived therefrom. Moreover, his contentions concerning the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument are not persuasive. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\"><em>Background. </em>In ruling on the motion to suppress, the motion judge made the following findings. The victim is a mentally challenged individual who lives with her parents in New Bedford. At the time of the motion hearing, she had two daughters, ages eleven and two years old. After discovering the second pregnancy, the victim\u2019s family attempted to determine the father.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When a doctor informed the family that the onset of the pregnancy was in October, 2001, the family began to suspect that the defendant was the father. The family suspected the defendant because he was working at their residence during October, 2001, and had access to the victim. This suspicion was confirmed somewhat when, after confrontation, the victim informed her sister that the defendant had impregnated her<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that other individuals had touched her inappropriately.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The victim\u2019s family conveyed this information to the department. On the basis of this information, Detective Pamela Alves sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>DNA samples<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from multiple individuals, including the defendant. Other than the defendant, all those requested to provide DNA samples complied. The samples did not yield a \u201cmatch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In light of the defendant\u2019s refusal to provide a sample and Alves\u2019s inability to obtain a court order requiring one, the victim\u2019s family hired a private investigator, one Albino Faria,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to secure DNA evidence from the defendant. Working independently of the department, Faria surveilled the defendant for a \u201cnumber of months,\u201d but was unable to obtain a sample.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Faria therefore devised a plan wherein his assistant, one Carlos Lourenco,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> would contact the defendant to arrange for plumbing work at Lourenco\u2019s house. The defendant performed the requested plumbing work, during which time he spat on the sidewalk outside of Lourenco\u2019s residence. Lourenco collected the spittle<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and presented it to Faria, who sent it to a laboratory for genetic testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The results implicated the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Faria provided a copy of the results to Detective Alves, accompanied by a report of his investigation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With this information in hand, Detective Alves sought an order from the District Court requiring the defendant to submit a DNA sample. A District Court judge issued the order<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> without an explanatory opinion. Eventual test<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>ing identified the defendant as the father of both of the victim\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>DNA sample. </em>The motion judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, mling that he had no expectation of privacy in his saliva when he abandoned it on a public sidewalk. On appeal, the defendant essentially argues that the motion judge erred because the DNA sample was obtained in a ruse devised by a State actor, and that his State and Federal constitutional rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bly, </em>448 Mass. 473, 489-491 (2007), is instructive. There, in affirming the denial of a motion to suppress DNA evidence, the Supreme Judicial Court determined that the defendant lacked an expectation of privacy in the cigarette butts and a water bottle that he had abandoned, and that the police did not act improperly in collecting DNA evidence from those items after questioning the defendant on unrelated offenses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The items had been collected by the police pursuant to a ruse where the police had placed cigarettes and the water bottle in the interview room, in the hope, unbeknownst to the defendant (who had declined to provide a blood sample), of collecting DNA evidence. In response to the defendant\u2019s argument \u201cthat the method used by the Commonwealth in obtaining his known DNA sample constituted a nonconsensual seizure,\u201d the Supreme Judicial Court presented the analytical framework that guides us here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">\u201c[The defendant] must bear the threshold burden of show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>ing that a warrantless search or seizure occurred. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Onofrio, </em>396 Mass. 711, 714-715 (1986). This question is analyzed under the familiar two-part query whether [the defendant] had a subjective expectation of privacy in the items seized, and if so, whether that expectation was reasonable objectively. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 301 (1991), citing <em>California </em>v. <em>Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 211 (1986).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bly, supra </em>at 490. Put another way, \u201cThe Fourth Amendment and art. 14 protect from unreasonable search and seizure those areas in which individuals have a subjective expectation of privacy that is objectively \u2018reasonable,\u2019 \u2018justified,\u2019 or \u2018legitimate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Krisco Corp., </em>421 Mass. 37, 41 (1995), citing <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 39 (1988). Thus, in analyzing a search by a State actor, we look to whether the defendant had a subjective expectation of privacy in the place searched or the item seized, and whether as an objective matter society would recognize that expectation as reasonable. <em>Krisco Corp., supra </em>at 41-42, citing <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, supra. </em>See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 206-207 (2004), <em>S.C., </em>445 Mass. 72 (2005) , cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1187 (2006); Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 158 (2d ed. 1983 &amp; Supp. 2006); Grasso &amp; McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law \u00a7 3-5 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In the present case, although the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his saliva (and other bodily fluids), see <em>Matter of Lavigne, </em>418 Mass. 831, 835-836 (1994); <em>Jansen, petitioner, </em>444 Mass. 112, 120-121 (2005), when he expectorated on to a public street and did not retrieve the fluid, he voluntarily abandoned that protection; he assumed the risk of the public witnessing his action and thereafter taking possession of his bodily fluids. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 540 (no expectation of privacy in cigarette butts abandoned as trash in interview room), <em>S.C., </em>449 Mass. 1035 (2006) . See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 660-661 (1990) (observations and inspections occurring after items deposited in public places generally fail to intrude upon reasonable expectation of privacy); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nutile, </em>31 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>App. Ct. 614, 619 (1991) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in drugs voluntarily thrown from vehicle); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wedderbum, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 558, 564 (1994) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in drugs dropped on ground during police surveillance).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Here, the motion judge found that the location where the defendant spat was a public street, a place freely accessible to others. See <em>Krisco Corp., </em>421 Mass. at 42-44. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, supra </em>(no reasonable expectation of privacy in trash left on curb); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 951, 952 (1984) (defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in open area of public restroom). Moreover, there is no indication that the defendant took affirmative action to recover the saliva once it had left his mouth. In <em>Bly, supra </em>at 490-491, the defendant did not attempt to retrieve the cigarette butts when leaving the interview room, nor did he request to go back and collect them. The court held that Ely\u2019s \u201cwholesale failure to manifest any expectation of privacy in the items whatsoever\u201d compelled the \u201cconclusion that [he] had no subjective expectation of privacy.\u201d Id. at 491. See <em>Ewing, supra </em>(defendant made no attempt to take cigarette butts when leaving interview room). Contrast <em>Krisco Corp., supra </em>at 45 (discussing affirmative steps taken by defendant to protect dumpster from public access). Thus, where the defendant here voluntarily abandoned his saliva onto a public street, the investigator (whether deemed to be functioning in a private capacity or as a State actor) did not infringe on any reasonable expectation of privacy when he recovered the spittle from the street.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The defendant contends that <em>Bly </em>stands for the proposition that DNA evidence that is retrieved as the culmination of a ruse can be admissible only if the police had legitimate grounds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>question the defendant, albeit for unrelated offenses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He argues that such circumstances did not occur here, where he was unaware of any actual or surrogate law enforcement presence. This argument is not persuasive. As a factual matter, there was no meaningful connection between the ruse, which led the defendant to the plumbing job, and the collection of the saliva sample. That the defendant spat onto a public street is unrelated to that ruse, except in the most tenuous way \u2014 he would not have been on that particular public street but for the plumbing job. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Berry, 420 Mass. 95, 104 (1995) (\u201cIf a person surrenders an item voluntarily, \u2018a \u201csearch\u201d or \u201cseizure\u201d within the purview of the Fourth Amendment ... is not involved.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aguiar, </em>370 Mass. 490, 496 [1976], citing <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>443 U.S. 443, 484-490 [1971]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In any event, the defendant\u2019s argument misapprehends <em>Bly. </em>The focus of <em>Bly </em>is whether a defendant, by his own actions, manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the material that yielded the DNA evidence. A factor in that determination is whether a defendant\u2019s actions were prompted or coerced by another party. They were not in <em>Bly, </em>and they were not here. Plainly, neither the investigator nor anyone else prompted or coerced the defendant to spit on the sidewalk. See <em>Ewing, supra </em>(no evidence of coercion). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>430 Mass. 545, 550 (2000) (defendant\u2019s action nonconsensual).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The defendant further counters that the <em>Bly </em>case is distinguishable because there, although the police suspected that Bly might refuse to provide a DNA sample, he had not yet refused. The defendant argues that here, by contrast, he had refused, through counsel, to give a DNA sample, such that the ruse effectively yielded the DNA evidence in which he had manifested a privacy interest by refusing voluntarily to provide. This argument is not meritorious. For one thing, the defendant in <em>Bly </em>had declined to give a blood sample, a fact that did not thereafter preclude the extraction of DNA evidence from the abandoned cigarette butts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>For another thing, while at one point the defendant here may have shown a subjective expectation of privacy in his DNA, when he later spat onto the public street and did not attempt to retrieve his saliva, he no longer manifested such a subjective expectation. In any event, as has been noted, given the public nature of the defendant\u2019s action, as an objective matter, society would not recognize that expectation as reasonable. In sum, under the circumstances, the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his spittle, or in the DNA evidence derived therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">2. <em>Closing argument. </em>In her closing argument, the prosecutor made several comments regarding the strength of the evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant asserts that the argument was in error because the prosecutor represented to the jury that, in her personal opinion, the evidence was \u201coverwhelming\u201d and the elements of the charges were proven by the evidence. As the defendant did not object to the argument, we review to determine whether the argument, if error, created a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13-14 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">A prosecutor may argue the strength of the evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 498 (1997), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>401 Mass. 731, 738-739 (1988) (\u201cGenerally, there is no error in a prosecutor\u2019s describing the evidence presented as \u2018overwhelming\u2019. . .\u201d). Assessing the case\u2019s strength for the jury is a \u201cpermissible part of marshaling the evidence and arguing forcefully for a conviction.\u201d <em>Santiago, supra. </em>Here, the prosecutor\u2019s comment that the evidence was \u201coverwhelming\u201d was tethered to a recitation of that evidence, permissibly describing the substantial evidence presented by the Commonwealth on the victim\u2019s ability to consent to sexual intercourse and the evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s intercourse with the victim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s use of the description \u201coverwhelming\u201d in two separate instances therefore was not error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, supra </em>at 738-739. This is especially so when taken in the context of the entire closing argument, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam-rini, </em>392 Mass. 427, 432 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>437 Mass. 554, 565 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coren, </em>437 Mass. 723, 730-731 (2002), as well as the trial judge\u2019s instructions, noted <em>infra, </em>that the closing arguments were not evidence and the jury were the sole arbitrators of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s isolated interjections of her own personal assessment of the defendant\u2019s guilt warrant a more cautious examination. See <em>Santiago, supra. </em>We conclude that, while the comments were better left unsaid, they were not error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>428 Mass. 852, 857 (1999). Her interjections do not imply that she (the prosecutor) had knowledge of the evidence not presented to the jury upon which the jury should premise its decision, <em>ibid, </em>(\u201c[prosecutor\u2019s] use of the phrases T think\u2019 and T suggest\u2019 to preface some remarks did not, viewed in their proper context, imply that the prosecutor had personal knowledge or was stating a personal belief\u201d); do not critically misstate the evidence, see <em>Coren, supra </em>at 730-732; do not improperly appeal to the jury\u2019s sympathies, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dumais, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 70, 74 (2003); and do not instruct the jury as to how it should find, see <em>Santiago, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Moreover, the jury repeatedly was reminded that arguments by the attorneys did not constitute evidence. Of particular note is the instruction after the closing arguments, in which the trial judge stated, \u201cThe lawyers are entitled to argue the evidence in this case and the reasonable inferences that you can draw from the evidence. As I told you, their arguments are not a substitute for the evidence.\u201d These instructions placed the closing arguments in the proper perspective. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>432 Mass. 1, 10 (2000) (jury presumed to follow judge\u2019s instructions); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 27, 36-37 (2005) (judge\u2019s instructions capable of curing error).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\">After the first pregnancy, the victim\u2019s family attempted unsuccessfully to discover the identity of the father.
