The arbitrator concluded that the committee had violated the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) by failing to comply with certain requirements for the evaluation of Alice Haseltine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>a teacher who had not attained professional teacher status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The committee argues that the Education Reform Act of 1993 (Act) made substantial changes in school committee governance and that, as a result, Haseltine\u2019s grievance was not arbitrable because it involved a decision not to renew the employment of a teacher who had not attained professional teacher status.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The committee goes on to argue that because Haseltine lacked such status, she should be treated as an at-will employee. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\"><em>Background. </em>Haseltine had been employed full time by the committee since 2001. She divided her time forty per cent as a technology instructor and sixty per cent as a guidance counsel-lor at Hull High School. On May 30, 2003, she was called to the office of the principal, Russell Goyette, and given a letter which stated: \u201cPursuant to . . . General Laws, Chapter 71, Section 41, I am sorry to inform you that we will not be renewing your contract for the 2003-2004 school year.\u201d No reason was given. The Hull Teachers Association (association) filed a grievance on Haseltine\u2019s behalf. When that procedure did not resolve the grievance, the association sought arbitration of the grievance. The stipulated issues presented to the arbitrator were: \u201cDid the School Committee violate Article VI, Sections 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 and Article XLIH of the Association\u2019s collective bargaining agreement in the manner in which it evaluated the Grievant prior to the decision not to reappoint her for the 2003-04 school year? If so, what shall be the remedy?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The arbitrator concluded that the committee had failed to comply with certain requirements for the evaluation of Haseltine, as stated in the parties\u2019 CBA. In the award, the arbitrator ordered that Haseltine be reinstated to her position. The committee sought to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award in the Superior Court. G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11. The association sought an order confirming the award. G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">A judge concluded that the arbitrator did not exceed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>authority, denied the committee\u2019s request to vacate the award, and allowed the association\u2019s motion to confirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We proceed under familiar principles governing judicial review of decisions of arbitrators. See <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990) (courts inquire into arbitration only to determine if arbitrator has exceeded scope of authority or decided matter based on fraud, arbitrary conduct, or procedural irregularity in hearings).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">We first examine the statutory framework established by the Act, applicable to this case, to determine if the arbitrator correctly determined that the scope of his authority in considering the grievance was not limited by the Act. Such a determination belongs with the courts. Cf. <em>School Dist. of Beverly </em>v. <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. 223, 230 (2001) (responsibility for interpreting statute and arbitrator\u2019s authority thereunder remains with court).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The committee relies on a provision in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, that teachers without professional teacher status \u201cshall otherwise be deemed employees at will.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The committee asserts that at-will employees may be dismissed at any time, for any reason or no reason. The committee\u2019s argument ignores the requirements of the preceding sentences in c. 71, \u00a7 42. The statute makes clear that after the initial ninety days of service a teacher without professional teacher status must be given a written notice of intent to dismiss, along with an explanation of the grounds for dismissal. See and compare <em>Saxonis </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 916, 917 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 819 (2005) (\u201crudimentary rights to notice and a hearing prior to dismissal\u201d accrue under c. 71, \u00a7 42, after retention for ninety days).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Section 42 was rewritten by St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44. The ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>sion of the statute in effect prior to 1993 provided that a teacher \u201cnot employed at discretion\u201d who had served for more than ninety days could not be dismissed without prior notice and, if requested, a written statement of \u201ccause or causes,\u201d as well as a hearing before the school committee. The Act did not materially alter these \u201crudimentary rights\u201d of teachers without professional teacher status. Accordingly, whatever may be the meaning of the statement that teachers without professional teacher status \u201cshall otherwise be deemed employees at will,\u201d contrary to the committee\u2019s view, such teachers cannot summarily be dismissed without observing the rudimentary rights provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">While the Act significantly gave principals \u201cprimary responsibility for hiring, disciplining, and terminating teachers [and other assigned personnel],\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, the \u201cLegislature did not grant principals unfettered discretion . . . .\u201d <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, </em>438 Mass. 753, 761 (2003). They must follow the strict procedural and substantive provisions in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44. Cf. <em>ibid. </em>\u201c[B]y enacting \u00a7 59B, the Legislature carefully balanced school-based management reforms with the district-wide needs of school systems and the collective bargaining rights of school employees over the terms and conditions of their employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762. In fact, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38, mandates that a superintendent of schools \u201cshall require the evaluation ... of teachers without professional teacher status every year,\u201d and that the procedures for conducting those evaluations \u201cshall be subject to the collective bargaining provisions of [c. 150E].\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38, third par., as amended through St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 40 (essentially unchanged from version of statute in effect prior to 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The central issue in Haseltine\u2019s grievance, and the subject of arbitration, was her claim that the committee dismissed her without following the evaluation procedures set forth in the CBA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We think it readily apparent that those procedures fall within the statutory framework that provides for the evaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>of teachers; provides notice and hearing protections for teachers without professional status; and preserves the management prerogatives of the principal and the school committee. \u201c[T]he alleged failure to follow certain practices agreed to by the school committee is arguably a grievance under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. The question of the arbitrability of these asserted grievances properly may be submitted to an arbitrator and, if the arbitrator concludes that the issue is arbitrable, he may pass on the question whether the school committee adhered to its obligations.\u201d <em>Dennis-Yarmouth Regional Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Dennis Teachers Assn., </em>372 Mass. 116, 120 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that nothing in the Act prohibited arbitration of Haseltine\u2019s grievance, and that the arbitrator properly derived his power and authority from the CBA. Compare <em>School Dist. of Beverly </em>v. <em>Geller, </em>435 Mass. at 230-231. See generally <em>School Comm. of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. 106, 113 (1977) (school committee may not surrender its authority to make tenure decisions but may bind itself to follow certain procedures).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The relevant facts underlying the grievance indicate that during her first year (2001-2002) Haseltine was never formally observed in the classroom and received no written observation reports or a summative evaluation by the principal then in office, as required by the CBA. After Goyette became principal in February, 2002, Haseltine asked about observations and evaluation, but was told they would not be done. Haseltine was reappointed by Goyette to a second year. There were no formal observations in her second year (2002-2003) until May, when three observations were made, but no post observation reports or summative evaluations were prepared. No observations or evaluations of Haseltine\u2019s performance as a guidance counselor were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">The arbitrator properly could conclude that there had been a violation of the CBA from the failure to perform the evaluations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>He did not transcend the limits of the agreement to arbitrate. Compare <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. 18, 28-29 (1980); <em>School Dist. of Beverly </em>v. <em>Geller, supra </em>at 230-235.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In his award, the arbitrator ordered Haseltine reinstated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the Superior Court, the committee opposed reinstatement on the ground that the technology courses taught by Haseltine would not be offered because of limited enrollment. Nevertheless, her position was not eliminated, and another teacher was appointed with the same split duties (forty per cent teaching and sixty per cent guidance counselling). The Superior Court judge concluded that ordering reinstatement did not impinge on the committee\u2019s authority because a full-time position would have been available had Haseltine\u2019s contract been renewed. In this appeal, the committee does not dispute that conclusion and, in any event, makes no separate argument on reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">We conclude that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority by ordering reinstatement of Haseltine in these circumstances. Because Haseltine\u2019s nonrenewal was not based on a conclusion drawn from an evaluation of her performance as a teacher, the order did not impinge on the ultimate authority of the principal or the committee. The order of reinstatement simply required the principal and the committee to follow the procedures agreed to in the CBA. There is ample authority and precedent for such a reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">\u201cThe agreement to follow certain procedures preliminary to exercising its right to decide a tenure question, and to permit ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>bitration of a claim that it has failed to follow those procedures, does not impinge on a school committee\u2019s right to make the ultimate tenure decision.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. at 114. \u201c[Reinstatement of a nonsupervisory teacher who had been treated unfairly because of the breakdown of required teacher evaluation procedures would not impinge on a school committee\u2019s nondelegable prerogatives. We agree with the conclusions of the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>Board of Educ., Bellmore-Merrick Cent. High Sch. Dist., Nassau County </em>v. <em>Bellmore-Merrick United Secondary Teachers, Inc., </em>39 N.Y.2d 167, 173 (1976), where the court said, \u2018The temporary reinstatement awarded here does not eviscerate the public policy mandate that a board of education evaluate the requisite competence and merit of a teacher before the conferral of tenure. . . . The award merely requires that. . . [the board of education] follow procedures it has agreed to adopt in its decision-making process in the area of tenure.\u2019 (Citations omitted.)\u201d <em>School Comm. of W. Bridgewater </em>v. <em>West Bridgewater Teachers\u2019 Assn., </em>372 Mass. 121, 127 (1977). \u201c[Reinstatement . . . was an appropriate remedy where the school committee\u2019s failure to reappoint took place \u2018without observance of [the notice and hearing] procedures prescribed by [the] collective bargaining agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>School Comm. of W.
