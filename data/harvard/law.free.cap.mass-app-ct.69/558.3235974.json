About three and one-half years after her return to work, her teaching position was abolished. Two years later she sought but was denied accidental disability retirement benefits by the Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board (board). The board\u2019s denial was affirmed by an administrative magistrate of the division of administrative law appeals, the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB), and a Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Court judge. Soucy argues on appeal that because her disability matured while she was a \u201cmember in service,\u201d as that term is defined in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(l)(a)(i), she retained the right to such benefits by reason of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14. Based on the language of the pertinent provisions of G. L. c. 32 and the substantiated facts found by the administrative magistrate, we conclude that Soucy was not a \u201cmember in service\u201d and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">1. <em>Background facts. </em>Soucy was employed as a medical occupations instructor at a regional high school from January, 1983, to August, 2001. On January 22, 1997, she fell while on the school\u2019s premises. She thereafter suffered from back, buttock, and leg pain and took a leave from her employment. While on leave, she treated with numerous health care providers. After consulting with an orthopedic surgeon who diagnosed her as suffering from \u201csignificant degenerative disc disease,\u201d Soucy underwent spinal surgery. Although the surgery left Soucy with bladder and bowel dysfunctions, her surgeon authorized her to return to work without restrictions on her activities on December 2, 1997.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Soucy returned to work on January 14, 1998, and continued to teach until August, 2001. Throughout this period, Soucy continued to experience back pain. She also found it painful and difficult to stoop to assist students at their computers and to push, pull, or lift heavy objects such as books or computers. Other teachers were sometimes required to cover her class because she was forced by her bladder dysfunction to excuse herself from her classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Soucy\u2019s teaching position was eliminated and her employment terminated in August, 2001. Almost immediately after the termination of her employment, Soucy filed a claim for further workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>based upon her 1997 work-related injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Her claim was resolved by a lump sum settlement agreement (lump sum agreement) approved by the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) on October 2, 2003. The lump sum agreement provides that the lump sum payment represents \u201capproximately 2.5 years of total incapacity benefits, from the date [Soucy\u2019s] position was eliminated.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In March of 2002, while her claim for further workers\u2019 compensation benefits was pending but not yet resolved, Soucy applied for accidental disability retirement benefits. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1). To support her claim, Soucy submitted (1) medical records dated December, 2001, and July, 2002, in which her physicians opined that Soucy was disabled as a result of the injury she had sustained on January 22, 1997, and would continue to be so for the foreseeable future; (2) the August, 2000, report of the three-member regional medical panel certifying pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3)(o), that Soucy was disabled and that her disability \u201cmight be the natural and proximate result\u201d of her 1997 injury; and (3) the report of the doctor who performed an independent medical evaluation of Soucy in June, 2003, apparently in connection with her then still pending claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and who concluded that Soucy\u2019s 1997 accident \u201crendered] [her] previously asymptomatic degenerative disc disease symptomatic\u201d; that \u201cher complaints at this point are an outgrowth of her symptomatic degenerative disc disease and subsequent failed surgery\u201d; that \u201c[t]here is a permanent disability for activities related to high school shop instructor\u201d; and that Soucy was \u201ceffectively totally and permanently disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Soucy contends that her claim for accidental disability retirement benefits was supported by a preponderance of the evidence, which the administrative magistrate \u201cignored,\u201d and which established that her disability matured while she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>a member in government service. Because our analysis turns on the application of the law to the facts found by the administrative magistrate and accepted by CRAB, we first consider the administrative findings by which we are bound and then apply the law to those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">a. <em>The controlling facts. </em>It is well established that the administrative magistrate\u2019s findings, accepted by CRAB, must be based upon substantial evidence, that is, \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6). See <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd.., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 257 (1996). It is not our function to weigh the evidence presented during administrative proceedings. See <em>Houde </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 842, 851 (2003), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">There was evidence found credible by the administrative magistrate that Soucy was seen by her primary physician on September 11, 2001, and that her chief complaint at that time was \u201cacute stress secondary to being laid off from her job.\u201d The physician\u2019s note from that date reflects that Soucy\u2019s \u201clow back pain secondary to remote injury,\u201d while \u201c[n]ot disabling,\u201d did \u201climit her in her activities.\u201d The administrative magistrate could reasonably credit this 2001 assessment of Soucy\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">While acknowledging that Soucy continued to experience pain when she returned to service in January, 1998, the administrative magistrate nonetheless concluded that her condition was not so debilitating as to render her \u201cunable to perform the duties of her job\u201d prior to her separation from government service. This conclusion was based upon the 2001 medical assessment that although Soucy\u2019s condition limited her activities, it was not disabling; the fact that after her return to work on January 14, 1998, Soucy worked her regular schedule and taught summer sessions until such time as her position was eliminated in August, 2001; and her testimony that she would have continued to teach but for the fact that her position was abolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">b. <em>The applicable law. </em>Soucy\u2019s claim of entitlement to accidental disability retirement benefits is structured on various sections of G. L. c. 32. General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 7(1), as amended by St. 1996, c. 306, \u00a7 14, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>\u201c[A]ny member in service . . . who is unable to perform the essential duties of his job and . . . such inability is likely to be permanent... by reason of a personal injury sustained ... as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties [,] . . . upon his written application . . . shall be retired for accidental disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">A \u201cmember in service\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(l)(a)(i), which reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">\u201cAny member [of the State retirement system] who is regularly employed in the performance of his duties, except a member retired for disability who upon partial recovery is restored to active service as provided for in paragraph (2)(a) of section eight.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] Any member in service shall continue as such during any period of authorized leave of absence with pay or during any period of authorized leave of absence without pay if such leave is due to his . . . physical incapacity for duty or if such authorized leave of absence without pay is for not more than one year .... In any event the status of a member in service shall continue as such until his death or until his . . . <em>retirement, resignation </em>. . . <em>removal or discharge from his . . . position\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Based on <em>Vest </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 191 (1996), we conclude that Soucy was not a \u201cmember in service\u201d after her position was abolished in August, 2001. In the <em>Vest </em>case, the claimant was a police officer who was diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes but who nonetheless continued to work until he left government service for nonmedical reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 192. Five years later, he applied for accidental disability retirement benefits. <em>Ibid. </em>Upon review of his medical records, a regional medical panel concluded that it was unable to certify that he was disabled at the time of his departure from government service. <em>Id. </em>at 192-193. On appeal from a Superior Court judgment affirming the denial of the claimant\u2019s application for accidental disability retirement benefits, the court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>\u201cThe term \u2018member in service,\u2019 as defined by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(l)(ti)(i) . . . , is a member of the retirement system \u2018regularly employed in the performance of his duties.\u2019 Giving tenses their ordinary significance, the statute, when it says, \u2018shall be retired,\u2019 contemplates retirement <em>following </em>manifestation of disabling disability\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">As determined in the instant case by the administrative magistrate on the substantial evidence before her, Soucy was able \u201cto perform the essential duties of her job\u201d at the time of her separation from government service in August, 2001. At that time she became a \u201cmember inactive\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(l)(a)(ii), that is, she became a member in service \u201cwhose employment has been terminated and who may be entitled to any present or potential retirement allowance or to a return of his accumulated total deductions.\u201d See <em>ibid., </em>wherein the court stated that it is a \u201csettled principle that, after the end of active service, an employee has the status in the State retirement system of a \u2018member inactive.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Seeking to distinguish her claim from that rejected in the <em>Vest </em>case, Soucy argues that by reason of her workers\u2019 compensation lump sum agreement dated October 3, 2003, and the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(l)(a) and (c), she was a \u201cmember in service\u201d at the time her teaching position was abolished in August, 2001. As pertinent to Soucy\u2019s argument, \u00a7 14(1) reads: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Consistent with the mandate contained in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(l)(c), the lump sum agreement provides that the lump sum payment \u201crepresents approximately 2.5 years of total incapacity benefits, from the date [Soucy\u2019s] position was eliminated.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>\u201cRetention of Rights of a Member in Service, <em>(a) </em>Any employee who was a member in service at the time of sustaining an injury ... on account of which he becomes entitled to payments under the provisions of [G. L. c. 152] shall, during the period while he is receiving weekly payments for total incapacity ... or during any period . . . represented by the allocation of the amount of any lump sum settlement payable ... to him under . . . [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48,] in lieu of such weekly payments . . . retain all the rights of a member in service while he is living, unless and until a retirement allowance becomes effective for him under the provisions of sections one to twenty-eight, inclusive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Soucy claims that although she sustained her work-related injury in 1997 and left government service in August, 2001, she remained a \u201cmember in service\u201d eligible to receive accidental disability benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, by reason of her lump sum agreement and the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(l)(a) and (c). Her argument fails for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Soucy\u2019s argument ignores the basic and well-established principle of statutory construction that \u201cstatutory language itself is the principal source of insight into the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977), cited and quoted in <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>391 Mass. 92, 94 (1984), and <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>421 Mass. 344, 345 (1995). In considering the language of the controlling statutes, we give \u201ctenses their ordinary significance.\u201d <em>Vest </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 14(1), directs itself to the rights <em>retained </em>by a \u201cmember in service.\u201d Although Soucy was a \u201cmember in service\u201d when she sustained her 1997 injury, she became a \u201cmember inactive\u201d when she left government service in August, 2001, while still able to perform the essential duties of her position. See <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>345 Mass. 692, 695 (1963); G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(l)(a)(i), (ii). As a \u201cmember inactive,\u201d she was not eligible to receive accidental disability retirement benefits under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, and did not retain any of the rights conferred on \u201cmembers in service\u201d under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(l)(a). Notwithstanding any determina-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>tian made by the DIA concerning Soucy\u2019s ability to perform the essential duties of her position at the time she left government service, that determination was not binding on the board or the administrative magistrate, who found and concluded on substantial evidence that Soucy was able to perform the essential duties of her position in August, 2001. She was, therefore, a \u201cmember inactive\u201d at the time of her application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits in August, 2001, and her application for accidental disability retirement benefits in March, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We see nothing in the language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(l)(a) or (c), that supports Soucy\u2019s claim that, three years after her departure from government service, the terms of her lump sum agreement retroactively bestowed upon her the status of a \u201cmember in service,\u201d a status that would make her eligible to apply for accidental disability retirement benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7. When she left government service, she was no longer a \u201cmember in service.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">It follows from the findings of the administrative magistrate as supported by substantial evidence as well as our reading of the pertinent statutory provisions, that Soucy is not eligible for the accidental disability retirement benefits provided by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">While on leave, Soucy received workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the provisions of G. L. c. 152. Based upon her claim for such benefits, an independent medical evaluation was conducted in October, 1997. The examining physician opined that Soucy needed additional time to recover from her surgery, that she was unable to return to work at that time, and that she would \u201cend up with a significant permanent partial disability, particularly if she does not have any improvement in her bowel and bladder dysfunction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 34, as amended, St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 42, provides for benefits for a loss of earning capacity caused by a work-related injury \u201c[wjhile the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is total. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\">According to a handwritten and initialed notation on the lump sum agreement, the settlement redeemed liability for benefits provided under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36. Section 36 provides for additional compensation for specific injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b588-8\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(a), pertains to the evaluation and re-examination of members retired for disability and is irrelevant to the present dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">As pertinent to Soucy\u2019s lump sum agreement, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(l)(c), reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">\u201cWhenever such member receives an amount of lump sum settlement payable directly to him ... in lieu of weekly payments, the period represented thereby shall, for the purpose of this section, be computed to begin on the date for which he last received regular compensation prior to such settlement. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">We do not view <em>DiNatale </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 39 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 401 (1995), as requiring a different result. In the <em>DiNatale </em>case, the claimant settled her workers\u2019 compensation action by way of a lump sum agreement. This court held that for the purpose of calculating creditable service, the claimant \u201cwas entitled to retain membership in the retirement system pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(1),\u201d during the period over which the lump sum amount was allocated. <em>Id. </em>at 407. That case did not involve the claimant\u2019s right to receive accidental disability retirement benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
