L. c. 265, \u00a7 23). On appeal, he argues that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence and that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for mistrial and by denying him the right to cross-examine the victim regarding an alleged prior false allegation of sexual assault. In addition, he contends that a portion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper and prejudicial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\"><em>Facts. </em>The jury permissibly could have found the following facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant and the fifteen year old victim met in November, 2001, through a telephone chat line intended for use by teenagers. At the time, the defendant, who was twenty-six years old, arranged to pick up the victim at her home in New Bedford on November 23, 2001, at 8 a.m. After the defendant arrived at the victim\u2019s home that morning, the victim told her grandmother that she was leaving the house but would return shortly. Instead, the defendant drove her to Division Street in Fall River, where he parked the car on the street and began kissing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Shortly thereafter, Fall River police Officer Robert Costa, Sr., who was on routine patrol in the Division Street area of Fall River, received a communication from the police station directing him to 222 Division Street to investigate an automobile parked on the street in front of that address. When he arrived at the address, Officer Costa observed the defendant in the driver\u2019s seat and the victim in the passenger seat. During a twenty minute field investigation, Officer Costa learned the names, dates of birth, and addresses of the defendant and victim, and determined that neither had any outstanding warrants or was the subject of a missing-person report.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claimed that he had been dropped off at that location by a friend and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>waiting for the friend to return. Officer Costa, suspicious of the defendant\u2019s story, transported both the defendant and the victim to the Fall River police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">At the station, the police attempted to contact members of the victim\u2019s family, but were unsuccessful. The police would not allow the defendant to drive his vehicle,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so the defendant called his parents for a ride home. When the defendant\u2019s family arrived at the police station, the victim was allowed to leave the station with the defendant and his parents. She accompanied them to the parents\u2019 home in New Bedford. The victim remained at the parents\u2019 home for the following five days, spending the nights with the defendant in his bedroom.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">On November 26, 2001, the victim\u2019s family reported her as a mnaway to the New Bedford police department. Detective James Jose, who was assigned to the case, quickly learned that the victim had been involved recently with the Fall River police department. Through the Fall River police, Jose obtained the defendant\u2019s address and went to the defendant\u2019s home the following day. His knock on the door of the defendant\u2019s home was answered by the defendant\u2019s mother. Jose asked her if the defendant was home. In response, the defendant\u2019s mother pointed down the hall.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Jose asked the defendant\u2019s mother if the victim was also present in the home, she nodded and pointed again down the hall. At that point, Jose asked her if he could \u201cgo and see [the defendant].\u201d In response, the defendant\u2019s mother walked further into the house and \u201cpointed into a bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Jose entered the home and went to the bedroom, where he observed that blankets were covering the bedroom windows and the victim was sitting on the defendant\u2019s bed, with the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>standing near her. Upon seeing Jose, the defendant became belligerent, asking Jose, \u201c[W]hat the fuck are you doing in my house?\u201d When Jose asked the defendant what he was doing with a fifteen year old girl, the defendant responded \u201cbecause I fucking like her\u201d or \u201cbecause I feel like it.\u201d Jose then removed the victim from the home in handcuffs and took her to the New Bedford police station. He did not place the defendant under arrest at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">At the police station, the victim told Jose that the defendant had digitally penetrated her and wanted to have intercourse with her but she refused. Jose had the victim complete a written statement, then took photographs of \u201chickeys\u201d on several parts of her body. After the interview, Jose contacted the victim\u2019s parents, and the victim\u2019s father picked her up from the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The following week, the victim disclosed the rape to a teacher, who brought the victim to a local hospital where a rape kit was performed. A copy of the rape kit report was forwarded to Jose,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> who brought the victim back to the police station for a second interview on December 5, 2001. At the second interview, the victim informed Jose that she had left certain details out of her first interview, including that the defendant had penetrated her with a lollipop and a banana.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\"><em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Motion to declare mistrial. </em>During the presentation of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, Jose gave certain testimony which prompted the defense counsel to object and request a mistrial. During his testimony, Jose informed the jury that the victim had reported that the defendant had digitally penetrated her while she was in his automobile in Fall River. In addition, Jose testified that the victim had informed him that during one of her walks with the defendant, the defendant had purchased illegal drugs. The judge sustained each objection and ordered the statements struck from the record. The defendant contends that the statements were highly prejudicial and that the judge abused his discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">\u201cThe declaring of a mistrial is ordinarily within the discretion of the trial judge, who is in the best position to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>whether or not anything has happened likely to affect the justice of the verdict.\u201d <em>Curley </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>314 Mass. 31, 31-32 (1943). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Early, </em>349 Mass. 636, 637 (1965). \u201cWhere a party seeks a mistrial in response to the jury\u2019s exposure to inadmissible evidence, the judge may \u2018correctly rel[y] on curative instructions as an adequate means to correct any error and to remedy any prejudice to the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kilburn, </em>426 Mass. 31, 37-38 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 232 (1989). \u201cGenerally, as long as the judge\u2019s instructions are prompt and the jury do not hear the inadmissible evidence again, a mistrial is unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Here, the judge sustained the defendant\u2019s objections to Jose\u2019s improper testimony and ordered it struck from the record. Moreover, the judge gave a prompt curative instruction that was adequate to cure any possible prejudice stemming from both the narcotics testimony and the challenged testimony regarding digital penetration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chubbuck, </em>384 Mass. 746, 753 (1981) (\u201cBy striking the testimony and promptly instructing the jury to disregard it, the judge did all that was necessary to cure any possible error from the admission of the statement\u201d). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">b. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>The defendant alleges that the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress the statements he made when Jose entered his bedroom and the observations Jose made while in the bedroom. He argues that the evidence was obtained as a result of an illegal entry and search of his home by Jose. \u201cWarrantless entries into the home are prohibited by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights absent either probable cause and exigent circumstances, or consent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>444 Mass. 234, 236 (2005). In this case, the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>monwealth relies on the consent of the defendant\u2019s mother to justify Jose\u2019s entry into the defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">\u201cWhen the police rely on consent to justify a warrantless entry, under both the Fourth Amendment and art. 14, the prosecution \u2018has the burden of proving that the consent was, in fact, freely and voluntarily given.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, quoting from <em>Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548 (1968). As entry based on consent is an exception to the constitutional warrant requirement, the Commonwealth must demonstrate \u201cconsent unfettered by coercion, express or implied, and also something more than mere \u2018acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Voisine, </em>414 Mass. 772, 783 (1993), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>370 Mass. 548, 555, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 943 (1976). Specifically, the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, supra </em>at 238-239 (citations omitted), ruled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">\u201cThe voluntariness of an individual\u2019s consent to a warrant-less entry is an issue of fact, and must be examined in light of the totality of the circumstances of the case. Ordinarily, in cases involving consent to enter a defendant\u2019s home, entry is preceded by an exchange in which a police officer makes some type of inquiry of an occupant, and in response, the occupant verbally or physically reacts in a manner that is interpreted as \u2018consent.\u2019 Whether consent is voluntary depends on the nature of this interaction between the police and the occupant. In meeting its burden of establishing voluntary consent to enter, the Commonwealth must provide us with more than an ambiguous set of facts that leaves us guessing about the meaning of this interaction and, ultimately, the occupant\u2019s words or actions. If either the officer\u2019s request or the occupant\u2019s response is so ambiguous that we are unable to discern whether the occupant voluntarily consented to entry, our inquiry will be over and the entry must be deemed unlawful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Further, \u201cwe accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact unless not warranted by the evidence,\u201d and while open to review, we afford the judge\u2019s \u201cultimate findings . . . \u2018substantial deference. \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 395 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 145, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Here, the motion judge concluded that the defendant\u2019s mother voluntarily allowed Jose to enter the home. Essentially, the motion judge found that the defendant\u2019s mother invited Jose into the home in a setting that was noncoercive, without influence by orders or threats. There are no findings that the defendant\u2019s mother appeared confused or unable to understand the officer\u2019s request. The evidence presented amply supports these findings. Jose testified that, after ascertaining that the defendant was at home and with the victim, he asked the defendant\u2019s mother if he could \u201cgo and see [the defendant].\u201d The defendant\u2019s mother, who understands English,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> gave Jose permission to enter the house and directed him to the bedroom occupied by the defendant and the victim. We therefore conclude that there was no error in the judge\u2019s determination that Jose entered the defendant\u2019s home with the consent of the defendant\u2019s mother. Accordingly, the judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">c. <em>Exclusion of evidence of another accusation claimed to be false. </em>The defendant claims that the trial judge erred in precluding his counsel from presenting evidence that the victim made a false prior accusation of sexual assault. He argued before the judge, and now here, that he was entitled to use the victim\u2019s prior accusation to impeach her credibility. He also suggests, for the first time on appeal, that evidence of the prior accusation was relevant to show the victim\u2019s state of mind, bias, or a common scheme, and that its exclusion, in relation to those purposes, resulted in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">i. <em>The prior allegation. </em>In the spring of 2001, the victim reported to one of her teachers that a school bus driver had touched her breasts and buttocks as she entered the bus. A school official contacted the New Bedford police department, which set up an interview with the victim in coordination with the Department of Social Services. According to the initial report completed by a detective assigned to the case, the victim made several inconsistent statements related to the time of the incident and the conduct of the bus driver. Specifically, the victim stated during the interview that the bus driver did not touch a private part of her body, but rather \u201csnapped\u201d her thong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>underwear five times, which was contrary to what she initially reported to her teacher.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The detective also learned that the victim told her mother that the driver had \u201ctouched her all over,\u201d but then told her father that the driver touched her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt. Citing the \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in the victim\u2019s allegations, the investigating officer chose not to file any charges. Instead, she placed the case on file with the possibility of reopening it at a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">ii. Bohannon <em>analysis. </em>\u201cThe well-established rule in Massachusetts is that \u2018[s]pecific acts of prior misconduct of the witness . . . not material to the case in which he testifies cannot be shown by the testimony of impeaching witnesses or other extrinsic evidence to affect [the witness\u2019s] credibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 151 (1993), quoting from Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 149 (5th ed. 1981). However, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90, 94 (1978), the court carved a narrow exception to the general rule to be applied in unusual fact situations where \u201cthe interest of justice forbids strict application of the rule.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, supra. </em>The court emphasized the narrowness of the exception to the general rule in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, supra. </em>It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-6\">\u201cWe have applied this exception in only one case, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>where we allowed evidence of prior false accusations of rape to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility. Specifically, the special circumstances included: \u2018the witness was the victim in the case on trial, her consent was the central issue, she was the only Commonwealth witness on that issue, her testimony was inconsistent and confused, and there was a basis in independent third-party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>records for concluding that the prior accusations of the same type of crime had been made and were false.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">\u201c[T]o open the gate to cross-examination, the evidence of falsity of an accusation must be solid, as when the accusing witness has recanted the other allegation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wise, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 922, 923 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 487, 490-492 (1987). The victim\u2019s mere failure to prosecute or confirm prior allegations of sexual assault, or the Commonwealth\u2019s decision not to move forward with criminal charges, are insufficient bases for inferring that the allegations in question are false. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hrycenko, </em>417 Mass. 309, 319 (1994) (\u201cEvidence that the victim failed to pursue a claim is not evidence that the claim was falsely made\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>444 Mass. 586, 591 (2005) (\u201cmere fact that the witness had said she was joking does not establish that her statement was false\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, supra </em>at 490-491 (falsity of allegations not proven by victim simply dropping charges against alleged assailant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rathburn, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 699, 709-710 (1988) (victim\u2019s failure to confirm previous allegations of abuse does not constitute \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d that allegations were false); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wise, supra </em>(authorities\u2019 decision not to initiate prosecution based on prior allegations insufficient basis to establish that they were false). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 332, 333-335 (1994) (complaining party\u2019s admission that allegations were false sufficient to establish their falsity for <em>Bohannon </em>purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">We find no abuse of discretion in the present case. As in <em>Bo-hannon, </em>there was only one eyewitness, the victim. Here, however, the evidence failed to establish that the victim\u2019s prior accusation against the bus driver was false. The detective assigned to investigate the victim\u2019s allegation against the bus driver concluded merely that the victim\u2019s statements were \u201cinconsistent.\u201d This conclusion, and the detective\u2019s decision not to file charges, does not establish that the accusation was false. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Talbot, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wise, supra. </em>Moreover, unlike <em>Bohannon, </em>consent of the victim was not a central issue in the present case, the victim\u2019s testimony was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>inconsistent and confused, nor was there a pattern of false allegations of the specific crime which was the subject of the trial. Given this factual predicate, we hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to permit the defendant to cross-examine the victim about the allegedly false accusation made by her against a school bus driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The defendant also argues, for the first time on appeal, that evidence of the victim\u2019s prior accusation was admissible to prove her state of mind, bias, or a common scheme. Again, it has not been shown that the victim\u2019s prior accusation was false. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Hicks, 23 Mass. App. Ct. at 492 (\u201cNot only did the defendant not raise this issue at trial, but, here again, the questions were pertinent only if there was threshold evidence warranting a conclusion that the allegations were false\u201d). Moreover, the defendant has failed to point to any evidence demonstrating that the victim was biased against him or that she was engaging in a common scheme. Nor has he made any cogent argument relating to the victim\u2019s state of mind and how that state of mind is relevant to any issue at trial. Rather, he has simply repackaged his <em>Bohannon </em>argument under another name. In sum, we find no merit to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">d. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>Finally, the defendant alleges that a portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper since she called upon the jury to speculate on the evidence with the following comment: \u201cNow, if they are making out in a public place in Fall River, what do you think is going on in a private place in his bedroom?\u201d We will assume, without deciding, that the statement was improper because it had the effect of encouraging the jury to speculate that the defendant committed the criminal acts charged while the victim was in his bedroom. We evaluate a prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks to the jury to determine whether those statements constituted prejudicial error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 500 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">In making this determination, we consider \u201c[t]he cumulative effect of all the errors in the context of the entire argument and the case as a whole.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, the following factors are considered: \u201cwhether the defense counsel seasonably objected to the arguments at trial; whether the judge\u2019s instructions mitigated the error; whether the errors in the arguments went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>the heart of the issues at trial or concerned collateral matters; whether the jury would be able to sort out the excessive claims made by the prosecutor; and whether the Commonwealth\u2019s case was so overwhelming that the errors did not prejudice the defendant.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">After a careful review of the prosecutor\u2019s entire closing argument, we conclude that any impropriety in the challenged statement was not prejudicial. The prosecutor\u2019s remark was brief, not repeated, and neutralized by the judge\u2019s instructions that the jury were not to \u201cspeculate or engage in surmise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-10\">We reserve additional factual background to be described where pertinent to the legal issues addressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-11\">Officer Costa also ascertained that the automobile in which the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>and the victim were found belonged to the defendant\u2019s father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b855-9\">At trial, Officer Costa could not recall if the defendant had a valid driver\u2019s license at the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b855-10\">The victim left the house with the defendant twice during that period, once to walk to a gasoline station to get cigarettes and once to walk to a nearby housing project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b855-11\">The defendant\u2019s mother testified, through a Portuguese interpreter, at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.
