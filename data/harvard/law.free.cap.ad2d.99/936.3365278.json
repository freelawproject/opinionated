A reopened <em>Wade </em>hearing was held before Justice Becker. At that hearing, Justice Becker closely observed the facial characteristics of the defendant and the three stand-ins. fin an opinion dated October 3, 1983, Justice Becker found that neither the defendant nor the stand-ins had red hair. He did find, however, that all the participants in the lineup had similar facial features. It was Justice Becker\u2019s conclusion that the lineup was fair, permissible and proper, f The evidence at the reopened hearing amply supports Justice Becker\u2019s factual determination that the lineup was fairly conducted. Based upon the additional evidence submitted at the reopened hearing, we are now in agreement that the lineup identification by witnesses Jill Smith and Angela Dortch was properly admitted at trial. We also agree that there was an independent basis for Jill Smith\u2019s identification at trial. Although Jill Smith\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>identification testimony was extensively impeached at trial, her credibility remained a matter for the jury. We find that the totality of the evidence at trial was sufficient to establish defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We find no merit to the other points raised by the defendant.
