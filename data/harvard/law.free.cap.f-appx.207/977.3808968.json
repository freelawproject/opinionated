White, who was 16 years old, was a passenger in a car driven by 18-year-old Adam Jacoby. During a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>patrol around 2:30 a.m., Officer Lawson, who was driving an unmarked patrol vehicle, began to follow Jacoby.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Officer Lawson did not activate his car\u2019s siren or other emergency equipment as he followed Jacoby\u2019s car for over 15 miles. During Officer Lawson\u2019s surveillance of Jacoby\u2019s car, both vehicles traveled at speeds exceeding 100 m.p.h. and disobeyed traffic laws. At some point during this chase, Officer Lawson learned that Jacoby\u2019s car was not stolen. While traveling over 100 m.p.h., Jacoby\u2019s car failed to navigate a curve in the road; and his vehicle crashed, killing White. After the crash, many persons complained to Polk County officials that Officer Lawson had performed unnecessary physical searches of them at the time of their arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">On appeal Plaintiffs argue that Lawson\u2019s surveillance of Jacoby and White shocks the conscience and therefore violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of substantive due process. They contend that Officer Lawson intended to harm White based on the circumstances of the crash and Officer Lawson\u2019s refusal to answer questions after the crash about his intentions in chasing Jacoby\u2019s car.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the facts \u2014 as supported by the evidence in the record \u2014 and reasonable inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Young v. City of Palm Bay, </em>358 F.3d 859, 860 (11th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 \u201cprovides a cause of action for constitutional violations committed under color of state law.\u201d <em>Burton v. City of Belle Glade, </em>178 F.3d 1175, 1187-88 (11th Cir.1999). To state a section 1983 claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant, acting under color of state law, deprived him or her of a right secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States. <em>Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 119 S.Ct. 977, 985, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999). The first step in evaluating a section 1983 claim is to \u201cidentify the exact contours of the underlying right said to have been violated.\u201d <em>County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 1714 n. 5, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lewis </em>involved a high-speed police pursuit during which an officer chased a speeding motorcycle driver, resulting in the death of the motorcycle\u2019s passenger after the motorcycle tipped over and the officer struck the passenger. <em>Id. </em>at 1712. In that case, the Supreme Court explained that the critical factor in determining whether the officer violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of substantive due process was whether the officer\u2019s conduct shocked the conscience, which occurs when a plaintiff can show that the officer had \u201ca purpose to cause harm unrelated to the legitimate object of arrest.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1711-12; <em>see also id. </em>at 1720 (explaining that \u201chigh-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>speed chases with no intent to harm suspects physically or to worsen their legal plight do not give rise to liability under the Fourteenth Amendment, redressible by an action under [section] 1983\u201d). Therefore, \u201cwhen unforeseen circumstances demand an officer\u2019s instant judgment\u201d \u2014 in situations such as a high-speed chase-a showing that an officer\u2019s recklessness caused plaintiffs injury is insufficient to support a substantive due process claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1720.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Here, Plaintiffs have not presented evidence that Officer Lawson\u2019s acts were motivated by an intent to harm White; and we conclude that Officer Lawson\u2019s conduct does not rise to a level that shocks the conscience.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1721 (concluding that \u201c[rjegardless whether [initiating a high-speed chase] offended the reasonableness held up by tort law or the balance struck in law enforcement\u2019s own codes of sound practice, it does not shock the conscience, and [defendants] are not called upon to answer for it under [section] 1983\u201d); <em>Vaughan v. Cox, </em>343 F.3d 1323, 1327, 1333 (11th Cir.2003) (concluding that when a police officer fired shots towards a vehicle being pursued, resulting in a bullet hitting the spine of one of the vehicle\u2019s passengers and instantly paralyzing him below the chest, summary judgment to defendants was appropriate because plaintiff did not present evidence that the officer\u2019s acts were motivated by anything other than a desire to arrest the vehicle\u2019s occupants); <em>Fagan v. City of Vineland, </em>22 F.3d 1296, 1299-1300, 1303, 1309 (3d Cir.1994) <em>(en </em>banc) (concluding that a police pursuit \u2014 during which a police officer pursued a vehicle by speeding through a residential neighborhood violating traffic laws, resulting in the death of some of the occupants of the pursued vehicle \u2014 did not shock the conscience).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">Because Officer Lawson\u2019s conduct did not shock the conscience, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendants was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-17\">. Before Defendants filed their motion for summary judgment in this case, Officer Lawson had filed <em>pro se </em>a motion for summary judgment, which the district court denied because the case was not yet ripe for disposition by summary judgment. In its order granting summary judgment to Defendants, the district court acknowledged that it previously had denied Officer Lawson\u2019s summary judgment motion but explained that Officer Lawson \"should obtain the benefits of this ruling\u201d granting summary judgment to Defendants because no constitutional violation was committed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">. Officer Lawson later stated in an incident report that Jacoby had been speeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">. The record contains evidence that Officer Lawson performed an unnecessary strip search of a fifteen-year-old male two weeks before the crash.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">. We note that Plaintiffs do not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that pursuit of Jacoby\u2019s car did not result in an unlawful seizure under the Fourth Amendment; therefore, this claim is abandoned. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>270 F.3d 1346, 1347 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that a party abandons an issue when he fails to raise it in his initial brief on appeal). In addition, we acknowledge that the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims against Polk County; so Plaintiffs might pursue these claims in state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">. Plaintiffs argue that Officer Lawson did not engage in \"split second decision making\u201d that requires application of the shock-the-conscience standard; and they contend that we should consider Officer Lawson\u2019s conduct under a deliberate-indifference standard. But Plaintiffs have not directed us to evidence that Officer Lawson had sufficient time to deliberate on his conduct before undertaking pursuit of Jacoby\u2019s vehicle. Instead the evidence presented indicates that this case involved a high-speed chase governed by the shock-the-conscience standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">. We are not persuaded \u2014 in the absence of even a scintilla of other evidence that Officer Lawson intended to harm White \u2014 by Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that, because Officer Lawson invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and did not answer a deposition question about whether he intended to harm White and Jacoby, we should infer that Officer Lawson did intend such harm. <em>See Avirgan v. Hull, </em>932 F.2d 1572, 1580 (11th Cir.1991) (\"Invocation of the fifth amendment privilege did not give rise to any legally cognizable inferences sufficient to preclude entry of summary judgment. The negative inference, if any, to be drawn from the assertion of the fifth amendment [by the moving party] does not substitute for evidence needed to meet the [non-moving party\u2019s] burden of production.\u201d). And we note that, in his <em>pro se </em>motion for summary judgment, Officer Lawson stated that he did not intend to assault White and Jacoby or to worsen their legal plight.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
