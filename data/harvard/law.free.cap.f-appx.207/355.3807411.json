McSwain timely appealed. McSwain\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that in his opinion there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning the validity of McSwain\u2019s conviction on the ground that the firearm McSwain possessed was inoperable and questioning the reasonableness of McSwain\u2019s sentence. McSwain was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but did not file one.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">McSwain first asserts that his conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1) is invalid because the pistol he possessed was missing a firing pin and therefore was inoperable. However, it is well established that a weapon does not have to be operable to qualify as a firearm under \u00a7 922(g)(1). <em>United States v. Willis, </em>992 F.2d 489, 491 n. 2 (4th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Brown, </em>117 F.3d 353, 355-56 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-16\">Next, McSwain argues that the district court erred by imposing a sentence at the top of the guideline range. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness. A sentence imposed within the properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-19\">McSwain asserts that the sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonable because he contends that the trial court failed to take into consideration the special circumstances of his case, as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2006). A sentencing court is presumed to have considered the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a) unless the record indicates otherwise and is not required to explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Legree, </em>205 F.3d 724, 728-29 (4th Cir.2000) (dealing with denial of motion to reduce sentence); <em>see also United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 632 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. \u2014 (U.S. June 20, 2006) (No. 05-11659), <em>and United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">In imposing McSwain\u2019s sentence, the district court stated that it had considered the arguments of both the defense and the government and concluded that McSwain\u2019s long and violent criminal history and the nature of the instant offense justified a sentence at the top of the guideline range. Because the district court adequately explained the basis for its sentencing decision, we find the resulting ninety-six-month sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. \u2014 (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439); <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm McSwain\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform McSwain, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If McSwain requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on McSwain.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
