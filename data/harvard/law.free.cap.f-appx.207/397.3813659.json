Garcia was sentenced within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>guideline imprisonment range to a 150-month term of imprisonment as to count 1 and to concurrent 120-month terms of imprisonment as to counts 3, 4, and 5 and was ordered to serve concurrent three-year periods of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">At the bench trial, the Government introduced evidence showing that Garcia was transporting three illegal aliens from a house in Houston to a grocery-store parking lot. One of the aliens was Jimy Lopez-Mejia Garcia. His brother, Jose Santos Lopez-Mejia, was going to meet Garcia in the grocery-store parking lot and pay for Jimy\u2019s release. During the transaction, Jose and Garcia got into a knife fight. Garcia drove away, with Jose Lopez hanging on the side of Garcia\u2019s truck. Garcia pulled a 9mm pistol and the other men in the truck struggled with Garcia. The pistol discharged once. The truck struck a telephone pole and two other vehicles. Jose Lopez was thrown to the pavement and was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In general, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A) makes it a crime to transport illegal aliens. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A). Section 1324(a)(l)(B)(iii) and (iv) establishes increased maximum penalties if, during the commission of a violation of subsection (a)(1)(A), the defendant causes any person to suffer serious bodily injury or death or placed in jeopardy the life of \u201cany person.\u201d \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(iii) <em>&amp; </em>(iv); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>449 F.3d 635, 644-45 (5th Cir.2006). Garcia contends for the first time on appeal and without citation that the term \u201cany person\u201d refers only to undocumented aliens alleged to have been transported. Our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Alfaro-Hemandez, </em>453 F.3d 280, 281 (5th Cir.2006). Garcia has not identified and we have not found any case in which a court has interpreted the statute in the manner in which Garcia contends it should be interpreted. Accordingly, the district court could not have committed a clear or obvious error in giving the term \u201cany person\u201d its ordinary and natural meaning. <em>See United States v. Hall, </em>110 F.3d 1155, 1161 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Garcia contends also that the district court erred by overruling his objection to an eight-level increase in his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) because of Lopez\u2019s death. Garcia contends that the enhancement does not apply because Lopez was not one of the smuggled aliens. Our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir.2005). Under \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6), (4), a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by eight levels \u201cif any person died.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia-Guerrero, </em>313 F.3d 892, 898 (5th Cir.2002). In overruling Garcia\u2019s objection, the district court found that Garcia\u2019s relevant conduct proximately caused Jose\u2019s death. The district court explained, \u201cSmuggling aliens illegally with a loaded firearm could reasonably lead the smuggler to foresee the result in this case; that is, death and serious bodily injury to third parties who negotiate for the release of the illegally smuggled aliens.\u201d The district court\u2019s finding and its enhancement of the offense level under \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) was not plainly erroneous. <em>See Villegas, </em>404 F.3d at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Prior to the bench trial, the parties reached an agreement that Garcia would plead guilty to transporting an illegal alien for financial gain, a violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii) and (B)(ii) (count 1), and \u00a7 1326 (count 5), but would proceed to a bench trial as to the sentencing enhancements of count 1 related to bodily injury and death ((B)(iii) <em>&amp; </em>(iv)) and as to the firearms counts (counts 3 and 4), in exchange for which the Government would agree to dismissal of count 2 (kidnaping).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">Garcia contends that the district court erred in finding him guilty of \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(iii) and (iv) because that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>finding \u201cwas not supported by the evidence and was contrary to the admonishments of the offense elements to which [he] entered his plea of guilty.\u201d We review the district court\u2019s acceptance of Garcia\u2019s partial guilty plea to count 1 for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). We review the sufficiency of the evidence as to the bodily-injury-and-death enhancements in the light most favorable to the Government to determine \u201cwhether the finding of guilt is supported by substantial evidence, i.e., evidence sufficient to justify the trial judge, as the trier of fact, in concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>319 F.3d 716, 720-21 (5th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Garcia admitted at the rearraignment that he violated \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A) by transporting illegal aliens for financial gain. Under \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(ni) and (iv), the maximum penalty for such violation is increased (to 20 years and death or life imprisonment, respectively) if, \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d the violation, the defendant \u201ccauses serious bodily injury ... to, or places in jeopardy the life of, any person\u201d or if such violation results \u201cin the death of any person.\u201d \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(iii) <em>&amp; </em>(iv); <em>see Williams, 449 F.8d </em>at 644-45. The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, showed that, while Garcia was transporting illegal aliens in violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii), Jose Lopez became involved in an argument with Garcia regarding one of the aliens and that Lopez was killed when he was thrown to the pavement as Garcia attempted to leave the scene in his vehicle. The district court\u2019s finding of guilt is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Turner, </em>319 F.3d at 720-21. Garcia\u2019s substantial rights were not affected by any error in accepting Garcia\u2019s partial guilty plea as to count 1. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Garcia also contends that his guilty plea was involuntary because the district court failed to comply with Fed.R.CrimP. 11. We review this issue for plain error. <em>See Vonn, </em>535 U.S. at 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043. As to count 1, Garcia contends specifically that the district court erred in admonishing him about the maximum punishment. The maximum term of imprisonment for transporting illegal aliens for financial gain or for engaging in a conspiracy to transport illegal aliens is ten years. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) &amp; (v)(I) and (B)(i). If the defendant merely transports illegal aliens or aids and abets the offense of transporting illegal aliens, the maximum penalty is five years. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii) &amp; (v)(II) and (B)(ii). The district court admonished Garcia that he faced a maximum sentence of 10 years for count 1. Garcia argues that the maximum sentence was five years because the evidence introduced at the bench trial showed that he was guilty of aiding and abetting only and so should have been convicted and sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(n). Garcia admitted at the rearraignment that he had transported illegal aliens for financial gain. Therefore, the maximum sentence to which he was exposed as a consequence of his guilty plea was 10 years, under \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii) and (B)(i). There was no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The district court admonished Garcia that he faced a maximum sentence of 20 years for count 5 (illegal reentry after deportation). Under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), an alien who reenters the United States following deportation, in violation of \u00a7 1326(a), who was convicted of an aggravated felony pri- or to deportation, faces a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years. Garcia admitted that, prior to deportation, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>convicted of an aggravated felony, that is, a drug trafficking offense. Garcia contends that the prior felony involved marijuana possession for which he served a six-month sentence and that the district court erred in admonishing him that he faced a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years. Because he received only a six-month sentence for the marijuana-possession conviction, Garcia argues, he was not subject to the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(1)(A)(I) and the district court\u2019s admonition to the contrary and failure to define \u201caggravated felony\u201d made his guilty plea involuntary. Garcia contends also that the error led to an incorrect application of the Guidelines. These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Under <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Court upheld the treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors. Despite repeated attack, this court has held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding, despite the holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Accordingly, any failure on the part of the district court to admonish Garcia adequately regarding the impact of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) on his sentencing range could not have affected the voluntariness of Garcia\u2019s guilty plea to a violation of \u00a7 1326(a) and was not plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Garcia admitted, in response to questioning by his own attorney, that he was deported following conviction for an aggravated felony. Instead of a 16-level increase in offense level, Garcia received a 12-level increase in offense level because of the prior felony. That increase impacted group II of the guideline calculation (count 5) but did not impact group I (counts 1, 3, and 4). Garcia did not object to the 12-level increase. Accordingly, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vargas-Garcia, </em>434 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1894, 164 L.Ed.2d 578 (2006). Because the offense level for group I was higher, Garcia was sentenced pursuant to group I and the 12-level enhancement had no effect on the total offense level and Garcia\u2019s substantial rights were not affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Garcia contends that the district court erred in overruling his objection to the lack of an adjustment in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. The reduction for acceptance of responsibility \u201c \u2018is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409, 414-15 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 2)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 315, 166 L.Ed.2d 237 (2006). The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
