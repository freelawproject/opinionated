Lewis asserts: (1) his conviction under \u00a7 924(c) violated the Commerce Clause; (2) his trial on the \u00a7 924(c) charge violated the Double Jeopardy Clause; and (3) the district court erred in denying him a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 acceptance of responsibility reduction. After review, we affirm Lewis\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-18\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b970-19\">A. <em>Commerce Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b970-20\">Lewis first contends \u00a7 924(c) is unconstitutional because Congress did not explicitly link the offense conduct with interstate commerce, and, therefore, lacked the power to enact it under the Commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Clause. Specifically, he asserts linking the possession of a firearm to a generic \u201ccrime of violence\u201d does not establish the crime had a \u201csubstantial effect on interstate commerce.\u201d Although Lewis acknowledges we have rejected facial challenges to \u00a7 924(c), he states \u201cthe issue is raised here for consideration by this Court under the factual circumstances of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">We review constitutional issues <em>de novo. United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1280 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 968, 125 S.Ct. 1751, 161 L.Ed.2d 615 (2005). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>the possession or use of a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to any crime of violence ... for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>robbery which \u201cobstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce.\u201d We have rejected facial challenges to \u00a7 924(c). <em>See United States v. Ferreira, </em>275 F.3d 1020, 1028 (11th Cir.2001) (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that \u201cCongress lacked the power under the Commerce Clause to enact [\u00a7 924(c)]\u201d); <em>United States v. DePace, 120 </em>F.3d 233, 235 n. 2 (11th Cir.1997) (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 924(c) \u201cis an unconstitutional effort to regulate intrastate, non-economic activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">To the extent Lewis argues Congress lacked the power to enact the statute, we reject this argument because we have rejected facial challenges to \u00a7 924(c). <em>See id. </em>To the extent Lewis is challenging the statute\u2019s constitutionality as applied to him, Lewis pled guilty to violations \u00a7 1951(a). Additionally, Lewis agreed the store he robbed was a store engaged in interstate commerce and a number of the firearms he stole had moved in interstate commerce. As a result, the predicate crime of violence in this case admittedly was one that involved interstate commerce. Accordingly, under the facts of this case, \u00a7 924(c) was constitutionally applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">B. <em>Double Jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">Lewis next contends his trial and conviction on Count IV violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because he had already pled guilty to the lesser-included robbery offense. Specifically, he asserts that, because the Government was required to prove a violation of \u00a7 1951(a) in order to obtain a conviction under \u00a7 924(c), once he pled guilty to violating \u00a7 1951(a), the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited the prosecution of the \u00a7 924(c) charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">We recently held that, when a double jeopardy claim is not asserted at trial, the issue is waived. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>445 F.3d 1302, 1306 n. 4 (11th Cir.2006). As a result, we refused to hear the merits of the claim. <em>Id. </em>Because Lewis faded to assert his double jeopardy claim during trial, he has waived this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">C. <em>Acceptance of Responsibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">Lewis next contends that, because he admitted during the plea colloquy all of the essential factual elements constituting a \u00a7 1951(a) violation, the district court erred in not granting him an acceptance of responsibility reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1. Lewis notes the Government\u2019s factual proffer at the plea hearing did not mention the firearm because it was unnecessary to sustain the \u00a7 1951(a) convictions and was not relevant in calculating the applicable Guidelines range. Lewis asserts that, in \u00a7 924(c) cases, the Guidelines prohibit the consideration of the use and possession of a firearm in determining the applicable Guidelines range for the underlying crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s refusal to grant an adjustment [under \u00a7 3E1.1], [we] review[ ] interpretations of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and factual determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>tions for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Coe, </em>79 F.3d 126, 127 (11th Cir.1996) (citations omitted). In <em>Coe, </em>we rejected a claim nearly identical to the instant claim. <em>See id. </em>at 127-28. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-4\">Section 3E1.1 requires a downward adjustment \u201c[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 (a). To determine whether a defendant qualifies, a sentencing court should consider whether he \u201ctruthfully admitted] or [did] not falsely deny [] any additional relevant conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n. 1). Relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3 includes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-5\">all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 127. In <em>Coe, </em>the defendant pled guilty to illegally possessing a firearm. <em>Id. </em>In doing so, he admitted to using a gun during a crime of violence, but first denied and subsequently stated he could not remember whether he had brandished the weapon. <em>Id. </em>The district court found Coe had not accepted responsibility because he did not admit to brandishing the weapon. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, he argued whether he accepted responsibility for the brandishing of the weapon was not \u201crelevant conduct\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1B1.3. <em>Id. </em>We rejected that argument, holding the defendant\u2019s brandishing of a gun was \u201crelevant conduct\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1B1.3, and Coe thus was not entitled to an acceptance of responsibility reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">Although Lewis admitted he committed the robbery, he denied brandishing or possessing a firearm during the commission of that robbery, instead choosing to go to trial on the \u00a7 924(c) charge. The jury found him guilty of carrying and using a firearm during the robbery, specifically finding Lewis brandished the firearm. Based on these facts, Lewis\u2019s brandishing the firearm was \u201crelevant conduct\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1B1.3. <em>See Coe, </em>79 F.3d at 128. Accordingly, because Lewis did not admit to all of the relevant conduct as related to all of the offenses of conviction, he was not entitled to an acceptance of responsibility reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">Finally, the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction does not violate the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 rule against \u201cdouble counting\u201d because that rule merely prohibits the application of a specific offense characteristic. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, comment. (n.4) (prohibiting the application of a specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of a firearm when a defendant is convicted of both a \u00a7 924(c) offense and the underlying offense). No such characteristic was applied in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">Lewis\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 924(c) did not violate the Commerce Clause, and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>trial on the \u00a7 924(c) charge did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Additionally, the district court did not err in denying him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-7\">. We note that <em>post-Coe, </em>the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 was amended to \"clarify under what circumstances defendants sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may receive weapon <em>enhancements </em>contained in the guidelines for those other offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C., Amendment 599 (emphasis added). This amendment concerns sentencing enhancements, not reductions. Lewis is appealing the denial of a reduction, so the amendment to the commentary does not apply to his case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
