The dispute arose when Premier Products was sued by Rebecca Drake for injuries she alleged were caused by defects in cosmetic lip implantations produced by Premier Products. Following the initiation of that lawsuit, Premier Products submitted a claim to Maryland Casualty for defense and indemnity. Maryland Casualty denied the claim and stated that the insurance policy did not cover defense of that lawsuit because the claims asserted in the suit fell under the policy\u2019s exception for \u201cproducts \u2014 completed operations hazard.\u201d The district court agreed that the insurance policy did not cover the claims submitted and granted summary judgment to Maryland Casualty.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">We review grants of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Wheeler v. BL Dev. Corp., </em>415 F.3d 399, 401 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 798, 163 L.Ed.2d 627 (2005). Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party can show \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see also Wheeler, </em>415 F.3d at 401. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party- \u2014 in this case, Premier Products. <em>Id. </em>at 401-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The issue before this court is whether the insurance contract between Premier Products and Maryland Casualty covered the defense and indemnity from the suit brought by Rebecca Drake. According to the insurance contract, the Commercial General Liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) coverage obligates Maryland Casualty \u201cto defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking damages from bodily injury or property damage.\u201d The contract goes on: \u201cHowever, [Maryland Casualty] will have no duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking damages for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance does not apply.\u201d An endorsement incorporated into the policy explains a modification to the CGL coverage, stating, \u201cThis insurance does not apply to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 included within the \u2018products\u2014 completed operations hazard.\u2019\u201d Section V.16 of the CGL coverage form defines \u201cproducts \u2014 completed operations hazard\u201d: \u201cIncludes all \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damages\u2019 occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of \u2018your product\u2019 or \u2018your work\u2019.... \u201d The coverage form then identifies two exceptions, which neither party contends apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Under this language, it would be clear that Drake\u2019s lawsuit falls under the policy\u2019s exclusion for \u201cproducts \u2014 completed operations hazard,\u201d because the suit arose from the implantation of Premier Products products away from Premier Products premises. But the framework gets more complicated as Premier Products points to Subsection (c)(3) under the definition of \u201cproducts \u2014 completed operations hazard\u201d in Section V.16. Subsection (c)(3) states that the \u201cproducts \u2014 completed operations hazard\u201d exception \u201c[d]oes not include \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 arising out of: Products or operations for which the classification, listed in this Coverage Part, states that products \u2014 completed operations are subject to the General Aggregate Limit.\u201d Ultimately, this case turns on whether Subsection (c)(3) refers to the injuries Drake sustained and the resulting law suit. If the injuries and the law suit fall under Subsection (c)(3), then Maryland Casualty would have to defend and cover those expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Relying on page 3.2.1 of the policy, Premier Products asserts that \u201ccosmetics, toiletries and perfumes\u201d are listed under the Coverage Part and therefore fall under Subsection (c)(3). Because Drake\u2019s injuries and suit were based on cosmetic lip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>implantations, Premier Products argues that Subsection (c)(3) applies. As Maryland Casualty points out, though, page 3.2.1 is not in the Coverage Part and the reference to cosmetics on that page does not refer to the policy coverage. Page 3.1.1 states, \u201cThis coverage part consists of this declarations form, the common policy conditions, and the coverage forms and endorsements indicated as applicable on the forms list.\u201d Page 3.2.1 does not fall within any of these categories. Further, Page 3.1.1 notes the coverage and limits of insurance and specifically states that \u201cproducts and completed operations\u201d are excluded. The reference to \u201ccosmetics, toiletries and perfumes\u201d that appears on Page 3.2.1 is a \u201cclassification name,\u201d which indicates the type of business in which Premier Products is engaged. Merely classifying Premier Products as a cosmetics company does not extend insurance coverage to all cosmetics-related injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The insurance policy is clear and unambiguous; Subsection (c)(3) does not extend the insurance policy to \u201ccosmetics, toiletries and perfumes.\u201d As a result, the lawsuit arising out of the injuries sustained by Drake falls within the \u201cproducts \u2014 completed operations hazard\u201d exception and Maryland Casualty is not bound by the policy to cover the costs of defense and indemnity related to that suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Maryland Casualty.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-19\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
