Harris initially appealed his sentence on January 6, 2004; this court affirmed. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>No. 04-4011 (4th Cir. July 30, 2004) (unpublished). The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s decision, and remanded for further proceedings in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The parties were directed to file supplemental briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker </em>and its progeny upon the validity of Harris\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Harris now claims his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Booker. </em>Because Harris raised his <em>Booker </em>challenge for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). As set forth in <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), plain error is present if: (1) there was error; (2) it was plain; and (3) it affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. If these conditions are met, we may then exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). In light of <em>Booker, </em>we find plain error under <em>Olano </em>in regard to Harris\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">First, Harris contends that the district court committed non-constitutional error by treating the guidelines as mandatory, rather than advisory, as <em>Booker </em>requires. Although we held in <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 216-17 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005), that treating the guidelines as mandatory constitutes plain error, our review of the record convinces us that there is no nonspeculative basis on which we could conclude that the district court would have sentenced Harris to a lower sentence had the court proceeded under an advisory guidelines scheme. <em>See id. </em>at 225. Thus, Harris fails to demonstrate that the plain error in sentencing him under a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">Second, Harris contends that the district court sentenced him in violation of the Sixth Amendment because the court applied a two-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(2) (2003), based upon the court\u2019s conclusion that Harris wrote at least five letters that contained threats against the victim or her family. Although Harris\u2019 Sixth Amendment contention was foreclosed by our precedent at the time of his sentencing, <em>Booker </em>has since \u201cabrogated our previously settled law,\u201d rendering the error plain. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 548. Third, the error was prejudicial, in that Harris\u2019 forty-one month sentence was greater than the thirty-three month maximum authorized by the facts to which Harris pled guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 548-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">To affirm Harris\u2019 sentence despite the error would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of these judicial proceedings. In the wake of <em>Booker, </em>the Guidelines are to be treated as advisory (rather than mandatory), and sentences that fall within the statutorily prescribed range are reviewable only for reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 546 (citing <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>244, 125 S.Ct. 738). The record before us does not indicate what sentence the court would have imposed on Harris had it exercised discretion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and treated the Guidelines as merely advisory. Although it is possible that Harris will receive the same sentence on remand, \u201c[t]his possibility is not enough to dissuade us from noticing the error.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Finally, in his initial appeal, Harris contended that the district court clearly erred in denying his request for a downward sentencing adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. Harris also requested a remand to the district court for a new sentencing hearing based on a violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">A district court\u2019s determination as to the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility is a factual question reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999). The burden is on the defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to the adjustment. <em>United States v. Urrego-Linares, </em>879 F.2d 1234, 1238-39 (4th Cir.1989). A guilty plea does not automatically entitle a defendant to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.3). A defendant may not be entitled to a sentencing adjustment for acceptance of responsibility if the defendant engages in conduct inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. <em>Id. </em>Although Harris admitted that he sent a threatening communication to his wife, two witnesses testified that Harris made additional threats against his wife and others involved in his case even after he pled guilty. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that Harris\u2019 conduct after he pled guilty was inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. Further, we find no <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Accordingly, while we do not disturb Harris\u2019 conviction, we vacate Harris\u2019 sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker </em>and its progeny. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
