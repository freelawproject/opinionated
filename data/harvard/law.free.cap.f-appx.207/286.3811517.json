The district court designated Doctor an armed career offender and sentenced him, pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), to a 262-month term of imprisonment, five years of supervised release, $125 special assessment, and a mandatory minimum fine of $1000. On appeal, Doctor argues that the district court improperly sentenced him as an armed career criminal because the Government failed to properly plead and prove enhancing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">Doctor does not dispute the fact of his prior convictions or the sentences he received. The fact of a prior conviction need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 233-36, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 351-54 (4th Cir.) (reaffirming continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). Thus, the district court was not required to make any factual findings concerning Doctor\u2019s prior record at the time of the instant offense, but could rely on the \u201cconclusive significance\u201d of the record, <em>see Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 25, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), as set out in the presentence report. Moreover, this court has concluded a determination that a defendant is eligible for sentencing under the ACCA may be based on a judge\u2019s determination that the predicate convictions are for violent felonies or drug trafficking crimes if the qualifying facts are inherent in the predicate convictions and the court is not required to perform additional fact finding. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 282-83 (4th Cir.2005). We conclude that the district court was not required to engage in additional fact finding. Additional pleading and proof regarding the facts surrounding each of the predicate convictions would not have assisted the district court in determining that each qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA, as the qualifying facts are inherent in each of Doctor\u2019s predicate convictions. Therefore, we find that the district court properly sentenced Doctor under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
