Osbourne filed a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion, purporting to challenge a state court judgment. The district court construed the filing as a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) action and dismissed it for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (2000). Osbourne then filed a motion for reconsideration, claiming that his filing was a mistaken attempt to appeal a state court decision. The court denied the motion. Osbourne timely appealed the denial of both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-20\">Because Osbourne\u2019s motion was unambiguously titled and because he subsequently made his intent explicitly clear, we find that the district court erred in construing his filing as a \u00a7 1983 complaint. Accordingly, we modify the district court\u2019s dismissal to show that the case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and affirm the dismissal as modified. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-14\"> <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.
