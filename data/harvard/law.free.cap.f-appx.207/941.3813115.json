For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">In September 2001, Dixon and four others were indicted by a federal grand jury for manufacturing, possessing, and conspiring to possess counterfeit federal notes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 471, and 472. Dixon, without the benefit of a plea agreement, pleaded guilty to all counts against him, and was sentenced to 88 months in prison. Dixon\u2019s four co-defendants, by contrast, entered into plea agreements, under which the conspiracy count was dismissed, and were sentenced to 24 months of probation. Dixon, who did not appeal his convictions, filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. After the district court denied his initial \u00a7 2255 motion, Dixon requested, and was denied, permission to file a second and successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Dixon then filed a \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel and erroneous calculation of his sentence. Dixon also claimed that because the Government had dismissed the conspiracy charges against his co-defendants, he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of conspiracy. The district court denied his \u00a7 2241 petition, holding that Dixon had failed to satisfy the criteria of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, and thus, as a federal prisoner, could not proceed under \u00a7 2241. On appeal, Dixon argues that: he properly filed his petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241, the district court should have addressed the merits of his petition, he is actually innocent of conspiracy, and there was a fundamental defect in his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). On rare occasions, however, it is possible for federal prisoners to attack their convictions and sentences pursuant to \u00a7 2241 as opposed to \u00a7 2255. <em>Id.; </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. Under what is termed the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-9\">[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Thus, a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally-imposed sentence may be entertained only if the petitioner establishes that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See id. </em>The burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the movant. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive our authorization before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255; <em>In re Blackshire, </em>98 F.3d 1293, 1293 (11th Cir.1996). We have made clear that the restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, \u201cstanding alone, do not render that section \u2018inadequate or ineffective\u2019 within the meaning of the savings clause.\u201d <em>Darby, </em>405 F.3d at 945. Therefore, a petitioner who has filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion, which has been denied, may not circumvent the successive-motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>rule simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">We have articulated a three-prong test to determine whether \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of a prisoner\u2019s detention under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. According to that test, the savings clause applies when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-6\">(1) that claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV6\"><em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. In order for a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. <em>See id. </em>If the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies \u201cto open the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding, the proper inquiry in that \u00a7 2241 proceeding will be whether the petitioner can establish actual innocence of the crime for which he has been convicted, as \u2018actual innocence\u2019 is defined in <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">In the instant case, Dixon is precluded from seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 because the \u00a7 2255 savings clause does not apply. First, Dixon previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, and his motion was denied: Thus, it appears that Dixon filed his \u00a7 2241 petition in an effort to circumvent the rules limiting the scope of successive \u00a7 2255 motions. Second, Dixon cannot meet the initial prong of the <em>Wofford </em>criteria because he has not shown that his claims are based on any retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. Because he has not satisfied all three <em>Wofford </em>criteria, Dixon\u2019s petition does not fit within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, Dixon has failed \u201cto open the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding,\u201d and he cannot argue the merits of his claims of actual innocence, improper sentencing, and ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">For the reasons above, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
