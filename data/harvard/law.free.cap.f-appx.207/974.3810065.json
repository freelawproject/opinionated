No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Cortes asserts that the district erred in denying him a minor role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). He contends that he was less culpable than the other persons found on the boat (which was carrying 269 bales of cocaine) because he (1) did not plan the smuggling operation, (2) had no authority over the smuggled drugs or the boat\u2019s other crew members, (3) did not know the source, destination, or kind of drugs on the boat, (4) had not participated in other drug smuggling operations, and (5) only assisted loading the drugs onto the boat. Cortes also argues that he was a minor participant because he did not finance the smuggling operation nor have a proprietary interest in the smuggled drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">We review for clear error \u201ca district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), \u201c[a] defendant warrants a two-level reduction for playing a minor role in an offense if he is less culpable than most other participants, although his role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1348 (11th Cir.2002). The defendant has the burden of establishing his role by a preponderance of evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">We have set out two elements that inform the sentencing court\u2019s determination about a defendant\u2019s role in an offense: (1) the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable and (2) the defendant\u2019s role as compared to that of other participants in his relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 940. About the first element, <em>De Varon </em>explains that \u201c[ojnly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. About the second element, <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>counsels that this relative culpability inquiry includes \u201conly those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. The conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first element is the more important and, in many cases, may end the inquiry. <em>See id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">The district court committed no clear error in determining that Cortes\u2019s role in the offense was more than minor. About the first element, Cortes\u2019s sentence was based only on the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing: the 269 bales of cocaine seized from the drug smuggling boat. He was held accountable for no larger quantity. And the district court correctly pointed to the boat\u2019s large drug quantity in denying Cortes a minor role reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 943 (noting that, in the drug courier context, the amount of drugs is a \u201cmaterial consideration\u201d in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in his relevant conduct). About the second element, Cortes was one of only nine persons on the boat, which was carrying a very large cocaine delivery. He has failed to show that he was \u201cless culpable than most <em>other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 944; and we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a minor role reduction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">Cortes next argues that his sentence was unreasonable under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number><em>Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He contends that, in determining his sentence, the district court failed to consider information on the factors provided at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including that he has a wife and three children in Colombia, does not have a prior criminal history, and lacks education and money. In addition, he asserts that the district court failed to consider sufficiently the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities because he and the drug representative on the boat each received a sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was longer than the sentence that one of Cortes\u2019s co-defendants \u2014 who was also a mariner on the smuggling boat \u2014 received.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Cortes was sentenced after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker; </em>so we review his sentence for reasonableness in the light of the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005). Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). A sentence within the advisory Guidelines range is not per se reasonable, <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 787 (11th Cir.2005); but \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. Reasonableness review is \u201cdeferential.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">We conclude that Cortes\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court correctly calculated his Guidelines range as 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment; and the court sentenced Cortes to the lowest point of that range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, in sentencing Cortes, the district court noted the section 3553(a) factors, commenting in particular on Cortes\u2019s poverty and the large amount of drugs involved in this case. The district court judge was not required to discuss all of the section 3553(a) factors at the sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors\u201d). And nothing in the record convinces us that Cortes\u2019s sentence was unreasonable in the light of the section 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">. Except for disputing the district court's decision not to apply a minor role reduction to his sentence, Cortes does not challenge the district court's calculation of his Guideline range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">. The government asserts that, although Cortes asked the district court to sentence him below his Guidelines range based on application of the section 3553(a) factors, his failure to object after sentencing \u2014 either that his sentence was unreasonable or that the district court did not consider properly the section 3553(a) factors in determining his sentence \u2014 indicates that we should review Cortes\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence only for plain error. We need not decide this issue because, even under a reasonableness standard, Cortes's appeal fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
