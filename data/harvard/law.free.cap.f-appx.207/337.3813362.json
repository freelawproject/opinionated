Montague was sentenced to thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Montague contends the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">A defendant may withdraw a guilty plea prior to sentencing if he \u201ccan show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). In determining whether a defendant should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea, a district court should consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-16\">(1) whether the defendant has offered credible evidence that his plea was not knowing or not voluntary, whether the defendant has credibly asserted his legal innocence, (3) whether there has been a delay between the entering of the plea and the filing of the motion, (4) whether defendant has had close assistance of competent counsel, (5) whether withdrawal will cause prejudice to the Government, and (6) whether it will inconvenience the court and waste judicial resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-17\"><em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-18\">The relevant factor at issue in this appeal is whether Montague has credibly asserted his legal innocence. Montague argues that <em>North Carolina v. Allen, </em>359 N.C. 425, 615 S.E.2d 256, 265 (2005) (holding, after <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , statutory maximum is the maximum a defendant can face in light of his criminal history and the facts found by a jury or admitted by defendant), establishes his legal innocence. Montague\u2019s argument is squarely foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246-47 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005) , which holds that <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>Jones, </em>195 F.3d 205 (4th Cir.1999), is still viable after <em>Blakely </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and reaffirms that a prior North Carolina conviction satisfies \u00a7 922(g)(1) if any defendant charged with that crime could receive a sentence in excess of one year. Thus, because it is undisputed that a sentence of over twelve months could be imposed on a defendant convicted of felony breaking and entering a motor vehicle in North Carolina, Montague\u2019s prior conviction was properly considered a predicate felony under \u00a7 922(g)(1). Therefore, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Montague\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Montague\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
