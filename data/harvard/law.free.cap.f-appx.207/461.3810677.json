An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied Yanez\u2019s claim and the Appeals Council affirmed the decision of the ALJ. Treating the decision of the Appeals Council as the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, Yanez filed suit in the district court for the Southern District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Texas seeking judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Yanez and the Commissioner filed cross motions for summary judgment, and the matter was referred to a Magistrate Judge for report and recommendation. The Magistrate Judge recommended that Yanez\u2019s motion for summary judgment be denied, and the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment be granted. The district court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation and entered final judgment dismissing Yanez\u2019s action. Yanez appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Our review is limited to determining (1) whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision, and (2) whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision comports with relevant legal standards. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>174 F.3d 692, 693 (5th Cir.1999). We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the record excerpts, and relevant portions of the record itself. For the reasons stated in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Memorandum and Recommendation, as adopted by the district court, we affirm the decision of the district court to enter final judgment against Yanez.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
