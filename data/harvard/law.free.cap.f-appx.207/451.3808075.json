The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) adopted and affirmed the denial of relief by the immigration judge (IJ). As Barkat has not challenged the denial of his application for asylum, he has abandoned that issue. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003) (issue not briefed by petitioner is deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Barkat argues that: (1) the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for a continuance was an abuse of discretion because Barkat had a pending labor certification request; (2) the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for a continuance and the enforcement of the National Security Entry/Exit Registration System (NSEERS) violated Barkat\u2019s equal protection and due process rights; (3) the IJ\u2019s denial of Barkat\u2019s request for cancellation of removal was erroneous; (4) the IJ\u2019s denial of Barkat\u2019s request for withholding of removal was erroneous; and (5) the IJ erred by failing to conduct a hearing regarding his motion for a continuance and by striking his witness list.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Barkat\u2019s challenge to the denial of his motion for a continuance based upon 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i) and his constitutional rights are foreclosed under Ahmed <em>v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 437-40 (5th Cir.2006). Because Barkat\u2019s challenge to the denial of his application for cancellation of removal solely implicates the exercise of discretion under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider this issue. <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). The assertions contained in Barkat\u2019s testimony were not sufficiently compelling to warrant overturning the BIA\u2019s decision denying withholding of removal under either the INA or the CAT. <em>See Bah v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 348, 352 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Barkat has also failed to show that the IJ violated the local rules when denying his motion for a continuance and striking his witness list. Moreover, Barkat\u2019s due process challenge regarding the striking of his witness list fails because he never made any proffer as to any of the testimony of any listed witness and has not otherwise made any initial showing of substantial prejudice. <em>See Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Barkat\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
