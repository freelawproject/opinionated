Aonso also argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that his imprisonment term exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326 offense charged in his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-22\">The record reflects that the district court considered factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) when it determined that a 70-month term of imprisonment was a fair and reasonable sentence in Aonso\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Aonso\u2019s sentence fell at the lowest end of his properly calculated advisory guidelines range and is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). Aonso has failed to rebut that presumption. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-25\">Aonso\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Athough Aonso contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Aonso properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
