Pena was sentenced to a 96-month term of imprisonment and to a three-year period of supervised release. Pena has appealed his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">Pena contends that the district court erred in considering two prior sentences, imposed in 1984 and 1989, in determining his criminal history category because those sentences were imposed more than 15 years prior to the commencement of the instant offense. Pena also contends that one of those convictions should have been regarded as a juvenile conviction for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">Pena does not dispute that he was tried as an adult for the 1984 offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(l). Because the 1984 conviction resulted in Pena being incarcerated within the 15-year period, the district court properly assigned the sentence three criminal history points. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l); <em>United States v. Arnold, </em>213 F.3d 894, 895-96 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Ybarra, </em>70 F.3d 362, 366-67 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Gipson, </em>46 F.3d 472, 475 (5th Cir.1995). Because the sentence for the 1989 conviction was \u201cimposed\u201d within 15 years of the date of the instant offense, the district court also properly assigned that sentence three criminal history points. <em>See Arnold, </em>213 F.3d at 895; \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-18\">Pena contends also that the district court erred in assigning criminal history points for the 1989 felony conviction and for a 1992 felony conviction because those convictions were a necessary predicate for his conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm and affected the determination of his offense-level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). He argues that consideration of these felony convictions in determining his criminal history category constituted improper double counting. In <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>69 F.3d 11, 14-15 (5th Cir.1995), we held that the Guidelines permit the district court to consider a defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions in calculating both his offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(l) and his criminal history category. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.12). Pena\u2019s double counting argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-19\">Pena contends that the district court violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by making fact findings with respect to his endangerment of a child, drug use, and possession of a weapon in a family household. Because Pena was sentenced after the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Booker, </em>however, Pena was sentenced pursuant to advisory Sentencing Guidelines. Accordingly, the constitutional holdings of <em>Booker, Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), are not applicable. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Pena contends that the district court erred in assigning four levels under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) because the evidence did not show that the firearm, which was found during a search of his residence, facilitated and made more dangerous another crime. Section 2K2.1(b)(5) provides, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">If the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense, increase [the defendant\u2019s offense level] by 4 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). The enhancement should be assessed \u201c \u2018even if the defendant <em>only possesses </em>a firearm in connection with <em>any </em>other felony.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 231 (5th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1196 (5th Cir.1994)). A firearm is possessed \u201cin connection with another felony offense\u201d if the firearm \u201cmay have facilitated or made more dangerous the other felony offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 364 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Pena was charged by state authorities with the offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver\u2014 habitual, based on two controlled purchases by a confidential informant from Pena of small quantities of cocaine. These purchases led to the issuance of a search warrant for Pena\u2019s residence, which resulted in the instant firearms conviction. The firearm, trace amounts of cocaine, a small metal spoon, a large amount of currency, and scales were found in the bathroom of the residence. Four small children resided in the house. At the time the presentence report was prepared, Pena was charged but not yet indicted for child endangerment. Based on these facts, the district court could reasonably infer that the firearm was possessed in connection with either the controlled substance offense or the child-endangerment offense. The district court did not clearly err in enhancing Pena\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Villegas, </em>404 F.3d at 363-64; <em>Washington, </em>340 F.3d at 231; <em>Condren, </em>18 F.3d at 1198-1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Pena contends that the district court should have departed downward from the guideline imprisonment range. This court ordinarily lacks jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s refusal to depart downwardly. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). The record does not support Pena\u2019s contention that the district court was under the erroneous belief that it lacked the authority to grant a downward departure. <em>See id. </em>at 424 n. 5. The district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
