Westphal, </em>230 F.3d 170, 174 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-20\">As a threshold matter, any claims for monetary damages are without merit as Sheffield has not alleged more than a <em>de minimis </em>physical injury. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>716, 718-19 (5th Cir.1999). However, as Sheffield seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, we consider his underlying constitutional claims. <em>See Harper, </em>174 F.3d at 718-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">With respect to Sheffield\u2019s \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection claims under the Fourteenth Amendment, the summary judgment evidence shows that Trevino\u2019s decision to register Sheffield for DNA collection was motivated by a belief that Sheffield had been convicted of compelling prostitution. Sheffield admits telling Trevino that he had been in jail for compelling prostitution. Accordingly, Sheffield has not shown that \u201can illegitimate animus or ill-will motivated [ ] intentionally different treatment from others similarly situated and that no rational basis existed for such treatment.\u201d <em>Shipp v. McMahon, </em>234 F.3d 907, 916 (5th Cir.2000), <em>overruled on other grounds by McClendon v. City of Columbia, </em>305 F.3d 314, 328-29 (5th Cir.2002). The district court did not err in granting summary judgment on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Sheffield also contends that Trevino was motivated by his Muslim faith. Contrary to Trevino\u2019s assertion, Sheffield asserted this claim in the district court, albeit not until he filed his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, and the district court addressed it. Nevertheless, Sheffield failed to submit any competent summary judgment evidence that Trevino ordered the DNA collection based on any unconstitutional religious bias. Sheffield\u2019s conclusory and unsworn assertions that Trevino became upset when he informed her that he was Muslim were insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment, particularly given that they conflicted with Sheffield\u2019s prior accounts of his conversation with Trevino, in which he failed to mention any religious motivation. <em>See Ear son v. Thaler, </em>73 F.3d 1322, 1325 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Sheffield next contends that the DNA extraction violated his Fourth Amendment rights. This claim is without merit in light of our holding in <em>Velasquez v. Woods, </em>329 F.3d 420, 421 (5th Cir.2003). <em>See also Groceman v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>354 F.3d 411 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Sheffield also asserts that his Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment was violated. Sheffield\u2019s vague Eighth Amendment claims in the district court did not put the issue sufficiently before the court. <em>See Vela v. City of Houston, </em>276 F.3d 659, 678-79 (5th Cir.2001). Further, he failed to allege or demonstrate any injury or use of force sufficient to support an Eighth Amendment claim. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Finally, Sheffield complains that the district court did not address his claims pursuant to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1965. These claims were first raised in a supplement to Sheffield\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. As the district court did not address them, we assume that the district court exercised its discretion not to allow Sheffield to amend his complaint to add these claims. <em>See United States v. Riascos, </em>76 F.3d 93, 94 (5th Cir.1996). Given the undue delay in bringing these claims, the fact that a summary judgment motion was pending, and Sheffield\u2019s failure to show why he could not have brought the claims earlier, the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>952 F.2d 841, 846 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
