We find these challenges to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-18\">First, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to preclude cross-examination of Government cooperating witnesses as to the polygraph provision in their plea agreements. It is well-established in this Circuit that poly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>graph examination results, or even the reference to the fact that a witness has taken a polygraph examination, are not admissible. <em>United States v. Prince-Oyibo, </em>820 F.3d 494, 501 (4th Cir.2003). We decline to revisit this <em>per se </em>rule against polygraph evidence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We review Nelson\u2019s assertion of improper bolstering for plain error, as he failed to object at trial. <em>United States v. Jarvis, </em>7 F.3d 404, 410 (4th Cir.1993). He challenges the Government\u2019s questioning of Elliott Porcher, Leones Lesane, Flarantino Rhodes, and Leonard Pelzer, four of its eighteen witnesses, regarding their previous cooperation. We find that, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the Government\u2019s comments constituted improper vouching, there was no prejudice to Nelson. The comments were not such that they could have misled the jury, they were not extensive, there was a plethora of other evidence, including the unchallenged testimony of fourteen other cooperating witnesses, which provided strength of proof of guilt absent the challenged comments, and there is no dispute that the comments were not made deliberately to divert the jury\u2019s attention. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sanchez, </em>118 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>1 F.3d 235, 240 (4th Cir.1993). As the challenged comments did not so infect the trial with unfairness such that Nelson\u2019s conviction resulted from a denial of due process, we reject his claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Nelson\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-11\">The district court sentenced Nelson to a life sentence as to Count 1 and twenty years\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
