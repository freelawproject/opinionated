To obtain reversal of an adverse eligibility determination, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that it does not compel a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief Rusli seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-26\">Similarly, as Rusli does not qualify for asylum, he is ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-18\"> Rusli does not challenge the Board's denial of his application for protection under the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, Rusli has waived appellate review of this claim. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
