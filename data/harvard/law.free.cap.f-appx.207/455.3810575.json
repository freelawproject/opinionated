In May 1990 an Immigration Judge (IJ) determined that Pacheco was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>deportable. In November 2005 Pacheco filed his third motion to reopen, after his two prior motions to reopen were denied. In the BIA ruling that is at issue in the instant petition for review, the BIA denied Pacheco\u2019s third motion to reopen as untimely and numerically barred pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Pacheco argues, inter alia, that the BIA erred when it determined that his motion to reopen was untimely and numerically barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Pacheco\u2019s third motion to reopen, filed in November 2005, was filed more than 15 years after his deportation order and almost a decade after September 30, 1996. His motion was therefore untimely. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>Matter of Goolcharan, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 5, 2001 WL 307091 (BIA 2001). Additionally, as Pacheco had previously filed two motions to reopen, his third motion to reopen was barred by the numerical limitation set forth in \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), which permits only one motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Pacheco\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000). As the BIA\u2019s ruling was not an abuse of discretion, this court need not consider Pacheco\u2019s remaining argument, which addresses the merits of whether he is entitled to adjustment of status. Pacheco\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
