Readon asserts his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. We conclude Readon\u2019s sentence is reasonable, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Sentences imposed under an advisory Guidelines system are reviewed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court must first correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, then, using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court may impose a more severe or lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the available sentences, the applicable Guidelines range, the nature and circumstances of the offense and the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cCongress\u2019s decision to punish crack cocaine offenders more severely than powder cocaine offenders is plainly a policy decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1367 (11th Cir.2006). As \u201c[fjederal courts are not at liberty to supplant this policy decision,\u201d the district court may not consider the disparity between crack and powder cocaine in its consideration of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Readon does not contest the district court\u2019s calculation of his Guidelines range, but only argues the district court failed to appreciate its ability to sentence him below that range. The district court specifically stated the Guidelines were advisory. Further, it expressly considered the factors Readon asserted as mitigating evidence. The court\u2019s explanation for Readon\u2019s sentence, which was within the applicable Guidelines range, evidenced its consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the seriousness of the offense, just punishment, and the history and characteristics of the defendant. The district court correctly refused to consider the disparity in sentences between crack and powder cocaine offenses in determining whether Readon\u2019s sentence was reasonable, as the crack and powder cocaine disparity is an impermissible sentencing factor. <em>See Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1367. We conclude that Readon\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
