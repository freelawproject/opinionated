They contend that overstay is not a deportable offense under the Immigration and Nationality Act and that their asylum application, which they had filed before the expiration of their visas, extended their authorized peri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>od of stay. They further contend that the IJ\u2019s failure to address their concerns about this issue at their evidentiary hearing and the IJ\u2019s determination that they were removable violated their due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">This court has repeatedly held aliens to be deportable for overstaying their visas. <em>See, e.g., Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 592 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Eyoum v. INS, </em>125 F.3d 889, 890-91 (5th Cir.1997). Furthermore, the petitioners have not cited any statutes or case law in support of their argument that their filing of an asylum application alone extended their authorized period of stay. The record does not support the petitioners\u2019 due process argument, and the IJ did not violate the petitioners\u2019 due process rights in correctly concluding that the petitioners were removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Accordingly, the petitioners\u2019 petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order is DENIED. All of the petitioners\u2019 outstanding motions and petitions are also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
