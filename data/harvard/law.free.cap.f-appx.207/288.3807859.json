Because the Trustees did not abuse their discretion in deny<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ing O\u2019Quinn\u2019s claim, we reverse and remand with instructions to enter summary-judgment in favor of the Trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">O\u2019Quinn, a former miner for Clinchfield Coal Company (Clinchfield), injured his back in January 2001 while attempting to exit a mantrip and move through a mantrap door.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An administrative law judge later found that O\u2019Quinn was disabled due to his injury, and O\u2019Quinn was awarded social security disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">O\u2019Quinn separately applied for disability pension benefits under the Plan. The Trustees denied O\u2019Quinn\u2019s application on the ground that his disability was not caused by a \u201cmine accident\u201d as required by the Plan. J.A. 201. O\u2019Quinn sought administrative review of this decision and submitted additional evidence in support of his claim. After a hearing, the Trustees upheld the denial of disability benefits. Relying on a rule interpreting the Plan, the Trustees concluded that O\u2019Quinn\u2019s disability did not result from a \u201cmine accident\u201d because it \u201cwas not caused by the exertion or impact of some external physical force or object against [O\u2019Quinn\u2019s] body or by the exertion or impact of [his] body against some external physical object.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">O\u2019Quinn later brought this action alleging that the Trustees improperly denied his claim for disability benefits. Both O\u2019Quinn and the Trustees moved for summary judgment. The district court held that the Trustees had abused their discretion in denying O\u2019Quinn\u2019s claim. The court determined that O\u2019Quinn\u2019s disability was caused by a \u201cmine accident,\u201d concluding that \u201cthere was force and impact exerted on O\u2019Quinn\u2019s body\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">0\u2019Quinn[ ] was not just simply bending over into a crouched position. [He] bent over, squatted, fell to his knees and turned all in the same motion and was in the process of pulling himself through the mantrap door when he was injured. Falling to one\u2019s knees and pulling oneself through a door is an exertion of the body against some external physical object as required by Q <em>&amp; </em>A 252, and, thus, any disabling injury suffered thereof, is the result of a mine accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-11\"><em>O\u2019Quinn v. Trs., UMWA Health &amp; Ret. Fund, </em>395 F.Supp.2d 387, 391 (WD.Va.2005) . Accordingly, the district court granted O\u2019Quinn\u2019s summary judgment motion and denied the Trustees\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">The Trustees contend that the district court erred in reversing their denial of disability benefits to O\u2019Quinn. We review the district court decision de novo. <em>See Donovan v. Eaton Corp., Long Term Disability Plan, </em>462 F.3d 321, 326 (4th Cir.2006) . When, as here, an ERISA disability pension plan commits eligibility decisions to the discretion of the plan administrator, we review those decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>See McCoy v. Holland, </em>364 F.3d 166, 169-70 (4th Cir.2004). In so doing, \u201cwe will not disturb such a decision if it is reasonable.\u201d <em>Booth v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Assocs. Health &amp; Welfare Plan, </em>201 F.3d 335, 342 (4th Cir.2000). While we may consider a variety of factors in assessing whether a plan administrator\u2019s decision is reasonable, <em>see id. </em>at 342-43, the only factor seriously in question here is whether the evidence considered by the Trustees supports their decision, <em>see McCoy, </em>364 F.3d at 170. Thus, \u201cthe Trus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>tees\u2019 decision is reasonable if it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Under the Plan, a miner is eligible for a disability pension if, <em>inter alia, </em>he \u201cbecomes totally disabled as a result of a mine accident.\u201d J.A. 236. Although the Plan does not define \u201cmine accident,\u201d an interpretive rule adopted by the Trustees, \u201cQ <em>&amp; </em>A 252,\u201d imposes three requirements for determining that a miner is \u201cdisabled as [a] result of a mine accident\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">(1) <em>Unexpectedness: </em>The disability must have been unlooked for and unforeseen;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">(2) <em>Definiteness: </em>The disability must be traceable to a definite time, place and occasion which occurred within the course of the mine worker\u2019s employment ....;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">(3) <em>Force or impact: </em>The disability must have been caused by the exertion or impact of some external physical force or object against the body or by the exertion or impact of the body against some external physical object; i.e., <em>not simply as a result of the mine worker\u2019s own physical condition.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 277 (internal quotation marks omitted; final emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, the Trustees contest only the third requirement, maintaining that O\u2019Quinn\u2019s injury was not caused by a \u201c[fjorce or impact\u201d within the meaning of Q <em>&amp; </em>A 252. The Trustees contend that substantial evidence supports their determination that the injury involved neither an external force or impact against O\u2019Quinn\u2019s body nor an exertion or impact of his body against an external object. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-18\">Clinchfield\u2019s accident report on O\u2019Quinn\u2019s injury mentions no external force or impact involving O\u2019Quinn\u2019s body. That report states that O\u2019Quinn \u201cgot out of [a] mantrip, bent forward and turned to go through [a] man door and felt something pull in his back.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. Nor do O\u2019Quinn\u2019s medical records describe an external force or impact in connection with the injury. For example, a record based on an examination of O\u2019Quinn the day after the incident describes the injury as follows: \u201c[O\u2019Quinn] was getting out of a man-trip to check a gas meter. He was trying to squat and turn at the same time on the left side. At that time, he heard a snapping noise in his low back area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147. Other medical records similarly describe the injury without mentioning an external force or impact. <em>See id. </em>at 83 (stating that O\u2019Quinn \u201cgot out of a mantrip backwards,\u201d \u201c[b]ent over, squatted, and turned all at the same time to go through a mandoor,\u201d and \u201cfelt something move in his back\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 142 (\u201c[O\u2019Quinn] states that as he was going into the mines ..., having parked his man-trip, [he] turned to get out of the man-trip, and ... felt \u2018something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>move in [his] lower back.\u2019\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 158 (\u201c[O\u2019Quinn] had ridden a mantrip into a section, and on getting out of it ... he backed out, turned and squatted at the same time to get low enough to go through a man door. When he turned and squatted, he felt something \u2018move\u2019 in his lower back, and felt a funny sensation in the left side of his body.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">There is some evidence suggesting that an external force or impact occurred in connection with O\u2019Quinn\u2019s injury. O\u2019Quinn testified at the administrative hearing that \u201cwhen he stepped backwards off the man trip, <em>he fell to his knees </em>to crawl through the man door, all in the same motion, and felt something move in his back.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18 (emphasis added). The hearing officer declined to credit O\u2019Quinn\u2019s testimony, however, noting that none of the records documenting O\u2019Quinn\u2019s injury described a fall or other external force or impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the Trustees\u2019 determination that O\u2019Quinn\u2019s injury did not involve an external force or impact and therefore that his disability was not caused by a \u201cmine accident.\u201d Although the district court determined that O\u2019Quinn fell to his knees at the time of his injury, most of the record evidence tends to show that O\u2019Quinn\u2019s injury occurred when he turned and squatted to go through the mandoor. <em>Cf. Vance v. Holland, </em>22 F.Supp.2d 529, 534 (W.D.Va.1998) (\u201cLower back pain associated with rising up or straightening up from a crouched position does not constitute a mine accident in the absence of an external physical force or impact.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>175 F.3d 1018 (4th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (unpublished table decision); <em>Allen v. Holland, </em>36 F.Supp.2d 325, 329 (S.D.W.Va.1997) (holding that claimant\u2019s allegation that he suffered low back pain \u201cwhile bent over or while standing\u201d did not satisfy definition of \u201cmine accident\u201d because claimant \u201cfaile[d] to show evidence of force or impact as required by Q &amp; A 252\u201d). And, while the district court found that O\u2019Quinn was pulling himself through the mantrap door when he was injured, nothing in the record supports that finding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the grant of summary judgment to O\u2019Quinn and remand with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of the Trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\">. The district court explained that \"[a] man-trip is a vehicle used to transport miners and supplies, and a mantrap is a metal door often found in block walls constructed in the mines for ventilation or other purposes.\u201d <em>O'Quinn v.

Q &amp; A 252 further lists several examples of circumstances in which a miner can be considered \"disabled as [a] result of a mine accident\u201d under this three-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">(a) a miner strikes himself with his own tool;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">(b) a miner slips and falls;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-13\">(c) a miner falls or strikes a stationary object while jumping out of the way of roof fall;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">(d) a miner falls down a mine shaft;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-15\">(e) a miner inhales a poisonous gas;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-16\">(f) a miner jumps across a beltline and lands in such a way that he suffers a disabling injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-19\">(g) a miner falls off a truck;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-20\">(h) a miner jumps out of the way of an oncoming piece of mine equipment and falls against a hard surface;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-21\">(I) a miner bumps his head on a solid object;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-22\">(j) a miner injures his back lifting a heavy object in the normal course of his job;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-23\">(k) a miner suffers a heart attack while pushing a heavy object in the normal course of his job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-24\"><em>Id. </em>at 277-78 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\">. O'Quinn argues that even if the Trustees reasonably determined that he was not involved in a \"mine accident\u201d as interpreted by Q &amp; A 252, that interpretive rule is contrary to the language and purpose of the Plan. We find no merit to this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
