Dismissal under the three strikes provision of \u00a7 1915(g) is reserved for those persons defined as prisoners. Perkins is civilly committed and not considered a prisoner. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(h) (2000); <em>Michau v. Charleston County, S.C., </em>434 F.3d 725, 727 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2936, 165 L.Ed.2d 961 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Despite the fact that the dismissal under \u00a7 1915(g) was improper, we affirm on alternate reasoning. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>395 F.3d 516, 519 (4th Cir.2005) (finding that court is not limited to grounds offered by district court for its decision but may affirm on any grounds apparent from the record). Perkins\u2019 complaint is clearly frivolous as he failed to state a claim of cruel and unusual punishment or deliberate indifference to medical needs. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">Accordingly, we grant Perkins\u2019 motion to proceed in forma pauperis and affirm the distinct court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
