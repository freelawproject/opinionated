The AZTECA was owned and operated by Mar\u00edtimas Mexicanas S.A. de C.V. (\u201cMarMex\u201d), a Mexican shipping company partially owned by Grupo TMM, S.A. (\u201cTMM\u201d) (collectively, \u201cAppellants\u201d). The TOTANCA was owned by Perforaciones Mar\u00edtimas Mexicanas, S.A. de C.V. (\u201cPMM\u201d). As a result of the allision, MarMex filed a limitation of liability action in Mexico, and a limitation fund was established in October 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">In July 2005, Perforaciones Exploraci\u00f3n y Producci\u00f3n (\u201cProtexa\u201d) and certain reinsuring Underwriters subscribing to Reinsurance Policy No. AHE-030044 as Amended to Policy No. AHE-04004 (the \u201cUnderwriters\u201d) (collectively, \u201cAppellees\u201d) filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in Galveston for damages sustained by the TOTANCA during the allision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants filed a motion to dismiss the suit on three grounds: lack of subject matter jurisdiction, international comity, and <em>forum non conveniens.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On July 21, 2006, the district court issued an order denying Appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss, ruling that the suit fell within the court\u2019s admiralty jurisdiction, that the principles of international comity did not warrant dismissal, and that dismissal based on <em>forum non conveniens </em>was also unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">Appellants filed a notice of appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(3), which provides for federal appellate jurisdiction over interlocutory decrees \u201cdetermining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(3). Appellees move to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the district court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss is not an appealable interlocutory order because it is not a \u201cdecree ... determining the rights and liabilities of the parties\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1292(a)(3). Appellants disagree. According to Appellants, the district court\u2019s order determines their rights because it \u201cdenies [their] substantive right to limit their liability and further denies [their] substantive right to have claims arising out of the allision at issue heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>and determined in Mexico under Mexican law.\u201d Appellants assert that the order \u201cignores the Mexican limitation action\u201d and effectively increases the Mexican limitation fund by subjecting Appellants to potential liability in the United States. Therefore, Appellants argue, the order ignores and/or extinguishes their substantive right to limit their liability under Mexican law.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u201cTo be appealable under section 1292(a)(3), the decree must determine the substantive rights and liabilities of the parties to the case.\u201d <em>Francis ex rel. Francis v. Forest Oil Corp., </em>798 F.2d 147, 149 (5th Cir.1986). Courts construe this jurisdictional grant narrowly. <em>Treasure Salvors, Inc. v. Unidentified Wrecked &amp; Abandoned Sailing Vessel, </em>640 F.2d 560, 564 (5th Cir.1981); <em>accord Blue Water Yacht Club Ass\u2019n v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>355 F.3d 139, 141 (2d Cir.2004). Even if an order has important procedural consequences, it is not appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(3) if it does not determine the parties\u2019 substantive rights and liabilities. <em>In re Ingram Towing Co., </em>59 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The district court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss did not determine Appellants\u2019 substantive rights or liabilities. The district court did not decide whether Appellants were entitled to limit their liability under Mexican law, nor would such a determination be appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(3), given that the underlying issue of liability has yet to be determined. <em>See Bucher-Guyer AG v. M/V Incotrans Spirit, </em>868 F.2d 734, 735 (5th Cir.1989) (holding that \u201c[t]he decision whether the $500 COGSA limitation on damages applies in this case is not a decision determining the rights and liabilities of the parties\u201d). What the district court decided was that the suit fell within the court\u2019s admiralty jurisdiction and that the suit could be heard in Galveston, Texas. Such decisions do not determine the rights or liabilities of the parties for purposes of \u00a7 1292(a)(3). <em>See Austracan (U.S.A.), Inc. v. M/V Lemoncore, </em>500 F.2d 237, 240 (5th Cir.1974) (\u201cDenial of a motion to dismiss for lack of admiralty jurisdiction does not decide the parties\u2019 rights so as to be within the statute ... authorizing interlocutory appeals in admiralty from orders that determined rights and liabilities of parties.\u201d) (citing <em>Jack Neilson, Inc. v. Tug Peggy, </em>428 F.2d 54, 55 (5th Cir.1970) (holding that \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction did not decide the parties\u2019 rights and liabilities within the meaning of the statute\u201d because \u201c[i]t did not go to the merits of the claim\u201d)). Accordingly, this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal under \u00a7 1292(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal is GRANTED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
