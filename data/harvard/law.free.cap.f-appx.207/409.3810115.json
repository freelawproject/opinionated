He argues for the first time on appeal that his Texas conviction for unlawful restraint did not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii)(2004) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-18\">Our review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (2005). The 16-level enhancement is to be made only if the prior offense is a violation of a statute that has as an element \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 255 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). The Texas unlawful restraint statute provides for the commission of the offense in a number of different ways, some of which do not require the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against a person. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 20.01 &amp; 20.02 (Vernon 1995). Because the Texas statute does not require that such use of force be proved as an element of the offense, the district court plainly erred in assigning the 16-level enhancement. <em>See Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d at 259-61; <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 275 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). This error affected his substantial rights and affected the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceedings. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 275. Accordingly, Eugenio\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
