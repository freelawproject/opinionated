By moving for IFP in this court, Andrew is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted because Andrew\u2019s appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-22\">The district court determined that Andrew\u2019s challenge to her conviction was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U. S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and that Andrew\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims were based on delusional factual allegations. Andrew does not brief any argument as to the dismissal of her claims based on <em>Heck. </em>Accordingly, any such challenge Andrew could have raised in regards to this claim is deemed abandoned. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Our review of the record convinces us that the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous of Andrew\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim was not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>abuse of discretion. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">As Andrew\u2019s appeal is without any arguable merit, we dismiss it as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. We caution Andrew that the dismissal by the district court and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each count as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). If Andrew accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), she will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while she is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless she is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">MOTION FOR IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
