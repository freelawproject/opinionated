Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987). According to the records of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Juarez-Jimenez was released from custody on March 3, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>To the extent that Juarez-Jimenez appeals his conviction, his appeal is not moot simply because his term of imprisonment has expired. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). However, because Juarez-Jimenez\u2019s term of imprisonment has expired, Juarez-Jimenez\u2019s appeal is moot to the extent that it challenges his sentence of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>529 U.S. 53, 60, 120 S.Ct. 1114, 146 L.Ed.2d 39 (2000); <em>United States v. Ramon, </em>320 F.3d 519, 519-20 (5th Cir.2003). Nevertheless, Juarez-Jimenez\u2019s appeal is not moot to the extent that it challenges the supervised release portion of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Lares-Meraz, </em>452 F.3d 352, 355 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Juarez-Jimenez argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 30-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Juarez-Jimenez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Juarez-Jimenez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Juarez-Jimenez renews his argument, preserved in the district court, that in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), his Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court assessed an eight-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Where, as here, an error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), has been preserved in the district court, we \u201cwill ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless the error is harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Government bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 285. In order to carry this burden, the Government must show that the <em>Booker </em>error did not affect the sentence, <em>i.e., </em>it must show that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">The Government concedes <em>Booker </em>error. However, it contends that the error was harmless because it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have imposed a lesser sentence if the Guidelines had been advisory rather than mandatory at the time of Juarez-Jimenez\u2019s sentencing. It notes that the district court imposed a sentence at the top of the guideline range and that the district court found the sentence adequately addressed the sentencing objectives of punishment and deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">The imposition of the maximum sentence within the guideline range alone is insufficient to establish that the <em>Booker </em>error was harmless beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>doubt. <em>See United, States v. Woods, </em>440 F.3d 255, 258-59 (5th Cir.2006). In light of <em>Woods, </em>there is nothing in the record which' demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under the post-<em>Booker </em>advisory sentencing regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Accordingly, the Government cannot meet its burden, and Juarez-Jimenez\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
