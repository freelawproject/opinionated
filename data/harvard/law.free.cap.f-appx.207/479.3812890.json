Rodriguez filed a <em>Bivens</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>suit alleging that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. The district court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim, denied Rodriguez\u2019s motion for IFP, and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP here, Rodriguez is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d\u2019 <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Rodriguez argues that the district court erroneously concluded that the defendants were not deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. Rodriguez fails to show that the defendants refused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs. <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001). Rodriguez\u2019s medical records show that he was examined repeatedly and received extensive treatment and objective tests for his back, shoulder, and flu-like symptoms. These records rebut his claims of deliberate indifference. <em>See Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1995). At most, Rodriguez has alleged a disagreement with the course of his medical treatment, which is insufficient to state a claim. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">With the benefit of liberal construction, Rodriguez also argues that the district court erred by not providing him with copies of the medical records submitted by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The district court properly ordered the BOP to submit copies of the records as part of its screening of this prisoner-rights case. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997). Rodriguez\u2019s assertion that he also should have received copies of the records may be arguable on the merits. However, the magistrate judge accurately summarized, in some detail, the medical records, and Rodriguez has not contested the factual accuracy of the magistrate judge\u2019s report. Further, as noted above, the records establish that the defendants were not deliberately indifferent, and the error, if it existed, was harmless. Therefore, Rodriguez\u2019s motion for IFP is granted, but the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">MOTION FOR IFP GRANTED; AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
