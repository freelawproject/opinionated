The district court determined that Posival\u2019s claims would be properly raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion but that construing the petition under \u00a7 2255 would render it successive and unauthorized. The district court also held that Posival could not proceed under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Posival argues that the evidence was insufficient for a sentencing enhancement based on a stolen firearm and that he should be allowed to proceed under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He also asserts that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely </em>constitute an intervening change in the law, that his trial and appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance, and that he is actually innocent. The district court properly determined that Posival\u2019s claims should be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion and that such a motion would now be successive. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, </em>211 F.3d 862, 867 (5th Cir.2000). Posival\u2019s argument that he should be permitted to proceed under the savings clause is unavailing in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
