Jenkins was found guilty after a jury trial of conspiracy to commit prostitution, two counts of interstate transportation in furtherance of prostitution, and three counts of inducing travel for prostitution. He was sentenced to seventy months\u2019 imprisonment. On his original appeal, Jenkins challenged the denial of his motion to suppress; contested his sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); and asserted that his sentencing enhancements were improper. We upheld Jenkins\u2019 convictions, vacated his sentence, and remanded for resentencing under <em>Booker. </em>We declined to reach the merits of Jenkins\u2019 challenges to his enhancements. On remand, the district court adopted its prior sentencing reasoning and denied Jenkins\u2019 challenges to his sentencing enhancements. The court then reimposed a seventy-month sentence and noted that, even in the absence of the obstruction of justice enhancement,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the court would still have sentenced Jenkins to seventy months.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>On appeal, Jenkins\u2019 attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising numerous issues. In addition, Jenkins has filed a pro se supplemental brief. After an independent review of the record, we affirm Jenkins\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">While recognizing that, under the advisory guidelines system, a district court determines an applicable guideline range based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, Jenkins nonetheless asserts that obstruction of justice is an exception and such an enhancement should only be based on a jury finding or admission. However, we have determined that <em>Booker </em>did \u201cnot in the end move any decision from judge to jury, or change the burden of persuasion.\u201d <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 121, 166 L.Ed.2d 91 (2006). Thus, a defendant\u2019s sentence is determined the same way after <em>Booker </em>that it was before; the only change is the degree of flexibility judges enjoy in applying the system. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err in calculating Jenkins\u2019 guideline range based on its factual conclusion that he had obstructed justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Next, Jenkins asserts that the district court erred in stating that, even in the absence of an obstruction of justice enhancement, his sentence would have been the same. Jenkins contends that the district court was required to consider the enhancement, and thus, were it removed, his sentence should have been reduced. However, the district court spoke in a hypothetical manner. The court determined that Jenkins had obstructed justice and calculated his guideline range based on that finding. Thus, anything the court may have done in the absence of such a finding is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">Jenkins asserts that the district court erred in determining that there were at least five victim prostitutes for grouping purposes under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2G1.1, 3D1.4 (2003). The defendant concedes that there were three victim prostitutes who were transported across a state boundary. He further concedes that there were four additional women who participated in prostitution. However, he asserts that there was insufficient evidence to show that the additional women crossed state lines in order to participate in prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">The commentary to USSG \u00a7 2G1.1 defines \u201cvictim\u201d as a person who is \u201ctransported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced to engage in, or travel to engage in, a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2G1.1, comment. (n.5). Section 2Gl.l(d)(l) instructs that \u201c[i]f the offense involves more than one victim, Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be applied as if the promoting of a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to each victim had been contained in a separate count of conviction.\u201d Section 3D1.4 provides for an increase in offense levels based on the grouping of offenses. Here, the district court determined that there were seven separate victims, counted each as a separate count of conviction, and assessed the defendant with an additional five levels under \u00a7 3D1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">Contrary to Jenkins\u2019 contentions, there is no requirement that a prostitute be transported or travel across state lines to be considered a victim under \u00a7 2G1.1. Interstate travel is not mentioned in the relevant guidelines or commentary. Further, a victim would satisfy the commen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>tary requirements if she were merely induced or enticed to commit a commercial sex act. Because Jenkins does not dispute that the four additional women were prostitutes working for him, the district court properly counted them as victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Jenkins\u2019 offense level was increased by four levels for his leading role in the commission of the offense. Under USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), two requirements must be met for a four-level increase based on a defendant\u2019s leading role in the commission of the offense to apply. First, the sentencing court must conclude that the defendant acted as \u201can organizer or leader of a criminal activity,\u201d and second, the court must find that the criminal activity \u201cinvolved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d Jenkins asserts that the district court erred in considering the prostitutes as victims for the grouping purposes described above and also as part of the organization for the purpose of determining that it was \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">For purposes of \u00a7 3B1.1, a victim can only be considered a participant if the victim assisted in the promoting of a commercial sex act with respect to another victim. USSG \u00a7 2G1.1, comment, (n.3). However, in assessing whether an organization is \u201cotherwise extensive,\u201d all persons involved during the course of the entire offense are to be considered, even if those persons are not \u201cparticipants\u201d under the guidelines. USSG \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3). Because the number of prostitutes involved could properly be considered when considering whether the activity was extensive, the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Next, Jenkins argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to depart from the guideline range based on the fact that his criminal history category overstated the seriousness of his criminal record. A sentence within a properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). A defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439). However, \u201ca district court need not explicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 632 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 20, 2006) (No. 05-11659).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Here, the district court issued a comprehensive sentencing order after Jenkins\u2019 first sentencing which was adopted at the second sentencing. This order discussed the merits of each of the issues raised at the second sentencing as bases for a variance from the guideline range. While the order was addressing these bases in the context of the calculation of the guideline range, the district court\u2019s rejection of the merits of each basis would also support the district court\u2019s decision not to impose a variance sentence. <em>See United States v. Castro-Juarez, </em>425 F.3d 430, 434-35 (7th Cir.2005) (recognizing that <em>pre-Booker </em>decisions analyzing upward or downward departures under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 are useful in determining whether increasing or decreasing the sentence for similar reasons was reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">We find that the district court was within its discretion to conclude that Jenkins\u2019 criminal history, which included a violent offense and repeated probation violations, weighed against a sentence below the guideline range. Thus, the court\u2019s decision to sentence Jenkins to the low end of the guideline range was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Finally, Jenkins argues that his crime was essentially a local crime that generally would have been handled in state court. He asserts that his prostitutes crossed state lines (thus, conferring federal jurisdiction) only because Jenkins worked in the D.C. area, where D.C., Maryland, and Virginia converge. He contends that, had he been sentenced in state court, he would have received a significantly lower sentence. Thus, he argues that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">First, Jenkins provides no statistics or proof showing that his sentence would have been shorter in state court. Second, the district court considered this argument in its written order and found that the crossing of state lines was intentional and that discouraging crime in the D.C. area was an important goal. Finally, we have concluded that, in the vast majority of cases, a sentence lowered in order to be more comparable to a similar state sentence will improperly create sentencing disparities among federal sentences and, thus, be unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>434 F.3d 684, 687-88 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). In addition, we noted that proof of state/federal sentencing disparities was required before relying on such a factor to impose a variance sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 688 n. 2. Because Jenkins did not support his contentions and because the district court properly considered the substance of Jenkins\u2019 arguments, Jenkins\u2019 sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Jenkins has filed a pro se supplemental brief raising the following claims: (1) the district court failed to order an updated PSR, (2) his sentence should have been reduced based on lack of coercion or force, (3) the district court improperly assessed an obstruction of justice enhancement, and (4) there was <em>Booker </em>error in calculating his guideline range. Our review of the record shows that these claims are merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in its entirety and found no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm Jenkins\u2019 sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. Thus, we deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may renew her motion at that time. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-10\"> This enhancement was based on an instant message Jenkins sent to a business associate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>and Government witness after the conclusion of the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
