Smarr argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the evidence did not establish that he committed the offense for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain. We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish that Smarr participated in an illegal alien smuggling operation and that members of the operation received sums of money to help the illegal aliens enter the United States illegally and travel within the United States. The evidence was sufficient to support Smarr\u2019s conviction. <em>See United, States v. Nolasco-Rosas, </em>286 F.3d 762, 765 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v.
