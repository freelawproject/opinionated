Garcia-Galeano argues that his sentence must be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing because the district court committed reversible error by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He also contends that his sentence pursuant to a mandatory Guidelines regime was a structural error. Garcia-Galeano concedes that his claim of structural error is foreclosed by circuit precedent, <em>see United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005), but he raises the argument here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-23\">Garcia-Galeano\u2019s sentence pursuant to a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime constitutes <em>Fanfan </em>error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). Garcia-Galeano preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>challenge in the district court by raising an objection based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and the Government so concedes. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397, 404 (5th Cir.2006). We review a preserved <em>Fanfan </em>challenge for harmless error. <em>Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 463-64; <em>cf. United States v. Mendoza-Blanco, </em>440 F.3d 264, 265 n. 7 (5th Cir.2006). The Government thus bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory only. <em>See id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-24\">The sentencing transcript is silent on whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory Guidelines scheme. The Government thus has not met its burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court\u2019s error was harmless. <em>See id. </em>We therefore vacate Garcia-Galeano\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-25\">Garcia-Galeano next argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 57-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Garcia-Galeano\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Garcia-Galeano properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Garcia-Galeano\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
