An immigration judge (IJ) ordered Dada to be removed but granted his request for voluntary departure. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Dada filed a motion to reopen on the ground that he was seeking adjustment of status, and he sought leave to withdraw his request for voluntary departure. The BIA denied Dada\u2019s motion to reopen on the ground that, because he failed to leave the United States by the imposed deadline for voluntary departure, he was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-23\">In this petition for review, Dada argues that the BIA erred by (1) finding him to be statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1229c(d) and (2) denying his motion to reopen despite the IJ\u2019s denial of Dada\u2019s request for a continuance. The BIA\u2019s interpretation of the applicable statutes rendering Dada ineligible was reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>able. <em>See Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 387, 389-91 (5th Cir.2006). The IJ did not abuse its discretion by denying Dada\u2019s request for a continuance. <em>See Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 438-39 (5th Cir.2006). Dada\u2019s arguments challenging the IJ\u2019s decision and the BIA\u2019s affirmance of that decision are not cognizable within his petition for review, which was directed at the BIA\u2019s denial of Dada\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Dada has failed to show that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303-04 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
