Shapiro, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the dismissal of his \u201cappeal,\u201d which the district court construed as a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil complaint, for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Liberally construing his appellate briefs, Shapiro challenges this dismissal. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-30\">Shapiro\u2019s \u201cappeal\u201d was apparently based on a 1993 Georgia state court civil contempt proceeding. The district court construed Shapiro\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleading as a chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>lenge to Judge S. Lark Ingram\u2019s failure to recuse herself from an action to which Shapiro was a party. The district court further stated that it appeared that Shapiro was found in contempt and was displeased with that ruling. The district court found that it lacked jurisdiction, under the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine, over Shapiro\u2019s challenge to his contempt finding and Judge Ingram\u2019s denial of Shapiro\u2019s motions for her recusal. In addition, the district court found that Judge Ingram was absolutely immune from damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), for failure to state a claim <em>de novo. Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). We also review a grant of judicial immunity <em>de novo. Smith v. Shook, </em>237 F.3d 1322, 1325 (11th Cir.2001). We \u201cmay affirm the district court where the judgment entered is correct on any legal ground regardless of the grounds addressed, adopted or rejected by the district court.\u201d <em>Bonanni Ship Supply, Inc. v. United States, </em>959 F.2d 1558, 1561 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Upon review of Shapiro\u2019s pleadings, we agree that Shapiro\u2019s main complaint was Judge Ingram\u2019s denial of two motions he filed seeking her recusal. We are uncertain whether Shapiro alleged that he was wrongfully found in contempt, or whether he alleged that the court violated his rights by failing to rule on the contempt charge. Furthermore, based on the pleadings before the district court at the time of its dismissal, it appears, although it is by no means clear, that state court proceedings were still ongoing. Regardless of the status of the state court proceedings at the time of the district court\u2019s dismissal, the court\u2019s dismissal is due to be affirmed; even if the district court applied the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine prematurely, comity concerns warrant abstention under <em>Younger</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as to injunctive relief, and Judge Ingram is entitled to absolute judicial immunity from damages. <em>See The News-Journal Corp. v. Foxman, </em>939 F.2d 1499, 1510 n. 13 (11th Cir.1991) (recognizing that incomplete state court review made federal suit premature under <em>Younger, </em>but, once state court review was final, federal review would have been barred by Rooker-Feldman).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">A. <em>Younger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">Although abstention is the exception and not the rule, \u201c[fjederal courts should abstain from exercising their jurisdiction if doing so would \u2018disregard the comity between the States and the National Government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wexler v. Lepore, </em>385 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). For abstention to be triggered, (1) the federal injunction must \u201ccreate an \u2018undue interference with state proceedings,\u2019 \u201d and (2) \u201cthe state proceedings at issue must involve \u2018certain orders that are uniquely in furtherance of the state courts\u2019 ability to perform then\u2019 judicial functions ... it has never been suggested that <em>Younger </em>requires abstention in deference to a state judicial proceeding reviewing legislative or executive action.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u2018We interpret the <em>Younger </em>doctrine as preventing federal courts from being the grand overseers of state courts and court-like administration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341. <em>Younger </em>abstention applies to civil proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1339. The Supreme Court has recognized that a state\u2019s interest in its contempt process is of sufficient im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>portanee to warrant the application of <em>Younger </em>and that a federal court\u2019s interference with this process constitutes undue interference with a state\u2019s legitimate activities. <em>Juidice v. Vail, </em>430 U.S. 327, 335-36, 97 S.Ct. 1211, 1217-18, 51 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Shapiro essentially sought to overturn Judge Ingram\u2019s orders. This would have required the district court to direct Judge Ingram to reverse her prior rulings, effectively telling the state court how to run its contempt proceeding. Thus, any injunctive relief granted in this case would unduly interfere with state court proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 335-36, 97 S.Ct. at 1217-18. This interference would relate to one of Judge Ingram\u2019s judicial functions \u2014 whether or not to recuse herself. To the extent that Shapiro challenged other decisions relating to a finding of contempt, administration of the case, and an evidentiary ruling, these also implicate Judge Ingram\u2019s judicial functions. Because of this direct interference with the judicial functions of a state court, comity would have warranted the district court\u2019s abstention as to any pending matters. <em>See Wexler, </em>385 F.3d at 1339, 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">B. Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Judges are entitled to absolute judicial immunity from damages for those acts taken while they are acting in their judicial capacity unless they acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. This immunity applies even when the judge\u2019s acts are in error, malicious, or were in excess of his or her jurisdiction. Whether a judge\u2019s actions were made while acting in his judicial capacity depends on whether: (1) the act complained of constituted a normal judicial function; (2) the events occurred in the judge\u2019s chambers or in open court; (3) the controversy involved a case pending before the judge; and (4) the confrontation arose immediately out of a visit to the judge in his judicial capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\"><em>Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1070 (11th Cir.2005) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">To the extent that Shapiro sought damages, Judge Ingram is entitled to judicial immunity. Shapiro complains about rulings that Judge Ingram made during a contempt proceeding, Georgia Superior Courts have jurisdiction to punish for contempt, <em>see </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-1-4, and the pleadings neither allege nor provide grounds to suggest that Judge Ingram acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. <em>See Sibley, </em>437 F.3d at 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">C. <em>Rooker-Feldman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine provides that federal courts, other than the Supreme Court, lack jurisdiction to review the final judgments of state courts. <em>Amos v. Glynn County Bd. of Tax Assessors, </em>347 F.3d 1249, 1265 n. 11 (11th Cir.2003). <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>applies when the following four criteria are met: (1) the party in federal court is the same as in the state court; (2) the state court ruling was a final or conclusive judgment on the merits; (3) the plaintiff in federal court had a reasonable opportunity to raise his federal claims in the state court proceeding; and (4) the issue before the federal court was either adjudicated by the state court or inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s judgment. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] party\u2019s ability to raise a claim on appeal constitute^] a reasonable opportunity to raise the claim.\u201d <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Maryland, Inc. v. Weiner, </em>868 F.2d 1550, 1555 (11th Cir.1989) (citing <em>Wood v. Orange County, </em>715 F.2d 1543, 1548 (11th Cir.1983)). \u201cA federal claim is inextricably intertwined with a state court judgment \u2018if the federal claim succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Siegel v. LePore, </em>234 F.3d 1163, 1172 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., </em>481 U.S. 1, 25, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 1533, 95 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987) (Marshall, J., concurring)). Assuming that there was a final judgment on the merits at the time of the dismissal, the district court correctly dismissed the case based on <em>Rooker-Feldman. See Goodman ex rel. Goodman v. Sipos, </em>259 F.3d 1327, 1333 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>bars claims that essentially seek to challenge a state court judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">D. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Judge Ingram has absolute immunity from damages. Either <em>Younger </em>abstention principles or the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine precluded Shapiro\u2019s attempt to challenge Judge\u2019s Ingram\u2019s rulings in the district court. In light of the foregoing, the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-7\">. <em>Rooker v.
