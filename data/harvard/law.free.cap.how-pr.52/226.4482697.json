For it may be that the judgment appealed from may be reversed, and it may yet be determined in the action that the same was maintainable, and the attachment properly and legally issued and levied.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">The plaintiff having based her cause of action upon the seizure of her property under the attachment, until it be formally adjudicated, in the action in which the attachment was issued, that the plaintiffs therein had no cause of action against the plaintiff in this suit, and no valid ground for the issuance of the attachment, their proceedings cannot be called unlawful in taking the property in question under the process in that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action becomes complete only when final judgment is rendered in his favor in the attachment suit. But with an appeal pending the judgment of dismissal cannot be considered final, nor the action to be ended. Nor can we try here, for the purposes of this action, the merits of the suit in which the attachment was issued ; nor give them any available consideration as long as that action is undetermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">There should be judgment for the defendant on the demurrer, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
