This ground, with a specification of certain alleged errors in rulings upon the trial, is now urged for a new trial upon a case. But it was early decided that a verdict will not be set aside merely to give the plaintiff an opportunity to recover nominal damages <em>(Brantigham </em>agt. <em>Foy, </em>1 <em>Johns. Cas., </em>256). <em>Randall </em>agt. <em>Butler </em>(10 <em>Wend., </em>119) was an action for libel, where the jury found a verdict for the defendant. The court refused to grant a new trial, although it was a case in which the verdict should have been for the plaintiff, with at least nominal damages <em>(Van Slyck </em>agt. <em>Hogeboom, </em>6 <em>Johns., </em>270; <em>McCombe </em>agt. <em>N. Y. and Erie R. R. Co., </em>20 <em>N. Y., </em>495-498). I am referred to no case in which the rule, apparently well settled, has been departed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">I do not think that upon any ground urged I can interfere with the verdict, and the motion for a new trial must be denied;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
