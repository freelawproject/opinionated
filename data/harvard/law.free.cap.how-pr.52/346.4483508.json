The relator was awarded $5,600 by three commissioners appointed, by the county court of Onondaga county. The report of said commissioners was made and presented to the common council, and ordered filed on the 11th day of December, 1871. According to the charter of the city of Syracuse, it then became the duty of the common council to pass resolutions directing the completion of the proceedings. Nothing further was done in the matter until the 13th day of October, 1873, when the common council adopted a resolution rescinding its former action, and declaring all proceedings taken pursuant thereto abandoned and discontinued. No proceedings were instituted or attempted by the relator in respect thereto until the 29th of June,\u2019 1875, when an alternative writ of mandamus was allowed, to compel the common council to go on and complete the proceedings to acquire the title to the lands of the relator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The common council filed their return, and a motion was then made by the relator for a peremptory writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-5\"><em>George F.

Y., </em>144, and conclusions were reached by the court of appeals that seem to weaken the case in 25 <em>Howard </em>as an authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\"><em>In the Matter of Syracuse, Binghamton and N.

That result was sustained by the general term in this department (S<em>ee also Hudson R. R. R.
