Smith (through one Fisher, his agent), $185.75; eighty-five dollars and seventy-five cents of this amount was to pay for the interest then due on the said bond and mortgage) and the balance $100, for extending the mortgage for three years \u2014 to November 1, 1877 \u2014 and said Fembacher delivered to him a paper, of which the following is a copy :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\">\u201c Rec\u2019d, New York, Nov. 16th, 1874, of Mr. F.

The defendant Smith alone answered, and set up as a defense:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-11\">First. That by the payment of the $100, the bond and mortgage became void by reason of usury, in the receipt of said sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-12\">Second.

Counsel for the defendants claimed that the extension of the mortgage also extended the time of the payment of interest, and that no action could be commenced for non-payment of either principal or interest until November 1, 1877, although default was made in the payment of the interest due November 1, 1875.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-4\"><em>Joseph, </em>Bellesheim, attorney, <em>A, C. </em>Anderson, of counsel, for plaintiff.

It is there held, that where a mortgagor paid to a holder of the mortgage $1,000 in addition to the lawful interest, to secure an extension of the time within which to pay the debt secured by the mortgage, that the security given for the original debt was not impaired by such payment, but the amount so paid should be applied as a payment on the mortgage debt.</p>\n<p id=\"AQD\">By the payment of $100, besides the lawful interest, the mortgagor secured an extension of the mortgage for three years. It is claimed by the counsel for the mortgagor that the extension postpones the payment of interest as well as principal for the period named. I think this is a strained and unnatural construction. The bond accompanying the mortgage requires the interest to be paid semi-annually. The receipt for the payment of the $100 does not refer to the bond. I think the time for the payment of interest remains <em>unaltered; </em>and there being a default in the payment of an installment, according to the terms of the bond, the action for foreclosure is properly brought, and there should be judgment for foreclosure and sale.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
