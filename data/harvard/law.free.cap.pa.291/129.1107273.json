Judgment was entered accordingly. Since this decision prevented the four children of testatrix from conveying a fee in certain real estate which they had sold to Harry <em>G. </em>Smith, the petitioner in the proceeding for the declaratory judgment, they have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The petition for the judgment recited, in brief, that William F. Bennett, Daniel M. Bennett, Margaret A. Hurrell and Jennie B. Flenniken, the children of testatrix, with the wife of D. M. Bennett and the husband of Margaret A. Hurrell, had undertaken to convey, for the sum of $2,760, a fee simple title to certain real estate, which the four .first named claim as devisees under the will of their mother; that a question of law had arisen between the vendors and vendee as to whether the above devisees possessed a fee simple estate which they could convey to a purchaser, and that this question involved the construction of the before-mentioned will. The four children of testatrix, with their several spouses, where any, and, in addition, all the adult children of such children, were included as parties to the proceeding, also the Pennsylvania Trust Company of Pittsburgh as guardian of several minor grandchildren of the testatrix, and the Potter Title &amp; Trust Co., of the same city, as trustee of the estates of unborn grandchildren. The petition sets forth that the eleven grandchildren named therein were all living at the date of the will and at the time of the death of testatrix; it also designates their parents, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In the will, testatrix, after stating a desire to \u201cdispose\u201d of her estate, and naming two of her children to have \u201cjurisdiction over the disposal of [her] clothing, linens, bedding [and] bric-a-brac,\u201d provides as follows: \u201cThe remainder of my estate to be equally divided between [my four children] Daniel M. Bennett, William F. Bennett, Margaret A. Hurrell and Jennie B. Fien<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>niken,* * * *My children are to have share and share alike <em>as long as they live </em>and in case of their death their share is to revert to their children.\u201d (The italics are by the writer of this opinion.) The question which this devise raises is, whether thereunder the four above-named children of testatrix take life estates in the realty here in controversy or fee simple interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Before entering upon a consideration of the question just put, it should be stated that the provisions represented by the asterisks in the above quotation are briefly as follows: Immediately after the name of Jennie B. Flenniken there is a comma, and then the will reads thus: \u201cafter all just claims against it [the estate of testatrix] be satisfied &amp; $100.00 to be set aside on interest the interest to be expended each year in careing for graves (and lot in the cemetery) of my immediate family, $100.00 to be given to each of my grandchildren [naming them, eleven in all]. The above amount to be given when lo't[s] are sold to that amount, my four children to be executors. In case of the death of any of the above named grandchildren before receiving the sum of $100.00 the same revert to my direct heirs. If my children act as executors [no bond to be required]. All just claims against my estate to be satisfied and a stone to be placed at my grave......With the exceptions of $10.00 [paid on cemetery lot by testatrix and M. J. Bennett, entitling them both to' burial there] the lot belongs to D. M. Bennett.\u201d All of the matter just recited is inserted between the first and last parts of the devise to appellants previously quoted; then testatrix states, \u201cI desire that my bed and furnishings go to Lou Jane Bennett, she having no mother to provide such for her\u201d; and, finally, \u201cIt is my will that Jennie Flenniken have $300.00 for caring for me when I had a broken hip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqJ5\">Appellants contend that, in construing the devise here in controversy, the words of gift, first contained therein, must be accepted (under section 9 of the Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 249, reenacted by section 12 of the Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>June <em>7, </em>1917, P. L. 403, 407) as conferring an absolute fee simple estate, and that the subsequent words, to the effect that they, the devisees, were \u201cto have share and share alike as long as they lived and in case of their death their share to revert to their children,\u2019\u2019 must be construed in such a way as not to cut down this prior absolute gift to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We agree with the court below that the present is not a case like Cross v. Miller, 290 Pa. 213, and others of its kind, where the will, after devising a fee to children, indicated, by subsequent language, a secondary intent to strip the estate thus given of some of its inherent qualities; on the contrary, taking the testamentary provisions now before us as a whole, they show a clear purpose to give but life estates to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The will evidently was drawn by Elizabeth Bennett herself; while she may have been ignorant of the precise and technical meanings of certain words employed, yet testatrix evidently knew how she wanted to dispose of her estate, and the sense in which she used the words \u00f3r expressions in question becomes reasonably clear, in each instance, when their context and the will as a whole is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">It may be conceded that the first words in the general devise to the children of testatrix, if these words stood alone, would be sufficient, under the above-mentioned acts of assembly, to give appellants fee simple estates, but this legislation particularly provides that devises without \u201cwords of inheritance,\u201d shall not vest a fee where the will indicates, \u201cby words of limitation or otherwise,\u201d an intention \u201cto devise a less estate\u201d; and that is this case, as will now be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Granting that, \u201cin the construction of a will of doubtful meaning, every intendment is made in favor of the heir or next of kin\u201d (Nebinger\u2019s Est., 185 Pa. 399, 404; Brush\u2019s Est., 277 Pa. 9, 13), and that \u201cthe law leans in favor of an absolute, rather than a defeasible estate\u201d (Smith\u2019s App., 23 Pa. 9, 11; Jackson\u2019s Est., 179 Pa. 77, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>83; Carter\u2019s Est., 254 Pa. 565, 568); further, that, where real estate is devised subject to the payment of bequests to others, this is an indication that more than a life estate was intended for the first taker (Coane v. Parmentier, 10 Pa. 72, 73; Fidelity Trust Co. v. Bobloski, 228 Pa. 52, 55); also granting that, death being a thing certain to happen, where a testator speaks of what is to occur to a gift in the event of the death of the first beneficiary named by him, death is generally construed to mean dying in the lifetime of the testator (Mickley\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 514, 517; Shornhorst v. Jacob, 272 Pa. 223, 225; Freeman\u2019s Est., 281 Pa. 190, 195; Seewald\u2019s Est., 281 Pa. 483, 486); yet none of these considerations, urged by appellants to sustain their contention that they are vested with estates in fee, can control where, as in this case, the will shows that only life estates were intended for the children of testatrix, and that the reference to their deaths meant death after that of their mother, \u2014 and not during her life, as appellants would have us decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">As shown by the longer of the two excerpts above quoted from the will (see paragraph four of this opinion), testatrix provides \u201cin case of the death\u201d of any of her named grandchildren before receiving the $100 which she leaves to each of them, that sum is to \u201crevert\u201d to the \u201cdirect heirs\u201d of testatrix, meaning her four children. In this gift of $100 to each of her grandchildren, testatrix directs that the amounts in question are to be paid only when lots belonging to her estate are sold to raise the money required for that purpose, stating at this point that her four children are to be executors, and assuming, apparently, that they would sell the lots. All of this plainly shows that, when testatrix provided, \u201cin case of the death of any of the above named grandchildren before receiving the sum of $100.00, the same [was to] revert to [her] direct heirs,\u201d she meant in the event of the death of any of the grandchildren after her own death; for, of course, the lots in question could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>sold as part of her estate (to^ pay the bequests to her grandchildren) until after her death. Testatrix having used the phrase \u201cin case of the death of\u201d to mean death after her own death, in connection with these bequests to her grandchildren, when we find precisely the same phrase used, a few lines later on, in connection with her children, each should be given a like meaning unless there is good reason to the contrary (Martin v. Grinage, 289 Pa. 473, 484, 485); and there is nothing to suggest that testatrix intended the phrase under discussion to have one meaning in connection with her grandchildren and quite another meaning in connection with her children. Moreover, and particularly, since testatrix provides in the general devise to her children, that they are \u201cto have share and share alike as long as they live,\u201d it is obvious this must mean as long as they live after the death of the giver of such shares, for the estate would not come into existence so that anyone could share therein prior to that event. \u201cThe rule of construction\u201d relied on by appellants, \u201cwhereby a devise over, in the event of the death of the first taker, is generally understood to mean death occurring in the lifetime of the testator, applies only when the will itself shows no other period to which the words may, on a proper interpretation, be referred; and the rule is never applied where the first takers referred to are treated as living at a period subsequent to the death of testator\u201d: Mebus\u2019s Est., 273 Pa. 505, 516. This rule has no place here, where, as we have shown, the grandchildren are named in the will as devisees with an interest which vested at the death of testatrix, and not as mere substitutionary devisees, to benefit only in the event of the death of their parents during the life of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Appellants, to sustain their claim of a fee, further contend that, when the will said, in case of the death of testatrix\u2019s children, their share was to \u201crevert to their children,\u201d the word \u201crevert\u201d was used as a synonym for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\u201cdescend,\u201d meaning to descend directly from the first takers, as a source of inheritable succession, to their issue indefinitely; and, in this connection, appellants argue that \u201cchildren,\u201d as last employed, was intended merely as a word of limitation. While the word \u201crevert,\u201d as here used, requires some consideration, \u2014 which we shall presently give it, \u2014 yet we are not impressed that testatrix employed it in an endeavor to install her children as a source of inheritable succession, or that she used \u201cchildren\u201d in other than its primary meaning as a word of purchase, as distinguished from one of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">When considering the proper construction to be put upon this word \u201crevert\u201d where testatrix provides that in case of the death of her children \u201ctheir share is to revert to their children,\u2019\u2019 it must be remembered that Elizabeth Bennett obviously wrote her own will, and that the language employed in any particular instance, when not clear, should be given her meaning, so far as this can be gathered from the writing as a whole, rather than a fixed technical meaning, where the latter conflicts with the former. The legal signification of \u201crevert\u201d is for property to go b\u00e1ck to and lodge in a former owner, who parted with it by creating an estate in another, which has expired (Words and Phrases, 2d ed. 6213; Anderson Law Dictionary, 899), or to return to and lodge in the heirs of such former owner; but it is plain that the word was not used with this strict technical meaning in the provision now under consideration, for testatrix could neither have intended the property with which she was dealing to return to herself, as devisor, nor to her children, as heirs, since she specifically provided that the reversion was to be to \u201ctheir children,\u201d \u2014 that is, her grandchildren. There are ample precedents (as will be shown in the course of this opinion) for using the word \u201crevert\u201d as one of devise, to create remainders to take effect after the expiration of particular estates, and this no doubt is what testatrix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>wanted to accomplish in the present instance. She intended, by the use of \u201crevert\u201d and its context, to provide that, upon the death of her children (the first takers), the respective shares enjoyed by them during life were to go to their children as remaindermen, and to accomplish that result, it was not necessary to say, \u201cI give and devise\u201d such an interest to such devisees; any phraseology which, from its context and the will as a whole, shows an intention to make the gift is sufficient for the purpose: Packer\u2019s Est. (No. 2), 246 Pa. 116, 127; Rau\u2019s Est., 254 Pa. 464, 471; Brown\u2019s Est., 289 Pa. 101, 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">While our research has disclosed no other Pennsylvania case where the word \u201crevert\u201d appears in a devise) or where, in the construction of a will, this particular word was given the meaning of carrying a gift to ..remaindermen, yet there are numerous instances in other jurisdictions where it has been so interpreted. In the following cases \u201crevert\u201d was construed as a word of gift, with the meaning of \u201cto go to,\u2019\u2019 and as sufficient to carry the property in question to remaindermen, after the expiration of a particular estate, just as in the present case: see Beaty v. Trustees, etc., 39 N. J. Eq. 452, 463; Bennett\u2019s Est., 134 Cal. 420, 66 Pac. 370; Johnson v. Askey, 190 Ill. 58, 60 N. E. 76, 77; Goerlitz v. Malawista, 56 Hun. 120, 80 N. Y. Supp. 832, 833; Warrum v. White, 171 Ind. 574, 86 N. E. 959, 960; Blackwell v. Blackwell, 147 Ky. 264, 143 S. W. 1010, 1011. See also Snell Exrs. v. Snell, 38 N. J. Eq. 119, 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">After deliberating on every part of this will, we find no support for appellant\u2019s contention that \u201crevert\u201d was used by testatrix as a synonym for \u201cdescend.\u201d In the first place, the word is used in connection with \u201cchildren,\u201d which is prima facie a word of purchase, and this means \u201cacquiring an estate otherwise than by descent\u201d (Anderson Law Dic. 846). Then the word \u201cdescend\u201d conveys the thought of constantly going onward from one generation to another; \u201crevert,\u201d of going back, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>some manner or to some extent. Therefore, the latter would hardly be employed by anyone as an outright substitute for the former. Here, so far as can be judged from the light thrown by the will as a whole on the part now before us for construction, testatrix, when writing this particular provision, instead of conceiving, as the law does, of the simultaneous passing from the devisor to the life tenants and ultimate beneficiaries of both the life estates and remainders, apparently thought of her property as moving forward from her to her children, and, on their deaths, back, as it were, to her estate, so that it might serve as a conduit to carry the remainders on to her grandchildren; and, by the use of the word \u201crevert,\u201d she probably sought to express the last two ideas, \u2014 of the property going back, in the sense just stated, from the life tenants, then on to the remaindermen. But, whether this surmise as to the mental operations of testatrix be correct or not, in both instances where she employed the word \u201crevert/\u2019 warrant may be found for that course (as we have shown), and the last use of it, to create remainders, has considerable judicial support, as indicated by the decisions cited from other jurisdictions, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In connection with the $100 gifts to the grandchildren of testatrix (see paragraph <em>\u00e1 </em>of this opinion), even appellants agree that \u201crevert\u201d was intended to have its common meaning of returning to an original source; that is to say, if a grandchild should die before receiving its $100, the right to that $100 was to go back to the children of testatrix, the devisees for life of the whole residuary estate subject to these $100 payments. This prior use of the word \u201crevert\u201d with a somewhat different meaning from its subsequent use in the general devise to appellants, cannot be allowed to govern or influence our construction of the latter, because it is quite plain, as we have shown in this opinion, that the word was used on each occasion to accomplish a different purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Finally, this is not a case where the assumption, sometimes made, that children, or heirs at law, were the special care of a devisor, can be allowed controlling effect, for the will shows that this devisor had in mind the desire to benefit her grandchildren quite as much as to care for her children; and the fact that, at one. point in the instrument, testatrix refers to the latter as her \u201cdirect heirs\u201d has no significance as indicating a special, or exclusive, care for them, since by that expression-, as used, she evidently meant no more than \u201cfirst takers.\u201d The will as a whole shows that testatrix intended just what she said, that these first takers, her four children, were to have the property here in question, share and share alike, so long as they might live, and since the will shows that she meant live after her oavu death, and there is a limitation over, of each share, at the death of the holder, to his or her children, these first takers have but life estates, as correctly determined by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Prior to the construction of this will in the proceeding now before us, it was passed upon by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County, in distributing the personal property of testatrix, and that tribunal also reached the conclusion stated by the court below, \u2014 namely, that appellants are entitled to no more than life estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">It is not necessary to discuss any of the numerous authorities contained in the briefs of counsel, for none of them governs here, but it may not be amiss to mention two recent cases which touch upon points and involve principles more or less relevant to the present controversy; these are Martin v. Grinage, supra, and Reif v. Pepo, 290 Pa. 508. The other cases hereinbefore cited are named, not as governing precedents, but because they are illustrative of the points, or contain good statements of the rules, in connection with which they are severally mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The judgment is affirmed at cost of appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
