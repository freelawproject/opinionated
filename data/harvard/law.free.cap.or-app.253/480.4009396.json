On October 8, 2009, Detective Floyd, a sergeant with the Coos County Sheriffs Department and director of the South Coast Interagency Narcotics Team (SCINT), applied by telephone for a warrant to search defendant\u2019s residence, <em>viz., </em>a recreational vehicle (RV), and an outbuilding, described as a silver \u201cQuonset hut style shop\u201d (the shop). Floyd\u2019s telephonic affidavit supporting the application contained the following information.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">On January 14, 2006 \u2014 almost 45 months earlier\u2014 Floyd had seized a commercial quantity of crystal methamphetamine from defendant at the shop. On October 8, 2009 \u2014 the same day that Floyd applied for the search warrant \u2014 Floyd had responded to a call from Larson, a parole and probation officer, indicating that defendant and another person, Burback, had been the subject of a traffic stop very early that morning. Larson told Floyd that both men \u201cwere on his case load for the possession of methamphetamine\u201d and that he wanted to conduct a home visit to make sure that defendant was not violating the terms of his supervision by possessing methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The officers went to defendant\u2019s address, where defendant was living in the RV. Burback was also present, as was a third person, Hasner. Defendant gave Larson consent to search the RV, and Larson promptly found approximately a quarter of a gram of methamphetamine and a \u201cmeth pipe with residue.\u201d The methamphetamine was in a bindle attached with a magnet to a metal box that defendant identified as belonging to him. Hasner, who had been living in the RV with defendant for over three months, refused consent to search her property, including another metal lock box located next to the box with the methamphetamine attached to it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Floyd knew from previous police contacts that defendant\u2019s mother occupied another structure on the property. He contacted her, and she told him that defendant spent a lot of time in the shop, where he had set up an office with a computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Floyd\u2019s affidavit also recounted his law enforcement training and experience; the extent of that testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">\u201cI am a Sergeant and Director of the South Coast Interagency Narcotics Team, and I have been a Deputy with the Coos County Sheriff\u2019s Department for over thirteen years and have over seventeen years of total law enforcement experience, which includes four years as a Reserve Deputy for the Coos County Sheriff\u2019s Office. I have attended the Oregon Department of Public Safety Standards and Training Academy, DPSST[,] and currently hold an advanced Police Certificate, that [as] part of my training as a police officer[,] I\u2019ve had on the job training and experience related to the investigation of possession of controlled substance specifically in methamphetamine. As part of my training I\u2019ve received instructions in all facets of law enforcement. That from this said training I have knowledge of State Statute that I can apply for a Telephonic Search Warrant. That during my tenure as a police officer I\u2019ve been involved in over fifty related investigations involving possession of methamphetamine and I\u2019ve also assisted in at least ten search warrants that have been issued during these investigations that have led to the arrests, successful prosecution and the subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>prosecution of suspects and that I\u2019ve applied for Telephonic Search Warrants in the past and recovered items of the initial search.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Based on the above, Floyd asserted that he had probable cause to believe that defendant and Hasner \u201care in possession of methamphetamine\u201d and that \u201cevidence of said crimes is located in the [RV] and * * * shop under the control and/or custody of [defendant] and [Hasner].\u201d The evidence to be seized included \u201ca quantity of Methamphetamine/ Amphetamine\u201d and \u201cmethamphetamine/amphetamine and marijuana distribution paraphernalia,\u201d as well as a comprehensive list of items, such as documents, records, computer equipment, photographs, receipts, cash and currency equivalents, and the like,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">\u201call of which are fruits, evidence and instrumentalities] of crimes!,] that is, the manufacture of methamphetamine/ amphetamine, the possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine/amphetamine, and the distribution of methamphetamine/amphetamine, a conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and to possess methamphetamine/ amphetamine by [defendant] or Hasner [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The trial court authorized the warrant, and Floyd, Larson, and another officer executed it, finding, in the RV, \u201ctally sheets,\u201d scales, packaging materials, syringes, a smoking pipe or \u201csnort tube,\u201d evidence of defendant\u2019s domicile at the address, a blackjack, and several bindles containing methamphetamine. They also found $851.02 in cash on defendant\u2019s person. No evidence was seized from the shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the search on the ground that \u201cthe search warrant affidavit fails to recite probable cause sufficient for a warrant to issue.\u201d In an affadavit supporting the motion, he contended that, other than the fact of the discovery of a quarter gram of methamphetamine and the pipe with residue, \u201cnothing was added by the affidavit to support issuance of a search warrant for anything more than the crime for which probable cause already had been established.\u201d At the hearing on his motion, defendant argued that \u201cthe search warrant affidavit did not recite enough additional information to go beyond what was originally searched for and found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, determining that the affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause based on the following facts: the discovery of the drugs, in a container associated with a locked box, and the pipe; defendant\u2019s criminal history involving commercial drug activity; and defendant\u2019s association with Burback, \u201cwho has a documented drug history,\u201d on two occasions within a 24-hour period.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">As noted above, after a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of unlawful delivery of methamphetamine and unlawful possession of methamphetamine, both as commercial drug offenses under ORS 475.900(l)(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">On appeal, defendant contends that the court erred in denying his suppression motion because the facts in the affidavit supporting the search warrant \u201cdo not support a reasonable conclusion that it was more likely than not that defendant had more drugs in his home.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Boldface omitted.) In support of that view, he contends that the information about prior drug activity on the property should not be considered because it is stale and the recent discovery of a \u201cpersonal use\u201d amount of drugs is not sufficiently similar to \u201crefresh\u201d it. He also argues that the other facts, specifically, observation of a \u201cuser amount of methamphetamine and a smoking pipe\u201d and the fact that defendant was in the company of another person who was also on supervision for a drug crime, are insufficient, either individually or collectively, to establish probable cause to issue the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The state, on the other hand, disputes that the information about defendant\u2019s 2006 drug activity is stale, contending that it is \u201cstill probative because of all the new information in the affidavit.\u201d In the state\u2019s view, taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>together, defendant\u2019s drug history, his fraternizing with another person with a known drug history, the discovery of methamphetamine attached to a \u201clock box\u201d in his residence, and his spending a lot of time in the shop that he had previously used as a drug distribution center could support a reasonable magistrate\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat it is more likely than not that evidence of drug activity would be found on the premises.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of an affidavit supporting a magistrate\u2019s issuance of a warrant, we consider \u201cwhether a neutral and detached magistrate could conclude, based on the facts and circumstances shown by the affidavit, that there was probable cause to believe that the search would discover things specified in the affidavit in the places requested to be searched.\u201d <em>State v. Castilleja, </em>345 Or 255, 270, 192 P3d 1283, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>345 Or 473, 198 P3d 937 (2008).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We consider \u201call inferences that fairly may be drawn from those facts to determine whether probable cause exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The probability standard \u201crequires more than a mere possibility, but less than a certainty.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>178 Or App 163, 167, 35 P3d 1111 (2001) (citations omitted). In other words, the information \u201cmust be such that a reasonable person could conclude that it is <em>more likely than not </em>that the objects of the search will be found\u201d at the locations to be searched. <em>State v. Castro, </em>194 Or App 109, 115, 93 P3d 815 (2004) (emphasis in original omitted; other emphasis added). We agree with defendant that the affidavit in this case fell short of that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">As a starting point, we have held that the current possession of a small amount of illegal drugs in a person\u2019s home does not give rise to probable cause to search the home for additional drugs. <em>See, e.g., State v. Mepham, </em>46 Or App 839, 613 P2d 500 (1980). In <em>Mepham, </em>an officer who was attempting to arrest the defendant for attempting to obtain drugs unlawfully went to the defendant\u2019s house and saw, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>through an open doorway, a container of marijuana on a coffee table. The officer submitted a search warrant request, supported by an affidavit in which he set out those facts. <em>Id. </em>at 842 n 1. The warrant issued and evidence was discovered. The trial court suppressed the evidence (except for that which was in plain view of the officers), reasoning that \u201cobservation of a container of marijuana does not give rise to probable cause to believe that more drugs would be found in the residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842. The state appealed, and we affirmed. Echoing the trial court, we concluded that nothing in the affidavit \u201cwarrant [ed] the reasonable suspicion that the container was not the household\u2019s entire supply.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">We reached the same result in <em>State v. Kittredge/ </em>Anderson, 36 Or App 603, 585 P2d 423 (1978), where the only facts supporting issuance of the warrant were that a confidential reliable informant had seen marijuana 96 hours earlier at the premises that the officers sought to search. We held that, without additional information about, for example, the quantity of marijuana seen, in whose possession it was seen, or the prior history of the suspects, the affidavit did not permit an inference that it was probable that there would continue to be drugs at the premises. <em>Id. </em>at 606-07; <em>accord State v. McGee, </em>45 Or App 13, 15, 607 P2d 217 (1980) (affidavit reciting only that a confidential reliable informant was in the defendant\u2019s residence within 48 hours before the affidavit was executed and, while there, observed a \u201cquantity of marijuana,\u201d was insufficient to establish probable cause to search the residence for marijuana).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Instead, additional facts beyond the current possession must be presented to establish the probability that further evidence of criminal activity will be found at the suspected location. For example, as we observed in <em>Kittredge!Anderson, </em>\u201c[i]f large quantities [of marijuana] were observed, there would exist at least a permissible inference that *** the premises were being used as a market for the sale of marijuana.\u201d 36 Or App at 606; <em>see also McGee, </em>45 Or App at 15 (under <em>Kittredge /Anderson, </em>a further detailing of \u201chow much marijuana was seen in the house, who normally occupied the house, who actually possessed the marijuana, *** whether the suspect had a history of drug use or dealings,\u201d or \u201cother relevant facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>might have rendered the affidavit sufficient to establish probable cause\u201d); <em>State v. Black/Black, </em>36 Or App 613, 617, 585 P2d 44 (1978) (evidence of long history of drug dealing and observation of various kinds of drugs on the suspected premises on many occasions supported probable cause to search the premises); <em>cf. State v. Miebach, </em>52 Or App 709, 713, 629 P2d 1312, <em>rev den, </em>291 Or 771 (1981) (distinguishing <em>Mepham </em>on the basis that the affidavit contained additional relevant facts, including two recent occasions on which the affiant was present when the defendant was arrested for crimes involving controlled substances).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Here, the affidavit established the presence of only a small quantity of methamphetamine in defendant\u2019s home\u2014 specifically, a quarter of a gram \u2014 and a pipe containing residue, both of which suggest personal use of the drug. In other words, neither of those facts supports an inference that defendant was engaged in the <em>sale </em>of methamphetamine from the location, which, in turn, could establish the probability that additional quantities of the drug would be discovered in defendant\u2019s residence and property. Accordingly, we look to the additional details set forth in the affidavit to see whether they are sufficient, when combined with those facts, to make it probable that additional drugs \u2014 or other evidence of drug activity \u2014 would be found at the location. <em>Kittredge </em>/ <em>Anderson, </em>36 Or App at 606-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Those details are sparse. First, the affidavit states that, approximately 45 months earlier, law enforcement officers had seized a commercial quantity of crystal methamphetamine from defendant at the same location. As noted, defendant contends that that information was \u201cstale,\u201d and, therefore, simply should not have been considered in determining whether probable cause existed to support issuance of the warrant. Although defendant acknowledges that otherwise stale information can be \u201crefreshed\u201d by more recent information indicating continuing criminal activity, in his view, that concept is inapplicable in this case because the recent drug discovery is \u201cso different in kind\u201d from the prior activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In <em>State v. Gale / Rowden, </em>105 Or App 489, 496-97, 805 P2d 158, <em>rev den, </em>311 Or 427 (1991), we explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u201c[a]lthough probable cause to search must exist when a warrant is issued, \u2018that does not mean that, simply because some information in an affidavit is old, a magistrate must exclude it when deciding whether the requisite probable cause exists.\u2019 <em>State v. Howell, </em>93 Or App 551, 559, 763 P2d 179 (1988), <em>rev den, </em>307 Or 405 (1989). Rather, the information presented must be evaluated in its <em>totality. [Id.] </em>The lapse of time after which information becomes stale depends on all the circumstances. <em>State v. Ingram, </em>251 Or 324, 327, 445 P2d 503 (1968).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">(Emphasis in original.) We have also emphasized that \u201c[e]vidence that conduct has continued over time can support an inference that it was ongoing at the time the warrant was issued.\u201d <em>State v. Chase, </em>219 Or App 387, 393, 182 P3d 274 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Here, the current discovery of drugs at the same location as the prior seizure of drugs provides an indication that some criminal drug activity was ongoing at the suspected location. It is thus distinguishable from <em>Castro, </em>upon which defendant relies for his contention that the prior information must be excluded from consideration. In <em>Castro, </em>we held that 16-month-old information regarding a methamphetamine production and distribution operation at a certain residence was insufficient to establish probable cause that criminal activity would still be occurring at that location, where the only recent information was of a drug transaction between a prior occupant of the residence and a third party at an undisclosed location. 194 Or App at 119. Thus, and significantly, in <em>Castro </em>(and unlike in the present case), there was <em>no recent </em>information connecting criminal activity with <em>the location that was the subject of the search warrant application. </em>It was on that basis that we also distinguished <em>Castro </em>from cases in which we had approved the use of even older information, specifically <em>Gale / Rowden, </em>105 Or App at 497-98 (holding that the trial court erred in not considering two-year-old information that the defendant was involved in manufacturing methamphetamine, given a two-week-old report of the discovery of a methamphetamine lab near the defendant\u2019s residence), and <em>Howell, </em>93 Or App at 556-59 (concluding that seven-year-old information about the defendant\u2019s marijuana-growing operation at one location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>and more recent observations of the defendant\u2019s activities and power usage data at a different location was sufficient to provide probable cause to believe that evidence of a marijuana-growing operation would be found on both properties).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">On the other hand, as defendant emphasizes, the nature of the recent criminal activity on the premises \u2014 that is, the discovery of a small amount of drugs there on the day the warrant request was made \u2014 differs significantly from the prior activity. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>186 Or App 186, 193, 62 P3d 861 (2003) (character of the crime or thing to be seized is a factor in the staleness analysis). Specifically, the 2006 information, because it involved the seizure of a \u201ccommercial quantity\u201d of methamphetamine, indicated that defendant was involved in a drug distribution operation on the premises. The recent information, in contrast, tends toward a suggestion of personal use rather than the continuation of a drug-distribution operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Considered in the totality of the circumstances, <em>Gale / Rowden, </em>105 Or App at 497, we conclude that, even if the information about the nearly four-year-old seizure is not impermissibly stale, it is, nonetheless, insufficient to allow the reasonable conclusion that evidence of drug distribution would probably be found on defendant\u2019s property. <em>See Johnson, </em>186 Or App at 192-93 (eight-year-old conviction for possession of less than one ounce of marijuana of little, if any, significance in determining probable cause to search for evidence of a marijuana-growing operation). Nor does the other recent information in the affidavit \u2014 that defendant was serving post-prison supervision for possession of methamphetamine, associating with another person under supervision for a possession offense, and spending time in the shop \u2014 support an inference that defendant continued to be engaged in the distribution of methamphetamine on the property. <em>See id. </em>at 193 (the fact that Johnson, one of the defendants, knew Barkau, the other defendant, \u201cis hardly a basis on which one reasonably could conclude that Johnson was engaged in criminal activity with Barkau\u201d). And, there is nothing in the affidavit that might provide the necessary linkage. There is no averment from the officer regarding, for example, the typical recidivist behavior of drug dealers or why, based on the officer\u2019s training and experience, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>possession of a user amount of drugs by a former dealer or consorting with another prior drug offender <em>might </em>indicate that defendant was continuing to deal in illegal substances. <em>See State v. Goodman, </em>328 Or 318, 328, 975 P2d 458 (1999) (\u201cFacts derived from training and experience may contribute [the] necessary factual nexus in a determination of probable cause.\u201d); <em>Wilson, </em>178 Or App at 171 (under <em>Goodman, </em>the weight to be given to representations derived from an officer\u2019s training and experience \u201cdepends on the totality of the facts contained in the affidavit\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The affidavit is also insufficient to support a reasonable inference that additional \u201cuser\u201d amounts of methamphetamine or methods of ingestion (containing traces or other evidence of the drug) would probably be found on defendant\u2019s property. As to that issue, our analysis in <em>State v. Kolb, </em>251 Or App 303, 283 P3d 423 (2012)\u2014 although it involves the less stringent standard of reasonable suspicion \u2014 is helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In <em>Kolb, </em>we considered whether a defendant\u2019s manifestations of recent drug use supported reasonable suspicion that the defendant possessed evidence of the crime of unlawful possession of a controlled substance sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>to justify the stop of the defendant. The officer testified, based on his training and experience, that \u201c [p]eople who usually are under the influence had to obviously take the methamphetamine. It\u2019s very common that they have pipes, needles, syringes, paraphernalia with them when they are under the influence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 307. The trial court agreed, reasoning that it was a \u201cfair inference\u201d that a person under the influence of a controlled substance would have the substance in his or her possession in the form of residue on implements used to ingest the substance. <em>Id. </em>at 308. In reversing the trial court, we discussed the impermissible stacking of inferences that was required to reach that conclusion. As we explained, \u201c [i] f the premises collectively are impermissibly speculative, or if any of the premises is individually insupportable, the stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313. Applying that principle, we seriously questioned whether it was permissible for the trial court to infer from the officer\u2019s testimony that persons under the influence of methamphetamine would not only possess implements of that use but would also retain those implements \u2014 a connection that was not explicit from the officer\u2019s testimony. Even if that were a permissible inference, however, the remaining inferences required to arrive at reasonable suspicion of possession \u2014 that retained implements often bear evidence of prior use and that that proposition applies specifically to methamphetamine use\u2014 were entirely speculative. <em>Id. </em>at 314. Nothing in the officer\u2019s testimony, we held, would substantiate those premises; therefore, the trial court erred in concluding that the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion based on the proposition that the defendant likely possessed the instrumentalities used to ingest the substance. <em>Id. </em>at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">In this case, the affidavit must satisfy the more demanding standard of probable cause. <em>See State v. Daniels, </em>234 Or App 533, 538, 228 P3d 695, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 171 (2010) (\u201c\u2018Probable cause\u2019 is a more rigorous standard than mere suspicion; even a well-warranted suspicion does not suffice, because \u2018a suspicion, no matter how well founded, does not rise to the level of probable cause.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>State v. Verdine, </em>290 Or 553, 557, 624 P2d 580 (1981).) Moreover, the affidavit in this case does not provide <em>any </em>potential linkage between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the presence of some drugs and the likelihood of more drugs or the presence of a single implement of use (the pipe) and the likelihood of more drugs or other implements that might bear traces of the drug, let alone a direct one.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And, even if it could somehow be inferred that, given the presence of a user amount of methamphetamine at the location, it was probable that some implement or manner of ingesting the substance would also be found, and that that implement would also bear traces of methamphetamine, that proposition was undercut here because such an implement had already been seized.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In other words, on top of the above-described \u201cstacked\u201d inferences, the issuing magistrate would also have to infer that multiple implements bearing evidence of recent use would probably be found along with the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">In sum, as we said in <em>Wilson, </em>\u201calthough the facts suggest a possibility that criminal evidence might be found at defendant\u2019s residence, that is not the standard to be met here.\u201d 178 Or App at 172. The affidavit simply does not provide enough facts to permit a magistrate reasonably to conclude that it is more likely than not that additional evidence of criminal drug activity would be found on defendant\u2019s property. The trial court therefore erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Convictions on Counts 1 and 2 reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> Defendant was also charged with conspiracy to commit unlawful delivery and unlawful possession of methamphetamine.
