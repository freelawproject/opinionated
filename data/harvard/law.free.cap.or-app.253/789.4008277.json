He was sentenced to probation and ordered to pay, among other amounts, $610 in attorney fees. On appeal, he raises two assignments of error, neither of which he preserved. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (although appellate court generally will not review unpreserved claims of error, we may consider \u201cplain error\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201can error of law apparent on the record\u201d \u2014 if certain conditions are satisfied).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">In his first assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in not <em>sua sponte </em>entering a judgment of acquittal for fourth-degree assault constituting domestic violence, <em>see </em>ORS 132.586, because there is no evidence that he and the victim were family or household members. Consequently, defendant argues, we should reverse that conviction and enter a judgment of conviction for fourth-degree assault without the element of domestic violence. The state concedes the error, and we agree. \u201cDomestic violence\u201d for this purpose means \u201cabuse between family or household members.\u201d ORS 132.586(1); ORS 135.230(3). \u201cFamily or household members,\u201d in turn, is defined to include \u201c[p]ersons cohabitating with each other.\u201d ORS 135.230(4)(d). In <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. C. M. C., </em>243 Or App 335, 339, 259 P3d 938 (2011), we held that \u201ccohabitating,\u201d as used in ORS 135.230(4)(d), \u201crefers to a domestic arrangement between a man and a woman who are not married to each other, but who live as husband and wife, in that, for more than a brief period of time, they share a common domicile and living expenses and are sexually intimate.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Here, the victim was the adult son of defendant\u2019s live-in girlfriend. Thus, defendant and the victim were not \u201ccohabitating\u201d within the meaning of ORS 135.230(4)(d). Nor does their relationship otherwise fall within the definition of \u201cfamily or household members\u201d in the statute. We also conclude \u2014 and the state does not dispute \u2014 that it is appropriate for us to review and correct the error as \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>See State v. Inloes, </em>239 Or App 49, 54-55, 243 P3d 862 (2010) (correcting as plain error the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence given the gravity of the error and intervening change in the law).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">In his second assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in requiring him to pay $610 in attorney fees because there was insufficient evidence in the record to show that he had the ability to pay those costs. That error is also unpreserved, and we decline to address it. <em>See State v. Larson, </em>222 Or App 498, 505 n 4, 193 P3d 1042, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 503 (2008) (any error in requiring defendant to pay defense costs was not plain error because it could be inferred from the record that defendant had sufficient assets to pay the awarded costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Judgment of conviction on count 1 reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction for fourth-degree assault; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
