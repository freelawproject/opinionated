J.</author>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427 (Counts 1 and 4); one count of furnishing alcohol to a minor, ORS 471.410(2) (Count 2); one count of attempted sodomy in the second degree, ORS 163.395; ORS 161.405(2)(c) (Count 3); and one count of harassment, ORS 166.065(4) (Count 7). On appeal, he raises four assignments of error, the first of which is that the trial court erred in refusing to exclude evidence of prior bad acts involving the alleged victim\u2019s two sisters, S and A, because the evidence was insufficient to establish a \u201cplan\u201d under OEC 404(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His other assignments of error relate to the admission of other testimony, the denial of a motion for continuance, and the imposition of a 170-month prison sentence. We conclude that the trial court should have excluded the evidence involving S, though not the evidence involving A, because unlike the latter, the former evidence was insufficient to establish a \u201cplan\u201d under OEC 404(3). Because we reverse and remand on that basis, we need not reach defendant\u2019s other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Before trial, defendant filed a pretrial motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of defendant\u2019s alleged prior acts of sexual abuse of S and A. At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, the state offered the testimony of each sister to show that defendant had a plan to sexually abuse the alleged victim, S. M.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">S, the oldest of the three sisters, testified as follows. Defendant was in a relationship with the sisters\u2019 mother and moved in with the family when S was 12 years old. S lived with them off and on until she was 20. Although defendant \u201ctook care of [them] financially,\u201d S and defendant never got along, and she did not see him as a father figure. S believed that her mother \u201calways took [defendant\u2019s] side\u201d and that, if S had a problem with defendant, she could not discuss her concerns with her mother. When S was younger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>defendant told her details about \u201c[losing] his virginity.\u201d On another occasion, defendant told S that, \u201cwhen [she] was skinny, [she] looked hot,\u201d and that \u201c[her] breasts and [her] butt were huge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">One day, when S was 20 years old, defendant \u201casked if [she] wanted to get drunk,\u201d and S said that she did. At the time, her mother and her sister, A, were out of town attending a wedding. Defendant poured a \u201ctall glass of tequila,\u201d and S started drinking it. As they were drinking, defendant \u201ckept on filling it before it was empty,\u201d and S became drunk. Although S later \u201c[did not] remember a lot of what happened,\u201d she remembered defendant \u201csucking on\u201d her breasts. She also remembered that, at one point, she was in \u201ca little room outside our back porch that had a hot tub in it\u201d and either \u201c[defendant] laid [her] down or *** [she] was already laid down,\u201d and defendant was \u201clicking [her] vagina.\u201d S told defendant, \u201c[n]o,\u201d because \u201c [i]t felt wrong.\u201d That entire week, defendant came into her bedroom at night and \u201cask[ed] for sex.\u201d On another occasion, S was lying on the couch in the living room when defendant \u201cput his hand on [her] leg,\u201d and she \u201ckicked him off of [her].\u201d Defendant told S that she \u201cmoaned in [her] sleep\u201d and that that meant she \u201cmoan[ed] during sex.\u201d S did not tell her mother about these events at the time they happened, because she did not think her mother would believe her.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">A testified as follows. She was five years old when defendant moved in with the family. She viewed defendant \u201clike [her] stepfather\u201d and believed that they were \u201c[v]ery close.\u201d A\u2019s relationship with her mother was \u201cokay,\u201d but she believed that her mother \u201cwas always *** closer to\u201d defendant and that defendant \u201cwas favored over her kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">A and defendant frequently \u201cwrestle [d] around\u201d and \u201cplayed fighting.\u201d One day when A was about 13, she stayed home from school because she was sick. Defendant was home as well, but her mother was at work. A was sitting on the couch when defendant \u201cstarting wrestling around\u201d with her. A\u2019s sweat pants started to fall down, so she told defendant, \u201cT need to go *** put on *** a pair of jeans or something so that my pants aren\u2019t falling down if we\u2019re going to * * * keep fighting.\u2019\u201d A then went around the kitchen island, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>realizing that defendant was following behind her. A testified, \u201cHe got behind rae and shoved me up against the counter with his crotch on my butt so hard I had bruises on my hips.\u201d Defendant was \u201c[plumping\u201d against her, and A \u201cdidn\u2019t feel comfortable\u201d and \u201cwanted to get away.\u201d She \u201cwas scared\u201d and \u201cwas alone in the house with\u201d defendant. Eventually she \u201cbroke free\u201d and \u201cwent running into [her] bedroom.\u201d Defendant followed her into her bedroom and \u201cpushed [her] on the bed.\u201d She was \u201cface-down\u201d and defendant then \u201cgot on top of [her] back\u201d and \u201cstarted nibbling on the small of [her] back and the top of [her] butt.\u201d A told defendant to \u201cget off\u201d and that \u201che was hurting\u201d her, and she either \u201ckicked him off of [her]\u201d or \u201che got scared and left.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">A few days after the incident, while A was alone with defendant in his car, defendant told A that \u201che would pay [her] $300.00 to do what [they] had done a few nights before but a little bit more.\u201d Initially, A did not tell her mother what had happened with defendant, because \u201ceverything [defendant] said goes,\u201d and A \u201cdidn\u2019t think [her mother] was going to believe [her].\u201d Shortly thereafter, A ran away from home. After her mother kept asking her to come home, A told her what had happened with defendant. Her mother cried and \u201cgot rid of\u201d defendant, but about two weeks later defendant moved back in. A did not report the incidents to authorities, and she did not return home because she \u201ccould never live with [defendant].\u201d She did not see her mother for \u201cthree or four years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The alleged victim, S. M., testified as follows. She had lived with defendant since she was two years old and, until the incidents of sexual misconduct, she viewed their relationship as being \u201clike a dad and a daughter.\u201d When she was 13, defendant \u201cstart[ed] wrestling\u201d with her. On one occasion, S. M. was in the computer room at home, when defendant pulled her down from the chair and \u201cstarted sucking and biting on [her] neck.\u201d Defendant held her down, and S. M. \u201casked him to stop.\u201d S. M. started crying because \u201cit hurt so bad.\u201d Around that time, defendant also asked S. M. for \u201ca blow job\u201d on three or four separate occasions and, on one occasion, asked her to have sex. On another occasion, defendant was balancing on an exercise ball when S. M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>kicked the ball and caused him to fall. Defendant pinned S. M. down and \u201cstarted pulling\u201d on her pants and \u201cripped\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">About a month later, S. M. was home in bed because she was feeling ill. Defendant was home at the time, and S. M.\u2019s mother was at work. Defendant asked S. M. \u201cif [she] was feeling alright,\u201d and S. M. responded that she \u201chad a really bad headache.\u201d Defendant gave her a glass of vodka and told her that it \u201cwould help with [her] headache.\u201d S. M. drank the vodka and fell asleep. When she woke up, S. M. told defendant that her headache \u201cdidn\u2019t go away.\u201d Defendant then \u201cbrought another glass of vodka\u201d to her, and she went \u201cto sleep after the second one.\u201d \"When she woke up, defendant gave her a glass of wine and she drank less than \u201chalf of it.\u201d She fell asleep again and, when she woke up, defendant came back into her bedroom \u201cto talk to [her], and he touched [her] in inappropriate areas,\u201d first \u201cput [ting] his hands down\u201d and touching her \u201cunder\u201d her underwear in her \u201cvaginal area\u201d and second touching her \u201cover\u201d her underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The following day, S. M. was lying in bed when defendant \u201cput his head in-between [her] legs.\u201d S. M. said that she \u201cclosed [her] legs\u201d and \u201cpushed him off the bed.\u201d She believed that defendant was trying to engage in oral sex with her. Defendant told her not to tell her mom and, indeed, she did not do so because, \u201cafter it happened with two of [her sisters, she] knew that [her mother] wouldn\u2019t believe [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Defendant subsequently was charged with (among other things not at issue here) two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427 (Counts 1 and 4); one count of furnishing alcohol to a minor, ORS 471.410(2) (Count 2); one count of attempted sodomy in the second degree, ORS 163.395; ORS 161.405(2)(c) (Count 3); and one count of harassment, ORS 166.065(4) (Count 7). Counts 1 through 4 concern the alleged incidents that took place when S. M. was ill: Counts 1 and 4 alleged that defendant had sexual contact with S. M. by touching her vagina over and under her clothing; Count 2 alleged that defendant furnished alcohol to S. M., a minor at the time of the incident; and Count 3 alleged that defendant engaged in deviate sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>intercourse with S. M. Count 7 concerned the alleged incident in which defendant engaged in offensive physical contact by kissing and sucking on S. M.\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">In defendant\u2019s closing arguments on the motion <em>in limine, </em>he contended that the testimony of S and A was inadmissible character evidence. Defendant argued that the evidence was \u201cprecluded by OEC 403\u201d because \u201cits prejudicial value *** significantly outweighs the probative value.\u201d Defendant also argued that all three girls had \u201cthree different sets of complaints,\u201d and, thus, the evidence was \u201csimply an effort to impeach [defendant] by insinuations and by claims that he has some kind of sexual propensity for young girls of different ages under different circumstances ***.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The state responded that the testimony of S and A was relevant for a noncharacter purpose \u2014 to show that defendant had a plan to sexually abuse S. M. In its memorandum, the state opined that the testimony of S and A evidenced a common theme in which all three sisters viewed defendant as a father figure and that defendant \u201ctook advantage of his position and the children\u2019s vulnerability.\u201d The state also argued that, \u201c[e]qually important\u201d is \u201cthe knowledge * * * defendant had about how the family would react to his \u2018plan\u2019\u201d; all three sisters believed that their mother would \u201cbelieve [defendant] and not them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In its memorandum, the state discussed the testimony of S and A as they each applied to support evidence of a plan in S. M.\u2019s case. With regard to S\u2019s testimony, the state argued that defendant \u201cgot [S. M.] drunk, just like he did [S], so at best their memory would be able to be challenged [,] at worst he could lower their ability to resist him. The request to perform oral sex, and the solicitation for sexual intercourse all are so similar as to show \u2018plan\u2019.\u201d With regard to A\u2019s testimony, the state argued that it evidenced defendant\u2019s plan to \u201ctake advantage of his position and that he had been grooming [A and S. M.] for sexual contact.\u201d The state identified the similarities between A and S. M.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\u201cBoth girls were teenagers at the time of the contact. Prior sexual contact began while defendant physically wrestled with both [A] and [S. M.]. They were both children dependant for care and were in a position where they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>thought of * * * defendant as a father figure. Each girl had [her] pants ripped off while \u2018wrestling\u2019 with * * * defendant, conduct that * * * defendant initiated. Sexual contact was attempted while both girls were home sick. [A] was held down on her bed while *** defendant bit her buttocks and legs, and [S. M.] was held down in the office while * * * defendant gave her a hickey on her neck. While the body parts of contact were different, the physical act of being held down against their will while * * * defendant put his mouth on them is consistent with the plan to use the [ruse] * * * defendant was perpetrating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\u201cIn both situations, * * * defendant plays this behavior off as \u2018horsing around\u2019 and believes he can play it off as a game. The behavior was highly sexualized, and both girls realized it. He was teaching [A] how to \u2018fight\u2019 and with [S. M.] was just \u2018wrestling around\u2019 or \u2018horsing around\u2019 physically, setting up the perfect situation to touch the girls in a sexual manner. Both girls believe this all began as innocent play but left feeling very sexually victimized. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>ruling that the evidence was admissible \u201cfor the reasons set forth in the [s]tate\u2019s [m]emorandum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">At trial, before the state elicited testimony from both S and A, defendant renewed his objection that the testimony was \u201cinadmissible propensity evidence\u201d and that the court was required to \u201cengage in a balancing test under <em>State v. Johns[, </em>301 Or 535, 725 P2d 312 (1986),] even though *** 403 [sic] seems to say balancing isn\u2019t appropriate.\u201d The trial court declined to change its ruling on defendant\u2019s pretrial motion that the testimony of S and A were admissible as evidence of a plan under OEC 404(3). The court then provided the jury with a limiting instruction to consider the testimony only for that purpose, and S and A testified about the sexual misconduct consistently with their testimony at the pretrial hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">On appeal, defendant renews his challenge to the trial court\u2019s refusal to exclude the testimony of S and A, arguing that the prior sexual misconduct described by S and A was not sufficiently similar to the charged conduct to be admissible \u201cplan\u201d evidence under OEC 404(3) and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>in determining the admissibility of that evidence, the court erred in not engaging in OEC 403 balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">We begin with the text of OEC 404(3), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">That evidentiary rule, the Supreme Court explained in <em>Johns, </em>is a rule of inclusion and, as such, permits the introduction of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d evidence as long as the evidence is relevant to a noncharacter purpose. 301 Or at 548. \u201cSome degree of similarity or connection between the prior acts and the charged conduct is necessary to establish the logical relevance of the evidence, no matter the rationale for its admission.\u201d <em>State v. Kaylor, 252 </em>Or App 688, 701-02, 289 P3d 290 (2012). As the court in <em>State v. Leistiko, </em>352 Or 172, 282 P3d 857, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>352 Or 622, 292 P3d 522 (2012), recently explained, when used for the noncharacter purpose of proving a \u201cplan,\u201d the requisite degree of similarity between the prior acts and the charged crime is particularly high. \u201c[S]omething more is required than mere repeated conduct to establish that a defendant acted pursuant to a plan.\u201d <em>State v. Pitt, </em>352 Or 566, 579 n 7, 293 P3d 1002 (2012) (citing <em>Leistiko, </em>352 Or at 184). The <em>Leistiko </em>court, by reference to John Henry Wigmore, 2 <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 304 (Chadbourne rev 1979), distinguished between the use of prior bad acts evidence for proving intent, as opposed to plan to illustrate that point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">\u201cWigmore distinguished the use of other crimes evidence to prove intent, as opposed to plan, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">\u201c\u2018In the former case (of intent) the attempt is merely to negative the innocent state of mind at the time of the act charged; in the present case the effort is to establish a definite prior design or system which included the doing of the act charged as part of its consummation. In the former case, the result is to give a complexion to a conceded act, and ends with that; in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>case, the result is to show (by probability) a precedent design which in its turn is to evidence (by probability) the doing of the act designed.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\"><em>\u201cId. </em>\u00a7 304 at 249. Wigmore reasons explicitly, as <em>[State v. Johnson, </em>340 Or 319, 340-42, 131 P3d 173 (2006)], did implicitly, that a pattern of prior similar acts may be admissible to prove a plan or design. Wigmore, 2 <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 304 at 249; ***. However, as both Wigmore and <em>Johnson </em>recognized, the level of similarity required to prove a plan or design is greater than the level of similarity required to prove intent. <em>See </em>Wigmore, 2 <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 304 at 249, <em>Johnson, </em>340 Or at 340-41. As Wigmore explained, in order to infer a plan or design from prior similar acts, the proponent of the evidence must show \u2018not merely a similarity in the results, but <em>such a concurrence of common features that the various acts are naturally to be explained as caused by a general plan of which they are the individual </em>manifestations.\u2019 Wigmore, 2 <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 304 at 249 (emphasis in original); <em>cf. Johnson, </em>340 Or at 340 (explaining that the prior bad acts evidence in that case established a greater connection than that required to prove intent but less than that required to establish <em>modus </em>operandi).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><em>Leistiko, </em>352 Or at 187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">As indicated above, the pertinent question is whether there is \u201csuch a concurrence of common features\u201d between the prior bad acts evidence concerning both sisters, and the charged conduct concerning S. M., such that \u201c\u2018the various acts are naturally to be explained as caused by a general plan of which they are the individual manifestations.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bunting, </em>189 Or App 337, 344, 76 P3d 137 (2003) (quoting <em>State v. White, </em>53 Or App 856, 861, 632 P2d 1363 (1981)). Applying that standard to the facts of this case, we conclude that the prior bad acts evidence involving A is sufficiently similar to the charged conduct to be admitted as evidence for the purpose of showing defendant\u2019s \u201cplan,\u201d but that the prior bad acts evidence involving S is not sufficiently similar and should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">We first address the connections between the evidence relating to A and the charged conduct involving S. M. Both sisters viewed defendant as a father figure from early childhood. Defendant attempted sexual contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>with each child when she was home alone with him and her mother was at work. Defendant engaged in grooming behavior with each child, which began as wrestling and horseplay but turned into inappropriate sexual touching. Some physical aspects vary \u2014 in A\u2019s case, defendant \u201cstarted nibbling on the small of [her] back and the top of [her] butt,\u201d and, in S. M.\u2019s case, defendant \u201cstarted sucking and biting on [her] neck.\u201d However, in each case defendant physically held down the child against her will and put his mouth on her in a sexual manner. Behavior that began as nonsexual touching became very sexualized and left both children feeling victimized. Because a concurrence of common features links the evidence of defendant\u2019s conduct toward both children, the testimony of A was properly admitted as evidence of defendant\u2019s plan to commit the charged acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The evidence of uncharged misconduct involving S and the charged conduct likewise shares some similarities. Defendant offered alcohol to both S and S. M. and both girls were intoxicated when defendant initiated sexual contact with them; defendant engaged in oral sex with S and put his head between S. M.\u2019s legs as though he was attempting to engage in oral sex with her; he propositioned both girls for sex; and the family relationships led both girls to believe that their mother would not believe them if they reported defendant\u2019s conduct. However, despite those similarities, there are significant differences between the two situations. S was a teenager when defendant first moved in with her family and she never viewed him as a father figure, nor did she engage in any playful physical contact with him before the sexual misconduct occurred. With regard to the incident involving alcohol, S was 20 years old when she accepted defendant\u2019s offer to \u201cget drunk.\u201d By contrast, S. M. was a toddler when defendant first moved in, and she viewed him as a stepfather, had a close relationship with him, and engaged in horseplay with him which defendant escalated into sexual behavior. Defendant offered S. M. alcohol to \u201cmake her headache go away\u201d while she was home sick from school. Despite some similarities, a \u201cconcurrence of common features\u201d is not apparent between the uncharged misconduct involving S and the charged conduct involving S. M. and, thus, the trial erred in not excluding the testimony of S.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>We further conclude that the error was not harmless. Given the nature of the conduct described and that it involved another member of the family, we cannot say that there is \u201clittle likelihood that the error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips, </em>314 Or 460, 471, 840 P2d 666 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Finally, we briefly address defendant\u2019s contention that, in determining the admissibility of the testimony of S and A, the trial court erred when it failed to engage in OEC 403 balancing. In criminal cases, OEC 404(4) precludes a trial court from excluding relevant evidence of a defendant\u2019s other crimes, wrongs, or acts under OEC 403, except as required by the state or federal constitutions. <em>See State v. Phillips, </em>217 Or App 93, 98, 174 P3d 1032 (2007) (\u201c[I]n criminal cases, that rule precludes OEC 403 balancing of probative value against, among other things, danger of undue prejudice.\u201d).
