We do not view this as the sort of \u201cexceptional case\u201d in which <em>de novo </em>review would be appropriate. Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings for \u201cany evidence\u201d and its legal conclusions for errors of law. <em>See Travis v. Strubel, </em>238 Or App 254, 256, 242 P3d 690 (2010) (explaining standard of review applicable to SPO appeals); ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals will exercise its discretion to try the cause anew on the record or to make one or more factual findings anew on the record only in exceptional cases.\u201d). We agree with respondent that the evidence is not sufficient to support the SPO. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">When the sufficiency of the evidence supporting an SPO is challenged, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the petitioner. <em>Delgado v. Souders, </em>334 Or 122, 134, 46 P3d 729 (2002). Petitioner and respondent were coworkers for a number of years and had become friends. At some point, respondent developed a romantic interest in petitioner, who is married. In early December 2011, respondent sent petitioner flowers at work with a card signed \u201cSanta Claus.\u201d At the SPO hearing, petitioner testified that when she discovered that the flowers were from respondent, she took the gift as a \u201cromantic overture\u201d and was \u201cmore or less in shock.\u201d Petitioner sent respondent a text message saying that she had valued their friendship but that it was \u201c[b]est we keep the friendship in the past\u201d because it was \u201cno longer healthy.\u201d Respondent replied with two text messages saying that he was just being honest and telling her his true feelings. Petitioner did not respond to those messages. She then received a text message from respondent\u2019s brother asking her to contact him regarding respondent. She did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Respondent apparently suffered an emotional breakdown and voluntarily admitted himself to the hospital for psychiatric treatment. After he was released from the hospital, respondent sent petitioner a series of text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>messages over the course of the next month, beginning with the following on December 16:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-4\">\u201cOn the outside chance that you read this, I would like to say thank you. Thank you for what I [k]now had to be done. I appreciate what friendship we had and if it wasn\u2019t for you I probably wouldn\u2019t be starting school in January. You also helped me to sit back and take a look at myself. Now I know what I need to work on. You made me a better man. Thank you so very much. I do hope that I have the opportunity to be your friend again in the future. May the lord bless you and keep you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Respondent sent the next message a week later:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-6\">\u201cI am not going to give up on you, I hope you realize that. I know and I understand that you have some hard decisions to make. You should know by now that I support your decisions. I\u2019ll will [sic] be around and you still are always will be [sic] in my heart.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Between December 25th and January 1st, respondent sent three text messages, two of which were simply holiday greetings. The other said, \u201cYou have a beautiful soul.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">On January 5,2012, respondent sent a text message asking whether or not he was \u201cgood enough\u201d for petitioner and asking, \u201cIs it because of my size?\u201d (The trial court described respondent as \u201ca very large man.\u201d) Respondent went on to say, \u201cI wish you would talk to me and let me know why you ran away. I guess I don\u2019t understand what I did to you to deserve being treated so harsh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">On January 16, respondent sent a message saying, \u201cStill say that you are the cats meow.\u201d The next message came three days later, saying, \u201cI hope all is OK with all the flood water,\u201d evidently a reference to flooding near the parties\u2019 workplace or petitioner\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">Respondent sent the final text message on January 20:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-12\">\u2018You never will talk you me [sic] will you? I thought you were such a nice person. I guess I need to stop being so nice as well. So I guess I will have to either confront you at work in front of your coworkers or I will come and confront you in front of [your husband].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>Respondent did not contact petitioner again in any way after sending that message.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">On January 27, 2012, petitioner filed a petition for an SPO under ORS 30.866. A temporary order issued that day and a hearing was held 19 days later. Petitioner testified at the SPO hearing that she had become increasingly frightened as she received respondent\u2019s messages after he was released from the hospital:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-5\">\u201cI definitely knew he had mental weaknesses at that point. I\u2019d known before that with the starting of the flowers and everything. From there on it just \u2014 it seemed to get worse and worse and worse. It spiraled out of control and he just didn\u2019t know how to stop himself, and I \u2014 and I was the recipient of whatever he was going through and I did not feel safe. I felt that I was in danger, and I didn\u2019t know what he was going to do or say next. I felt my family was in danger, I felt my coworkers were in danger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Petitioner testified that she took respondent\u2019s last message to be \u201cvery threatening\u201d and that, by that time, she was \u201cterrified,\u201d in part because respondent knew where she lived. Petitioner reported the messages to the police and to her manager at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Petitioner was the only witness at the SPO hearing; respondent did not testify. At the end of the hearing, respondent moved to dismiss the case, challenging the sufficiency of petitioner\u2019s evidence. In its ruling, the court found that respondent\u2019s text messages illustrated what the court characterized as his \u201cescalation,\u201d noting that respondent initially acknowledged and appeared to accept petitioner\u2019s wish to end their friendship but ultimately refused to accept that petitioner had \u201crejected his overtures.\u201d The court also found that petitioner \u201cfelt physically threatened\u201d when respondent sent her the last text message, on January 20. It found that respondent\u2019s use of the word \u201cconfront\u201d in that message conveyed aggression: \u201cWhen he said that he would confront her at work, this was a threat of aggression at work. When he said that he would confront [petitioner\u2019s] husband, this was an implied threat of aggression at [petitioner\u2019s] home.\u201d The court went on to state,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>\u201cWhen viewed in this light, [respondent\u2019s] previous texts in which he stated that she must make \u2018hard decisions,\u2019 it is clear that he would not accept the decision which she had already made. In other words, [respondent] was threatening [petitioner] to either accept the relationship on his terms or there would be consequences. Those consequences were spelled out in his text of 20 January \u2014 confrontation, aggression, defiance, hostility, or violence at work and at her home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">The court denied respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss and entered a permanent SPO. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In his sole assignment of error, respondent again challenges the sufficiency of the evidence offered in support of the SPO. Specifically, he argues that the record lacks evidence that (1) he was aware that his contacts with petitioner were unwanted; (2) the contacts instilled in petitioner a fear of imminent and serious personal violence; (3) the contacts included unequivocal threats and were objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts; or (4) petitioner\u2019s alarm was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Respondent\u2019s arguments relate to some of the statutory and constitutional requirements associated with entry of SPOs. Several of those requirements are set forth in ORS 30.866, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">\u201c(1) A person may bring a civil action in a circuit court for a court\u2019s stalking protective order or for damages, or both, against a person if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-8\">\u201c(a) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-9\">\u201c(b) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-10\">\u201c(c) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number><em>See also </em>ORS 163.730(1) (\u201c\u2018Alarm\u2019 means to cause apprehension or fear resulting from the perception of danger.\u201d); ORS 163.730(2) (\u201c\u2018Coerce\u2019 means to restrain, compel or dominate by force or threat.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\">Under that statute, the first requirement for an SPO is that the respondent\u2019s conduct meets the definition of \u201ccontact\u201d; in addition, the contact must be repeated and unwanted. The remaining statutory requirements have both subjective and objective components. The subjective component requires that the petitioner actually be alarmed or coerced by the contacts and that the contacts actually cause the petitioner reasonable apprehension regarding his or her personal safety. The objective component requires the alarm or coercion and the apprehension regarding the petitioner\u2019s personal safety to be objectively reasonable. \u201c[E]ach \u2018contact,\u2019 individually, must give rise to subjective and objectively reasonable alarm or <em>coercion.\u201dReitz v. Erazo, </em>248 Or App 700, 706, 274 P3d 214 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">In addition to the statutory requirements, if a contact involves speech, Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution requires proof that the contact constitutes a threat \u2014 that is, \u201ca communication that instills in the addressee a fear of imminent and serious personal violence from the speaker, is unequivocal, and is objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.\u201d <em>State v. Rangel, </em>328 Or 294, 303, 977 P2d 379 (1999). The threat must be \u201cso unambiguous, unequivocal, and specific to the addressee that it convincingly expresses to the addressee the intention that it will be carried out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306. \u201cThe threat of violence * * * must be a genuine threat. That is to say, the danger that the message will be followed by action must be found from the evidence to be objectively probable from the perspective of the factfinder, not only subjectively from the perspective of the addressee.\u201d <em>State v. Moyle, </em>299 Or 691, 704, 705 P2d 740 (1985). Proscribable threats do not include \u201c\u2018the kind of hyperbole, rhetorical excesses, and impotent expressions of anger or frustration that in some contexts can be privileged even if they alarm the addressee.\u2019\u201d <em>Rangel, </em>328 Or at 303 (quoting <em>Moyle, </em>299 Or at 705).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>The pertinent contacts here consist of the text messages that respondent sent to petitioner. <em>See </em>ORS 163.730(3)(d) (\u201ccontact\u201d includes \u201c[s]ending or making written or electronic communications in any form to the other person\u201d). All of those messages involved speech. Therefore, to support issuance of the SPO, at least two of the messages must have constituted threats that are proscribable under the test set forth in <em>Rangel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Because it is dispositive, we address only respondent\u2019s contention that petitioner adduced insufficient evidence that any of the contacts were objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts. We acknowledge the trial court\u2019s determination that petitioner was credible and that she genuinely experienced fear and felt threatened by respondent\u2019s communications. But petitioner\u2019s subjective concern is not sufficient to support entry of the SPO. Under <em>Rangel, </em>respondent\u2019s communications with petitioner could qualify as unwanted contacts supporting an SPO only if they also included unequivocal threats of violence that were \u201cobjectively likely to be acted upon.\u201d <em>Brown v. Roach, 249 </em>Or App 579, 585, 277 P3d 628 (2012). The text messages in this case do not meet that standard; nothing in the record supports an <em>objective </em>determination that respondent intended to carry out any threat that was implicit in his messages to petitioner and probably was going to do so. Indeed, even if the escalating text messages would make it objectively reasonable to believe that respondent likely would follow through on his threat to \u201cconfront\u201d petitioner, no evidence suggests that such a confrontation probably would involve violence or other unlawful acts. That is, no evidence supports a reasonable inference that respondent\u2019s implicit threats of aggression were anything more than \u201cimpotent expressions of anger or frustration.\u201d <em>See Rangel, </em>328 Or at 303; <em>see also Brown, 249 </em>Or App at 585 (\u201coffensive, hostile, and aggressive statements are not enough\u201d to satisfy the <em>Rangel </em>standard). It follows that none of respondent\u2019s messages to petitioner qualified as contacts for purposes of ORS 30.866. In short, the record does not include evidence sufficient to support entry of the SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
