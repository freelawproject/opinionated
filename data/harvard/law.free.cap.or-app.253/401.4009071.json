Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that there was no proof that she caused \u201cphysical injury\u201d to the victim, an element of first-degree criminal mistreatment. Because we agree with defendant, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The facts are undisputed. Defendant admitted to spanking a 16-month-old child, while she babysat him. The baby cried when she spanked him. The child\u2019s mother picked up the child later that evening and testified that the child looked tired and \u201chis eyes were all red.\u201d Later, when the mother\u2019s boyfriend, Coats, was changing the child\u2019s diaper, he noticed black and purple bruising extending from the top of his diaper to the bottom of his left buttock. The next day, the mother took the child to a doctor, and Coats called the police. Dr. Betlinski examined the child and described the bruising as \u201csuperficial ecchymosis.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He explained that \u201cecchymosis\u201d is a medical term for bruising and that it can occur at different levels ranging from just under the skin to deep in the muscle. He also explained that, in this context, \u201csuperficial\u201d means just under the skin and is the least severe type of bruise. In his opinion, a relatively flat object, possibly a hand, caused the bruising. He also testified that the bruise on the child was caused by \u201ca fairly sharp shock to the skin that then gets small capillary blood vessels to suddenly pop and leak out their blood.\u201d During the examination, Betlinski noted that the child was very active and had excellent range of motion in all of his joints and that he did not exhibit any evidence of pain. Later that evening, Detective Kettner visited the child and the mother. He took photographs of the child\u2019s bruise, which he described as a purple and brown bruise above the child\u2019s left buttocks and running down to the child\u2019s upper leg. Kettner testified that the child was so full of energy that he ran around the house making it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>difficult to get a hold of the child to take photographs of the bruise.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Defendant was arrested and charged with first-degree criminal mistreatment. At trial, the child\u2019s mother, Betlinski, and Kettner testified to the facts above. At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to prove \u201cphysical injury\u201d as required for a conviction of first-degree criminal mistreatment. ORS 163.205(l)(b)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cPhysical injury\u201d is defined as \u201cimpairment of physical condition or substantial pain.\u201d ORS 161.015(7). The trial court ruled that the prosecution had failed to adduce circumstantial evidence of substantial pain, but denied the motion because there was sufficient evidence of impairment of the child\u2019s physical condition to submit the case to the jury. The jury ultimately convicted defendant of first-degree criminal mistreatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On appeal, defendant contends that there was no evidence that the child suffered from an impairment of his physical condition to support the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for a judgment of acquittal. In reviewing a motion for a judgment of acquittal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational factfinder could find that the state proved each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u201cImpairment of physical condition\u201d means \u201charm to the body that results in a reduction in one\u2019s ability to use the body or a bodily organ for less than a protracted period of time.\u201d State <em>v. Higgins, </em>165 Or App 442, 446-47, 998 P2d 222 (2000). As we clarified in <em>State v. Hart, </em>222 Or App 285, 291, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>193 P3d 42 (2008), impairment of physical condition \u201cshould be understood to include not only impairment of voluntary use of a body part, but also of the ordinary <em>function </em>of a body part.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Our case law explains that, absent a diminishment in the ability to use a body part or disruption of the ordinary function of an organ, there is no impairment of physical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">In <em>Higgins, </em>the defendant slapped, shook, and scratched the victim, leaving four to six red scrape marks on the victim\u2019s neck and arm. 165 Or App at 444. There was no bleeding, and the victim did not require medical attention. <em>Id. </em>We held that, because there was no evidence that the victim\u2019s scratches reduced his ability to use his body or other bodily organ, there was no impairment of the victim\u2019s physical condition. <em>Id. </em>at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Likewise, in <em>State v. Rice, </em>48 Or App 115, 117, 616 P2d 538, <em>rev den, </em>289 Or 741 (1980), the defendant broke the rear window of a car, causing flying glass to cut the victim\u2019s cheek. The victim did not realize that she had been cut, she felt no pain, and the cut was not noticeable after two or three days. The cut left no scar, and the victim did not receive medical attention. We held that the victim\u2019s scratch was so slight that it did not constitute impairment of physical condition. <em>Id. </em>at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In contrast to <em>Higgins </em>and <em>Rice, </em>in cases where there is evidence that the injury reduces the victim\u2019s ability to use any bodily organ, we have concluded that the victim has suffered an impairment of physical condition. In <em>State v. Cetto, </em>66 Or App 337, 674 P2d 66, <em>rev den, </em>296 Or 712 (1984), we upheld the defendant\u2019s assault conviction because there was evidence that the victim sustained not only a bruise on his face, but also a swollen and bloody lip when the defendant slapped him. We reaffirmed that conclusion in <em>Higgins, </em>explaining that the <em>swollen lip </em>impaired the ordinary function of the victim\u2019s body part, the lips. <em>Cetto, </em>165 Or App at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">In <em>Hart, </em>we emphasized that the injury must diminish the body or bodily organ from functioning properly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>222 Or App at 291. In that case, we held that a reasonable factfinder could reasonably find impairment of a physical condition from the victim\u2019s half-inch gash on the back of his head, because the gash disrupted the skin\u2019s function to protect the inner body from infection. 222 Or App at 291-92. Likewise, in <em>State v. Jones, </em>229 Or App 734, 738, 212 P3d 1292, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 446 (2009), we held that the jury could infer from the evidence of a \u201cheavy scrape\u201d about one and one-half inches wide and four inches long that the wound could disrupt the ordinary function of the skin.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In light of the case law, there is no evidence in this case that the child\u2019s bruise impaired the voluntary use of a body part or disrupted any bodily organ from functioning properly. Defendant admitted to spanking the child at least three times on his left buttock, leaving a sizable bruise. The state did not present evidence that the bruise impaired the child\u2019s voluntary use of a body part. In fact, there was evidence that the child had full mobility. Betlinski testified that, when he examined the child the next day, the child had excellent range of motion in all of his joints and did not exhibit any evidence of pain. Kettner, who investigated the case, also testified that the child was so full of energy that he ran around the house making it difficult for Kettner to take photographs of the child\u2019s injury. There was no evidence that the child felt pain when he sat down on his left buttock or that he favored his right side when lying down. Therefore, we conclude in this case that, where the bruising did not diminish the child\u2019s bodily movement or ability to engage in everyday activities, there was insufficient evidence that defendant impaired the child\u2019s physical condition. <em>Cf. State v. Glazier, </em>253 Or App 109, 113, 288 P3d 1007 (2012) (evidence of pain arising from the bruised areas on the victim\u2019s ribs and legs that made it more difficult for her to engage in normal activities such as walking up and down stairs and lifting small objects is sufficient to support the inference that injuries caused impairment of a physical condition).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The state counters that it presented evidence that the spanking caused \u201csmall capillary blood vessels to suddenly pop and leak out their blood, which is then what is the actual bruising.\u201d The state concludes that \u201ca rational trier of fact could infer that \u2018popped\u2019 blood vessels that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>leak blood constitute impairment of the child\u2019s skin[.]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree. Unlike in <em>Hart </em>and <em>Jones, </em>where we held that a gash and a scrape disrupted the skin\u2019s ordinary function to prevent infection, in this case, there was no evidence that the bruising affected the skin\u2019s ordinary function. Indisputably, the skin did not break, which is evidence from which a jury can infer impairment of the skin\u2019s ability to ward off infection. <em>See Hart, </em>222 Or App at 291-92 (\u201cone of the functions of the skin is to protect the inner body from infection,\u201d and a factfinder could infer that a half-inch gash disrupts that function). Moreover, although Betlinski testified that the bruising occurred when blood vessels popped and leaked blood just below the skin\u2019s surface, he did not say whether that disrupted the skin\u2019s function or any other organ\u2019s function. Despite our view of the facts in the state\u2019s favor, there was no evidence to support a determination that the bruise was an impairment of the victim\u2019s physical condition and, consequently, a \u201cphysical injury\u201d for purposes of the criminal mistreatment statute. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\"> An \u201cecchymosis\u201d is a \u201cpurplish patch caused by extravasation of blood into the skin, differing from petechiae only in size (larger than 3 mm diameter).\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>561 (27th ed 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\"> ORS 163.205 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of criminal mistreatment in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">\u00ab* * \u2756 * sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">\u201c(b) The person, in violation of a legal duty to provide care for a dependent person or elderly person, or having assumed the permanent or temporary care, custody or responsibility for the supervision of a dependent person or elderly person, intentionally or knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">\u201c(A) Causes physical injury or injuries to the dependent person or elderly personf.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b426-5\"> The state also argues that a rational <em>trier of </em>fact could infer that the child suffered substantial pain during the spanking because the child appeared very tired and had red eyes, possibly from crying, when mother picked him up from defendant\u2019s home. We decline to address that argument because the trial court ruled that there was no evidence of substantial pain, allowing only the \u201cimpaired physical condition\u201d theory to go to the jury. <em>See Hart, </em>222 Or App at 288 (similarly declining to address the argument that the record contained evidence that the victim suffered substantial pain when the trial court found otherwise).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
