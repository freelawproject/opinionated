After respondent sold the house, petitioner Ivers (who is respondent\u2019s ex-wife and the minor\u2019s mother and conservator) sought respondent\u2019s removal as custodian, restitution, and an accounting. Respondent prevailed in the action,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the trial court entered a judgment that provided for respondent to seek the court\u2019s approval of his reimbursement for expenses incurred as the UTMA custodian in connection with the suit. Respondent sought approval four months later. Over petitioner\u2019s objection that ORCP 68 applied and that respondent had acted too late given the rule\u2019s deadline for seeking an award of attorney fees, the trial court entered a supplemental judgment allowing respondent custodial expenses consisting of attorney fees. We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision that ORCP 68 is inapplicable to the recovery of custodial expenses under the UTMA, even if those expenses include reimbursement of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The facts are primarily procedural and are undisputed on appeal. Petitioner and respondent divorced in 1996 and have one child, their minor daughter. Petitioner\u2019s mother devised her house in Redmond, Oregon, to respondent and to the minor. In 2004, after petitioner\u2019s mother had died and her will was probated, respondent received an undivided one-half interest in the house and respondent, as custodian in accordance with the will, received the minor\u2019s undivided one-half interest in trust until she turned 25 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Respondent made various improvements to the house and its landscaping. In 2007, he sold the house for approximately $239,000, a significant increase in the house\u2019s value as indicated by the inventory of petitioner\u2019s mother\u2019s estate. Respondent deposited the minor\u2019s share of the net proceeds from the sale in a separate account for her at a financial institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>In July 2007, however, petitioner, as conservator for the minor, filed this action for an accounting, restitution, and respondent\u2019s removal as the UTMA custodian. Respondent filed two counterclaims. He alleged a right to recover his expenses and attorney fees in connection with the litigation from the UTMA custodial estate as custodial expenses. Respondent also alleged that petitioner had filed the action in bad faith and that the court should award him attorney fees and costs as a sanction under ORS 20.105. Respondent also prepared and submitted an accounting to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The trial court found that respondent \u201cdid not act to the detriment of the minor\u2019s estate but rather prudently increased the value of the estate through repair and renovation of the house, sale at a substantial profit, and fair distribution and investment of the proceeds.\u201d The court approved respondent\u2019s accounting and rejected petitioner\u2019s request that respondent be removed as custodian and her other claims, as well as respondent\u2019s counterclaim for sanctions. Noting that respondent was not entitled to an award of attorney fees, the trial court entered a judgment that allowed respondent, as the UTMA custodian, to obtain reimbursement of his reasonable expenses from the custodial estate pursuant to ORS 126.852(1), \u201cupon application to the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The trial court explained its allowance of custodial expenses through its letter opinion, describing the kinds of expenses allowable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\u201c[Respondent], as custodian, is entitled to recover his \u2018reasonable expenses\u2019, pursuant to ORS 125.852, from custodial property. This would include, for instance, the expenses of preparing the accounting, even if prepared by an attorney. It could also potentially include the attorney fees and expenses incurred in defending this suit, if [respondent] makes that claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The court also instructed respondent that he could \u201csubmit his request for reimbursement from custodial property for reasonable expenses, pursuant to ORS 126.852(1), by affidavit.\u201d Separately, the court noted in its letter opinion that respondent could submit a cost bill under ORCP 68. In the judgment, the trial court reiterated that respondent was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>entitled to recover expenses from the estate but that costs were assessed because respondent was the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Respondent timely sought his costs \u2014 his filing, service, and prevailing party fees \u2014 within 14 days of the judgment as required under ORCP 68. Petitioner paid the costs. Later, four months after the judgment was entered, respondent filed a \u201cCustodian\u2019s Motion for Reimbursement of Expenses\u201d in which he sought reimbursement from the custodial estate for legal fees that attorneys had charged him for consultations, representation in the proceedings, and preparation of the accounting. Petitioner objected to the motion for expenses, arguing both that attorney fees were not includable as custodial expenses under ORS 126.852 and that respondent\u2019s statement of attorney fees was not timely filed, within 14 days of the entry of judgment, as required by ORCP 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In its letter opinion concerning petitioner\u2019s objections to respondent\u2019s motion, the trial court reasoned that, under ORS 126.852(1), \u201creasonable expenses\u201d can include the cost of experts and there is no reason to distinguish between fees of a CPA and the expense of legal representation. In fact, the UTMA expressly recognizes that an attorney may prepare an accounting instead of a CPA. <em>See </em>ORS 126.866(3) (a custodian\u2019s legal representative may account). Petitioner has not challenged on appeal the court\u2019s ruling that allowed respondent\u2019s attorney fees as custodial expenses under the UTMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The trial court also explained that ORCP 68 is applicable to fee awards, not to custodial expenses under the UTMA, and that the approval procedure the court had ordered was not required under the UTMA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201cThe court is not making an award of attorney fees to the custodian, against petitioner, as a prevailing party. In fact a custodian might still be entitled to reimbursement of attorney fees for defending a suit and <em>losing, </em>if the fees are \u2018reasonable expenses.\u2019 Assuming, however, that ORCP 68 and UTCR 5.080 would apply generally to fees incurred as expenses by a fiduciary, ORCP 68 is not applicable in this instance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u201cORS 126.852(1) allows a custodian, \u2018reimbursement from custodial property for reasonable expenses.\u2019 There is no requirement for prior or even subsequent court approval. Typically, there is no case and no court involvement at all. No court action is required to create the custodial relationship and there is no court monitoring or oversight. The only mechanism for ensuring that a custodian performs his fiduciary duty properly, including reimbursing himself, is the right to petition the court for an accounting of transactions which have already occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">\u201cIn this case, the procedure used provided greater protection than is normally the case but it was not required by rule or statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">(Emphasis in original.) The trial court then entered an order denying petitioner\u2019s objection because \u201cORCP 68 is not applicable in this instance.\u201d Consistently with that understanding, the trial court allowed only custodial expenses, not an award of attorney fees to a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">On appeal, petitioner contends that the trial court erred because respondent\u2019s motion was untimely. In petitioner\u2019s view, the custodial expenses approved included attorney fees and so constituted an award of attorney fees controlled by the pleading and proof requirements in ORCP 68 C(l). Accordingly, we decide the legal issue of whether ORCP 68 applies to a custodian\u2019s request for reimbursement of expenses, including attorney fees and the cost of accounting, under the UTMA. The correlative standard of review is for errors of law. <em>See Becker v. Pieper, </em>176 Or App 635, 641, 32 P3d 912 (2001) (\u201cbecause granting respondents\u2019 motion resulted necessarily from a substantive legal conclusion, we review that legal conclusion for errors of law\u201d). Based on (1) our case law establishing that ORCP 68 does not apply when there is no substantive right to fees and (2) the purpose and provisions of the UTMA, we conclude that ORCP 68 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">First, petitioner incorrectly assumes that the UTMA custodial expenses in this case are an \u201caward of attorney fees\u201d for purposes of ORCP 68. Petitioner focuses most of her attention on the broad language in ORCP 68 C(l), which requires application of Rule 68 \u201c[n]othwithstanding Rule 1A and the procedure provided in any rule or statute permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>recovery of attorney fees in a particular case,\u201d and which \u201cgoverns the pleading, proof and <em>award of attorney fees </em>in all cases,\u201d except when \u201c[s]uch items are claimed as damages arising prior to the action [,]\u201d or \u201c[s]uch items are granted by order, rather than entered as part of a judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) But that focus overlooks that not all attorney fees are awards of attorney fees that are covered under ORCP 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Although ORCP 68 C(l) states that it is designed to govern the award of attorney fees in \u201call\u201d civil cases, we have held that not all attorney fee cases fall under the ambit of ORCP 68 C. For example, in <em>Ashley v. Garrison, </em>162 Or App 585, 986 P2d 654 (1999), we held that ORCP 68 C did not apply to a party seeking judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s attorney fee award. In that case, the plaintiff was dissatisfied with the amount of attorney fees the arbitrator awarded to him and filed an exception to the fees with the circuit court pursuant to ORS 36.425(6), which allows challenges to an arbitrator\u2019s award or denial of attorney fees. 162 Or App at 587. The trial court reviewed the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions and issued a letter opinion reducing the plaintiff\u2019s attorney fee award. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the trial court had failed to conduct a hearing as required by ORCP 68 C. We analyzed ORCP 68 C to describe a process that operates <em>before </em>a decision on the award of attorney fees is made. By contrast, ORS 36.425(6) describes a process that operates <em>after </em>an arbitrator has decided the issue of attorney fees. <em>Id. </em>at 590. Although the rule and the statute both concern attorney fees, we recognized that they \u201cdenote different processes designed to accomplish different purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589. Thus, we concluded that ORCP 68 does not apply to an exception to the arbitrator\u2019s award of attorney fees filed pursuant to ORS 36.425(6). <em>Id. </em>at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In other cases, we have recognized that attorney fees sought as economic damages do not fall under ORCP 68. In <em>Rivera-Martinez v. Vu, </em>245 Or App 422, 263 P3d 1078, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 318 (2011), the plaintiff filed a malpractice claim against his former lawyer, alleging, among other things, that he was entitled to the attorney fees he would have collected had the lawyer-defendant handled the case without negligence. The trial court denied the plaintiff the attorney fees, and he appealed, arguing that those fees</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>should have been determined by employing the post-trial procedure provided by ORCP 68 C. <em>Id. </em>at 427. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling, concluding that, because the attorney fees were alleged as damages in his malpractice claim, the plaintiff was required to prove those damages in his case-in-chief, rather than in a post-trial hearing under ORCP 68 C. <em>Id. </em>at 428. <em>See also Portland Trailer &amp; Equipment v. A-l Freeman Moving, </em>166 Or App 651, 654, 5 P3d 604, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>168 Or App 654, 4 P3d 741 (2000) (in a case primarily concerning personal jurisdiction, we recognized that the plaintiffs could seek attorney fees as economic damages, to recover their expenses for defending a proceeding in Oklahoma).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">And, in a recent case, <em>Baker and Andrews, </em>232 Or App 646, 223 P3d 417 (2009), where the trial court awarded the defendant the amount of his attorney fees to defend the action, we distinguished between attorney fee awards covered by ORCP 68 and attorney fees that are not, based on whether the party had a \u201csubstantive right\u201d to an award of fees in the action. In <em>Baker, </em>the trial court entered a judgment rejecting all of the plaintiff\u2019s claims and then allowed the defendant to \u201cproceed pursuant to ORCP 68\u201d with regard to his request for his attorney fees under ORCP 17, which permits sanctions against a party that makes false certifications to the court through a filed pleading or other document. 232 Or App at 653. After the plaintiff filed her notice of appeal, the court entered a supplemental judgment ordering the plaintiff and her counsel to pay the defendant\u2019s attorney fees, which the plaintiff also appealed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">On appeal, we concluded that, despite the defendant\u2019s receipt of an award consisting primarily of his attorney fees for defending the action, that award constituted punitive sanctions under ORCP 17, not \u201ccompensatory attorney fees under ORCP 68 C[(2)(a)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657. Thus, regardless of the trial court\u2019s directive to proceed pursuant to ORCP 68, we held that the attorney fee procedure under ORCP 68 did not apply. In particular, we held that ORCP 68 C(5)(b) (a fee award \u201cshall be made by supplemental judgment\u201d if \u201cnot decided before entry of a general judgment\u201d) did not provide the trial court with authority to enter the supplemental judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Our holding was premised on that fact that the defendant \u201chad not earlier alleged a right to attorney fees in a pleading under ORCP 68 C(2), a necessary predicate to the allowance and taxation of attorney fees under ORCP 68 C,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 656-57, and, \u201cin short, did not seek attorney fees in the case as a matter of the <em>\u2018substantive right to recover such fees!\u201d Id. </em>at 657 (quoting ORCP 68 C(2)(a)) (emphasis added). Even though ORCP 17 and ORCP 68 lack any stated exceptions to the application of ORCP 68 when a court considers an award of attorney fees as a sanction, ORCP 68 did not apply in <em>Baker </em>because the defendant did not have a \u201csubstantive right to recover\u201d an attorney fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Like the defendant in <em>Baker, </em>respondent did not, under ORCP 68 C(2)(a), \u201callege the facts, statute or rule that provides a basis for the award of such fees in a pleading filed by that party.\u201d And, just like the attorney fees allowed under ORCP 17 as sanctions in <em>Baker, </em>the custodial expenses allowed in the present case did not constitute an award of attorney fees recovered under ORCP 68. Respondent had no substantive right to recover attorney fees <em>qua </em>an award of attorney fees \u2014 whether under the UTMA, which has no attorney-fee provision, or any other statute, rule of law, or contract brought to our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We also reject petitioner\u2019s position that ORCP 68 governed the custodial expenses allowed in this case for a second reason. Given the purpose and structure of the UTMA, ORCP 68 C does not apply to custodial expenses, even when a court reviews and approves the expenses and those expenses consist entirely of the custodian\u2019s attorney fees incurred because of litigation concerning the custodian\u2019s handling of the UTMA estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Oregon\u2019s UTMA is taken from a uniform law promulgated in 1983 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Laws. Uniform Transfers to Minors Act Historical Notes, 8C ULA 2 (1983). Every state has adopted the UTMA or its predecessor, the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA). Uniform Transfers to Minors Act Prefatory Note, 8C ULA 3 (1983). The Oregon legislature adopted the UGMA in 1959, <em>see </em>Or Laws 1959, ch 640, \u00a7\u00a7 1-18, and the UTMA in 1985, <em>see </em>Or Laws 1985, ch 665, \u00a7\u00a7 1-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Pursuant to ORS 126.882, the UTMA as enacted in Oregon \u201cshall be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law\u201d with respect to its subject among states that have enacted it. As to that purpose, the commissioners noted that uniform treatment concerning gifts to minors is desirable because the person making the gift or transfer, the custodian, and the minor may reside in different states or change state residency after a gift is made. <em>See </em>Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, Prefatory Notes, 8C ULA 3 (uniformity is important because \u201cthe laws of more than one state may apply to a transaction or a series of transactions\u201d). Because the UTMA is a uniform law that, to the extent possible, should be interpreted uniformly, \u201ccase law from other states provides part of the statutory context.\u201d <em>Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. v. Mishler, </em>161 Or App 544, 556, 983 P2d 1086 (1999). And, Oregon courts \u201cexamine the history of the uniform act and the context that led to its creation\u201d to inform its analysis of that act. <em>Datt v. Hill, </em>347 Or 672, 680, 227 P3d 714 (2010) (citing <em>Western Helicopter Services v. Roger son Aircraft, </em>311 Or 361, 364, 811 P2d 627 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">As the trial court observed, under the Oregon UTMA, a custodian \u201cis entitled to reimbursement from custodial property for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of the custodian\u2019s duties.\u201d ORS 126.852(1). The UTMA does not require any application to a court for approval of such reimbursements either in ORS 126.852 or elsewhere in the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the trial court recognized, the UTMA also does not provide for regular judicial oversight of the custodian\u2019s handling of custodial property. <em>See Jimenez v. Lee, </em>274 Or 457, 461 n 4, 547 P2d 126 (1976) (observing the difference between the discretion of a custodian under the UGMA and the duties of a trustee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>to a beneficiary of a trust). Nor does the UTMA contain an attorney fee provision. All of that is consistent with the purpose of the UTMA, which is to provide a simple, low-cost mechanism for handling gifts or transfers of property or funds to minors, without the complexity and expense of establishing a trust or conservatorship. <em>See Sutliff v. Sutliff, </em>515 Pa 393, 403, 528 A2d 1318, 1323 (1987) (purpose of UGMA is \u201cto provide an inexpensive, easy mechanism for giving property to minors\u201d and \u201cseeks to solve the problem of administrative expense and complexity while preserving certain federal tax benefits for the donor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Because of that purpose, along with the UTMA provisions mentioned, the Oregon legislature had no reason to insert into the UTMA any mention of ORCP 68. It is not surprising that the legislature did not address fee award procedures under the UTMA when the UTMA lacks an attorney fee provision and a custodian can manage funds and reimburse himself without court approval. Indeed, if the requirements of ORCP 68 were engrafted onto a custodial expense reimbursement under the UTMA, then those requirements would contravene at least one provision of the uniform law. The UTMA is devoid of any requirement for court approval of expense reimbursements, ORS 126.852, yet ORCP 68 concerns court approval of reasonable attorney fees allowed to a prevailing party after a judgment in that party\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The requirements of ORCP 68, if applied, would also undermine the purposes of the UTMA. To hold that ORCP 68 applies to reimbursement of a'custodian\u2019s attorney fees would not simplify and reduce the cost of handling transfers of funds or property to minors and reduce the involvement of courts in the oversight of the custodial estate; it would have the opposite effect. And, application of ORCP 68 to custodial expenses under the UTMA contravenes the directive in ORS 126.882 because it creates uncertainty in the application of the UTMA and does not promote uniformity of the law with respect to reimbursement of custodial expenses. Accordingly, we conclude that ORCP 68 is inapplicable, not that the legislature intended it to apply, to reimbursements of custodial expenses consisting of attorney fees under the UTMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>In sum, there are circumstances when ORCP 68 does not apply to an amount that consists of a party\u2019s expense for attorney fees. This is one of those instances. The recovery of custodial expenses under the UTMA was intended to occur outside of court supervision and, therefore, without regard to ORCP 68, and the reimbursement of respondent\u2019s fees was not an award of attorney fees pursuant to ORCP 68. The trial court correctly ruled that it could allow attorney fees in this case as custodial expenses; that ORCP 68 did not govern respondent\u2019s motion for UTMA custodial expenses; and, without petitioner\u2019s objection, that the amount of respondent\u2019s expenses was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\"> Petitioner joined respondent\u2019s wife as a party, and she also prevailed in the litigation, but because respondent is the UTMA custodian, we simply refer only to respondent throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-5\"> Section 15 of the UTMA is in relevant respects identical to ORS 126.852. The comment to section 15 says almost nothing regarding custodial expenses and is silent with regard to attorney fees as custodial expenses. Uniform Transfers to Minors Act \u00a7 15 Comment, 8C ULA 59. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the parties do not cite and we have not found a reported Oregon appellate case concerning attorney fees as custodial expenses under ORS 126.852 or its predecessors, <em>former </em>ORS 126.855 (1965), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1967, ch 300, \u00a7 7, and <em>former </em>ORS 126.856 (1983), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1985, ch 665, \u00a7 27 \u2014 or any other reported appellate decision on the issue. As noted, the trial court recognized that it was providing \u201cgreater protection\u201d by ordering respondent to submit his custodial expenses to the court for approval.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
