In multiple assignments of error, he challenges the property and debt division that the trial court made. We decline husband\u2019s request that we review <em>de novo </em>the facts that the trial court found, ORS 19.415(3), and we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in dividing the parties\u2019 property and liabilities as it did. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The parties were married for 11 years; they have no joint children. Both parties are in good health. Husband is a civil engineer, and wife is a real estate broker and developer. At the time of trial, husband was 54 years old and wife was 40. Both parties had modest assets at the time of their marriage. Because they are supported by evidence in the record, the following facts that the trial court found are binding on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201c[Beginning in 2002], [d]uring the real estate boom, the parties separately invested in various speculative projects. Wife\u2019s separate investments resulted in larger financial gains. Wife also received $85,000 during the marriage from her mother\u2019s estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\u201cHusband also engaged in a series of real estate investments including *** his current project, Aberdeen Landing. Husband made all decisions concerning these projects and kept them separate from Wife\u2019s finances as well as holding them in his separate name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">\u201cOverall, Husband\u2019s separate investments were not successful causing Husband to file bankruptcy in February 2002. Husband disclosed all of his assets to the Bankruptcy Court and-clearly did not claim any interest in Wife\u2019s separate investments, the Pfaffle and Claremont projects. The trustee in Bankruptcy Court abandoned any interest based upon Husband\u2019s representations that he did not have any interest in these assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">\u201cAfter the bankruptcy, any profit Husband made on his separate investments was used to pay Husband\u2019s separate tax liabilities and to invest in Aberdeen Landing, a project in Husband\u2019s separate name located in Washington State, consisting of approximately 200 acres.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>\u201cAt the time of the divorce, Husband\u2019s engineering business, Welkin, was down (due to the downturn in the economy) and Husband\u2019s income and cash flow was nominal. Husband testified that he is unable to borrow to continue to develop Aberdeen Landing and that he owes approximately $2 million in liens against the property that he has personally guaranteed. Husband recently borrowed $25,000, from his mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">\u201cHusband intends to subdivide and develop Aberdeen Landing into residential lots. There is timber on the property that may eventually be harvested and sold but the current market for timber is so low it is not a fiscally appropriate time to log the property. Husband has managed to hold onto this investment in spite of the fact that he is not servicing the mortgage and is not currently able to finish the development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">\u201cHusband testified that he brought his talents as a developer and engineer to Wife\u2019s development projects, thereby increasing the profits. In reality, Husband did bring his talent for subdividing real estate to Wife\u2019s projects however, Wife compensated Husband by paying his company and, at times, in excess of the true value of his contributions. Wife could have hired another engineer and reaped at least as much as she did by using Husband. At times Husband was a liability to Wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201cHusband\u2019s finances were frequently a source of conflict. Husband\u2019s poor credit and tax arrears contributed to Wife\u2019s insecurities about commingling their finances. Therefore, Wife meticulously kept separate bank accounts and business entities. For the last nine of 11 years the parties\u2019 finances were totally separate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Among wife\u2019s separately owned assets was a residence that the parties jointly occupied until their separation, the Egan Way property. With respect to that property, the trial court found and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">\u201cWife will be awarded this property free and clear of any interest of Husband, but subject to all liens and encumbrances thereon. The court finds this property to have a fair market value of $1.4 million and a net equity of $650,000. Wife was able to trace her contributions to the acquisition of the Egan home from assets that the court finds were either premarital or that wife can claim as her separate property due to successfully rebutting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>presumption of equal contribution. Wife\u2019s contributions exceed the equity in the home due to depreciation in the housing market.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">With respect to other investment assets that wife had owned and sold to reinvest in the Egan Way property, or still owned \u2014 including two real estate tenancies in common (TICs) \u2014 the court found and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">\u201c[Wife] rebutted the presumption of equal contribution by meticulously keeping these business enterprises separate from the marital estate. Further, any contributions by Husband were done in the context of a business relationship for which Husband was compensated at least as well as any engineer hired would have been compensated. There was no commingling of any part of this business investment and all contributions to the acquisition and maintenance of the businesses was done with traceable funds from Wife alone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The court awarded husband\u2019s professional services firms to him free of any interest of wife. With respect to the Aberdeen property, the court found and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">\u201cHusband is awarded all interest in this property, free and clear of any interest of Wife, but subject to all liens and encumbrances. Husband used his separate investments to acquire and his talents to finance this project. The court concludes that Husband rebutted the presumption of equal contribution and should be awarded this property without including in the marital estate. Although the current economy presents challenges to the development of this property, the court finds that Husband has a net equity of $700,000 based upon a gross value of $3.6 million and development costs of approximately $900,000 and the current debt owed by Husband of $2 million.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">In the concluding portion of its analysis, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">\u201cAttached to this opinion letter is a spreadsheet reflecting the division of assets and liabilities determined by the court. Although there is a small disparity between the bottom line distribution, the court will not require an equalizing judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">The spreadsheet that the court attached purported to award wife assets, including the Egan Way property \u2014 whose equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the court valued at $600,000 \u2014 totaling $705,894. The court awarded the Aberdeen property to husband at an assigned net value of $700,000, together with other miscellaneous assets, for a total of $719,780. In its spreadsheet calculus, the court did not list or assign values to several assets and debts that the parties owned or owed, including the two TICs that wife owned. The court also did not list in the spreadsheet a vehicle and other assets that wife had acquired with the proceeds of a home equity line of credit (HELOC) in the amount of $197,000 that, in valuing wife\u2019s equity in the Egan Way property, the court had treated as an encumbrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">On appeal, husband challenges various aspects of the property division that the trial court made; we reject most of those challenges without discussion, focusing only on several apparent anomalies in the structure of the trial court\u2019s decision that husband has questioned. First, husband observes that the trial court fixed wife\u2019s equity in the Egan Way property at $600,000 in the spreadsheet, whereas the court had set that equity in the amount of $650,000 in the body of its findings. According to husband, the latter figure is the more accurate. Second, husband challenges the trial court\u2019s implicit determination in the spreadsheet calculation that the net value of the Egan Way property should be reduced by the full amount of the post-separation HELOC advances. According to husband, that determination improperly reduced the net value of that property by approximately $180,000, representing post-separation indebtedness that wife incurred to purchase a new vehicle, clothing, and other items that she acquired for her sole benefit, and which the trial court failed to account for in the spreadsheet calculation. Finally, husband questions the trial court\u2019s exclusion from that calculation of wife\u2019s interest in the TICs and the personal indebtedness that husband had incurred during the marriage. According to husband, those omissions substantially distorted the property division with the consequence that it was not \u201cjust and proper in all the circumstances\u201d as required by ORS 107.105(l)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">ORS 107.105(l)(f) distinguishes between property brought into the marriage and property acquired during the marriage. <em>Kunze and Kunze, </em>337 Or 122, 133, 92 P3d 100 (2004). Property in the latter category \u2014 termed \u201cmarital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>assets\u201d \u2014 is subject to a rebuttable presumption of equal contribution under ORS 107.105(l)(f)(C). If one spouse rebuts the presumption of equal contribution, \u201cabsent other considerations, it is \u2018just and proper\u2019 to award that marital asset separately to the party who has overcome the statutory presumption.\u201d <em>Kunze, </em>337 Or at 135. If the presumption has not been rebutted, the property ordinarily will be divided equally between the parties, again \u201cabsent other considerations.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">As the previous paragraph indicates, other considerations may bear on what is just and proper with respect to division of both marital assets and other marital property. The timing of, and relative contributions to, the acquisition of property are two significant considerations in the \u201cjust and proper\u201d determination, but they are not the only relevant factors. Rather, courts also must consider equitable factors, including \u201cthe preservation of assets; the achievement of economic self-sufficiency for both spouses; the particular needs of the parties and their children; and * * * the extent to which a party has integrated a separately acquired asset into the common financial affairs of the marital partnership through commingling.\u201d <em>Kunze, </em>337 Or at 136; <em>see also id. </em>at 135 (\u201c[T]he court\u2019s final inquiry as to the \u2018just and proper\u2019 division concerns the equity of the property division in view of all the circumstances of the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">As part of determining a just and proper division of the parties\u2019 property, \u201ca court may divide the debts that the parties incurred during their marriage.\u201d <em>Shlitter and Shlitter, </em>188 Or App 277, 283, 71 P3d 154 (2003) (citation omitted). Our cases recognize a distinction between marital debts and debts that benefited only one of the parties. In determining the nature of a debt, courts \u201cfocus not on the person in whose name the [debt was incurred], but on the use to which it was put <em>\u201d Branscomb and Branscomb, </em>201 Or App 188, 202, 117 P3d 1051, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 544 (2005). If the debt was incurred to pay family expenses, equal division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>of the debt is generally appropriate. If, on the other hand, the debt is properly attributed to only one of the parties, the debt should generally remain that party\u2019s responsibility. <em>Id. </em>at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Ultimately, the determination of what is just and proper in all the circumstances is a matter of discretion for the trial court, and we will disturb the court\u2019s decision only if it misapplied the statutory and equitable considerations required by ORS 107.105(l)(f). <em>Kunze, </em>337 Or at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In particular, husband asserts that the property division in this case was not just and proper because (1) \u201cthe court entirely ignored\u201d husband\u2019s direct monetary and nonmonetary contributions that \u201cmade possible [w]ife\u2019s acquisition of substantial assets in her name alone;\u201d and (2) the court failed to adequately account for the social objective of ensuring husband\u2019s economic self-sufficiency. The difficulty with both of those arguments is that they discount the findings that the trial court made that husband was fully compensated for his efforts in regard to wife\u2019s projects, that the parties scrupulously avoided commingling their assets at least, in part, in order to avoid subjecting wife\u2019s separate assets to husband\u2019s separate debts, and that husband\u2019s Aberdeen property was worth substantially more than he claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Admittedly, it is difficult to follow the trial court\u2019s reasoning in that part of its letter opinion pertaining to the property division spreadsheet. In that concluding portion of its analysis, the court intimated that it might have undertaken to more or less equally divide the parties\u2019 assets, even though several significant assets were not included in the spreadsheet calculation. For example, as noted, the court did not include wife\u2019s interests in the two TICs that she had purchased during the marriage with the proceeds of sale of her separately owned assets. In her proposed property division, wife had valued those investments at $247,500.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, presumably owing to a ministerial error, the court used a lower value for wife\u2019s equity in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Egan Way property than it had designated in the body of its findings. And, finally, the court deducted wife\u2019s post-separation HELOC advances from her equity in the Egan Way property, even though the court did not include in the spreadsheet calculation the value of the separate assets that wife purchased from the proceeds of those advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Were it not for the trial court\u2019s underlying findings of fact, the foregoing anomalies would pose significant concerns in assessing whether the property division ultimately was just and proper. That is, if in fact the court had attempted to equally divide all of the parties\u2019 assets and debts, the division that it made did not accomplish that objective. However, it is clear from the body of the court\u2019s findings and conclusions that it had a different objective in mind. As discussed, the court found and concluded that wife had rebutted the presumption of equal contribution with respect to her separately owned assets. Moreover, as pertinent to the \u201cjust and proper\u201d analysis, the court found and concluded that, because the parties\u2019 assets had not been commingled, both parties were professionals with their own business enterprises, husband was fully compensated for any work that he had performed on wife\u2019s investment projects, and husband\u2019s poor economic choices had, if anything, dampened wife\u2019s investment efforts, each party should receive her and his separate assets free of any claim by the other. Consistently with the underlying findings and conclusions in its letter opinion, and notwithstanding the anomalies in the spreadsheet, the general judgment of dissolution that the trial court entered awarded each of the parties her and his own separately held assets and liabilities, free of any claim or obligation of the other party.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Because the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by evidence in the record, we will not disturb them. In light of those findings, each party rebutted the presumption of equal contribution as to all the marital assets of any significance. With respect to the \u201cjust and proper\u201d analysis, the question is whether, despite the inaccuracies in the trial court\u2019s spreadsheet, husband has demonstrated that a \u201cjust and proper\u201d distribution of the assets requires giving him a greater share than the court awarded him. We answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>At the time of dissolution, the parties were relatively young and in good health, there were no joint children of the marriage, and both parties were capable of self-support. Throughout the last nine years of their 11-year marriage, the parties conducted their lives in a meticulously scripted way so as to avoid commingling their economic affairs. In the absence of countervailing circumstances, the division of assets and liabilities that the court made was consistent with the expectations that would reasonably flow from such an arrangement. <em>Cf. Jacobs and Jacobs, </em>179 Or App 146, 152-53, 39 P3d 251 (2002) (awarding separately owned property to wife where property was not commingled and husband was separately paid for his contributions to the property). It follows that, although unequal, that division was not inequitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\"> Property acquired before the marriage is not subject to the presumption of equal contribution. The party who acquired premarital property generally is entitled to receive that property in the marital-property division, unless other considerations make it just and proper to distribute it differently. <em>Loomis and Loomis, </em>247 Or App 127, 136, 268 P3d 700 (2011). No such property is at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\"> Husband had valued them at a substantially higher amount but ultimately took the position that they should be equally divided because they were impossible to value.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
