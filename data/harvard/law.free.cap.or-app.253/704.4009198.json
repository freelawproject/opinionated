(Peace River) sought to recover damages from defendant Proseeds Marketing, Inc. (Proseeds) based on Proseeds\u2019 failure to purchase grass seed from Peace River as agreed pursuant to a series of contracts. The case was tried to the court, which entered a general judgment awarding Peace River damages along with prejudgment interest, post-judgment interest, and costs and disbursements. Peace River now appeals, raising five assignments of error. As explained below, we conclude that several of Peace River\u2019s assignments of error are well taken and, therefore, reverse and remand the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The following background facts were found by the trial court or are undisputed. Peace River, a Canadian company, is an agricultural cooperative. Proseeds is an Oregon corporation that, among other things, purchases and resells grass seed. In 1999 and 2000, the parties entered into a series of contracts for sale and purchase of grass seed through an Oregon seed broker. The form contracts were prepared by the broker and, pursuant to those contracts, Proseeds was to purchase from Peace River the total grass-seed production over two years for a set number of acres. The broker noted on the contracts an estimated production for each year. The contracts did not, however, specify particular fields on which the grass seed would be produced or particular farmers that would grow the seed. For the most part, the contracts provided that Proseeds would pay between 70 and 72 cents Canadian per pound of grass seed; the seed was to be delivered by Peace River to Minnesota or Oregon, as directed by Proseeds. The contracts incorporated a set of standard rules for seed trading known as the NORAMSEED rules. After entering into the contracts with Proseeds, Peace River contracted with a number of growers to plant the crop that it would need to fulfill its obligation to Proseeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">After the parties entered into their contracts, the price of grass seed dropped significantly. Proseeds provided shipping instructions and took delivery of some grass seed pursuant to the contracts, and all of the seed that Peace River <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>shipped to Proseeds was of the type and quality required under the contracts. However, although Peace River made multiple demands for shipping instructions for the remainder of the grass seed production under the contracts, Proseeds refused to provide shipping instructions. Eventually, Peace River declared Proseeds to be in breach and cancelled the contracts. Over the next several years, Peace River stored the grass seed that its growers had delivered and was eventually able to sell at least some of the seed.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Initially, the parties\u2019 dispute was submitted to arbitration, which resulted in a substantial award of damages to Peace River. Peace River sought to enforce the arbitration award in court and, over Proseeds\u2019 objection, the trial court concluded that the arbitration was binding and entered judgment. The matter was appealed and, on appeal, this court concluded that the arbitration was not binding and the case was remanded for trial. <em>Peace River Seed Co-Op v. Proseeds Marketing, </em>204 Or App 523, 132 P3d 31, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 216 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The case was tried to the court in December 2008. The court concluded that Proseeds had breached its contract with Peace River. Peace River had asserted that, as its damages, it was entitled to recover from Proseeds the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of the breach. However, the court determined that Peace River could not \u201crecover damages in an amount greater than actually incurred.\u201d Accordingly, it concluded that Peace River\u2019s compensatory damages would be the lesser of the \u201cdifference between the actual sales price received by [Peace River] upon ultimate sale [of the seed] and the contract price with [Proseeds]\u201d or \u201cthe difference between the market price and the contract price on the total production, less the seed purchased and paid for by [Proseeds].\u201d The court declined to attempt to calculate the damages based on the evidence submitted and, instead, directed Peace River to calculate damages based on its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Peace River sought reconsideration, again asserting that, based on Oregon\u2019s adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), specifically ORS 72.7080(1), it was entitled to damages measured by the difference in the contract price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>for the seed and the market price at the time of the breach. It also submitted a calculation of those damages. Proseeds, on the other hand, submitted a calculation of damages that, among other things, purported to account for Peace River\u2019s later sales. Peace River responded by indicating that, in its view, there was insufficient evidence to calculate damages based on later sales and that it was \u201cimpossible to identify any sales of seed that can be \u2018identified\u2019 to [Proseeds\u2019] (as opposed to others\u2019) contracts.\u201d Peace River further contended that Proseeds\u2019 calculations were based on flawed premises. The trial court noted that it had \u201cno way of knowing what sum [Peace River] believes [it is] entitled to using the measure of damages [the court] found was applicable to this claim.\u201d The court concluded that, despite the fact that Peace River contended Proseeds\u2019 calculations were based upon \u201cflawed assumptions, average prices, net sales prices, inapplicable credits, inaccurate calculations, and the ignoring of certain facts,\u201d because Peace River did not submit damage calculations accounting for its later sales, the court was \u201cstuck with\u201d Proseeds\u2019 calculations and had \u201cno option but to accept\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">In addition, Peace River sought attorney fees and all of its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the course of litigation. It asserted that it was entitled to recover those amounts under the parties\u2019 contracts and an Alberta Rule of Court. The court concluded that Peace River \u201cdid not make an adequate allegation necessary to obtain an award of attorney fees pursuant to ORCP 68.\u201d Furthermore, it considered the application of the NORAMSEED rules, which Peace River asserted were incorporated into the contracts and allowed for recovery of attorney fees and all other out-of-pocket expenses, and concluded that the provision of the NORAMSEED rules in question was ambiguous and that the \u201cambiguity must be resolved against the party drafting the contract, and in this instance, that is [Peace River].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court\u2019s opinion did not address Peace River\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses. Ultimately, the trial court entered a general judgment that awarded damages. The court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>award attorney fees or out-of-pocket expenses. Peace River now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">In its first assignment of error, Peace River contends that the trial court erred in allowing Proseeds to pay the judgment using a 2002 exchange rate. According to Peace River, pursuant to ORS 24.290 and ORS 24.260, Proseeds was required to pay the judgment using the \u201cconversion rate in effect on the day before the day of payment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Proseeds concedes that the trial court erred \u201cby failing to determine the exchange rate based on a conversion date consistent with\u201d those statutory provisions. We agree, and accept the concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Peace River next asserts, in its second assignment of error, that the \u201ctrial court erred in awarding $36,750 in damages from an agreed \u2018wash\u2019 transaction in Canadian funds * * * without explanation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In particular, plaintiff asserts that the damages set forth in the evidence had been calculated in U.S. funds rather than Canadian funds, and the trial court, in awarding that dollar amount in Canadian funds, \u201cgave Proseeds the benefit of duplicate discounts for the exchange rate.\u201d Proseeds responds that \u201c[t]he issue on appeal was not preserved and in fact was invited\u201d by Peace River. We agree with Proseeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">To be raised and considered on appeal, an issue must generally be first presented to the trial court. <em>Peeples v. </em>Lampert, 345 Or 209, 219, 191 P3d 637 (2008); <em>see </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court ***.\u201d). \u201c[T]he determination whether a particular issue was preserved for appeal is a \u2018practical one\u2019; it will depend on whether the policies behind the preservation requirement \u2014 judicial efficiency, full development of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>record, and procedural fairness to the parties and the trial court \u2014 are met in an individual case.\u201d <em>Charles v. Palomo, </em>347 Or 695, 700, 227 P3d 737 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 340-41, 211 P3d 262 (2009)). Accordingly, we review an issue advanced by a party on appeal only where \u201cthat party raised the issue below with enough particularity to assure that the trial court was able to \u2018identify its alleged error\u2019 so as to \u2018consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is <em>warranted.\u2019\u201dId. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000)). Similarly, error that is invited is not a ground for reversal. Under the invited error doctrine, \u201ca party who was actively instrumental in bringing about an alleged error cannot be heard to complain, and the case ought not to be reversed because of it.\u201d <em>State v. Kammeyer, </em>226 Or App 210, 214, 203 P3d 274, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 590 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Here, at trial, Peace River submitted two pieces of evidence regarding the transaction at issue and, during the trial, Peace River\u2019s attorney informed the court that the damages for the \u201cwash\u201d transaction were in U.S. dollars. However, later, at a hearing many months after the trial for the purpose of discussing damages and attorney fees, the parties and court engaged in the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">\u201c[Proseeds\u2019 attorney]: *** [I]t\u2019s reasonable that we would pay that total sum that was Peace River\u2019s obligation in that wash around of 36,750. And so the total adding those three numbers is $317,457 \u2014 317,457 Canadian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">\u201c[Proseeds\u2019attorney]: And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">\u201cThe Court: Give me the three numbers again? 36,750.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">\u201c[Proseeds\u2019 attorney]: 46,450 for storage. Which is what their claim was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">\u201c[Proseeds\u2019 attorney]: \u2014in Exhibit 409. And $234,257 Canadian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-12\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-13\">H: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Okay. And that\u2019s Canadian based upon what exchange rate or is there an exchange rate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">\u201c[Peace River\u2019s attorney]: We deal with that at the time of the judgment\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">\u201c[Peace River\u2019s attorney]: \u2014under the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">\u201c[Proseeds\u2019 attorney]: So it\u2019s just in Canadian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">\u201c[Peace River\u2019s attorney]: Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">After the hearing, the court issued a letter opinion in which it accepted the damages presented at the hearing, including the \u201c$36,750 for \u2018wash around\u2019\u201d and instructed Peace River to submit a form of judgment. After the hearing in which it agreed that the damages were \u201cjust in Canadian\u201d dollars, Peace River submitted, among other things, forms of judgment and correspondence to the court. However, it never informed the court of its view that the $36,750 was a U.S. dollar damage amount and that the information the court had to the contrary was incorrect. Thus, Peace River was actively instrumental in the trial court awarding $36,750 in damages for the \u201cwash\u201d transaction in Canadian funds and we do not consider the issue further on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">We turn next to Peace River\u2019s third assignment of error. In that assignment, Peace River argues that the trial court erred \u201cin refusing to award Peace River direct damages measured by the difference in the contract price and the market price at the time of breach as required by ORS 72.7080(1).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is Peace River\u2019s position that it is \u201cunequivocally entitled to recover market price damages under ORS 72.7080(1)\u201d and the trial court\u2019s measure of damages is \u201ccontrary to the clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>language\u201d of the UCC.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Boldface omitted.) Proseeds responds that Peace River, \u201chaving resold, could not claim greater damages based on the contract/market differential.\u201d As explained below, we agree with Peace River that, under the pertinent provisions of the UCC, it may recover its damages pursuant to ORS 72.7080.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Generally, in interpreting a statute, we examine the statutory text in context and in light of any pertinent legislative history offered by the parties. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009); <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-11, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). Furthermore, comments to the UCC \u201care actually statements of the purpose of each section\u201d and \u201c[t]he legislative intent behind the UCC can therefore be derived from the language of the statute itself and the language of the comments.\u201d <em>Security Bank v. Chiapuzio, </em>304 Or 438, 445 n 6, 747 P2d 335 (1987). Because the UCC is a uniform law, case law from other states and discussions by scholars in the field are also relevant. <em>Id. </em>Here, in particular, the parties\u2019 arguments present the question of how the UCC remedies sections, and specifically ORS 72.7030, ORS 72.7060, and ORS 70.7080, work together.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">There are a number of remedies available to a seller of goods upon the buyer\u2019s breach. Those remedies are outlined in ORS 72.7030:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">\u201cWhere the buyer wrongfully rejects or revokes acceptance of goods or fails to make a payment due on or before delivery or repudiates with respect to a part or the whole, then with respect to any goods directly affected and, if the breach is of the whole contract as provided in ORS 72.6120, then also with respect to the whole undelivered balance, the aggrieved seller may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\u201c(1) Withhold delivery of such goods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\">\u201c(2) Stop delivery by any bailee as provided in ORS 72.7050.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\u201c(3) Proceed under ORS 72.7040 respecting goods still unidentified to the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u201c(4) Resell and recover damages as provided in ORS 72.7060.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u201c(5) Recover damages for nonacceptance as provided in ORS 72.7080 or in a proper case the price as provided in ORS 72.7090.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">\u201c(6) Cancel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Official Comment 1 to that section explains that \u201c[t]his Article rejects any doctrine of election of remedy as a fundamental policy and thus the remedies are essentially cumulative in nature and include all of the available remedies for breach.\u201d UCC \u00a7 2-703, Comment 1. Thus, whether a particular remedy is available to an aggrieved seller is dependent on the facts of the particular case. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt should also be noted that this Act requires its remedies to be liberally administered ***.\u201d UCC \u00a7 2-703, Comment 4. Thus, at first blush, it appears that a seller may, at its own option, seek its remedy for a buyer\u2019s breach under either ORS 72.7060 or ORS 72.7080. Furthermore, those sections, on their face, do not indicate that a sale of the goods after the buyer\u2019s breach will preclude an aggrieved seller from pursuing a remedy pursuant to ORS 72.7080; on its face, the UCC gives a seller the choice of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">ORS 72.7060 concerns damages relating to a resale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">\u201c(1) Under the conditions stated in ORS 72.7030 on seller\u2019s remedies, the seller may resell the goods concerned or the undelivered balance thereof. Where the resale is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner the seller may recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price together with any incidental damages allowed under the provisions of ORS 72.7100, but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer\u2019s breach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\"><em>\u201c(2) </em>Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section or unless otherwise agreed resale may be at public or private sale including sale by way of one or more contracts to sell or of identification to an existing contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>of the seller. Sale may be as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the sale including the method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable. The resale must be reasonably identified as referring to the broken contract, but it is not necessary that the goods be in existence or that any or all of them have been identified to the contract before the breach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\">\u201c(3) Where the resale is at private sale the seller must give the buyer reasonable notification of intention to resell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">\u201c(4) Wfiiere the resale is at public sale:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">\u201c(a) Only identified goods can be sold except where there is a recognized market for a public sale of futures in goods of the kind; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">\u201c(b) It must be made at a usual place or market for public sale if one is reasonably available and except in the case of goods which are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily the seller must give the buyer reasonable notice of the time and place of the resale; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">\u201c(c) If the goods are not to be within the view of those attending the sale the notification of sale must state the place where the goods are located and provide for their reasonable inspection by prospective bidders; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">\u201c(d) The seller may buy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\"><em>&lt;(% </em>s}; <em>tfc </em>\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-11\">\u201c(6) The seller is not accountable to the buyer for any profit made on any resale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">ORS 72.7080, in turn, provides a seller\u2019s general measure of damages in the event of a buyer\u2019s breach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-13\">\u201c(1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section and to the provisions of ORS 72.7230[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] with respect to proof of market price, the measure of damages for nonacceptance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>or repudiation by the buyer is the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the unpaid contract price together with any incidental damages provided in ORS 72.7100, but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer\u2019s breach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">\u201c(2) If the measure of damages provided in subsection (1) of this section is inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done then the measure of damages is the profit (including reasonable overhead) which the seller would have made from full performance by the buyer, together with any incidental damages provided in ORS 72.7100, due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of resale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Under those sections, where a seller fails to comply with the requirements set forth in ORS 72.7060, the seller may not recover damages under that section and must instead prove damages under ORS 72.7080. UCC \u00a7 2-706, Comment 2 (\u201cFailure to act properly under this section deprives the seller of the measure of damages here provided and relegates him to that provided in Section 2-708.\u201d). Thus, it is clear that a later resale does not categorically preclude a seller from obtaining damages pursuant to ORS 72.7080. Indeed, where the seller fails to comply with the standards for a resale set forth in ORS 72.7060, he cannot rely on that section for damages and must seek damages pursuant to ORS 72.7080. In the absence of a restriction within the UCC that precludes an aggrieved seller from seeking its remedy pursuant to ORS 72.7080 if the seller has resold, we would decline to impose such a restriction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>The rationale for allowing an aggrieved seller to choose to seek its remedy under ORS 72.7080, regardless of the fact of a later resale, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\">\u201c[A]t the time of the breach, the seller retains the right to the benefit of her bargain. The logical and expected measure of damages is the contract price-market price differential. This measure of damages is the risk the buyer assumed by entering into the contract; it is the right conferred upon the seller by the buyer. Therefore, the buyer is not in a position to complain when the seller demands this measure of damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">\u201cAt the same time * * *, the seller\u2019s restriction of freedom has ended; the buyer is no longer in a position to demand any restriction on that freedom arising out of the agreement. If the seller decides to resell the goods, or act or forbear in any other way, the buyer is foreclosed from asserting any rights arising from the seller\u2019s act or forbearance as long as the seller is claiming damages under section 2-708(1). That logically expected measure of damages is the seller\u2019s right under the contract. Moreover, the buyer\u2019s obligation is no more than the right the buyer originally conferred upon the seller.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Henry Gabriel, <em>The Seller\u2019s Election of Remedies Under the Uniform Commercial Code: An Expectation Theory, </em>23 Wake Forest L Rev 429, 449 (1988); <em>see also </em>Ellen A. Peters, <em>Remedies for Beach of Contracts Relating to the Sale of Goods Under the Uniform Commercial Code: A Roadmap for Article Two, </em>73 Yale LJ 199, 260 (1963) (history of UCC, including deletion of language prefacing a seller\u2019s right to recover damages for nonacceptance with \u201c\u2018so far as any goods have not been resold,\u201d\u2019 clarified that an aggrieved seller was not required to elect between damages under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Section 2-706 and Section 2-708 and \u201cindicates a purpose to safeguard alternative remedies\u201d). In other words, in paying the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of the breach, the breaching buyer is required only to meet the obligation to which it agreed when it entered into the contract. The seller\u2019s decision to resell its own goods after the buyer has failed to comply with the terms of the contract does not give the buyer the right to insist upon a different measure of damages. <em>See </em>UCC \u00a7 2-706, Comment 2 (seller acts on its own behalf; \u201ctheory of seller\u2019s agency is *** rejected\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">That rationale is especially persuasive under the circumstances presented in this case. After Proseeds failed to fulfill its obligations pursuant to the production contracts, Peace River was left with substantial quantities of grass seed. It proceeded to store the grass seed and attempted to recover damages from Proseeds. Over a period of years after the breach, Peace River eventually sold at least some of the grass seed. We note, however, that there is no indication that, in conducting those resales, Peace River particularly identified those sales as referring to the broken contracts with Proseeds. In any event, in our view, the UCC entitles Peace River to seek the measure of damages to which it was entitled at the time Proseeds breached the contracts: the difference between the price under the parties\u2019 contracts and the market price for the seed at the time of the breach. We are unpersuaded that Proseeds should be entitled to the benefit of Peace River\u2019s efforts, over several years, to find purchasers for the substantial quantities of grass seed with which it was left following the breach. For those reasons, we agree with Peace River that the trial court erred in its measure of damages, and the case must be remanded for a proper calculation of those damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Finally, in its fourth and fifth assignments of error, Peace River asserts that the trial court erred in \u201cfailing to award any of Peace River\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses of collection, and in failing to issue any findings or conclusions to explain that decision\u201d and \u201cin refusing to award Peace River its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Specifically, Peace River asserts that (1) it adequately pleaded a claim for attorney fees, (2) Alberta, Canada, law applies and entitles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>it to an award of fees, and (3) it should have been awarded both its fees and out-of-pocket expenses pursuant to the NORAMSEED rules incorporated into the parties\u2019 contracts. Proseeds responds that (1) the law of Oregon, not Canada, applies, (2) Peace River did not sufficiently plead a claim for attorney fees under the NORAMSEED rules, and (3) in any event, the NORAMSEED rules cannot be reasonably interpreted to provide for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">We begin with the question of whether Peace River adequately pleaded a claim for attorney fees. As noted, the trial court concluded that Peace River had failed to \u201cmake an adequate allegation necessary to obtain an award of attorney fees pursuant to ORCP 68.\u201d ORCP 68 C(2)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">\u201cA party seeking attorney fees shall allege the facts, statute or rule that provides a basis for the award of such fees in a pleading filed by that party. Attorney fees may be sought before the substantive right to recover such fees accrues. No attorney fees shall be awarded unless a right to recover such fee is alleged as provided in this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Although the pleading requirement of ORCP 68 C(2)(a) is mandatory,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">\u201cthe party seeking fees does not need to allege the statutory basis for an award when the facts alleged in the party\u2019s pleadings would provide a basis for such an award, the parties in the case have \u2018fairly been alerted that attorney fees would be sought, and no prejudice would result.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-8\"><em>Rymer v. Zwingli, </em>240 Or App 687, 691, 247 P3d 1246, <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 716 (2011) (quoting Page <em>and Page, </em>103 Or App 431, 434, 797 P2d 408 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Here, however, Peace River\u2019s operative pleading specifically pleaded the basis for its request for attorney fees. In its third amended complaint, Peace River alleged that, \u201c[p]ursuant to the parties\u2019 contracts and Alberta Rule of Court 601, Peace River is entitled to an award of attorney fees as the prevailing party in this action.\u201d Peace River attached to the pleading its contracts with Proseeds that, in turn, specifically incorporated the NORAMSEED rules. And, before both the trial court and this court, Peace River has relied on both the Alberta Rule of Court and the NORAMSEED rules, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>as incorporated into the parties\u2019 contracts, as the basis for its assertion that it is entitled to recover attorney fees. The allegation included in Peace River\u2019s pleading is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of ORCP 68 C(2)(a), and the trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">We reach that conclusion notwithstanding Proseeds\u2019 argument that Peace River\u2019s third amended complaint cannot form the basis for an award of fees under the provisions of the NORAMSEED rules. Proseeds points out that Peace River\u2019s second amended complaint included a claim for attorney fees that directly relied on the NORAMSEED rules, which Proseeds moved to strike. The trial court granted Proseeds\u2019 motion to strike, and Peace River did not assign error to that ruling. We disagree with Proseeds\u2019 assertion that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to strike affects Peace River\u2019s ability to rely on the NORAMSEED rules as a basis for recovery of attorney fees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">\u201cWhen the court grants a motion striking part of a pleading, a party <em>must </em>amend the pleading following the procedures set out in ORCP 23. ORCP 23 D, in turn, requires that, when a pleading is amended before trial, \u2018it shall be done by filing a new pleading to be called the amended pleading, or by interlineation, deletion, or otherwise. Such amended pleading shall be complete in itself, without reference to the original or any preceding amended one.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-6\"><em>Olson v. Howard, </em>237 Or App 256, 262, 239 P3d 510 (2010) (emphasis in original). \u201cThe effect of filing an amended complaint is to supersede the original pleading.\u201d <em>Balboa Apartments v. Patrick, </em>351 Or 205, 212, 263 P3d 1011 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Here, the trial court granted the motion to strike and, as required, Peace River filed its third amended complaint. The third amended complaint did not reference the prior pleadings, but did contain an allegation that Peace River was entitled to attorney fees under a particular Alberta rule, and under the contracts. Those contracts were attached to the pleading and incorporated the NORAMSEED rules by reference. Because the effect of filing the third amended complaint was to completely replace and supersede the prior pleading, the paragraph included in the third amended complaint is the operative allegation for attorney fees. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>order striking a different allegation from an earlier pleading does not affect Peace River\u2019s ability to seek attorney fees to the extent that they are sufficiently pleaded in the operative complaint. As we have already concluded, the third amended complaint is sufficient to permit Peace River to seek an award of attorney fees under the Alberta rule and under the NORAMSEED rules, as incorporated into the parties\u2019 contracts. Accordingly, we reject Proseeds\u2019 contention with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">We turn next to Peace River\u2019s assertion that Alberta, Canada, law applies and, under the Alberta Rules of Court, it is entitled to recover its attorney fees. Peace River asserts that Alberta, and all of Canada, \u201cfollows the \u2018English rule\u2019 presumptively allowing the prevailing party to recover its reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Proseeds disagrees with Peace River\u2019s assertion that Alberta law applies, contending that \u201ca proper examination of the facts, as applied to the pertinent legal rules, instead leads to the application of Oregon law.\u201d We agree with Proseeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We begin by observing that substantive issues are resolved according to the law of the forum that has the most significant relationship with the dispute while \u201cmatters concerned primarily with judicial administration are governed by the law of the forum state because it would create a tremendous burden to require a state court to apply local rules of another jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Stricklin v. </em>Soued, 147 Or App 399, 403, 936 P2d 398, <em>rev den, </em>362 Or 58 (1997); <em>Manz v. Continental American Life Ins. Co., </em>117 Or App 78, 80, 843 P2d 480 (1992), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>119 Or App 31, 849 P2d 549, <em>rev den, </em>317 Or 162 (1993) (\u201cOregon courts resolve procedural issues under Oregon law and substantive issues according to the forum having the most significant contacts with the dispute.\u201d). This court has held that the ability to recover attorney fees is an issue subject to choice-of-law analysis. <em>See Seattle-First National Bank v. Schriber, </em>51 Or App 441, 447-48, 625 P2d 1370 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\u201cThe proponent of the law of another forum has the obligation to identify material differences between the applicable law of Oregon and that of the other forum.\u201d <em>Spirit </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>Partners, LP v. Stoel Rives LLP, </em>212 Or App 295, 301, 157 P3d 1194 (2007). Furthermore, where the laws of Oregon and the proposed alternate forum do not actually conflict with one another, Oregon law applies. <em>Machado-Miller v. Mersereau &amp; Shannon, LLP, </em>180 Or App 586, 591, 43 P3d 1207 (2002). Here, Peace River asserts that, in contrast to the general law in Oregon, which allows a prevailing party to recover fees only as provided for by statute or contract, under Alberta law, a party may recover fees merely by virtue of having prevailed in the action. Proseeds does not contend otherwise; it instead argues that Oregon has the most significant relationship to the parties and the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">In the absence of an effective choice of law between the parties, the court considers which forum has the most significant contacts with the parties and the transaction to determine which forum\u2019s law applies. <em>See Manz, </em>117 Or App at 80-82; <em>see also </em>ORS 15.360 (relating to choice of law applicable to contracts). We also consider whether the \u201cinterests of Oregon (its \u2018public policy\u2019) are so basic and important that we should not apply [the law of another jurisdiction], despite its significant connection to the transaction.\u201d <em>Straight Grain Builders v. Track N\u2019 Trail, </em>93 Or App 86, 90, 760 P2d 1350, <em>rev den, </em>307 Or 246 (1988). Some of the contacts that are generally taken into account to determine the law applicable to an issue include the place of contracting, the place of negotiation of a contract, the place of performance, the location of the subject matter of the contract, and the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties. <em>Manz, </em>117 Or App at 82 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 188 (1971)); <em>see also </em>ORS 15.360(1) (with respect to choice of law as to the \u201cthe rights and duties of a party with regard to an issue in a contract,\u201d relevant connections include \u201cplace of negotiation, making, performance, or subject matter of the contract, or the domicile, habitual residence or pertinent place of business of a party\u201d). However, the rights of the parties to a contract for the sale of goods will generally be governed by the law of the place of delivery, unless another forum has a more significant relationship to the transaction. <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 191. That is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>in part, because \u201c[d]elivery is the most significant stage of the sales transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment e.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Here, most significantly, the contracts provided that the seed was to be delivered \u201cFOB\u201d to Minnesota or Oregon, as directed by the buyer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In view of that provision, in determining whether to apply Oregon or Canada law, the place of delivery militates in favor of the application of the law of Oregon. Furthermore, the parties entered into their contracts through an Oregon broker and the buyer, Proseeds, is an Oregon company with its principal place of business in Oregon. <em>See Capital One Bank v. Fort, </em>242 Or App 166, 174 n 4, 255 P3d 508 (2011) (noting, to support a conclusion that Oregon law applied, that \u201cmost importantly, Oregon is the residence of one of the parties to the contract\u201d). Even though the seller was in Canada and the seed to be sold was grown in Canada, all the circumstances of the transaction in question, taken together, weigh more heavily in favor of the application of Oregon law.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Peace River contends that, even if Oregon law applies, the trial court erred in failing to award attorney fees and other out-of-pocket expenses Peace River incurred because the parties\u2019 contracts provide for recovery of \u201ccharges for collection.\u201d It is Peace River\u2019s position that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the parties\u2019 agreements and that, under a correct interpretation, it is entitled to recover its expenses, including attorney fees. Proseeds responds that \u201ccharges for collection\u201d cannot reasonably be construed to include attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">As noted, the parties\u2019 contracts incorporate the provisions of the NORAMSEED rules. NORAMSEED Rule XIV, which addresses payment, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201c2. In all cases, payment shall be made in full and immediately when due. Every portion of a shipment shall be paid for separately, as soon as payment falls due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">\u201c3. The <em>charges for collection </em>of payment shall be for the Seller\u2019s account unless the Buyer does not pay in full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>and immediately when due, in which case they shall be for the Buyer\u2019s account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\"><em>\u201c4. </em>a. If the Buyer does not pay within three working days of the due date of payment, from the date on which he can legally do so, he shall pay the <em>charges for collection, </em>as well as interest at a rate of <em>5% </em>per annum above the official bank rate in the Seller\u2019s country at the time the invoice was due for payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">(Emphasis added.) The parties\u2019 dispute regarding attorney-fees and other expenses in this case centers on the meaning of the phrase \u201ccharges for collection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Thus, the question before us involves the construction of a contract. \u201cTo interpret a contractual provision * * * the court follows three steps. First, the court examines the text of the disputed provision, in the context of the document as a whole. If the provision is clear, the analysis ends.\u201d <em>Yogman v. Parrott, </em>325 Or 358, 361, 937 P2d 1019 (1997). However, \u201c[w]ords or terms of a contract are ambiguous when they can, in context, be given more than one meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363-64 (internal quotation marks omitted). If the provision in question is ambiguous, the trier of fact will \u201cascertain the intent of the parties and construe the contract term consistent with the intent of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363 (internal quotation marks omitted). To resolve that question, the trial court may receive and consider extrinsic evidence relating to intent. <em>Id. </em>at 363-64; <em>see also Williams v. Wise, </em>139 Or App 276, 281, 911 P2d 1261 (1996). \u201cIf the meaning of a contractual provision remains ambiguous after the first two steps have been followed, the court relies on appropriate maxims of construction.\u201d <em>Yogman, </em>325 Or at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Here, we conclude that the trial court did not properly follow those analytical steps in determining whether Peace River could recover its attorney fees and other out-of-pocket expenses as \u201ccharges for collection.\u201d We first observe that, in its analysis, the trial court discussed the meaning of \u201cthe term \u2018fees\u2019 in the NORAMSEED rules.\u201d However, that term is not used in the relevant rule and was not at issue in this case; instead, the parties\u2019 dispute was about the meaning of</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the term \u201ccharges for collection.\u201d As Proseeds acknowledges, the trial court did not construe that contractual language. Indeed, the trial court never mentioned the phrase \u201ccharges for collection\u201d in its determination of whether Peace River was entitled to recover attorney fees and other expenses under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Nonetheless, whether a contractual term is ambiguous is a question for the court and, if the provision is unambiguous, \u201cthe court construes the contract as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Business Men\u2019s Service Co. v. Obrist, </em>130 Or App 577, 581, 883 P2d 219 (1994), <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 507 (1995). As noted, a contractual provision is ambiguous \u201cif it is capable of more than one sensible and reasonable interpretation\u201d; a \u201cterm is unambiguous if its meaning is so clear as to preclude doubt by a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Here, we conclude that, as a matter of law, the term \u201ccharges for collection\u201d is ambiguous; the meaning of the term is not so clear as to preclude doubt by a reasonable person. Under the provisions at issue, \u201ccharges for collection\u201d are for the seller\u2019s account unless the buyer does not pay when due; under those circumstances, the buyer \u201cshall pay the charges for collection.\u201d It is not clear whether that phrase refers to pecuniary obligations incurred by the seller in the act of collecting on an existing debt or in establishing the existence of the debt in the first place. Furthermore, it is unclear how broad the \u201ccharges\u201d that must be paid are\u2014 whether the term (1) includes only administrative costs of billing, (2) extends as broadly as Peace River reads it, including all costs of subsequent litigation to establish that a debt is owed and attorney fees incurred in such litigation, or (3) contemplates payment of some amount between those extremes. In any event, the term \u201ccharges for collection\u201d is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation and is, therefore, ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">As noted, when a contractual provision is ambiguous, the necessary next step in the analysis is for the court to ascertain the intent of the parties and to consider extrinsic evidence, if any, pertinent to that issue. Importantly, here, it appears that the trial court failed to attempt to ascertain the intent of the parties, instead skipping from determining the agreement to be ambiguous to applying a maxim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>construction. It is only if the court is unable to determine the intent of the parties in light of the circumstances and extrinsic evidence on that issue that it is to apply maxims of construction to construe a contractual provision. \u201cDetermining the meaning of * * * extrinsic evidence is * * * a factual inquiry to be performed by the factfinder in the first instance.\u201d <em>Hammond v. Hammond, </em>246 Or App 775, 783, 268 P3d 691 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">In this case, there was some evidence in the record that would relate to the parties\u2019 intent. Peace River \u201curge[d the trial court] that the \u2018tradition\u2019\u201d in the industry treated the NORAMSEED rules as entitling the prevailing party to attorney fees. Furthermore, there was testimony from the manager for Peace River that expenses, including legal fees, were \u201cjust the cost of collection\u201d and that it was customary to be able to recover those expenses after litigation. Because a determination of the intent of the parties and the evaluation of extrinsic evidence is a factual inquiry, and because the trial court does not appear to have engaged in that inquiry, we conclude that it is appropriate to remand with respect to this issue so that the trial court may consider the intent of the parties in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We further observe that, when it engaged in the third step of the contractual analysis, the trial court in this case determined that the contract \u201cmust be resolved against the party drafting the contract, and in this instance, that is [Peace River].\u201d However, as the parties agree on appeal, Peace River did not draft the contract in this case. Indeed, the trial court itself specifically found that the parties \u201centered into a contract for the sale and purchase of seed through a broker. The contract was prepared by the broker.\u201d Thus, the court\u2019s reliance on that maxim of construction to construe the provision against Peace River, under the facts of this case, was improper. If, on remand, after considering evidence relating to the parties\u2019 intent, the court concludes that the meaning of the provision in question remains ambiguous, it must decide on an appropriate maxim of construction, in view of the facts of the case, to use at the third step of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-5\"> As discussed later, the trial court did not actually consider the text of the provision of the NORAMSEED rules in question. Instead, it appears to have analyzed language that is not included in those rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\"> ORS 24.290(2) provides that a \u201cjudgment or award on a foreign-money claim is payable in that foreign money or, at the option of the debtor, in the amount of United States dollars which will purchase that foreign money on the conversion date at a bank-offered spot rate * * *.\u201d Under ORS 24.260(3), the \u201cconversion date\u201d is \u201cthe banking day next preceding the date on which money * * * js * * * [p]aid to a claimant in an action or distribution proceeding * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\"> Peace River explains that the \u201cwash\u201d transaction was one where Proseeds agreed to pay to Peace River the difference between the contract price and the market price on the date of intended delivery for a particular quantity of seed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b731-12\"> As discussed below, with respect to its entitlement to attorney fees, Peace River asserts that Canadian law applies. With respect to its third assignment of error, Peace River\u2019s arguments are made under the UCC. Likewise, Peace River\u2019s assertions to the trial court relied on its interpretation of ORS 72.7030, ORS 72.7060, and ORS 72.7080 as well as the comments to those provisions. Although Peace River now observes that \u201cAlberta has adopted a code similar to, but more general than, the Uniform Commercial Code called the \u2018Alberta Sales of Goods Act,\u201d\u2019 we do not consider the application of Alberta law with respect to this assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b732-7\"> In addition to its broad argument regarding the ability of a nonbreaching seller to choose to seek its remedy pursuant to ORS 72.7080 regardless of a later resale of goods, Peace River also makes several more specific arguments. It contends that the trial court\u2019s application of the resale measure of damages, ORS 72.7060, to this case ignores that section\u2019s requirement that the \u201cresale must be reasonably identified as referring to the broken contract.\u201d Furthermore, it asserts that it was a lost volume seller and that, in any event, for Proseeds to insist on application of the resale measure of damages in ORS 72.7060, Proseeds was required to prove that Peace River was <em>not </em>a lost volume seller. We resolve the issue presented based on Peace River\u2019s more general argument and, therefore, do not address its other arguments on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b734-14\"> ORS 72.7230 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-15\">\u201c(1) If an action based on anticipatory repudiation comes to trial before the time for performance with respect to some or all of the goods, any damages based on market price shall be determined according to the price of such goods prevailing at the time when the aggrieved party learned of the repudiation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-16\">\u201c(2) If evidence of a price prevailing at the times or places described in this chapter is not readily available the price prevailing within any reasonable time before or after the time described or at any other place which in commercial judgment or under usage of trade would serve as a reasonable substitute for the one described may be used, making any proper allowance for the cost of transporting the goods to or from such other place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>\u201c(3) Evidence of a relevant price prevailing at a time or place other than the one described in this chapter offered by one party is not admissible unless and until the party has given the other party such notice as the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b735-10\"><em> As </em>part of its analysis, Proseeds refers to a discussion found in James J.

We note that other states have come down on both sides of the issue. <em>See, e.g., Roye Realty &amp; Developing, Inc. v.
