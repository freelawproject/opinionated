J.</author>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Plaintiff Stephen Lucas appeals a judgment in favor of defendant Lake County, contending that the trial court erred in (1) dismissing, on summary judgment, his blacklisting claim as being barred by claim preclusion arising from prior federal litigation between the parties and (2) granting judgment on the pleadings as to his wrongful discharge claim on the ground that the complaint did not sufficiently allege that plaintiff\u2019s termination contravened an \u201cimportant public duty.\u201d Defendant cross-assigns error, contending that, because plaintiff\u2019s wrongful discharge claim was also barred by claim preclusion principles, the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment as to that claim. As amplified below, we conclude that claim preclusion did not bar either of plaintiff\u2019s claims and, for that reason, the trial court erred in allowing summary judgment as to the blacklisting claim but properly denied it as to the wrongful discharge claim. We further conclude that, because plaintiff alleged that his termination contravened an \u201cimportant public duty,\u201d the trial court erred in allowing judgment on the pleadings as to the wrongful discharge claim. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Because the circumstances of this case involve litigation between the parties in both federal and state courts, as well as extensive motion practice in the state court action from which this appeal originates, the operative procedural facts, although undisputed, are somewhat complicated. For that reason, our recitation of those facts is necessarily detailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">On April 28, 2005, defendant terminated plaintiff, a deputy sheriff sergeant, from his position as the jail manager of the Lake County Jail. At that time, the Lake County Sheriff did not tell plaintiff the reason for his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">In July 2006, plaintiff filed an action against defendant in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon alleging, among other things, that defendant violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 USC \u00a7 12112, by terminating his employment because of a permanent partial disability related to his former military service or a perceived disability. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>alleged that the federal court had supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s state law claims for unlawful employment practices and defamation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, plaintiff alleged that defendant had committed unlawful employment practices by (1) terminating plaintiff because of a disability or a perceived disability, in violation of ORS 659A.112; (2) terminating plaintiff because he had filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim during his employment, in violation of ORS 659A.040; and (3) fraudulently inducing plaintiff, in violation of ORS 659.815, to move to Oregon to work for defendant based on representations that he would be hired as a \u201cSergeant/Jail Manager\u201d at a commensurate salary when, for the first few months of his employment, he held the position of corrections officer at a lower salary because of \u201cdissension in a collective bargaining unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">As pertinent to the issues on appeal, plaintiff also alleged a claim for defamation. That claim was essentially predicated on an allegation that, \u201c[o]n or about April 27, 200 [5]\u201d \u2014 the day <em>before </em>plaintiff\u2019s termination \u2014 defendant\u2019s Law Enforcement Data System (LEDS) representative sent an e-mail to the state-wide LEDS Training and Education Manager falsely indicating that \u201cplaintiff had cheated on an examination required for access to [LEDS] and had encouraged another employee to do so as well.\u201d Further, plaintiff alleged that the \u201cfalse statements were defamatory, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>were intended by defendant to injure plaintiff\u2019s reputation as a law enforcement officer and to interfere with his ability to obtain other employment in that field after his discharge by defendant.\u201d Plaintiff sought $100,000 in damages for injury to his reputation and extreme emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The federal court ordered the parties to complete discovery by March 9, 2007. Approximately a month before that deadline, defendant took plaintiff\u2019s deposition. During that deposition, plaintiff\u2019s attorney indicated that he anticipated that he would need to amend plaintiff\u2019s complaint based on information that he \u201cha[d] just received th[at] week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Although the record does not demonstrate that plaintiff filed a motion to amend his complaint in federal court, he filed a motion to extend the discovery deadline. In that motion, plaintiff\u2019s attorney explained that he sought to investigate a new theory about plaintiff\u2019s termination\u2014 <em>viz., </em>that defendant had wrongfully terminated plaintiff in retaliation for, and to conceal the results of, his investigation concerning an incident in which a deputy under his supervision had required a female inmate at the Lake County Jail to engage in oral sex. According to plaintiff\u2019s attorney, he needed additional discovery to ensure that filing a claim for, among other things, common-law wrongful discharge was \u201cjustified by the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">On April 2, 2007, the federal court held a hearing concerning plaintiff\u2019s motion. During that hearing, the court confirmed that defendant\u2019s position was that it had fired plaintiff because he had cheated on the LEDS examination. The following colloquy then ensued between the court and plaintiff\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Let\u2019s go next to the plaintiff\u2019s motion to extend the deadlines. In the light of [defense counsel\u2019s] commitment that there\u2019s only one issue in this case, I don\u2019t see any reason to extend it. This case should be tried as scheduled. Any problem with that, [plaintiff\u2019s counsel]? I\u2019m not inclined to allow you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: If, in fact, two things turn out to be the case that we now are, my client and I, more strongly than ever are convinced they are, that, one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the reason being asserted by the defendant is entirely untrue * * * for the termination; and, two, that the actual motive here was to keep [plaintiff] away from both criminal and civil claims involved by this woman, [the inmate] who alleges that she was sodomized in the jail, then under those conditions, <em>I want to bring another claim </em>and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, no. Wait a minute. No. I read your papers on that, your brief. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s your choice. <em>You can file another lawsuit if you want to, but it\u2019s clear that the only claim they made for firing *** him was as set forth as we\u2019ve discussed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">\u201cThat\u2019s the issue. This case has been ready for closing of discovery, let me just look. We\u2019re not going to \u2014 and she knew about all these things before, or he did. So we\u2019re not going to go back and start over on this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * And I don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve known about this other possibility, [plaintiff\u2019s counsel,] but we\u2019re not going to start this case all over for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\"><em>\u201cSo, we\u2019ll try this case on the pleadings that have been filed </em>and the motions for summary judgment that have been filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">In sum, in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to extend the discovery deadline, the federal court effectively refused to allow plaintiff to amend his complaint to allege a common-law wrongful discharge claim. The court then turned its attention to defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion. In that regard, as pertinent to the issues on appeal, defendant contended that plaintiff\u2019s defamation claim was barred under the doctrine of absolute privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">Then, on April 27, while the federal litigation was still pending and before the federal court ruled on the summary judgment motion, plaintiff filed this action in state court alleging claims for blacklisting, ORS 659.805,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>and common-law wrongful discharge. Unlike his defamation claim in federal court \u2014 which concerned a statement that was made <em>before </em>his termination \u2014 the allegations comprising plaintiffs blacklisting claim concerned statements and conduct that occurred <em>after </em>his termination. Specifically, plaintiff alleged that \u201c[o]n April 28, 2005\u201d \u2014 the day that plaintiff was terminated \u2014 the sheriff</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">\u201cand others acting at his direction falsely reported to the Department of State Police of the State of Oregon that plaintiff had been caught cheating on an examination for certification to access [LEDS], and arranged that this allegation be furnished to the Oregon Department of Public Safety Standards and Training in order to disqualify plaintiff from certification as a police officer or corrections officer in the State of Oregon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Further, plaintiff alleged that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\"><em>\u201c[f]rom April 28, 2005 through the present time </em>[(i.e., April 27, 2007)], defendant has published and caused to be published; and has conspired or contrived by correspondence to communicate, false allegations of dishonesty and unfitness against plaintiff as an employee it has discharged, with the intent and for the purpose of preventing plaintiff from securing employment as a police officer or corrections officer in the State of Oregon. The said conduct of defendant is blacklisting within the meaning of ORS 659.805.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">(Emphasis added.) Plaintiff sought (1) $100,000 in damages for \u201cemotional distress, humiliation, and injury to his reputation\u201d and (2) economic damages for lost wages, the amount of which plaintiff proposed to establish at the time of trial in the state action because they would continue to accrue over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s state court wrongful discharge claim was (and is) predicated on the same basic operative facts that he had described in his motion to extend the discovery deadline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>in the federal district court. In general terms, plaintiff alleged the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">After becoming aware that a deputy under his supervision had been flirting with female inmates, plaintiff had requested authorization from the sheriff to provide training to all deputies concerning appropriate conduct, but the sheriff had \u201crejected plaintiffs suggestion as unnecessary.\u201d Plaintiff later learned about an incident in which the subordinate deputy allegedly required a female inmate to engage in oral sex for contraband <em>{i.e., </em>tobacco). When interviewed by plaintiff, the inmate had confirmed the incident. Plaintiff immediately notified the sheriff, who authorized him to conduct an official investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Plaintiff had provided a written report of his investigation to the sheriff, recommending that \u201can outside agency be called in to conduct an investigation of possible criminal culpability.\u201d Thereafter, in the presence of the sheriff, plaintiff reported to defendant\u2019s insurance representative that \u201cthe incident had in fact occurred and was attributable in part to inadequate staff training and supervision.\u201d Following plaintiff\u2019s termination, the inmate who had been the victim of the purported misconduct commenced an action in federal district court in which she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">\u201calleged that [the sheriff] had failed to take any steps to deter [the deputy\u2019s] flirtatious behavior toward her, and that [the sheriff] had been reckless in failing to properly train and supervise [the deputy]. Defendant responded to the said lawsuit by denying that [the sheriff] was aware of any such behavior by [the deputy] or of any need for such training and supervision; and alleging that [the inmate] had failed to notify the county of any misconduct by [the deputy].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Against the backdrop of those factual allegations, plaintiff, in his common-law wrongful discharge claim alleged that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">\u201c[a]t all material times, [he] had important societal duties to notify defendant of reports and observations of inappropriate flirtatious conduct by [the deputy] toward female prisoners; to seek to provide additional training and supervision for corrections officers; to promptly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>objectively investigate reports of criminal conduct toward a prisoner by a corrections officer; and to cooperate fully and candidly in investigations of such reports by outside agencies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Plaintiff further alleged that his discharge was wrongful because \u201cdefendant terminated plaintiff\u2019s employment in retaliation for his having fulfilled the said duties and in order to conceal the facts regarding the defendant\u2019s civil liability for the conduct of [the deputy] toward [the female inmate].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">On May 7, 2007 \u2014 approximately 10 days after plaintiff filed his complaint in state court \u2014 the federal court litigation was concluded. The federal court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant on all of plaintiff\u2019s claims \u2014 that is, the federal ADA claim and the state claims for unlawful employment practices and defamation. Specifically, with regard to the defamation claim, the court concluded that absolute privilege barred plaintiff from pursuing his claim. The court entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Thereafter, defendant moved for summary judgment against both of plaintiff\u2019s claims in this case, asserting that the federal court\u2019s judgment precluded those claims. The parties\u2019 competing contentions as to the proper interplay between the federal court litigation and adjudication and the prosecution of the claims in this action were framed by reference to <em>Ram Technical Services, Inc. v. Koresko, </em>215 Or App 449, 171 P3d 374 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>217 Or App 463, 177 P3d 10 (2008) <em>(Ram I), rev\u2019d, </em>346 Or 215, 208 P3d 950 (2009) <em>(Ram II).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Our analysis in <em>Ram I </em>was, in turn, implicitly informed by section 25 comment e of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>(1982), which recognizes that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u201cas a general rule, claim preclusion will bar a plaintiff who litigates a federal claim in federal court from relitigating state claims that the plaintiff could have but did not litigate in the federal action.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] However, the <em>Restatement </em>also recognizes an exception to that general rule: If the federal court either clearly lacked jurisdiction over any pendent state law claims or, having jurisdiction, clearly would have declined to exercise its discretion to hear those state law claims, then claim preclusion does not bar litigating those claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><em>Ram II, </em>346 Or at 220 (citations omitted). <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In light of that construct, the parties\u2019 contentions before the trial court essentially reduced to a single <em>issue </em>\u2014 viz., whether, in the circumstances of this case, the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d controlled or the \u201cexception\u201d applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">For its part, defendant contended that the general rule required preclusion because plaintiff\u2019s state and federal claims arose out of the same factual transaction and that plaintiff, through his state claims, was simply seeking to relitigate (1) the propriety of his termination by alleging a new reason that it was wrongful and (2) \u201cthe circumstances surrounding plaintiff\u2019s lack of veracity during the LEDS examination] and defendant\u2019s related accusation.\u201d In sum, defendant, consistently with the general rule, asserted that plaintiff could have raised his claims in the federal action and, thus, was precluded from pursuing them now.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">As particular support for that position, defendant relied on our then-recent decision in <em>Ram I </em>in which we had held that \u201cbroadened supplemental jurisdiction rules not only allow plaintiffs to litigate both state and federal issues at once in federal court, but they also compel plaintiffs to assert all of their transactionally related claims in a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>federal forum \u2014 or risk losing them to claim preclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 215 Or App at 461. Consistently with <em>Ram I, </em>defendant contended that plaintiff was compelled to assert all of his transactionally related claims in a single federal forum. Further, defendant asserted that, because plaintiff had failed to do so, his claims were precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Plaintiff remonstrated that \u201cthe judgment in the Federal case d[id] not bar the claims alleged in this case.\u201d With regard to his blacklisting claim, plaintiff contended that claim preclusion was inapposite because that claim concerned a different factual transaction from the defamation claim adjudicated in federal court. That was so, according to plaintiff, because, unlike his defamation claim, the blacklisting claim involved communications that occurred <em>after </em>his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s primary contention, however, was that claim preclusion was inapposite here because the federal district court had not permitted plaintiff to adjudicate his blacklisting and wrongful discharge claims in the federal action. Specifically, plaintiff explained that he had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">\u201cearnestly attempted to join [his claims for blacklisting and wrongful discharge] into his federal case, but was frustrated from doing so both by the objection of the defendant, and the refusal of [the federal court] to permit such joinder when it might delay discovery and final adjudication of the existing claims. Thus, the claims in this case could not have been litigated in the federal action prior to final judgment in that case; and the rule of preclusion simply does not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">(Boldface in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Bluntly (at least in plaintiff\u2019s view): The \u201cexception\u201d to the Restatement\u2019s \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of preclusion applied because plaintiff had sought to amend his federal complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>to include his blacklisting and wrongful discharge claims and the federal court had clearly declined to allow him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion as to plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim but denied it as to the wrongful discharge claim. The trial court concluded that claim preclusion barred plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim because it was \u201crelated to the same factual transaction as the [federal] suit and is of such a nature that it could have been joined in it.\u201d In particular, the court noted that \u201c[t]he crux of plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim is the same as his defamation claim\u201d\u2014 <em>viz., </em>the publication of false allegations with the intent to interfere with plaintiff\u2019s ability to obtain employment as a law enforcement officer following his discharge. Further, citing our decision in <em>Ram I, </em>the court noted that, although the blacklisting claim could have been filed in the federal case, \u201c[p]laintiff never made any attempts to pursue the claim in his first suit.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion as to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The court, however, came to a different conclusion with regard to the wrongful discharge claim. Specifically, the court identified two reasons that claim preclusion did not bar that claim. First, the court explained that the wrongful discharge claim \u201c[was] not based upon the same factual transactions at issue in the Federal Court case. Both cases involved alleged wrongful dismissal, but they rely upon very different facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Second, and alternatively, the court explained that the wrongful discharge claim \u201ccould not have been joined in the first action since [the federal district court] effectively did not allow it to be joined.\u201d Specifically, the trial court explained that the \u201cmain focus [of the federal district court] was to keep the Federal Court case progressing to trial\u201d and that, consistently with <em>Ram 1, </em>plaintiff had effectively attempted to pursue his wrongful discharge claim in federal court when he sought to extend the discovery deadline. In sum, the court reasoned that, \u201c[although, plaintiff never actually moved to join the claim in the federal suit, it is clear that an attempt to do so would have been futile.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion as to the wrongful discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Defendant subsequently moved for judgment on the pleadings under ORCP 21 B as to plaintiff\u2019s wrongful discharge claim. In support of that motion, defendant relied principally on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lamson v. Crater Lake Motors, Inc., </em>346 Or 628, 216 P3d 852 (2009), and particularly on the court\u2019s statement that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-4\"><em>\u201ceven if </em>a \u2018public duty\u2019 wrongful discharge claim theoretically could arise in the absence of a law imposing a specific legal obligation to perform the act or acts that trigger the discharge, the sources of law that express the asserted \u2018public policy\u2019 must in <em>some </em>sense speak directly to those acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 638 (emphasis in original). In light of that reasoning, defendant contended that plaintiff\u2019s complaint failed to identify \u201ca sufficient basis in law, either by statute, constitutional provision, or existing case law, for his allegedly important societal [duty].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Plaintiff remonstrated that various statutes demonstrated that a sheriff is responsible for enforcing the criminal law and that, as a deputy, he has a derivative duty. Specifically, plaintiff explained that his duty to respond as he did to \u201cknowledge that a deputy under his supervision had engaged in criminal sexual activity and bribe-taking with a female prisoner\u201d derived \u201cfrom the Sheriff\u2019s own duties\u201d (boldface in original) under ORS 206.010(1) to \u201c[a]rrest and commit to prison all persons who break the peace *** and all persons guilty of public offenses.\u201d <em>See also </em>ORS 169.320(1) (providing generally, that a sheriff \u201chas custody and control of all persons legally committed or confined in the county local correctional facility of the county of the sheriff during the period of the commitment or confinement\u201d). Relying on ORS 204.635(3), which provides that \u201c[a] deputy has the power to perform any act or duty that the principal has,\u201d plaintiff posited that he \u201chad the same duties as the Sheriff himself to procure the arrest and punishment of [the deputy]; and to secure the custody of Lake County\u2019s prisoners and control of its jail.\u201d In sum, plaintiff noted that, if an important public duty did not exist under those circumstances, \u201ca law enforcement officer c[ould] be fired without recourse for assisting in the investigation and prosecution of a criminal, if that criminal\u2019s employment or conduct might embarrass the sheriff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The trial court, without amplification, granted defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the wrongful discharge claim. Given its dismissal of both of plaintiff\u2019s claims, the court then entered judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">On appeal, plaintiff assigns error both to the trial court\u2019s allowance of summary judgment against his blacklisting claim and to the allowance of judgment on the pleadings against his wrongful discharge claim. Conversely, defendant cross-assigns error to the court\u2019s denial of summary judgment as to plaintiff\u2019s wrongful discharge claim. The parties essentially reiterate the contentions that they raised before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">As amplified below, we conclude that claim preclusion did not bar either of plaintiff\u2019s claims \u2014 and, thus, the trial court erred in allowing summary judgment as to the blacklisting claim but properly denied it as to the wrongful discharge claim. We further conclude that, because plaintiff alleged circumstances sufficient to establish that he was terminated for fulfilling an important public duty, the trial court erred in allowing judgment on the pleadings as to the wrongful discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Because they both pertain to the proper application of claim preclusion principles, we turn first to plaintiff\u2019s assignment of error and defendant\u2019s cross-assignment of error concerning the trial court\u2019s summary judgment rulings. Before addressing the parties\u2019 specific contentions, however, we begin by determining whether state or federal law governs the resolution of that legal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u201cThe general rule is that the preclusive effect to be given to a judgment is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the judgment was rendered.\u201d <em>Aguirre v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>201 Or App 31, 46, 117 P3d 1012 (2005). Thus, \u201cstate courts generally are bound by federal law in determining the preclusive effect of federal court judgments.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Nevertheless, as we notedinAgM\u00bfrre,\u201c[a]s apractical matter, * * * preclusion principles \u2018as expounded in state and federal courts\u2019 often reflect few or no differences, so that it is \u2018usually a moot question whether the effect of a federal judgment is determined by federal law or state law.\u2019\u201d 201 Or App at 46 (quoting <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 87 comment a). That appears to be the case here. Consequently, \u201cin an exercise of caution,\u201d we cite both Oregon and federal authorities in our discussion of claim preclusion principles.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 46 n 17; <em>see also Ram I, </em>215 Or App at 456-57 (applying that approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Here, we begin with plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim. Plaintiff contends that claim preclusion principles did not bar the prosecution of that claim because it concerned a different factual transaction from the defamation claim adjudicated in federal court. Plaintiff explains that, unlike the defamation claim \u2014 which concerned a statement \u201cmade <em>before </em>[his] termination and for the purpose of justifying that termination\u201d (boldface omitted; emphasis added) \u2014 his blacklisting claim concerned statements and conduct that occurred <em>after </em>his termination. As amplified below, we agree with plaintiff.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u201cAs a rule, * * * a subsequent claim is barred by a prior judgment if the earlier litigation proceeded to final judgment, involved the same parties, and concerned a claim arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions.\u201d <em>Aguirre, </em>201 Or App at 47 (citing <em>Headwaters, Inc. v. U. S. Forest Service, </em>399 F3d 1047, 1051-57 (9th Cir 2005); <em>Drews v. EBI Companies, </em>310 Or 134, 140-41, 795 P2d 531 (1990)). As we explained in <em>Aguirre,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u201c[u]nder that expansive \u2018transactional approach,\u2019 which is endorsed by federal and Oregon precedents alike, claim preclusion bars not only claims that have actually been litigated, but any claim arising out of the same transaction or series of connected transactions. <em>See Costantini v. Trans World Airlines, </em>681 F2d 1199, 1201-02 (9th Cir), <em>cert den, </em>459 US 1087 (1982) (claim preclusion applies to claims arising from the \u2018same transactional nucleus of facts\u2019); <em>Drews[, </em>310 Or at 140-42] (tracing development of claim preclusion principle and affirming Oregon\u2019s endorsement of transactional approach).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">201 Or App at 47 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In determining whether a set of facts constitutes a single transaction, we and the Ninth Circuit rely on the approach expressed in section 24(2) of the <em>Restatement, </em>which \u201cgiv[es] weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation [and] whether they form a convenient trial unit[.]\u201d <em>See Western Systems, Inc. v. Ulloa, </em>958 F2d 864, 871 (9th Cir 1992), <em>cert den, </em>506 US 1050 (1993) (applying that approach); <em>Handam v. Wilsonville Holiday Partners, LLC, </em>221 Or App 493, 498, 190 P3d 480 (2008) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Applying those principles to the circumstances here, we conclude that plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim did not arise out of the same transaction as did his defamation claim in federal court. In general terms, the factual transaction at issue in the federal action involved the circumstances surrounding plaintiff\u2019s termination. In that context, the defamation claim concerned a single false <em>statement </em>\u2014 viz., that plaintiff had cheated on his LEDS exam and encouraged another employee to do so as well \u2014 made by one of defendant\u2019s employees to create, as plaintiff theorized, a pretextual justification for plaintiff\u2019s subsequent termination. Further, although plaintiff alleged that defendant defamed him to interfere with his ability to obtain employment, plaintiff sought damages only for emotional distress and the harm caused to his reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">As did plaintiff\u2019s defamation claim, the subject matter of plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim concerns communications about plaintiff\u2019s dishonesty and unfitness. Nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim concerns a different factual transaction. That is so for at least two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">First, plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim involved communications that occurred over a substantial period of time after his termination that are distinct from the single communication that was the subject of his defamation claim and that the federal court concluded was privileged. Thus, the facts concerning the circumstances surrounding those later communications, including when and between whom they were made, will be different from those adjudicated as part of plaintiff\u2019s defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Second, the gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s federal action was that his termination was wrongful. In that context, plaintiff\u2019s defamation claim \u2014 which was predicated on defendant\u2019s allegedly false statement that plaintiff had cheated on his LEDS examination \u2014 functioned as a vehicle for plaintiff to establish that defendant\u2019s purported reason for terminating him was pretextual. By contrast, his blacklisting claim alleges that defendant\u2019s subsequent communications were motivated by a different <em>purpose </em>\u2014 viz., to \u201cdisqualify plaintiff from certification as a police officer or corrections officer in the State of Oregon\u201d and to \u201cprevent[] plaintiff from securing employment as a police officer or corrections officer in the State of Oregon.\u201d The factual bases underlying those distinct motivations will themselves be distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Under such circumstances, we conclude that plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim was not part of the same factual transaction that had been litigated in federal court. Accordingly, the trial court erred in allowing summary judgment as to plaintiff\u2019s blacklisting claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Before turning to plaintiff\u2019s remaining assignment of error, we address defendant\u2019s cross-assignment of error, which concerns the propriety of the court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment, on preclusion grounds, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>to plaintiff\u2019s wrongful discharge claim. Initially, plaintiff contends that that cross-assignment of error is unreviewable. Plaintiff, however, is incorrect in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">In <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. v. Speerstra, </em>63 Or App 533, 535, 666 P2d 255, <em>rev den, </em>295 Or 773 (1983), the defendants moved for summary judgment against the plaintiffs\u2019 claim on statute of limitations grounds. The trial court denied that motion. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the plaintiffs twice amended their pleadings, and each time the defendants moved to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 535-36. The court granted the defendants\u2019 motions. The plaintiffs appealed, assigning error to the allowance of the motions to dismiss, and the defendants cross-assigned error to the trial court\u2019s denial of their summary judgment motion concerning the plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint. As to the reviewability of the defendants\u2019 cross-assignment of error, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\u201cThe denial of a motion for summary judgment is not an appealable order. Under some circumstances, however, a denial may be reviewable. Final judgment was eventually entered in defendants\u2019 favor here, and they therefore had no reason or means to assert the denial of their summary judgment motion as error. A trial was never held, and so a motion for a directed verdict on the grounds now urged by defendants was precluded. Thus, because of the peculiar procedural posture of this case, we will review this alleged error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\"><em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins., </em>63 Or App at 536 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">This case is in the same procedural posture as <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. </em>Thus, under the reasoning in that case, defendant\u2019s cross-assignment of error is reviewable. <em>See also Stilwell v. Seibel, </em>169 Or App 613, 10 P3d 319 (2000) (reviewing cross-assignment of error concerning the denial of summary judgment where the case was in the same procedural posture as <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.). </em>Accordingly, we proceed to address the merits of that cross-assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in concluding that plaintiff\u2019s wrongful termination claim was not barred by claim preclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u201cThe state and federal employment claims that plaintiff brought in federal court arose from the same transaction as his wrongful termination claim \u2014 the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s termination of plaintiff\u2019s employment. The wrongful termination claim is simply an alternative theory for why he was fired, and the <em>Restatement </em>rule on claim preclusion, which has been adopted in Oregon, provides that the doctrine covers this situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\">\u201cMoreover, plaintiff knew of all the relevant facts concerning this claim before he filed the federal action. Any facts of which he was not aware are of questionable relevancy and were easily discoverable. Plaintiff\u2019s own failure to investigate his claim should not be a sufficient reason to allow him to bring a second lawsuit regarding the same employment decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Further, defendant contends that the exception to preclusion that the Supreme Court referred to in <em>Ram II </em>does not apply under the circumstances of this case. As previously noted, 253 Or App at 47-50, when the parties litigated defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion in the trial court, they \u2014 as did the trial court \u2014 relied on our then-recent decision in <em>Ram I. </em>Thereafter, however, in <em>Ram II, </em>the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Ram I. </em>346 Or 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In <em>Ram II, </em>the Supreme Court held that <em>Restatement </em>section 25 comment e applies in determining whether a federal judgment precludes claims raised in a subsequent state court action. 346 Or at 226. Specifically, that comment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">\u201cA given claim may find support in theories or grounds arising from both state and federal law. When the plaintiff brings an action on the claim in a court, either state or federal, in which there is no jurisdictional obstacle to his advancing both theories or grounds, but he presents only one of them, and judgment is entered with respect to it, he may not maintain a second action in which he tenders the other theory or ground. <em>If, however, the court in the first action would clearly not have had jurisdiction to entertain the omitted theory or ground (or, having jurisdiction, would clearly have declined to exercise it as a matter of discretion), then a second action in a competent court presenting the omitted theory or ground should be held not precluded.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>(Emphasis added.) The Supreme Court explained that that provision of the <em>Restatement </em>recognized that, \u201cas a general rule, claim preclusion will bar a plaintiff who litigates a federal claim in federal court from relitigating state claims that the plaintiff could have but did not litigate in the federal action.\u201d <em>Ram II, </em>346 Or at 220. However, as the Supreme Court noted, the <em>Restatement </em>also recognizes an exception to that general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The Supreme Court concluded that we had erred in <em>Ram I </em>in concluding that the congressional expansion of a federal court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction had effectively superseded the exception identified in the <em>Restatement </em>and required a plaintiff to assert all transactionally related claims in the federal forum. <em>Ram II, </em>346 Or at 220-21, 226. The court explained that, \u201c [t] o be sure, the rule that the Court of Appeals adopted * * * avoids having state courts decide, in retrospect, how a federal court would have exercised its discretion if a plaintiff had sought to litigate his or her state claims under the doctrine of supplemental jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227. However, the Supreme Court posited that \u201cstate courts are fully capable of making that determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In sum, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">\u201c[T]he exception to claim preclusion applies only when a federal court, having jurisdiction, clearly would have declined to exercise it. If it is not clear that the federal court, having jurisdiction, would have declined to exercise it, then claim preclusion will bar any state law claim that a plaintiff could have but did not raise initially in federal court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ram II, </em>defendant now contends that plaintiff did not establish that the federal court clearly would have declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his wrongful discharge claim. Instead, defendant asserts that \u201c[h]ad plaintiff filed a timely motion to amend, the [federal] court undoubtedly would have granted it given the legal standard that governs such motions, and it would have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s [wrongful discharge] claim.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>For that reason, defendant posits that the exception to preclusion is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">For purposes of our analysis, we assume without deciding that (as defendant posits) plaintiff\u2019s wrongful discharge claim arose from the same factual transaction that was adjudicated in his federal action. We indulge in that assumption because, in all events and for the reasons that we explain, the exception to preclusion applies as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Here, plaintiff\u2019s motion to extend the discovery deadline in federal court and his colloquy with the federal court during the ensuing hearing alerted the court that plaintiff was seeking additional time for discovery so as to verify the facts necessary to amend his complaint to add the common-law wrongful discharge claim at issue in this appeal. <em>See </em>253 Or App at 43-44 (setting out colloquy). Thus, plaintiff essentially sought to amend his federal complaint to add a claim for common-law wrongful discharge, and the court refused to allow him to do so. The federal court\u2019s intent in that regard is patent from its statements that plaintiff could \u201cfile another lawsuit if [he] want[ed] to\u201d and its directive, \u201c[W]e\u2019ll try this case on the pleadings that have been filed ***.\u201d Under those circumstances, the federal court, having jurisdiction, \u201cclearly\u201d declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s wrongful discharge claim. Accordingly, the exception to preclusion identified in <em>Ram II </em>applies, and the trial court properly denied summary judgment, on preclusion grounds, as to plaintiff\u2019s wrongful discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Having determined that plaintiff\u2019s wrongful discharge claim was not subject to dismissal on claim preclusion grounds, we turn finally to plaintiff\u2019s remaining assignment of error in which he contends that the trial court erred in allowing judgment on the pleadings against that claim on the ground that he had failed to allege that his termination contravened an \u201cimportant public duty.\u201d On appeal, as before the trial court, plaintiff contends that, among other things, enforcing the criminal laws \u2014 which encompasses the prevention and detection of crime \u2014 is an important public duty, and that, just as the sheriff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>was obligated to fulfill that duty, so too was he (plaintiff) required to undertake and promote the enforcement of the criminal laws, including with respect to conduct involving jail inmates.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiff further contends that, because his termination contravened that duty, his termination was wrongful. Whether plaintiff identified an important public duty is a question of law. <em>Huber v. Dept. of Education, </em>235 Or App 230, 242, 230 P3d 937 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">In determining whether an important public duty exists, we recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">\u201c\u2018This court cannot create a public duty but must find one in constitutional or statutory provisions or case law.\u2019 <em>Eusterman v. Northwest Permanente, P.C., </em>204 Or App 224, 229-30, 129 P3d 213, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 579 (2006). \u2018To establish a duty, statutes cannot merely express a general public policy; rather, they must encourage specific acts or \u201cotherwise demonstrate] that such acts enjoy high social value.\u201d\u2019Id. at 230 <em>(quoting Babick [v. Oregon Arena Corp.], </em>333 Or [401,] 409[, 40 P3d 1059 (2002)]; brackets in original).

Further, we indicated that in <em>Lamson </em>\u2014 the case on which defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings had been predicated \u2014 the Supreme Court had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">\u201cexplained that, for purposes of a common-law wrongful discharge claim, an important public duty could theoretically arise \u2018in the absence of a specific legal obligation to perform the act or acts that trigger the discharge, [but] the sources of law that express the asserted \u201cpublic policy\u201d must in <em>some </em>sense speak directly to those acts.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>Huber, </em>235 Or App at 243 (quoting <em>Lamson, </em>346 Or at 637-38) (brackets in <em>Huber; </em>emphasis in <em>Lamson).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">We begin by noting that plaintiff\u2019s duties derive from the sheriff\u2019s. <em>See </em>ORS 204.635(3) (providing, in part, that \u201c[a] deputy has the power to perform any act or duty that the principal has\u201d).

In general, a sheriff also \u201chas custody and control of all persons legally committed or confined in the county local correctional facility of the county of the sheriff during the period of the commitment or confinement.\u201d ORS 169.320(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">A sheriff must be certified as a \u201cpolice officer\u201d by the Department of Public Safety Standards and Training.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The term \u201cpolice officer\u201d is defined for those purposes in ORS 181.610(15), which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u201c\u2018Police officer\u2019means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">\u201c(a) An officer, member or employee of a law enforcement[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] unit employed full-time as a peace officer who is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u201c(A) Commissioned by a * * * county * * *; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">\u201c(B) Responsible for enforcing the criminal laws of this state ***[\u2022]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><em>See also State v.

Thus, to the extent that plaintiff alleged that he was terminated for seeking to enforce the criminal laws by preventing, detecting, and investigating crime, he has adequately alleged that his termination contravened an important public duty. <em>See Lamson, </em>346 Or at 638 (holding, in part, that the \u201csources of law that express the asserted \u2018public policy\u2019 must in <em>some </em>sense speak directly to\u201d the acts that trigger the discharge (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Here, accepting the truth of plaintiff\u2019s allegations,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> during plaintiff\u2019s employment, he sought to provide training <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>to all deputies so as to prevent inappropriate contact with female inmates, but the sheriff rejected that request. Moreover, when he learned that a deputy under his supervision had allegedly exchanged contraband for oral sex with a female inmate, he investigated that alleged criminal conduct.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Ultimately, plaintiff concluded that that incident involving the inmate occurred and was attributable to inadequate training and supervision and shared those conclusions, in the presence of the sheriff, with defendant\u2019s insurance representative. Because plaintiff alleged that he was terminated for that conduct, he has adequately pleaded that his termination was in contravention of an important public policy.

Accordingly, we do not address it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\"> As previously noted, 253 Or App at 46-47, plaintiff specifically alleged that he had been terminated for fulfilling important public duties</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">\u201cto notify defendant of reports and observations of inappropriate flirtatious conduct by [the deputy] toward female prisoners; to seek to provide additional training and supervision for corrections officers; to promptly and objectively investigate reports of criminal conduct toward a prisoner by a corrections officer; and to cooperate fully and candidly in investigations of such reports by outside agencies.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b81-9\"> <em>See </em>ORS 206.015(l)(c) (providing that a \u201cperson is not eligible to be a candidate for election or appointment to the office of sheriff\u201d unless, among other things, \u201c[t]he person has not been convicted of a felony or of any other crime that would prevent the person from being certified as a police officer under ORS 181.610 to 181.712\u201d); ORS 206.015(3) (\u201cIf the person is not certified as a police officer by the Department of Public Safety Standards and Training at the time of accepting appointment or filing as a candidate, a person elected or appointed to the office of sheriff must obtain the certification not later than one year after taking office. A copy of the certification shall be filed with the county clerk or the county official in charge of elections. The county governing body shall declare the office of sheriff vacant when the person serving as sheriff is not certified as a police officer within one year after taking office.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b81-10\"> Relatedly, the term \u201claw enforcement unit\u201d is defined in ORS 181.610(12). That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">\u201c\u2018Law enforcement unit\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">\u201c(a) A police force or organization of * * * a * * * county *:i: :i: the primary duty of which, as prescribed by law, ordinance or directive, is one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u201c(A) Detecting crime and enforcing the criminal laws of this state or laws or ordinances relating to airport security;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">\u201c(B) The custody, control or supervision of individuals convicted of or arrested for a criminal offense and confined to a place of incarceration or detention other than a place used exclusively for incarceration or detention of juveniles!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b82-10\"> We note that this case is readily distinguishable from <em>Babick, </em>333 Or 401, a case in which the Supreme Court held that private security personnel had not stated claims for common-law wrongful discharge. In that case, the court concluded that statutes evincing a public policy against crime and in favor of safe communities did not impose or suggest that private security personnel have a public duty to take law enforcement actions against those who break the law. <em>Id. </em>at 409-10. Specifically, the court noted that the statutes did not \u201cimpose an affirmative duty on private security personnel to arrest lawbreakers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410. Here, by contrast, the pertinent statutes impose on sheriffs, as well as their deputies, an obligation to, among other things, investigate crime and enforce the criminal laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b82-11\"> <em>See Boyer v.
