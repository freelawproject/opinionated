Claimant contends that the board erred in finding that an expert opinion admitted into evidence for purposes of rebuttal did not address any condition at issue and therefore would not be considered in determining whether claimant\u2019s work activities were the major contributing cause of his claimed conditions. Specifically, claimant asserts that, although the expert addressed claimant\u2019s alleged lumbar radiculopathy and its cause, the board unreasonably found otherwise and thereby erred in misinterpreting the expert\u2019s opinion and disregarding it as rebuttal evidence. We review the board\u2019s order for substantial evidence and errors of law, and to determine whether its analysis comports with substantial reason. ORS 656.298(7); ORS 183.482(8); <em>SAIF v. Martinez, </em>219 Or App 182, 184, 182 P3d 873 (2008). For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the board erred in disregarding claimant\u2019s rebuttal evidence and, accordingly, reverse and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Employer is in the business of metal fabrication, and claimant began working at its plant on September 25, 2000. Before working for employer, claimant had been employed briefly as a cannery supervisor and for 10 years as a punch-press operator with some limited, light grinding duties. Claimant began work in employer\u2019s \u201clarge parts\u201d division as a belt grinder \u2014 grinding large pieces of metal by hand and with the aid of machinery. After three years, he transitioned to a position working with titanium, performing similar work on both large and small parts. Claimant\u2019s work activity throughout the course of his employment involved continuous exposure to vibrations, repeated bending and stooping, relatively heavy lifting, and use of substantial physical force to control the grinders, metal parts, and hoists used to lift them. Claimant often worked between 10 and 12 hours per day and testified, simply, that it was \u201c[hjeavy work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Approximately three years after beginning work for employer, claimant began to experience pain in his arms and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>legs, and then eventually in his neck, shoulders, and lower back. Assuming that it would subside naturally, claimant did not seek treatment for approximately two years; however, in December 2005, he reported his symptoms to Dr. Harvey. After a follow-up visit on January 5,2006, Harvey diagnosed claimant with cervical radiculopathy, released him from work due to his medical condition, and noted that, in addition to pain, claimant was experiencing numbness radiating into his right arm. A subsequent MRI of claimant\u2019s cervical spine revealed a posterior disc protrusion at C4-5, mild cervical spondylosis, and bony narrowing of the right C5-6 nerve root canal. Claimant continued to obtain treatment from Harvey through April 2006, participating in physical therapy, taking multiple medications, and receiving a series of epidural steroid injections that, for the most part, failed to alleviate his symptoms. During the same period of time, claimant additionally complained of weakness in his thighs, pain in his right leg, and pain in both hips. Harvey opined that claimant\u2019s condition \u201cseem[ed] to be work related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">After filing an initial workers\u2019 compensation claim under an industrial injury theory for the herniated disc at C4-5,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claimant was referred by employer to Dr. Rabie at an occupational health clinic. Rabie initially addressed claimant\u2019s herniated disc and related injury claim, diagnosing cervical radiculopathy due to the herniated disc at C4-5. Thereafter, Rabie continued to treat claimant, diagnosed lumbar radiculopathy in addition to cervical radiculopathy, and referred him to an outpatient neurosurgery consultation with physician\u2019s assistant Musacchio. On May 18, 2006, Musacchio identified claimant\u2019s condition as \u201c [c] ervical lumbar radiculopathy\u201d and recommended cervical and lumbar MRIs as well as consultation with a neurosurgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In the course of evaluating claimant\u2019s industrial injury claim, employer wrote to Rabie requesting information pertaining to compensability. Rabie recommended an independent medical examination (IME), and, on May 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>2006, claimant reported to Dr. Graham for an IME. At that time, claimant reported neck pain, bilateral shoulder tightness, lower back pain, and intermittent numbness both in his right arm and running down his right leg into his heel. While he did not have the benefit of cervical and lumbar MRI scans taken a week later pursuant to Musacchio\u2019s recommendation, Graham opined that there were \u201cno objective findings consistent with a radiculopathy\u201d and attributed claimant\u2019s symptoms to preexisting degenerative disc disease. Addressing the industrial injury claim, he ultimately opined that claimant\u2019s symptoms were not caused by \u201ca work injury in December of 2005.\u201d Five days later, on May 29, 2006, Rabie concurred with Graham\u2019s \u201cdiagnoses, physical findings and conclusions\u201d by checking a box on a form letter provided by employer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The MRIs of claimant\u2019s cervical and lumbar spine recommended by Musacchio were conducted on May 31, 2006. The images of claimant\u2019s lumbar spine revealed \u201c[mjultilevel degenerative disc disease at contiguous disc levels from L3 to SI\u201d and \u201cdisc bulging and a posterior right paracentral disc protrusion that results in severe (50%) central canal stenosis with focal narrowing of the right lateral recess and potential compression of the right I nerve root\u201d at L4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Claimant subsequently met with a neurosurgeon, Dr. Zelaya, pursuant to Musacchio\u2019s recommendation. On June 30, 2006, Zelaya advised against surgical intervention and opined as follows regarding claimant\u2019s lumbar spine: \u201cIn the lumbar area, * * * [claimant] has pretty significant degenerative changes at L5-S1 where the disk is collapsed, and at L4-5 there is a bony spur centrally, but it does not seem to be putting pressure * * * on the nerves.\u201d Claimant then met with Dr. Ono for a second opinion on August 31, 2006. Ono opined that claimant \u201cprobably has fibromyalgia rather than radiculopathy\u201d and ordered x-rays which showed significant degenerative changes in claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>lumbar spine. Notwithstanding the x-rays, Ono adhered to his probable diagnosis of fibromyalgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Claimant continued treatment with Rabie, who adhered to his diagnoses of cervical radiculopathy and lumbar radiculopathy, opining that an underlying cause was degenerative disc disease. On January 11, 2007, Rabie spoke with employer and opined \u2014 as reflected in a chart note documenting the telephone conversation \u2014 that degenerative disc disease in the cervical and lumbar spine is an \u201cintrinsic condition not caused by or pathologically accelerated by work activity.\u201d He further opined that claimant\u2019s condition was in part caused by work activity, stating, regarding claimant\u2019s occupational disease claims, that \u201cthis IS a combined condition in which work combined with [degenerative disc disease] to cause [the] current condition ***.\u201d (Uppercase in original.) He stated that the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s combined condition was \u201cprogressive ongoing [degenerative disc disease] in both segments of [the] spine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">On February 13, 2007, employer denied compensability of claimant\u2019s occupational disease claims for cervical radiculopathy and lumbar radiculopathy. Claimant requested a hearing, which commenced on May 16, 2007. At the hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) admitted an employer-prepared summary of Rabie\u2019s findings and opinions. Rabie had signed the summary the day before the hearing, reaffirming his diagnoses of cervical radiculopathy and lumbar radiculopathy and his opinion that those conditions were caused by a combination of degenerative disc disease and claimant\u2019s work activities. In addition, Rabie opined that claimant\u2019s degenerative disc disease \u201chas resulted in disc bulges, which in turn <em>compress his nerve roots causing pain (radiculopathy)\u201d </em>(emphasis added) and that the underlying degenerative disc disease resulted \u201cfrom a combination of [claimant\u2019s] particular genetic make up, smoking habit, and age[.]\u201d He further opined that claimant\u2019s degenerative disc disease had \u201cnot been caused by or pathologically worsened by his work activities\u201d and rejected Ono\u2019s tentative diagnosis of fibromyalgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Claimant, bearing the burden of proof in an occupational disease claim, ORS 656.266, sought a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>continuance in order to rebut Rabie\u2019s opinion with a report from Dr. Gritzka, with whom he had an evaluation scheduled in early July. After denying claimant\u2019s request for a continuance, the AL J granted claimant\u2019s request to admit Gritzka\u2019s report after the hearing for the sole purpose of rebutting Rabie\u2019s opinion. <em>See </em>OAR 438-007-0023 (party bearing the burden of proof on an issue is entitled to the \u201clast presentation of evidence and argument on the issue\u201d). In so doing, the ALJ limited claimant\u2019s presentation of Gritzka\u2019s opinion to \u201cactual rebuttal\u201d \u2014 specifically limiting consideration of the report \u201cto the issues of cervical and lumbar radiculopathy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Gritzka evaluated claimant on July 5, 2007, with claimant continuing to report substantial neck and back pain along with pain and numbness radiating into his arms and right leg. Gritzka performed a physical examination and reviewed claimant\u2019s medical records, most notably the MRI of claimant\u2019s lumbar spine conducted on May 31, 2006. Regarding that MRI, Gritzka stated, \u201cThis study was interpreted by the radiologist to show potential <em>compression of the L5 nerve </em>root; I agree with that interpretation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Ultimately, Gritzka provided the following diagnosis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">\u201c1. Mild cervical degenerative spondylosis with C4-5 intervertebral disk protrusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">\u201c2. Lumbar degenerative spondylosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">\u201ca. Moderate to moderately severe intervertebral disk degeneration and disk space collapse [at] L5-S1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">\u201cb. Intervertebral disk herniation [at] L4-5 lateralized primarily to the right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">\u201cBased on the evaluation today, [claimant] does not have a cervical radiculopathy. He does have pain in his right lower extremity that is most probably related to the intervertebral disk herniation at L4-5 lateralized to the right and compressing the <em>right L5 nerve root condition\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">(Emphasis added.) Gritzka thus disagreed with Rabie as to the existence of cervical radiculopathy but diagnosed, using terminology nearly identical to Rabie\u2019s as discussed further below, lumbar radiculopathy related to degenerative disc disease. Gritzka further opined, rebutting Rabie\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>opinion as to causation, that \u201cit is conclusory to attribute [claimant\u2019s] cervical and lumbar complaints * * * [to] aging and \u2018genetic factors.\u2019\u201d Rather, Gritzka offered an opinion as to causation similar to Harvey\u2019s, albeit explained in more detail, concluding, \u201cIn my opinion, more probably than not, the major contributing cause of [claimant\u2019s] cervical condition and lumbar condition [is] his work activities operating a grinder for [employer].\u201d He opined that claimant\u2019s work activities did in fact \u201ccontribute [ ] to a pathological worsening of\u201d degenerative disc disease (\u201c [t] o the extent that [claimant] had \u2018preexisting degenerative disk disease in his cervical and/or lumbar spine\u2019\u201d) and, addressing claimant\u2019s lumbar condition specifically, opined that \u201cthe major contributing cause of [claimant\u2019s] lumbar condition and need for treatment [is] his work activities over time at [employer\u2019s plant].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The ALJ admitted Gritzka\u2019s report into evidence; however, he determined that Gritzka \u201cdid not diagnose lumbar radiculopathy or address the cause of such a condition\u201d and concluded that \u201cGritzka\u2019s opinions regarding the cause of claimant\u2019s lumbar or cervical conditions were not directed at his radiculopathies * * *. Therefore, they will not be addressed.\u201d Ultimately, in an opinion and order issued on July 16, 2008, the ALJ found that there was \u201cno persuasive expert medical evidence supporting claimant\u2019s contention that his work activities were the major contributing cause of his cervical and lumbar radiculopathies [,]\u201d and approved employer\u2019s denials of both occupational disease claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>The board adopted and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order, further stating, regarding the ALJ\u2019s treatment of Gritzka\u2019s report, \u201cBased on the ALJ\u2019s express language that the rebuttal report was limited to addressing claimant\u2019s cervical and lumbar radiculopathies, we conclude that it was within the ALJ\u2019s discretion[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] to exclude evidence that did not fall within the limited purpose for which the record remained open.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Beyond discussion of procedural matters not at issue on review, the board did not provide any additional explanation regarding its decision not to consider Gritzka\u2019s opinion or its determination that Gritzka\u2019s opinion did not address claimant\u2019s alleged cervical or lumbar radiculopathies.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">On review, claimant argues first that Gritzka in fact diagnosed lumbar radiculopathy given his \u201cfinding of nerve root compression in the lumbar spine.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Claimant further challenges the board\u2019s adoption of the ALJ\u2019s determination that Gritzka \u201coffered no opinions regarding the cause of claimant\u2019s alleged lumbar radiculopathy [,]\u201d contending that Gritzka addressed, diagnosed, and provided an opinion as to causation of that condition. Accordingly, claimant argues, the board erred in adopting the ALJ\u2019s finding that Gritzka\u2019s report did not address any condition to which rebuttal evidence was limited, <em>i.e., </em>cervical or lumbar radiculopathy, and thus erred in failing to consider Gritzka\u2019s opinion as rebuttal to Rabie\u2019s opinion when determining whether the record, \u201cviewed as a whole,\u201d ORS 183.482(8)(c), demonstrated that claimant\u2019s work activities were the major contributing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>cause of his claimed conditions. Employer responds that Gritzka made only one \u201cisolated comment\u201d regarding a compressed nerve in claimant\u2019s lumbar spine<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and argues that he \u201cdid not directly address the issue of whether there was a work-related cause for [claimant\u2019s] cervical or lumbar radiculopathy.\u201d Beyond disputing claimant\u2019s assertions regarding the substance of Gritzka\u2019s opinion, employer contends that the board\u2019s treatment of Gritzka\u2019s opinion is governed on review by an abuse of discretion standard and that any error in disregarding the opinion was harmless and should be treated as such. We agree with claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">We first clarify the applicable standard of review. Employer evaluates the board\u2019s treatment of Gritzka\u2019s opinion under an abuse of discretion standard, likening it \u2014 consistent with the board\u2019s order \u2014 to adoption of an evidentiary ruling made by the ALJ. However, Gritzka\u2019s opinion was in fact admitted into evidence. This was not a situation in which the ALJ could have exercised discretion to reject certain aspects of Gritzka\u2019s report. The proper question on review is whether the board\u2019s interpretation of Gritzka\u2019s report was a reasonable one. <em>See SAIF v. Pepperling, </em>237 Or App 79, 84-85, 238 P3d 1013 (2010) (\u201cIn reviewing the board\u2019s evaluation of [an expert\u2019s] opinion, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the board; rather, we determine whether the board\u2019s evaluation of that evidence was <em>reasonable.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added.)); <em>see also Asten-Hill Co. v. Armstrong, </em>100 Or App 559, 562-63, 787 P2d 890 (1990) (concluding that the board \u201cunreasonably\u201d \u201cmisread\u201d and \u201csubstantially misstated\u201d an expert\u2019s statements, and further identifying \u201c[t]he only reasonable reading\u201d of that expert\u2019s opinion); <em>SAIF v. Paxton, </em>154 Or App 259, 263-65, 959 P2d 634 (1998) (the board\u2019s finding was not supported by substantial evidence where it unreasonably misinterpreted an expert\u2019s opinion regarding the cause of the claimant\u2019s hearing loss); <em>Kenimer v. SAIF, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>183 Or App 131, 138, 51 P3d 632 (2002) (finding \u201conly one reasonable interpretation of the basis for [an expert\u2019s] opinion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">We address claimant\u2019s assignments of error together, as the resolution of claimant\u2019s first assignment of error \u2014 that the board erroneously adopted the ALJ\u2019s finding that Gritzka did not diagnose claimant with \u201ca lumbar radiculopathy\u201d \u2014 is simply one means of resolving whether the board ultimately erred in determining that Gritzka did not address any condition within the scope of rebuttal permitted by the ALJ (namely, Rabie\u2019s diagnoses of cervical and lumbar radiculopathies). \u201cRadiculopathy\u201d is defined as a \u201c[d]isorder of the spinal nerve roots.\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>1503 (27th ed 2000). As claimant correctly points out, Rabie\u2019s diagnosis of radiculopathy \u2014 that is, \u201cdisc bulges, which in turn compress [claimant\u2019s] nerve roots causing pain (radiculopathy)\u201d \u2014 was addressed directly and unambiguously by Gritzka\u2019s report. In evaluating claimant\u2019s lumbar MRI and an accompanying radiologist\u2019s report, and in formulating his diagnosis, Gritzka addressed \u201cpotential compression of the L5 nerve root\u201d and a \u201cright L5 nerve root condition [,]\u201d respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The record thus reflects that, with regard to claimant\u2019s lumbar condition, Gritzka\u2019s opinion contained prominent language nearly identical to that used by Rabie in referring to radiculopathy. Both physicians referred to pain caused by compression of claimant\u2019s spinal nerve roots; Rabie simply included the term \u201cradiculopathy\u201d in parentheses afterward. That one-word parenthetical ultimately constitutes the only discernible difference (excluding theories of causation) between the two experts\u2019 language pertaining to claimant\u2019s lumbar radiculopathy. There is therefore only one reasonable interpretation of Gritzka\u2019s opinion: that it addresses claimant\u2019s alleged lumbar radiculopathy. <em>See Kenimer, </em>183 Or App at 138 (finding \u201conly one reasonable interpretation\u201d of an expert\u2019s opinion); <em>cf. Freightliner Corp. v. Arnold, </em>142 Or App 98, 105, 919 P2d 1192 (1996) (concluding, in the context of causation, that an expert\u2019s \u201ctestimony as a whole reasonably may be read as [reaching the relevant conclusion]\u201d and \u201cneed not be ignored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><em>merely because it fails to include \u2018magic words\u2019 </em>such as \u2018major contributing cause\u2019\u201d (emphasis added)). Gritzka\u2019s report thus fell \u201cwithin the limited purpose for which the record remained open,\u201d and the board\u2019s unexplained determination to the contrary was not reasonable. Consequently, the board erred in disregarding Gritzka\u2019s opinion as medical evidence rebutting Rabie\u2019s conclusions as to the cause of claimant\u2019s alleged lumbar radiculopathy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">In sum, Gritzka\u2019s opinion, at minimum, addressed claimant\u2019s alleged lumbar radiculopathy and its cause. The board\u2019s determination to the contrary was not reasonable. Accordingly, because we conclude that the board unreasonably misinterpreted Gritzka\u2019s opinion and therefore erred in failing to consider it as rebuttal evidence, we reverse and remand for reconsideration. <em>See, e.g., Asten-Hill, </em>100 Or App at 562-63 (reversing and remanding for reconsideration where the board \u201cmisread [an expert\u2019s] testimony unreasonably\u201d); <em>Skochenko v. Weyerhaeuser Co., </em>118 Or App 241, 245, 846 P2d 1212 (1993) (citing <em>Asten-Hill, </em>100 Or App 559) (\u201c[W]e cannot say that the Board\u2019s misinterpretation of some of the medical evidence did not influence its ultimate conclusion * * *. Accordingly, we must reverse and remand for reconsideration.\u201d); <em>SAIF v. Bryant, </em>173 Or App 402, 407-08,21 P3d 1104 (2001) (reaffirming the principle that we reverse and remand for reconsideration when \u201cthe Board\u2019s misinterpretation of some of the medical evidence may have influenced its ultimate conclusion\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Kenimer, </em>183 Or App at 139 (similar).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\"> That injury claim was denied on June 2, 2006, and is not at issue here. This judicial review relates exclusively to claimant\u2019s subsequent occupational disease claims for cervical and lumbar radiculopathies, although, as evidenced below, claimant\u2019s assignments of error primarily give rise to analysis of his claim for lumbar radiculopathy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\"> As claimant notes, that concurrence is inconsistent with Rabie\u2019s diagnoses of lumbar radiculopathy and cervical radiculopathy \u2014 the same diagnoses, as set forth below, regarding which claimant introduced the rebuttal evidence at issue on review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b708-5\"> Gritzka also discussed \u201cvibrational occupational hand syndrome\u201d in support of his opinion as to causation. On that point, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\u201cThe intervertebral disk herniation at C4-5, more probably than not, is the result of vibration transmitted through [claimant\u2019s] upper extremities to his cervical spine. With regard to [claimant\u2019s] low back, he describes first, that his grinder sometimes would buck or jerk, shaking his whole body and also that he had to operate the grinder sometimes in a stooped over or ben[t] position. Flexion of the lumbar spine compresses the L4-5 and L5-S1 intervertebral disk spaces particularly. In a situation where one would work in a position of lumbar flexion and was subjected to whole[-]body vibration and an occasional jerking episode, biomechanically one would expect that forces would be concentrated at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels that would lead, over time, to (at least) worsening of degenerative changes and disk herniations at L4-5 and L5-S1.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b709-5\"> As noted, Gritzka\u2019s report was not \u201cexclude[d]\u201d by the ALJ, but rather was simply not considered \u2014 based on an understanding of its contents \u2014 in determining the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s conditions. Accordingly, the board erroneously addressed the ALJ\u2019s treatment of Gritzka\u2019s opinion as an evidentiary ruling subject to an abuse of discretion standard. We address the standard of review applicable to this case in detail below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> Claimant concedes that Gritzka did not diagnose cervical radiculopathy. However, he argues that, even with regard to cervical radiculopathy, the report falls within the scope of the rebuttal evidence permitted by the ALJ given that Gritzka addressed the cause of the degenerative changes underlying claimant\u2019s cervical condition. In other words, claimant argues that Gritzka provided an alternative explanation as to causation of the same degenerative process identified by Rabie as the cause of claimant\u2019s cervical radiculopathy. We need not decide that issue, as we conclude that, in any event, Gritzka directly addressed claimant\u2019s alleged lumbar radiculopathy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b710-5\"> Insofar as the number of Gritzka\u2019s references to spinal nerve root compression is significant, that is simply not the case. Gritzka addressed spinal nerve root compression in reviewing the May 31, 2006, MRI, in concurring with a radiologist\u2019s interpretation of that MRI, and in rendering his diagnosis. He also addressed the cause of the pain associated with radiculopathy, as well as the cause of claimant\u2019s disc degeneration and other factors underlying and contributing to the alleged lumbar radiculopathy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\"> The board\u2019s misinterpretation of Gritzka\u2019s opinion is compounded by the fact that radiculopathy is a generalized term that most commonly refers to pain or numbness and can encompass a variety of underlying conditions. In fact, this court has openly debated its status as a \u201ccondition,\u201d though that is ultimately a question of fact to be decided based on the medical evidence in individual cases. <em>See Young v. Hermiston Good Samaritan, </em>223 Or App 99, 101, 107, 194 P3d 857 (2008) (finding that \u201cradiculopathy,\u201d defined by the medical evidence as <em>\u201cpain that radiates along the course of a nerve root that exits from the spine,\u201d </em>was a \u201csymptom and not a condition\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also City of Eugene v. McCann, </em>248 Or App 527, 536, 273 P3d 348 (2012) (citing <em>Young </em>and its definition of radiculopathy in distinguishing \u201cdiseases from symptoms\u201d). Gritzka addressed the generalized definition of radiculopathy, did not neglect to address the pain and other symptoms associated with it as a condition, and in effect treated it much like this court (and, notably, the board) did in <em>Young, </em>223 Or App at 101, 107.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
