The state concedes that the trial court \u201carticulated an after-the-fact aid-and-abet theory when it explained its verdict\u201d and that Oregon does not recognize such a theory, but contends that defendant failed to preserve that argument for review. Further, the state contends that the claimed error is not plain, and, even if it were, we should not exercise our discretion to correct it. We agree with the state that defendant failed to preserve his argument below, but conclude that, in convicting defendant under an improper theory of liability, the trial court committed legal error apparent on the face of the record. For the reasons set forth below, we exercise our discretion to correct that error, and, in so doing, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">On appeal from a judgment of conviction, we recount the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Sundberg, </em>349 Or 608, 610, 247 P3d 1213 (2011). On January 4, 2007, defendant was working as a waiter at The Pheasant Caf\u00e9 &amp; Lounge (The Pheasant). Some days earlier, Chad Mercer had stolen a credit card from Randall Muller, and Muller had not yet noticed that the card was missing. While defendant was waiting tables on January 4, Mercer and defendant\u2019s step-cousin, Samantha, entered The Pheasant with another woman and accrued a $32.65 bill at a table serviced by defendant. Mercer paid the bill using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the stolen credit card, left defendant a $75 tip, and signed the credit-card receipt using Muller\u2019s name rather than his own. Contrary to the restaurant\u2019s policies, defendant did not check the signature on the credit card and receipt, nor did he verify the cardholder\u2019s identification. Defendant then removed the $75 tip from the till in cash, leaving the restaurant short of cash the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Soon thereafter, Muller\u2019s wife noticed a $107.65 charge from The Pheasant on an online bank statement and contacted Muller, who had been out of town and unable to visit the restaurant. After discovering that his credit card was in fact missing, Muller called the police. On January 6, Officer Roberts went to The Pheasant and spoke with defendant. Defendant told Roberts that he distinctly remembered receiving the large tip, as he was \u201cexcited\u201d about it, but he initially denied knowing either Mercer or Samantha. After further questioning, defendant told Roberts that he thought \u201cthat one of the females\u2019 names was Samantha,\u201d but stated that he did not know her last name and \u201cdidn\u2019t know any information about the other people.\u201d He denied having any knowledge that the credit card was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Over one year later, on March 12, 2008, Roberts again spoke with defendant regarding the events of January 4, 2007. At that time, defendant maintained his earlier assertion that he did not know that the credit card was stolen when he ran it and received the $75 tip, but openly admitted that Samantha was a relative, stating that he did not think much of the $75 tip because \u201c[i]t was a family thing[,]\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\u201cit\u2019s not normal but, I mean, somebody you know comes in, they\u2019re going to tip you good.\u201d Defendant confirmed that Mercer was the person who physically handed him the credit card, and told Roberts that he knew Mercer. However, defendant later testified that he was \u201cnever even introduced\u201d to and did not know Mercer on January 4, 2007, but rather got to know him during the intervening year. Roberts placed defendant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Defendant was charged with one count of second-degree theft, ORS 164.045 (2007), <em>amended by </em>Oregon Laws 2009, chapter 11, section 12, and Oregon Laws 2009, chapter 16, section 2, and one count of fraudulent use of a credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>card, ORS 165.055. He elected to try the case to the court and, at the close of the state\u2019s case, moved for judgment of acquittal on both charges on the ground that the state had failed to produce sufficient evidence that he \u201chad knowledge that the card was stolen at the time of the transaction.\u201d The trial court denied the motion and ultimately acquitted defendant of the second-degree theft charge but convicted him of fraudulent use of a credit card. In rendering that verdict, the court explained that it found defendant guilty of fraudulent use of a credit card under an aid-and-abet theory because he knowingly failed to disclose Samantha\u2019s or Mercer\u2019s identities to the police after the crime had been committed \u2014 thereby aiding Mercer in escaping arrest. Specifically, in announcing its verdict, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-3\">\u201cUnder ORS 161.155, a person is liable as the principal for aiding and abetting, planning or committing a crime. Under <em>State v. Burney, </em>191 Or App 227[, 82 P3d 164] (2003), in that case the Court noted the aid and abet, proof of intent, was to promote or further the commission of a crime under ORS 161.155. Further, the commission of a crime, in that case, essentially appears to be the natural evolution of an accessory after the fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201cEven [sic] for the moment that our Defendant here today did not know Mercer \u2014 and I\u2019m finding that Mercer did pass the stolen credit card to him \u2014 even assuming that the Defendant did not have a legal duty to follow the procedures and identify the credit card holder, and then, <em>when the Defendant learned of the theft and misuse of the credit card and having gained from that theft, knowingly failed then to disclose the information to the police about the case, that was done in the furtherance of the crime, and thus the Defendant aided and abetted the crime of fraudulent use</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cTherefore, the Defendant being motivated by his own self-interest in having received the $75 and protecting his family\u2019s participation in the theft, <em>took the step to aid the offender, Mercer in this case, in escaping arrest. </em>I believe that that is primarily used for the fraudulent use of the credit card. So as to count one, the theft, I find you not guilty; and as to count two, for the purposes and reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>just stated, I find you guilty of the fraudulent use of the credit card.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Shortly after announcing its verdict, the trial court sentenced defendant and provided both parties with a proposed judgment. After stating that he would \u201cinitial and sign it and go ahead and make distribution,\u201d the trial judge asked, \u201cOutside of distribution of the copies, anything else today?\u201d The parties raised nothing further in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in finding him \u201cguilty of something that is not a crime\u201d when it convicted him of fraudulent use of a credit card based on an improper aid-and-abet after-the-fact theory of liability. In addition, he asserts that his argument regarding the trial court\u2019s legally infirm verdict was preserved below as required by ORAP 5.45(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, should we conclude otherwise, alternatively argues that the trial court\u2019s legal error constitutes plain error and merits discretionary correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">As noted, the state concedes that Oregon does not recognize an aid-and-abet after-the-fact theory of criminal liability, and further concedes that \u201cthe trial court in this case articulated an after-the-fact aid-and-abet theory when it explained its verdict.\u201d However, the state argues that defendant\u2019s assignment of error is unpreserved, as defendant failed to raise it in his motion for judgment of acquittal, failed to raise it during closing argument, and failed to <em>\u201csomehow </em>alert[ ] the judge to the legal inadequacy of [the aid-and-abet after-the-fact] theory * * (Emphasis in original.) The state further argues that, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s \u201cmistaken reasoning,\u201d the error is not plain and, even if it were, we should not exercise our discretion to correct it. As noted, we agree with the state that defendant\u2019s argument was not preserved below; however, as to the state\u2019s latter arguments, we disagree and exercise our discretion to address the trial court\u2019s verdict as plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Defendant contends that his assignment of error was preserved below when, during closing argument, defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">\u201cAnd moreover, [defendant is] under no obligation to discuss the matter with the officer at all. He\u2019s got a Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. <em>It would be inappropriate for the Court to convict him on some aiding and abetting theory based on his unwillingness to be entirely forthright with the officer at the first conversation.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">(Emphasis added.) In support of that contention, defendant analogizes closing arguments in the context of bench trials to jury-instruction arguments, citing, <em>inter alia, State v. Andrews, </em>174 Or App 354, 358-59, 27 P3d 137 (2001), <em>abrogated in part on other grounds by State v. Rutley, </em>202 Or App 639, 644-45, 123 P3d 334 (2005), <em>aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>343 Or 368, 171 P3d 361 (2007). In <em>Andrews, </em>this court held that, where a defendant in a bench trial argues that the state is required to prove a particular element of the charged offense, and the trial court explicitly rules to the contrary, the issue is reviewable on appeal much like a \u201cruling on an exception to an instruction in a jury trial.\u201d 174 Or App at 358; <em>see also State v. Clum, </em>216 Or App 1, 7-9, 8 n 5, 171 P3d 980 (2007) (applying the reasoning set forth in <em>Andrews </em>and concluding that \u201cthe ruling to which defendant assigns error is directly analogous to a ruling on an exception to an instruction in a jury trial\u201d). However, defendant\u2019s closing argument did not raise the issue that he now asserts on appeal \u2014 namely, that, as a matter of law, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>trial court could not convict him on an aid-and-abet after-the-fact theory. Instead, in his closing argument, defendant contended only that the evidence that he was unwilling to be forthright with Roberts during their first conversation was insufficient to convict him on that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Moreover, when the trial court did erroneously rely upon an \u201caiding and abetting theory based on [defendant\u2019s] unwillingness to be entirely forthright with the officer[,]\u201d defendant remained silent. Further, defendant raised no objection after the trial court distributed the proposed judgment and asked, \u201cOutside of distribution of the copies, anything else today?\u201d Given that context, defendant\u2019s statement during closing argument is insufficient to preserve for appeal his argument as to the trial court\u2019s reliance on an improper theory of liability in rendering its verdict. <em>See Shields v. </em>Campbell, 277 Or 71, 77, 559 P2d 1275 (1977) (\u201cA party owes the trial court the obligation of a sound, clear and articulate motion, objection or exception, so as to permit the trial judge a chance to consider the legal contention <em>or to correct an error already made.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)); <em>cf. State v. Wilson, </em>240 Or App 475, 484-85, 248 P3d 10 (2011) (finding that the defendant\u2019s argument that the court in a bench trial relied upon an improper theory of liability was preserved after, \u201cin colloquy during closing argument, the trial court advanced\u2014 and <em>defense counsel patently disputed </em>\u2014 the [erroneous theory of liability]\u201d (citation omitted; emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">As noted, defendant alternatively contends that the error is plain and asks that we exercise our discretion to correct it. Although we generally will not consider an unpreserved issue on appeal, <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 341, 15 P3d 22 (2000), we may nevertheless review an unpreserved assignment of error as plain error under ORAP 5.45(1), provided that (1) the error is one of law; (2) the error is \u201capparent,\u201d in that the \u201clegal point is obvious, not reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) the error appears \u201con the face of the record\u201d such that we \u201cneed not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it, and the facts that comprise the error are irrefutable.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). Further, even where those conditions are satisfied, we must still affirmatively exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>our discretion to reach and correct the error. <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The trial court\u2019s verdict convicting defendant based on a theory of criminal liability that does not exist in Oregon presents an error of law, and we need not look beyond the record or choose between competing inferences to identify that error. ORS 161.155, the aid-and-abet statute, plainly applies only to conduct prior to or during the commission of a crime. The statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201cA person is criminally liable for the conduct of another person constituting a crime if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201c* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201c(2) With the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the crime the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u2021 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201c(b) Aids or abets or agrees or attempts to aid or abet such other person <em>in planning or committing the crime </em>[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">(Emphasis added.) <em>See State v. Rosser, </em>162 Or 293, 344, 91 P2d 295 (1939) (\u201cThe words \u2018aid and abet\u2019 *** manifestly have reference to some word or act of encouragement or assistance in the commission of the offense, and <em>not to something done after the crime is complete.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)); <em>State v. Holcomb, </em>246 Or App 687, 693, 268 P3d 684 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 675 (2012) (\u201c[A]fter-the-fact assistance * * * is not cognizable under Oregon law.\u201d); <em>Wilson, </em>240 Or App at 484 (\u201c[Accomplice liability under ORS 161.155(2)(b) cannot be based on \u2018aiding and abetting after the fact.\u2019\u201d); <em>State v. Moriarty, </em>87 Or App 465, 468 n 1, 742 P2d 704, <em>rev den, </em>304 Or 547 (1987) (\u201c[A]ctions <em>after </em>the commission of a crime cannot alone constitute aiding or abetting[.]\u201d (Emphasis in original.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">The state disputes only <em>Brown's </em>second prerequisite to plain error review, arguing that \u201cit is not \u2018obvious\u2019 that the court convicted defendant solely on a flawed understanding of the law[.]\u201d That is, the state asserts that, although the trial court erroneously relied upon an aid-and-abet after-the-fact theory in convicting defendant, a reasonable dispute exists as to whether the court \u201calso believe [d] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>defendant had facilitated the fraudulent credit-card use as it happened.\u201d We reject that argument in the context of our plain error analysis,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> noting that, regardless of speculation as to what the trial court may have \u201cbelieve [d],\u201d the record unambiguously reflects \u2014 as set forth above \u2014 that the trial court in fact convicted defendant for aiding Mercer in escaping arrest after the crime was complete, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cwhen the Defendant learned of the theft and misuse of the credit card.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s legal error in convicting defendant of aiding and abetting Mercer after the fact is \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">We next determine whether to exercise our discretion to reach and correct the error. <em>SeeAiles, </em>312 Or at 382. In so doing, we employ the \u201cutmost caution\u201d given the \u201cstrong policies\u201d underlying the preservation requirement. <em>Id. </em>Considerations relevant to that determination include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way, i.e., whether the trial court was, in some manner, presented with both sides of the issue * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 382 n 6. Additional considerations include whether defendant encouraged the error in some way, whether defendant strategically chose not to object to the error, and whether or not the error could have been remedied were it raised below. <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 523, 173 P3d 822 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">First and foremost, the gravity of the error militates in favor of discretionary review. As defendant succinctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>points out, he presently \u201cstands convicted of something that is not a crime.\u201d As we recently explained in <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>250 Or App 516, 522-23, 280 P3d 1046 (2012), a defendant \u201chas a strong interest in having a criminal record that accurately reflects the nature and extent of [his or her] conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522 (citing additional cases supporting that proposition). Conversely, the state has no competing interest in seeing the law applied incorrectly to sustain a conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 524 (\u201c[W]e cannot fathom any reason why the state would have an interest in upholding the erroneous conviction.\u201d); <em>State v. Decamp, </em>252 Or App 177, 179, 285 P3d 1130 (2012) (\u201c[T]he state has no interest in sustaining a constitutionally infirm sentence.\u201d (Citation omitted.)). In fact, the state\u2019s concession that \u201cthe trial court here appears to have relied, at least in part, on an after-the-fact theory of aiding and abetting\u201d weighs in favor of the exercise of our discretion. <em>See State v. Jones, </em>129 Or App 413, 416-17, 879 P2d 881 (1994) (factoring \u201cthe state\u2019s concession of error on [the relevant] legal point\u201d into decision to reach the trial court\u2019s error as plain error). Finally, as noted, defense counsel\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]t would be inappropriate for the Court to convict [defendant] on some aiding and abetting theory based on his unwillingness to be entirely forthright with the officer at the first conversation\u201d tends to refute the notion that defendant encouraged or intentionally failed to object to the error. <em>See State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 511-12, 228 P3d 688 (2010) (insufficient objection for preservation purposes refuted contention that the defendant made a tactical choice not to raise the issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the error merits correction and that doing so \u201cwill not subvert the judicial system\u2019s interest in requiring preservation of error.\u201d <em>State v. Inloes, </em>239 Or App 49, 54, 243 P3d 862 (2010) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we affirmatively exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s plain error in \u201cconvict [ing] [defendant] of something that is not a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We now turn to the remaining question of the appropriate disposition. Defendant asks that we reverse his conviction and remand for a new trial on the basis that he \u201cwas found guilty without the state proving * * * that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the intent necessary to commit fraudulent use of a credit car[d] <em>before </em>[or while] the crime was committed.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The state in effect agrees with defendant\u2019s latter point, asserting (albeit while making a different argument)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that \u201cthe trial court did <em>not </em>find that the state had failed to prove that defendant aided and abetted the fraudulent credit-card use [before or] <em>as it </em>occurred.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We have consistently held that, under such circumstances, <em>i.e., </em>where factual issues pertinent to a material element of the crime remain unresolved, \u201cthe proper disposition is to reverse and remand for a new trial [.]\u201d <em>State v. Schodrow, </em>187 Or App 224, 232, 66 P3d 547 (2003) (citation omitted); <em>see also, e.g., Wilson, </em>240 Or App at 489 (same); <em>Andrews, </em>174 Or App at 366 (same); <em>State v. Jaha, </em>118 Or App 497, 501, 848 P2d 622 (1993) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Given its similarity to this case, <em>Wilson </em>is particularly instructive. There, the defendant was convicted of theft following a bench trial, and, as here, that conviction was based on an erroneous aid-and-abet after-the-fact theory of criminal liability. 240 Or App at 489. On appeal, we rejected the aid-and-abet after-the-fact theory, but noted that there was sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could infer that the defendant had actually participated in the theft as it occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 483-89. Consequently, addressing the appropriate disposition of the matter, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u201c[T]here is evidence on which, depending on the trial court\u2019s determination of (as yet) unresolved factual issues, the court could properly convict defendant of the charged offense. In that respect, this case is in a procedural posture directly analogous to that in <em>Andrews. </em>Accordingly, as in <em>Andrews, </em>we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 489. <em>See Andrews, </em>174 Or App at 366 (\u201c[T]he case is in a posture in which the trial court convicted defendant without deciding a material element for which there was proof sufficient to withstand a motion for judgment of acquittal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Given those circumstances, and as we have done previously, we reverse and remand for a new trial.\u201d (Citation omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">This case does not so neatly fit within the ambit of the precedent set forth above; that is, some measure of scrutiny is required in order to determine whether the rule articulated in <em>Andrews </em>and <em>Wilson </em>applies at all based on the face of the record and the trial court\u2019s findings of fact or lack thereof. As noted, in delivering its verdict, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\"><em>\u201cEven [sic] for the moment </em>that our Defendant here today did not know Mercer \u2014 and I\u2019m finding that Mercer did pass the stolen credit card to him \u2014 even assuming that the Defendant did not have a legal duty to follow the procedures and identify the credit card holder, and then, <em>when </em>the Defendant learned of the theft and misuse of the credit card and having gained from that theft, knowingly failed then to disclose the information to the police about the case, that was done in the furtherance of the crime, and thus the Defendant aided and abetted the crime of fraudulent use * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201cTherefore, the Defendant being motivated by his own self-interest in having received the $75 and protecting his family\u2019s participation in the theft, took the step to aid the offender, Mercer in this case, in escaping arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">(Emphasis added.) At the outset, we acknowledge that the trial court\u2019s remarks present close questions as to the findings that it actually made. Had the trial court unambiguously found that defendant did not know Mercer on January 4, 2007, rather than assuming as much for purposes of applying an erroneous legal premise, or had the court specified when, exactly, defendant \u201clearned of the theft and misuse of the credit card\u201d <em>{i.e., </em>after speaking with Roberts), we would be bound to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction outright. <em>See, e.g., State v. Gonzalez, </em>188 Or App 430, 431, 431 n 1, 71 P3d 573 (2003) (reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction where its basis was legally infirm while acknowledging cases reversing and remanding for a new trial \u201cwhere [the] trial court did not decide [a] material element and there was proof sufficient to withstand a motion for judgment of acquittal\u201d); <em>see also State v. Johnson, </em>335 Or 511, 523, 73 P3d 282 (2003) (\u201cIt is familiar doctrine that we are bound by a trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>findings of fact, if there is evidence in the record to support them.\u201d (Citations omitted.)). Moreover, where the trial court does not make findings of fact on all of the issues and there is evidence based upon which particular factual issues could be decided in more than one way, \u201cwe will presume that the facts were decided in a manner consistent with the [trial court\u2019s] ultimate conclusion[.]\u201d <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487, 443 P2d 621 (1968); <em>accord, e.g., State v. Potter, </em>236 Or App 74, 82, 234 P3d 1073 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">However, here the trial court\u2019s verdict indicates that it did not make findings of fact pertaining to whether defendant aided and abetted before or during the commission of the crime as required by ORS 161.155. Rather, the trial court merely <em>assumed for the sake of argument </em>that the evidence did not support conviction under a proper interpretation of ORS 161.155. Consequently, because the trial court ultimately convicted defendant <em>only </em>under the erroneous theory and predicate findings of fact, we need not apply the rule set forth in <em>Ball </em>given that the undecided facts were not necessary to the trial court\u2019s ultimate disposition. <em>Ball, </em>250 Or at 487; <em>see also State v. Woodall, </em>181 Or App 213, 221 n 2, 45 P3d 484 (2002) (\u201c[G]iven the fact that the trial court never addressed the [critical issue], we cannot assume, as in <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>that the trial court implicitly resolved that critical factual issue in the state\u2019s favor.\u201d (Citations omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Given the trial court\u2019s ambiguity as to its findings of fact and, more importantly, given that it did not make concrete findings of fact regarding defendant\u2019s knowledge before or during the commission of the charged offense, we follow the course of action prescribed by <em>Wilson. </em>Accordingly, because a factual question as to defendant\u2019s knowledge <em>at the time of the fraudulent transaction </em>(a material element of the crime of fraudulent use of a credit card) remains unresolved, and the evidence pertaining to that question is sufficient to withstand a motion for judgment of acquittal,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial on the charge of fraudulent use of a credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\"> ORS 165.055 was amended after the conduct at issue in this case occurred. Or Laws 2009, ch 16, \u00a7 7. Because the amendment is not relevant to our analysis, we refer to the current version of ORS 165.055, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac_\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of fraudulent use of a credit card if, with intent to injure or defraud, the person uses a credit card for the purpose of obtaining property or services with knowledge that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201c(a) The card is stolen or forged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">\u201c(b) The card has been revoked or canceled; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">\u201c(c) For any other reason the use of the card is unauthorized by either the issuer or the person to whom the credit card is issued.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> ORAP 5.45(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b392-10\"> We briefly dispose of the state\u2019s preliminary argument that the trial court\u2019s \u201cconclulsion] that defendant could be convicted of fraudulent use of a credit card <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>on. the theory of aiding and abetting after the fact\u201d is not properly the subject of an assignment of error under ORAP 5.45. The state contends that defendant is not entitled to assign error to the <em>basis </em>for the trial court\u2019s verdict, asserting that \u201c[a] court\u2019s conclusion is not subject to attack, * * * except as it is actually related to a ruling by the court.\u201d That argument is unavailing. Here, the trial court\u2019s conclusion as to the applicable law was directly related to the verdict itself, and error may properly be assigned to both an erroneous verdict and error in identifying the elements that must be proved in order to convict a defendant. <em>See, e.g., State v. Wilson, </em>240 Or App 475, 483-84, 248 P3d 10 (2011) (defendant properly preserved contention that trial court \u201cconvicted him on a theory of culpability that is legally erroneous\u201d); <em>cfi State v. Hull, </em>286 Or 511, 517, 595 P2d 1240 (1979) (\u201cIn [a bench trial], there are different ways in which the record could show the basis of the court\u2019s conclusion so as not to foreclose review of this issue on appeal. *** We prescribe no formal findings; what matters is only that an appellate court can perform its function on the issue whether [the case] was decided on the right legal premises.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\"> As we note below in reaching our disposition, the state\u2019s argument is not without merit; it is simply inapplicable in this context. Here, we must ensure that the legal error \u2014 that is, that the trial court convicted defendant using an improper legal theory \u2014 is obvious. <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355. The face of the record is such that no reasonable dispute exists, and, as noted, the state concedes that the trial court relied \u201cat least in part\u201d on a \u201cmistaken\u201d aid-and-abet after-the-fact theory of liability in rendering its verdict. The state\u2019s argument set forth above more appropriately pertains to our discussion below regarding whether material facts have not yet been decided such that a new trial is warranted in lieu of outright reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\"> To be clear, the state does not assert that defendant is entitled to a new trial; rather, it simply agrees with the premise that the trial court\u2019s verdict does not on its face dispose of the possibility that defendant aided or abetted in the commission of the crime <em>before or as it occurred </em>as required by ORS 161.155.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\"> Although the state devotes a substantial portion of its brief to the sufficiency of the evidence, we need not discuss it in detail. Defendant moved for judgment of acquittal on both counts based on sufficiency of the evidence, that motion was denied, and, in any event, we are persuaded that a rational trier of fact could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew that the credit card was stolen at the time that the fraudulent transaction took place.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
