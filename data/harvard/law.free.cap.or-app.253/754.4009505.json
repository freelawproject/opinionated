The sole issue on appeal is the sufficiency of the evidence supporting that order. Because this is not an \u201cexceptional case\u201d justifying <em>de novo </em>review, we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings for \u201cany evidence\u201d and its legal conclusions for errors of law. <em>See Travis v. Strubel, </em>238 Or App 254, 256, 242 P3d 690 (2010) (explaining standard of review applicable to SPO appeals); ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals will exercise its discretion to try the cause anew on the record or to make one or more factual findings anew on the record only in exceptional cases.\u201d). Applying that standard of review, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the entry of the SPO against respondent. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">When the sufficiency of the evidence supporting an SPO is challenged, we view the evidence, and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from it, in the light most favorable to the petitioner. <em>Delgado v. Souders, </em>334 Or 122, 134, 46 P3d 729 (2002). That said, except as noted below, the parties do not present greatly differing versions of the pertinent historical facts, although they disagree vehemently about the significance of several events. Petitioner and respondent worked together for five years at the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and were fairly close friends. At some point, petitioner became engaged to be married and, at a party in December 2010, respondent made offensive comments to petitioner\u2019s then-fianc\u00e9e. Shortly thereafter, petitioner confronted respondent about his comments and told respondent, \u201c[Wle\u2019re done. We\u2019re not friends anymore, I don\u2019t want anything to do with you.\u201d That same evening, respondent sent petitioner a string of 19 text messages, starting at 6:14 p.m. and ending at 1:08 a.m. Although petitioner did not save the text messages, he testified that the first message was apologetic, but the next was \u201cmore sarcastic\u201d and subsequent messages \u201cwould go back and forth in between put downs and threats,\u201d including respondent calling petitioner a \u201cdouche bag,\u201d saying he would \u201ckick [petitioner\u2019s] ass\u201d when he next saw him, and saying that petitioner\u2019s fianc\u00e9e should \u201cget a protective order\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>petitioner, because he was \u201cgoing to need it.\u201d Petitioner did not respond to the text messages; instead, he blocked respondent\u2019s telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The next day, both petitioner and respondent went to the office, but they did not say a word to each other. At the SPO hearing, petitioner acknowledged that he had not feared going to work that day, despite knowing that respondent would be there, and despite the fact that \u2014 according to petitioner \u2014 respondent once had pointed a loaded firearm at him, sometime before their December 2010 confrontation. Petitioner explained that he could choose whether to work with another DEA agent on particular cases, and he had decided no longer to work on cases with respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Within the next week, petitioner learned that respondent had told a supervisor that petitioner had \u201ctaken money from a search warrant,\u201d was growing medical marijuana for profit, was suicidal, and was \u201cin collections\u201d and \u201cgetting property repossessed.\u201d During the subsequent investigation, the parties\u2019 supervisor decided to keep both men working, even though they worked in the same office space, as their desks were separated by a bank of lockers. Although the men worked in the same office, they did not talk to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">On at least two different days in February 2011, respondent repeatedly dry fired his duty weapon when he and petitioner were working at the DEA office. On each of those occasions, respondent dry fired his weapon at least 10 or 15 times over the course of a minute or more. On the first of those occasions, petitioner was alone; on the other, two additional officers witnessed the dry firing. Petitioner did not believe that respondent was dry firing his gun after having cleaned it, as petitioner did not smell any solvent. At the SPO hearing, respondent\u2019s counsel asked petitioner on cross-examination whether he had been in fear of respondent harming him with the gun at that point. Petitioner responded, \u201cI was armed at the time, too, sir.\u201d Counsel then asked, \u201cMy question was, you were not concerned at that point, about him harming you,\u201d to which petitioner replied, \u201cI was concerned enough to stand up and walk over to see what he was doing, yes.\u201d Petitioner testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>that two other people had complained to a DEA supervisor about the dry-firing incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Respondent acknowledged at the SPO hearing that he had dry fired his gun, but said that he was \u201cjust playing with [it],\u201d noting that DEA agents always have firearms at the office. Respondent denied that he had intended to place petitioner in fear when he dry fired his gun. The trial court rejected that aspect of respondent\u2019s testimony. Instead, the court explained in its written ruling that it had inferred from the evidence that respondent dry fired his gun with the intent to intimidate petitioner and that petitioner \u201cdid experience apprehension as a result of that conduct.\u201d The court also found that respondent\u2019s conduct constituted contacts that were unwanted by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Soon after the dry-firing incidents, respondent stopped working for the DEA for reasons that are not entirely clear from this record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner eventually was exonerated of the allegations that respondent had made against him. He had no other contact with respondent after February 2011, except for the incident described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">After leaving the DEA, respondent obtained employment as a detective with the Josephine County Sheriff\u2019s ffice. At some point in the past, the Medford Police Department had investigated respondent on other allegations of misconduct unrelated to his dispute with petitioner. Those allegations had resulted in an indictment, but apparently no conviction, although the record does not reveal exactly how the charges were resolved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In June 2011, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>and apparently in response to those earlier allegations, the sheriff relieved respondent of certain narcotics-investigation duties (which had given him the opportunity to work significant overtime) and assigned him different responsibilities. Respondent testified at the SPO hearing that the sheriff had told him that he did not want the fact of respondent\u2019s previous indictment \u201cto affect their federal cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">On June 27, 2011, the day after respondent learned of his changed duties, he drove his motorcycle to petitioner\u2019s house, stopped near the end of petitioner\u2019s driveway, and\u2014 seeing petitioner through a window \u2014 revved his engine and yelled at petitioner to come outside.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner testified that he believed respondent was armed and threatening him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">\u201cI can see him yelling and telling me to come out, and at one point, points down like this to his side, and on his right side, I\u2019ve known the guy for probably about five years, and I have never seen [respondent] not carry his duty gun with him. And at that point it was my belief that he was armed and trying to get me to come out for some type of confrontation. So at that point, my wife called 911. She gets on the phone, and I just stared out the window at him, which is probably a 35, 45-foot driveway, to where he is in the street, still yelling, still motioning for me to come outside. When she gets on the phone with 911, she\u2019s standing in view, he starts doing this, and yelling some more, and I don\u2019t remember the exact extent of time that he was there, but over five minutes, before he finally drove away.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The trial court found, in keeping with petitioner\u2019s testimony, that petitioner was alarmed by what the court characterized as respondent\u2019s \u201cprovocative behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">When petitioner checked his work e-mail the next morning, he discovered the following message from respondent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>\u201cI just wanted to let you know that I am not mad at you in the least! Anyone who doesn\u2019t work elder abuse would question the legality of my grandpa adding me to his bank accounts and I don\u2019t blame you for reporting it (although AFTER I slapped you upside the head in Portland I\u2019m sorry and said so) Anyway, I heard you guys are afraid of me and that\u2019s ridiculous because [you] are a much better shot than me. Anyhow, I really believed you [were] my [friend] and I tried to treat you as such...except you broke the law and committed a felony and that\u2019s a problem for me. (Solicitation of 10K is a felony if you look it up) Anyway, there\u2019s nothing to worry about since DEA is vouching and covering for you. I\u2019m not trying to trap you or anything and I just wanted you to know today that I forgive you. I hope you and [another person, presumably petitioner\u2019s wife] work out, but like [your] dad warned, \u2018listen to Josh.\u2019 You probably won\u2019t but you can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t [your] friend. Anyway, best wishes and good luck. From a mildly retarded but \u2018better late than never \u2018friend.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-4\">\u201cJosh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">\u201cOh by the way. Thanks for killing my best friend, my grandpa, losing 30K a year in overtime and a million in property! So maybe I\u2019m struggling with forgiveness but I\u2019m trying!!!\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">(Uppercase in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">At the SPO hearing, petitioner described how he had been affected by those events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">\u201cMy fear is, and it\u2019s obvious by reading the e-mail, and by several other people he\u2019s talked to, that [respondent] thinks that I have turned him in for a past crime that he was investigated for, which I had nothing to do with. And he blames me for losing money, for losing property, for losing his grandfather. And my worry is, this same day that he came over \u2014 what triggered that for him to put all the blame on me, and what additional things are going to happen wrong in his life, that he\u2019s going to turn around and subsequently blame on me, and come after me or one of my family members for?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Sergeant Mike Budreau of the Medford Police Department investigated the June 27th incident and, as part of that investigation, interviewed respondent. During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>the recorded interview, respondent acknowledged that \u201cthey\u201d all were \u201cdefinitely afraid\u201d of him but characterized those fears as \u201cridiculous.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondent said that he had gone by petitioner\u2019s house to say that he had forgiven petitioner for what he claimed were petitioner\u2019s misconduct and false accusations against him. Respondent denied that he had been armed at the time and explained that he had lifted up his shirt to show that he was unarmed: \u201c[T]hey\u2019re all afraid that I want to kill them or something, for getting into this crap, and I didn\u2019t want them to \u2014 to think that I was carrying a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Respondent told Budreau that the DEA was \u201ccovering *** up\u201d petitioner\u2019s misconduct. According to respondent, the DEA had discredited respondent to \u201cget [him] out of their hair, because they know [he knows] the truth.\u201d Respondent also said that a Medford police officer who had investigated respondent\u2019s allegations against petitioner had lied about what respondent had said. That, too, respondent asserted, was \u201ca coverup\u201d that needed to be looked into by a police officer \u201cwho knows how to investigate conspiracies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Petitioner filed his stalking complaint against respondent on June 29, 2011. A temporary SPO issued and a hearing was set for August 1st. After the hearing, the trial court issued a written ruling that included factual findings that generally reflected petitioner\u2019s testimony about his interactions with respondent. On the basis of those findings, the trial court entered the permanent SPO that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">On appeal, respondent assigns error to the trial court\u2019s determination that the evidence was sufficient to support the entry of a permanent SPO. He mistakenly asserts that we review the facts <em>de novo, </em>citing a case that predates the 2009 change to ORS 19.415(3)(b) that makes <em>de novo </em>review discretionary. As noted, we choose not to exercise our discretion to review the facts <em>de novo </em>in this case, which is not \u201cextraordinary\u201d for purposes of ORAP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>5.40(8)(c). Respondent\u2019s arguments on appeal do not all depend on us reviewing the facts <em>de novo, </em>however, and we address those in which respondent claims that the trial court erred as a matter of law. We treat his factual arguments as a contention that the trial court\u2019s findings are not supported by legally sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B), under which the trial court entered the SPO, provides that a court may enter a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">\u201ccourt\u2019s stalking protective order if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">\u201c(i) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">\u201c(ii) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-8\">\u201c(in) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">That statute creates several requirements for entry of an SPO. First, a respondent\u2019s conduct must, on at least two occasions, meet the statutory definition of \u201cunwanted contact\u201d with the petitioner or a member of the petitioner\u2019s immediate family or household. Second, the petitioner must <em>subjectively </em>\u2014 i.e., actually \u2014 be alarmed or coerced by the contacts, and that alarm or coercion must be objectively reasonable. Third, the cumulative contacts also must actually cause the petitioner apprehension, and that apprehension, too, must be objectively reasonable. Finally, the respondent must have intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly engaged in the unwanted contact. That is, at a minimum, the respondent must have been aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the contact was unwanted and consciously and unreasonably disregarded that risk. <em>Delgado, </em>334 Or at 133.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution imposes an additional requirement in stalking cases in which the petitioner \u201cseeks to rely on a contact that involves speech.\u201d <em>Falkenstein v. Falkenstein, </em>236 Or App 445, 451, 236 P3d 798 (2010). \u201cTo avoid constitutional overbreadth problems, a contact that involves speech can serve as a predicate contact for an SPO only if it is a threat.\u201d <em>Id. A </em>\u201cthreat\u201d is \u201ca communication that instills in the addressee a fear of imminent and serious personal violence from the speaker, is unequivocal, and is objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.\u201d <em>State v. Rangel, </em>328 Or 294, 303, 977 P2d 379 (1999). Qualifying threats do not include \u201c\u2018the kind of hyperbole, rhetorical excesses, and impotent expressions of anger or frustration that in some contexts can be privileged even if they alarm the addressee.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Moyle, </em>299 Or 691, 705, 705 P2d 740 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">At the outset, we readily agree with respondent that the series of text messages that he sent in December 2010 and the e-mail that he sent in June 2011 were expressive contacts that do not meet the heightened standard set out in <em>Rangel. </em>Specifically, nothing in any of the text messages or in the e-mail gave rise to an objectively reasonable fear of imminent and serious physical harm. Accordingly, although those incidents may serve as context for the other contacts, we do not consider them in their own right. <em>See Habrat v. Milligan, </em>208 Or App 229, 237, 145 P3d 180 (2006) (although speech that is not a threat cannot be a \u201ccontact,\u201d it can provide context for nonexpressive contacts).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We turn to the remaining contacts, beginning with the February 2011 dry-firing incidents. Respondent argues that those incidents could not constitute \u201cunwanted contacts,\u201d as a matter of law, because \u201cthey involved the parties at their work place while acting within the scope of their employment as police officers.\u201d Respondent invokes ORS 163.755(l)(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">\u201c(1) Nothing in ORS 30.866 or 163.730 to 163.750 shall be construed to permit the issuance of a court\u2019s stalking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>protective order under ORS 30.866 or 163.738 * * * or a civil action under ORS 30.866:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-4\"><em>(&lt;%i % </em>\u2021 \u00edj\u00ed %</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">\u201c(c) By or on behalf of a person not described in paragraph (b) of this subsection [relating to persons in custody] to or against another person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">\u201c(A) Is a parole and probation officer or an officer, employee or agent of a law enforcement unit, a county juvenile department or the Oregon Youth Authority; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">\u201c(B) Is acting within the scope of the other person\u2019s official duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Respondent asserts in his appellate brief that the incidents at the DEA office \u201cwere not actionable contacts, as they involved both parties while at their work place, when both were acting within the scope of their employment as law enforcement officers.\u201d At oral argument, however, respondent acknowledged that, if his intent in dry firing his gun was to intimidate petitioner, under the particular circumstances of this case, the conduct would have fallen outside the scope of his official duties and ORS 163.755(l)(c) would not apply. The trial court expressly found that it <em>was </em>respondent\u2019s intent to intimidate petitioner, and that is an inference that the court could reasonably draw from the evidence. Given respondent\u2019s concession that the \u201cofficial duties\u201d provision in ORS 163.755(l)(c) would not apply in those circumstances, we conclude that we may consider the dry-firing incidents in determining whether the SPO was properly issued.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">With respect to those incidents, respondent challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that the contacts were unwanted or caused petitioner subjective alarm, and he argues that any alarm that petitioner may have experienced was not objectively reasonable. We begin, briefly, with whether the contacts were unwanted. Respondent contends that, even if petitioner\u2019s statement, \u201cWe\u2019re not friends anymore, I don\u2019t want anything to do with you,\u201d was enough to put him on notice that any further contact was unwanted, petitioner essentially revoked any such notice by going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>work the next day knowing that respondent would be there. At the very least, respondent argues, he was not aware that further contact was unwanted and therefore could not have intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly engaged in unwanted contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">We disagree. Although petitioner reported to work the next day, he and respondent did not speak to each other for the remainder of respondent\u2019s employment with the DEA. A reasonable factfinder could infer from petitioner\u2019s refusal to interact with respondent that he did not want any contact beyond the parties being present together in their shared workplace. <em>Cf. Boyd v. Essin, </em>170 Or App 509, 515, 515 n 7, 12 P3d 1003 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 674 (2001) (in context of former wife\u2019s SPO petition against former husband, the former husband\u2019s assault of the couple\u2019s son qualified as an unwanted contact even though it occurred before the couple separated: \u201cNot every contact that occurs before separation is wanted.\u201d). It also is reasonable to infer from the fact that respondent also did not speak to petitioner in the months after petitioner ended the friendship that respondent, at the very least, recklessly engaged in the unwanted contact \u2014 that is, that he aware that there was a risk that further contact was unwanted and consciously disregarded that risk. <em>See </em>ORS 161.085(9) (\u201c \u2018Recklessly,\u2019 when used with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense, means that a person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Respondent next argues that the dry-firing incidents did not cause petitioner subjective alarm. Respondent points out that petitioner continued to go to work after both incidents and never reported any fear or alarm to his supervisor or even complained to respondent about the incidents. He also argues that petitioner did not testify at the hearing that he was alarmed by the incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">We agree with respondent that nothing in the record supports the inference that the second of the two dry-firing incidents caused petitioner subjective alarm. There is evidence that two other people in the office complained about the second incident to petitioner\u2019s supervisor, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>does not give rise to a reasonable inference that petitioner himself was alarmed by it. We therefore conclude that the second incident does not constitute a qualifying contact for purposes of issuing an SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">We reach a different conclusion with respect to the first dry-firing incident. As respondent points out, when asked whether the incident placed him in fear of respondent harming him with his gun at that point, petitioner initially responded, \u201cI was armed at the time, too, sir.\u201d That comment could be understood to suggest, as respondent contends, that petitioner was not alarmed by respondent\u2019s conduct. It also could be understood as intimating that petitioner would have been alarmed but for his own ability to protect himself from a threat \u2014 in other words, that petitioner believed that respondent may have been threatening him in a manner that would demand an armed response. Whatever meaning that initial testimony carried, however, petitioner then clarified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">\u201cQ: My question was, you were not concerned at that point, about him harming you, is that [ \u2014 ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">\u201cA: I was concerned enough to stand up to walk over to see what he was doing, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Petitioner\u2019s testimony that he <em>was </em>concerned about respondent harming him, in combination with petitioner\u2019s initial remark about being armed himself, is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that petitioner was subjectively alarmed by the contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">As noted, respondent also argues that any alarm petitioner may have experienced was not objectively reasonable. However, respondent does not explain that assertion, and our own review of the record does not persuade us that petitioner\u2019s alarm was not objectively reasonable. We reject respondent\u2019s argument without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">The only remaining contact is the June 27, 2011, incident in which respondent stopped his motorcycle in front of petitioner\u2019s house and tried to get petitioner to come outside. Respondent argues that the contact did not subjectively alarm petitioner. He also contends that petitioner\u2019s belief that respondent was armed and wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>a physical confrontation is not objectively reasonable under the facts reflected in the record. Respondent asserts that he \u201csimply sat upon his motorcycle on a public street, and did not go on to [petitioner\u2019s] property. His hand gestures were not threatening in any manner, and he was not armed.\u201d Finally, respondent asserts, without elaboration, that the contact \u201cclearly fail[s] the <em>Rangel </em>analysis ***.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">The record before us supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the contact at petitioner\u2019s home subjectively alarmed him. To be sure, petitioner did not explicitly state that he was alarmed by the contact. However, he testified that he had believed that respondent \u201cwas armed and trying to get [him] to come out for some type of confrontation\u201d and that, at that point, his wife called 9-1-1. Furthermore, respondent himself stated in his interview with Detective Budreau that, during the contact, he had lifted his shirt to show that he was not armed because \u201cthey\u2019re all afraid that I want to kill them or something * * The trial court could reasonably infer that petitioner was subjectively alarmed. <em>See Boyd, </em>170 Or App at 518 n 10 (subjective alarm can be inferred in the absence of explicit testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">We also reject respondent\u2019s argument that petitioner\u2019s alarm was not objectively reasonable. Respondent\u2019s assertion that he was not armed and that his gestures were not threatening is inconsistent with the trial court\u2019s explicit and implicit findings. The court expressly found that respondent\u2019s conduct was \u201cprovocative\u201d and that it \u201cconvincingly and unequivocally expressed to Petitioner Respondent\u2019s intention to carry out his threats as well as his ability to do so.\u201d In other words, the court found that respondent\u2019s gestures were, in fact, threatening \u2014 that is, that respondent intended to threaten petitioner and that petitioner perceived the gestures as a threat. Implicit in the court\u2019s ruling is a finding that respondent was armed or, at least, intended to be perceived as being armed. Those findings are supported by inferences that reasonably can be drawn from the record, so we are bound by them. Given those findings, we reject respondent\u2019s contention that petitioner\u2019s alarm was not objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Finally, respondent asserts that the contact at petitioner\u2019s home fails the <em>Rangel </em>analysis. Respondent\u2019s arguments on that point, however, simply mirror those that he makes in relation to whether the contact meets the requirements of ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B). We already have rejected those arguments, for the reasons set forth above, and they are no more persuasive in the <em>Rangel </em>context than they are with respect to the statutory analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\">To summarize, the first dry-firing incident in February 2011 and the contact at petitioner\u2019s home in June 2011 constituted actionable contacts for purposes of ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B). The trial court did not err in issuing the SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\"> Respondent subsequently told an investigating officer that he had been \u201ckicked out of DEA\u201d for blowing the whistle on petitioner, whom he continued to claim had stolen money that had been seized during the execution of a search warrant. Petitioner asserted in a legal memorandum to the trial court that respondent was terminated as a result of the dry-firing incidents. The trial court intimated that respondent may have been removed based on unrelated accusations of professional misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\"> Respondent apparently believed that petitioner had something to do with those previous allegations, but petitioner denied having had anything to do with them. A Medford police sergeant later told respondent that petitioner had not been involved with that case. The sergeant also acknowledged to respondent that the previous charges against him had \u201creally gone nowhere\u201d and the sergeant said he could understand why respondent was upset by the way the matter had been handled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\"> At the SPO hearing, respondent denied that he had been yelling at petitioner, and said that he had only been motioning to petitioner to come out of his house. The trial court found to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b778-10\"> By that point, petitioner had married the woman whom respondent had disparaged in December 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\"> During the interview, Sergeant Budreau confirmed that petitioner and his wife were \u201cvery scared of\u201d respondent; he also said that petitioner was \u201cquite afraid.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\"> <em>Delgado </em>involved an SPO issued under ORS 30.866, rather than ORS 163.738, as in this case. However, as the court noted in <em>Delgado, </em>the requirements for obtaining an SPO are identical under both statutes. 334 Or at 132 n 4. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Accordingly, the analysis in that case and others applying ORS 30.866 applies equally here. <em>Blastic v. Holm, </em>248 Or App 414, 422, 273 P3d 304 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b783-10\"> In light of respondent\u2019s concession, we need not address the scope of the \u201cofficial duties\u201d provision in this case, and we express no opinion on that subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
