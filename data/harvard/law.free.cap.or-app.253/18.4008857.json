J.</author>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">In this automobile insurance coverage dispute, defendant, who provided underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage to plaintiff, appeals. The sole substantive issue presented for our consideration is whether, in the particular circumstances of this case \u2014 in which plaintiff was injured in a multiple-collision, three-vehicle incident \u2014 the trial court erred in failing to apply a provision of the UIM policy, limiting defendant\u2019s coverage to $500,000 \u201cfor bodily injury and property damage <em>resulting from any one automobile accident.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We determine that the trial court did so err, and, accordingly, we reverse and remand, with an instruction to apply the $500,000 limit of liability to the judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The material facts are undisputed. On April 16, 2004, plaintiff and her friend Lorenz were traveling together northbound on Interstate 5 from California. As the women entered into Oregon, they encountered a hailstorm on Siskiyou Pass. The hail turned to rain as they descended a steep downgrade. Suddenly, a sedan, driven by Turner, lost control, spun, and collided with the front end of plaintiff\u2019s truck. The two vehicles separated momentarily \u2014 and then collided again \u2014 before both cars came to rest against a center barrier on the highway median, with both vehicles facing downhill and Turner\u2019s sedan \u201ca few feet\u201d in front of plaintiff\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">After the vehicles came to a stop, Lorenz and plaintiff checked on each other. Then Lorenz, who had been driving, attempted to exit the truck; however, she could not open the driver\u2019s door because the truck was positioned against the barrier. Lorenz pulled herself out of the truck through the driver\u2019s window and walked ahead to Turner\u2019s sedan to check on its occupants while plaintiff remained in the truck. Lorenz observed that Turner and his passenger appeared to need medical attention, so she returned to the truck to retrieve her cell phone to call 9-1-1. While standing outside of the truck, Lorenz implored plaintiff not to exit on the passenger\u2019s side because Lorenz feared that plaintiff would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>struck by passing traffic. Lorenz then leaned her head and shoulders into the driver\u2019s window and saw her purse on the floorboard, which she asked plaintiff to reach. Plaintiff unbuckled her seatbelt and, as she leaned over to reach the purse, a sports utility vehicle, driven by Oliver, struck the back of the truck. The rear-end impact pushed the truck into the sedan, causing Lorenz to be dragged forward and knocking plaintiff about the cab of the truck. Lorenz and plaintiff survived and received medical attention in Ashland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">The collisions exacerbated plaintiff\u2019s preexisting spinal degenerative disease and caused emotional distress, for which plaintiff underwent multiple spinal surgeries and therapy. Seeking to recover for her substantial injuries and medical expenses, plaintiff brought an action against Turner and Oliver and sought to collect UIM benefits from defendant to the extent that the other drivers were underinsured. Plaintiff settled with Turner and Oliver, respectively, for a total of $175,000. However, plaintiff and defendant disputed both the amount of plaintiff\u2019s damages as a result of the April 16, 2004, incident and the extent of defendant\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">As pertinent to this dispute, the UIM policy provides that defendant \u201cwill pay damages which the covered person is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of [bodily injury and property damage] sustained by the covered person and caused by an accident.\u201d (Boldface omitted.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The limit of liability provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">\u201cLIMIT OF LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">\u201cA.

The declarations page, in turn, provides, under the heading \u201cCOVERAGES AND LIMITS OF LIABILITY\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">\u201cUNINSURED MOTORISTS BODILY INJURY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-11\">\u201cUNINSURED MOTORISTS PROPERTY DAMAGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-12\">\u201cSINGLE LIMIT EACH ACCIDENT $500,000\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">(Capitalization in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-14\">In her first amended complaint, plaintiff alleged that \u201c[t]he insurance contract provides for a limit of $1,000,000 of coverage for damage or injury caused by an underinsured motorist.\u201d Further, the prayer of that complaint sought \u201cdamages available in underinsured motorist coverage not to exceed $1,000,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-15\">In its answer, defendant admitted plaintiff\u2019s allegation as to coverage limits but denied, <em>inter alia, </em>plaintiff\u2019s allegations as to the extent of her damages and requested a jury trial \u201cto determine the monetary value of plaintiff\u2019s claims.\u201d However, on the first day of trial, during a conference in chambers between the court and counsel before the jury was empanelled, defendant tendered an amended answer to plaintiff\u2019s first amended complaint in which defendant admitted only to \u201c$500,000 of coverage for damage or injury caused by an underinsured motorist.\u201d Plaintiff did not oppose the amendment, and the court allowed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Defendant also moved <em>in limine </em>to prohibit plaintiff</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\">\u201cfrom making any contractual type arguments such as breach of contract, payment of premiums, purchase of benefits, policy limits, or any other contract argument other than identifying this case as a claim which is allowed under the contract in order to resolve a dispute between the parties concerning the amount of damages which plaintiff would have been entitled to recover from [Turner] and [Oliver].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The parties agreed to limit the jury\u2019s role, and the court summarized the pretrial agreement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">\u201cI believe I can fairly state that[, in] our conference in chambers before we began the trial yesterday, there was a consensus that there were so many issues about what the limits were, and how confusing it would be to the jurors to know all these other peripheral issues that we just decided not to make any mention, as you heard me tell the jurors yesterday, not to make any mention of policy limits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\"><em>\u201cWe agree that it\u2019s a contract action because it\u2019s unclear whether under her insurance policy, there will be one coverage, or two; one policy limit, or two policy limits; whether they\u2019re one occurrence </em>\u2014 I\u2019m <em>not even sure what the contract language looks like, but one occurrence or two occurrences; one accident, or two accidents; that we will wait until we see what the verdict looks like, and then we\u2019ll try and sort those issues out.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Both parties generally agreed with the court\u2019s synopsis. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested clarification from the court that plaintiff would not be limited by the policy or the pleading in arguing the amount of damages. Defendant responded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">\u201cif plaintiff is going to contend that there are two policies available, then there will have to be some determination of whether one policy was under-insured, and how much, and whether the other one was under-insured, how much, if [plaintiff\u2019s counsel] intends to split those in order to make two $500,000 claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Plaintiff opposed such a determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\">\u201cI think it\u2019s really too late at this point to change the course, and the whole nature of how the case is going to be tried, to \u2014 and then come in at the last minute and say, \u2018Well, we need to have the jury make a determination between the two accidents.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">\u201c[T]hat hasn\u2019t been pled or argued by the defendant, up to this point. The defendant\u2019s gone along with combining them in \u2014 in one case, and one pleading with regard to both accidents and both injuries \u2014 or, all the injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">\u201cSo, I\u2019m objecting to going down that road. I think it\u2019s impossible for the jury. Certainly it, impossible for the plaintiff at this point, without having some kind of a pleading, or some kind of bifurcation, or something where the issue was raised by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Defendant remonstrated that it was \u201cnot the defendant\u2019s responsibility\u201d to raise the issue of one versus two accidents; rather, it was plaintiff\u2019s burden to establish that two accidents had occurred under the terms of the policy in order to avail herself of two policy limits. Defendant further argued that plaintiff had at least implicitly raised the issue by claiming that defendant\u2019s liability was $1 million \u2014 the sum of two $500,000 policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The court rejected defendant\u2019s request to submit a verdict form that would apportion damages, and the court appeared to defer the issue of one versus two accidents for post-verdict determination. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">\u201cI\u2019m not inclined to make the jury assess which damages are attributable to which injury. And, again, we may be crossing bridges that we don\u2019t even have to worry about crossing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">\u201cSo, for now, *** it\u2019s a one-answer question on the verdict form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">Near the close of trial, after instructing the jury, the court solicited exceptions to the jury instructions and verdict form. Plaintiff did not take any exception. Defendant took exception to the verdict form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201cDefendant has no exceptions to the instructions. I do except to the verdict form *** in view of this argument about whether there are two impacts, and therefore two policy limits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">\u201cAnd if we have come to a juncture where that becomes an issue, I wanted to submit [a verdict form that asks] the jury to assess the economic, and non-economic damages, resulting from the impact involving Mr. Turner, and the impact involving Ms. Oliver, because it may be that one of those [persons is] not under-insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">\u201cAnd so, as a consequence of that, if [the jury] had answered that question, * * * there may be only a minimal amount that would be owing on one policy as opposed to a larger amount on the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">\u201cBut, as the Court knows, the benefits to which the plaintiff is entitled to is limited by the policy limitation amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yeah. And we haven\u2019t even crossed that bridge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And we haven\u2019t crossed that bridge yet, but I believe that that was the plaintiff\u2019s responsibility to establish that circumstance by testimony, and by submitting it to the jury in that fashion, in order to obtain the answer that, in order to make the two-policy argument. And I know the Court said that you weren\u2019t going to do that, and I [except to] the Court\u2019s ruling, and I think that\u2019s on the record, but I want\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">\u201c[THE COURT]: I think so, too.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">The jury returned a verdict in which it determined plaintiff\u2019s total damages to be $979,540, consisting of $750,000 in noneconomic damages and $229,540 in economic damages. Plaintiff then submitted a proposed general judgment, which included a money award of $804,540, reflecting an offset of $175,000 for the settlement payments made by Turner and Oliver. Defendant opposed entry of that judgment. According to defendant, \u201cthe verdict is insufficient to determine [defendant\u2019s] aggregate liability upon which judgment can be entered,\u201d because \u201cthere was no determination by the court regarding whether the events giving rise to plaintiff\u2019s claim constituted a single accident or two accidents under the policy\u201d and \u201cthere was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>determination by a jury to apportion damages attributable to each accident[.]\u201d Defendant argued that, \u201c[i]n light of the undisputed factual circumstances and in light of the policy language,\u201d the court should conclude that there was only one accident under the policy and enter a judgment of $325,000 \u2014 that is in the amount of a single $500,000 limit minus $175,000 to offset the payments by Oliver and Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">In response to defendant\u2019s objection, plaintiff argued that, because \u201c[t]he trial jury was only asked to set an amount of compensation and nothing further,\u201d the trial court should enter a judgment that reflected the amount of the verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The trial court entered plaintiff\u2019s proposed judgment and explained its reasoning in a memorandum opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">\u201cIt was not until a colloquy between the court and counsel that the \u2018meaning\u2019 of defendant\u2019s answer on the amount of coverage became clear (both to plaintiff\u2019s counsel and to the court). I find that defendant\u2019s Answer to First Amended Complaint, filed April 9, 2009, either <em>expressly admitted </em>that the plaintiff had $1,000,000 in coverage or, alternatively, that defendant was <em>estopped from challenging the amount of coverage </em>on the first day of trial. I note that, in both Answers, defendant did not request a jury trial on the number of accidents, the amount of coverage (if that were a jury issue), or any issue <em>other than the \u2018monetary value of plaintiff\u2019s claims.\u2019 </em>And that is exactly what defendant got. Accordingly, the jury\u2019s verdict will be entered as a judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u201c(Although the post-trial pleadings have addressed numerous legal issues, in light of the above finding, I write only to reflect on defendant\u2019s apportionment argument. Were there multiple defendants and/or insurance policies, the issue of apportionment between the accidents would be more important, if not critical. However, in this case, there is only one defendant * * *. Defendant has presented no reason why apportionment was necessary; allocation between the two accidents (the definition of which [is] not found in the policy) is a mere book keeping task. The first policy limit has an offset for the first tortfeasor\u2019s payment; the second policy limit has an offset for the second tortfeasor\u2019s payment. This court has found no persuasive authority that requires a jury to allocate claims when the insured and the insurance company are identical.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">(Third, emphasis in original; first and second emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Defendant appeals from the general judgment. Defendant contends that the trial court erred in entering a judgment on the verdict without applying a single $500,000 per accident policy limit. In that regard, defendant contends, variously, that (a) it was not bound by its original answer because that answer was superseded by the amended answer; (b) it was not estopped from challenging the amount of coverage because \u201cneither the insurer nor the insured can ever be estopped from relying on the terms of the policy to prove or disprove coverage\u201d; and (c) a single policy limit applies because, as a matter of law, only one accident occurred and plaintiff failed to prove otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Defendant further contends that, if we conclude that only one accident occurred, the proper disposition is to reverse the judgment and remand to the trial court for entry of a new judgment that awards plaintiff $500,000 in damages less offsets for payments from the other parties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, and alternatively defendant asserts that, even if we were to conclude that two accidents occurred, the trial court erred in failing to submit a verdict form that apportioned plaintiff\u2019s damages between the two purported accidents; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>thus, in that event, we should remand for a new trial that includes a causal apportionment of plaintiff\u2019s damages as between the two accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Plaintiff does not attempt to defend the trial court\u2019s expressed rationale that defendant\u2019s initial answer to the first amended complaint either represented an enforceable \u201cadmission\u201d of UIM coverage of up to $1 million or gave rise to \u201cestoppel.\u201d Instead, plaintiff argues that defendant failed to preserve the issue of whether one or two accidents occurred, because defendant failed to move for a directed verdict on plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to prove that her damages resulted from two separate accidents. Plaintiff further contends that, even if the issue is preserved, as a matter of law the evidence establishes that two accidents occurred and, thus, two policy limits are available.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">As explained below, we conclude that (1) the \u201cone accident versus two accidents\u201d issue was sufficiently and timely raised for the trial court\u2019s consideration so as to be preserved for appellate review; and (2) on this record, as a matter of law, only one accident occurred. Thus, the trial court erred in failing to apply a single $500,000 coverage limit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">At the outset, we hold that (as plaintiff implicitly recognizes) defendant is not bound by its original answer in which defendant admitted to a $1 million policy limit. The trial court expressly allowed defendant\u2019s amendment, which admitted to a policy limit of $500,000 per accident. Plaintiff did not object to the amendment. Thus, defendant\u2019s original answer had no continuing effect, either by way of admission or judicial estoppel, and the trial court erred in concluding otherwise. <em>See McGanty v. Staudenraus, </em>321 Or 532, 538-39, 901 P2d 841 (1995) (citing <em>Yates v. Large, </em>284 Or 217, 223, 585 P2d 697 (1978)) (a trial court may relieve a party from the effect of an admission in a pleading by allowing amendment of the pleading); <em>see also Venture Properties, Inc. v. Parker, </em>223 Or App 321, 330 n 4, 195 P3d 470 (2008) (\u201cAlthough a statement of fact in a pleading <em>that has not been superseded </em>is a judicial admission that the fact as stated exists, a party that repleads is not so bound.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>As another preliminary matter, we conclude that defendant\u2019s contentions pertaining to the number of accidents \u2014 and the sufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s proof in that regard \u2014 were preserved for our consideration. As we and the Supreme Court have repeatedly emphasized, the touchstone of preservation is that the trial court was afforded a reasonable opportunity to address the contention advanced on appeal. <em>See Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 219-23, 191 P3d 637 (2008). Here, as recounted at length above, that occurred. Specifically: (a) at the outset of trial, defendant raised the question of whether the circumstances established a single \u201caccident\u201d instead of multiple \u201caccidents\u201d and, thus, whether any recovery against defendant should be subject to a single $500,000 coverage limit; (b) the trial court deferred addressing and resolving that matter (\u201c[W]e will wait until we see what the verdict looks like, and then we\u2019ll try and sort those issues out.\u201d); (c) the trial court reiterated that \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach in the context of rejecting defendant\u2019s special verdict form (\u201c[A]gain, we may be crossing bridges that we don\u2019t even have to worry about crossing.\u201d); and, finally, (d) after the jury returned its verdict, the court rejected defendant\u2019s renewed contention, albeit without addressing its substance. Preservation is patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">We proceed to the merits. In doing so, we emphasize, at the outset, that the parties agree that, as framed on this record, the determination of whether plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the result of a single \u201caccident\u201d (as opposed to multiple \u201caccidents\u201d) for UIM coverage purposes is purely legal and does not implicate any material factual dispute. Consequently, that question is properly resolved without the necessity of a remand to determine predicate factual questions pertaining to the circumstances of the April 16, 2004, incident. Ultimately, the resolution turns on the proper construction of the operative policy language\u2014 and, derivatively, on the particular application of that construction to the uncontroverted circumstances of the April 16, 2004, incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In <em>Holloway v. Republic Indemnity Co. of America, </em>341 Or 642, 649-50, 147 P3d 329 (2006), the court summarized the applicable analytical framework:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cInterpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law, and our task is to ascertain the intention of the parties to the insurance policy. We determine the intention of the parties based on the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">\u201cIf an insurance policy explicitly defines the phrase in question, we apply that definition. If the policy does not define the phrase in question, we resort to various aids of interpretation to discern the parties\u2019 intended meaning. Under that interpretive framework, we first consider whether the phrase in question has a plain meaning, i.e., whether it is susceptible to only one plausible interpretation. If the phrase in question has a plain meaning, we will apply that meaning and conduct no further analysis. If the phrase in question has more than one plausible interpretation, we will proceed to the second interpretive aid. That is, we examine the phrase in light of the particular context in which that phrase is used in the policy and the broader context of the policy as a whole. If the ambiguity remains after the court has engaged in those analytical exercises, then any reasonable doubt as to the intended meaning of such a term will be resolved against the insurance company. However, as this court has stated consistently, a term is ambiguous <em>only </em>if two or more plausible interpretations of that term withstand scrutiny, i.e., continue to be reasonable, despite our resort to the interpretive aids outlined above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">341 Or at 649-50 (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Significantly, although case law addressing the meaning of similar or analogous policy language <em>can </em>be informative, the utility of such decisional law (especially that of other jurisdictions) is highly variable and, in the final analysis, pertinent and persuasive only to the extent that it comports with the referent text and context. <em>Interstate Fire v. Archdiocese of Portland, </em>318 Or 110, 117, 864 P2d 346 (1993); <em>see also id. </em>at 117 n 6 (\u201cCase law and other authorities *** are no substitute for a thorough examination of the policy in the first instance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">We apply the foregoing interpretive framework to the phrase \u201cany one automobile accident.\u201d The policy does not include a definition of \u201caccident\u201d or \u201cany one automobile accident.\u201d That is unsurprising because, as the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Court observed in <em>Botts v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indent. Co., </em>284 Or 95, 103, 585 P2d 657 (1978), \u201c[t]here is no such thing\u201d as \u201cone all-encompassing definition of \u2018accident\u2019 which accommodates all circumstances.\u201d Thus, the term must be analyzed with regard to the \u201cparticular factual circumstances in which the meaning of the terms is brought into question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102. Consequently, we examine the operative language in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">As noted, defendant agreed to \u201cpay damages which [plaintiff] is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of [bodily injury and property damage] sustained by [plaintiff] and caused by an accident.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The liability limitation provision, again, provides that a single $500,000 limit is defendant\u2019s \u201cmaximum limit of liability for all damages for bodily injury and property damage <em>resulting from any one automobile </em>accident.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Significantly, that provision continues with the following qualification: \u201cThis is the most we will pay <em>regardless of the number of*** [vjehicles involved in the accident.\u201d </em>(Boldface omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Given that qualifying language, it is patent that the parties contemplated and understood that \u201cany one automobile accident\u201d <em>could </em>involve multiple other vehicles (besides the insured\u2019s vehicle) \u2014 and, hence, could involve multiple potentially tortious impacts. Bluntly, \u201cany one automobile accident,\u201d implicating only a single limit of liability, can involve multiple vehicles, multiple collisions, and (again, potentially) multiple underinsured motorist tortfeasors. That abstract, contextually compelled premise is, however, hardly conclusive. The mere fact that \u201cone automobile accident\u201d <em>can </em>involve multiple vehicles and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>multiple collisions \u2014 that is, that <em>some </em>single accidents can involve such circumstances \u2014 does not mean, logically or practically, that <em>all </em>events involving multiple vehicles colliding with the insured\u2019s vehicle constitute only \u201cone automobile accident\u201d (triggering only one coverage limit).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The policy\u2019s text in context offers no further guidance on resolving that <em>question </em>\u2014 viz., in what circumstances do incidents involving multiple vehicles colliding with the insured\u2019s vehicle constitute multiple accidents rather than \u201cany one accident\u201d? \u2014 on which the coverage determination depends. Accordingly, we turn, finally and unavoidably, to decisional law for assistance in construing the critical language. <em>Interstate Fire, </em>318 Or at 117. Ultimately, as we will explain, we find the reasoning of <em>United Servs. Auto Ass\u2019n v. Baggett, </em>209 Cal App 3d 1387 (1989), to be persuasive and adopt that construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><em>Baggett </em>involved very similar circumstances\u2014 the plaintiffs\u2019 decedent was killed in an incident involving two successive collisions by different vehicles \u2014 and the construction and application of almost identical language, albeit with respect to liability, not UIM, coverage. There, a vehicle operated by a driver insured under the disputed liability policy, struck the decedent\u2019s vehicle from behind on a freeway. 209 Cal App 3d at 1390. The decedent and the (liability) insured driver drove a short distance and then parked in the median to discuss the collision. <em>Id. </em>The decedent and insured driver stood outside of their vehicles talking and, within a minute, a third vehicle struck the insured\u2019s vehicle from behind, pushing it into the decedent and her vehicle, killing the decedent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The decedent\u2019s heirs filed an action against the insured for wrongful death and property damages. <em>Id. </em>at 1389. The insured\u2019s liability coverage included limits of $100,000 \u201cfor all damages for bodily injury sustained by any one person in <em>any one auto accident\u201d </em>and $300,000 \u201cfor all damages for bodily injury resulting from <em>any one auto accident\u201d Id. </em>at 1390 (emphasis added). The policy further provided (like the UIM coverage here) that those limits applied \u201cregardless of the number of * * * vehicles involved in the auto accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The parties disputed whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the circumstances that resulted in the decedent\u2019s death constituted one \u201caccident\u201d or two, which would implicate multiple limits under the liability coverage. Specifically, the decedent\u2019s heirs contended that the insured had (1) caused the initial collision (the purported \u201cfirst accident\u201d) by his negligent driving and (2) also tortiously contributed to/caused the subsequent collision (the purported \u201csecond accident\u201d) by negligently failing to, e.g., undertake warning measures and \u201cdirect [ ] traffic around the stopped vehicles\u201d after the initial collision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">The liability insurer filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking resolution of that coverage dispute, and the trial court, by summary judgment, resolved that question in the insurer\u2019s favor, concluding that only one \u201caccident\u201d had occurred and, thus, only one policy limit applied. <em>Id. </em>at 1391.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The Court of Appeal affirmed. In doing so, the court noted contextually (as we have here) the policy\u2019s provision that the limits of liability for \u201cany one auto accident\u201d applied regardless of the number of claims made or vehicles involved \u2014 and reasoned, consequently, that \u201c[t]he policy thus contemplates one accident involving several vehicles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1394. The court also reviewed cases from California and other jurisdictions in which courts had interpreted similar policy limitations and summarized their reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">\u201c[A] single uninterrupted course of conduct which gives rise to a number of injuries or incidents of property damage is one \u2018accident\u2019 or \u2018occurrence.\u2019 On the other hand, if the original cause is interrupted or replaced by another cause, there is more than one \u2018accident\u2019 or \u2018occurrence.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1393 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The court acknowledged that many of the decisions that it had canvassed could be characterized as \u201cinvolving simply one negligent act of driving by the [liability] insured,\u201d whereas the underlying circumstances in <em>Baggett </em>involved \u201ctwo negligent acts by [the] insured,\u201d each causing a separate collision. <em>Id. </em>at 1394. Nevertheless, the court rejected the categorical proposition that separate negligent acts necessarily result in separate \u201caccidents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1395. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Rather, \u201c[i]f cause and result are so simultaneous or so closely linked in time and space as to be considered by the average person as one event, courts adopting the cause analysis uniformly find a single occurrence or accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1394 (internal quotation marks omitted). Consistently with that premise, the court ultimately concluded that \u201cthe insurance policy provisions limiting maximum liability \u2018for any one auto accident\u2019 unambiguously contemplate two consecutive collisions as occurred here to be one accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">We do not understand plaintiff here to ultimately dispute the abstract correctness of the proximate cause-driven construct of \u201cany one accident\u201d as expressed in <em>Baggett, </em>specifically including its proviso as to the spatial and temporal proximity of the initial and subsequent impacts involving separate vehicles. Rather, plaintiff contends that the proper <em>application </em>of that construct here compels the conclusion that plaintiff was injured as the result of two accidents, not one.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In that regard, plaintiff particularly invokes <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Rawls, </em>404 F2d 880 (5th Cir 1968), and <em>Illinois National Insurance Co. v. Szczepkowicz, </em>542 NE 2d 90 (Ill App 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In <em>Rawls, </em>the insured driver, who was driving northbound on a highway at high speeds attempting to elude the police, collided with the rear of a northbound automobile, \u201cknocking] it off the highway.\u201d 404 F2d at 880. The insured driver then continued northward, veered across the center lane, and collided head-on with a southbound vehicle. The tortfeasor driver\u2019s liability insurance policy provided that $20,000 was \u201c\u2018the total limit of the company\u2019s liability *** as the result of any one accident.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>The insurance company settled with the occupants of the second car for $20,000, and, in subsequent litigation against the insured, the occupants of the first car contended that that settlement had not exhausted coverage limits because there had been two accidents, not one. <em>Id. </em>The district court, on stipulated facts and by way of summary judgment, concluded that there had been two accidents. <em>Id. </em>The Fifth Circuit affirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u201cAccording to the agreed facts, the impact between the [insured] automobile and the Rawls automobile was separated from the impact between the [insured] automobile and the Davis automobile by both time and distance. These impacts occurred 2 to 5 seconds apart and 30 to 300 feet apart. There were two distinct collisions, or more than a single sudden collision. There is no evidence that the [insured] automobile went out of control after striking the rear end of [Rawls\u2019s] automobile. On the contrary, the only reasonable inference is that [insured] had control of his vehicle after the initial collision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Accordingly, \u201cthere were, in law, two accidents.\u201d Id. at 881.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In <em>Szczepkowicz, </em>another declaratory judgment action, the insured truck driver had attempted, in foggy conditions, to cross over the median of a four-lane highway. 542 NE 2d at 91. The insured driver stopped with the rear portion of the driver\u2019s tractor-trailer in the northbound traffic lanes, and a northbound vehicle collided with the rear of the trailer. <em>Id. </em>The insured truck driver then \u201cmoved forward approximately 12 feet \u2018almost immediately\u2019 after the collision, and then stopped again\u201d; however, the trailer continued to block the northbound lanes. Five minutes later, another northbound vehicle collided with the trailer. <em>Id. </em>The occupants of both vehicles sought to recover for their injuries, implicating the liability policy\u2019s coverage limits of $300,000 for one accident. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The trial court, on summary judgment, concluded that there had been two accidents. <em>Id. </em>at 91. The appellate court, adopting the same (proximate) \u201ccause theory\u201d as in <em>Baggett, </em>observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cCourts applying the cause theory uniformly find a single accident if cause and result are so simultaneous or so closely linked in time and space as to be considered by the average person as one event.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 92 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court then canvassed case law from other states and noted that, generally, two accidents occur where collisions are separated by time and distance <em>and </em>the cause of the subsequent collision is distinct; conversely, only one accident occurs where separate collisions are \u201calmost instantaneously\u201d <em>and </em>the subsequent impact was caused by the first impact. <em>Id. </em>at 93. Applying the cause theory, the court concluded that two accidents had occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Here, plaintiff argues that, as a matter of law under the reasoning in <em>Rawls </em>and <em>Szczepkowicz, </em>two accidents occurred in this case because the evidence establishes that the initial collision with the first vehicle (driven by Turner), which caused the UIM-insured vehicle to come to rest against the center barrier, and the subsequent collision with the second vehicle (driven by Oliver), while plaintiff was still in the insured vehicle, were \u201cseparated by time and space\u201d and because the driver (Lorenz) resumed control of the UIM-insured vehicle during the interval between the impacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">On this record, we respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In that regard, we emphasize two overarching and, ultimately, dispositive considerations. The first is the proper allocation of the burden of production and persuasion as to establishing coverage \u2014 and specifically, the availability of coverage for multiple \u201caccidents.\u201d Because, \u201c[u]nder Oregon law, the initial burden of proving coverage is on the insured [,]\u201d <em>Employers Insurance of Wausau v. Tektronix, Inc., </em>211 Or App 485, 509, 156 P3d 105, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 363 (2007), plaintiff had the burden of presentation and persuasion as to whether there were two accidents, instead of one.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, plaintiff had the burden of adducing proof sufficient to substantiate a determination that the two collisions arose from distinct causation \u2014 that is, the latter was not merely proximately derivative of the causation of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Second, and equally critical, is the idiosyncratic posture of this case. Plaintiff does not contend that, given the trial court\u2019s erroneous rationale for failing to entertain the merits of the \u201cone accident versus two\u201d issue, a remand is required, or even would be appropriate, for the presentation (for the trial court\u2019s initial consideration) of further evidence pertaining to that question or for the resolution of any possible disputed issue of fact. Indeed, as noted, <em>see </em>253 Or App at 26 n 4, plaintiff has, on appeal, explicitly disavowed such a disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Thus, in the hackneyed, but here apt, phrase, the record \u201cis what it is.\u201d And plaintiff, as the party with the burden of presentation and persuasion with respect to establishing the availability of coverage for two accidents instead of one, was obligated at least to adduce <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the second collision was not merely proximately derivative of the causation of the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Plaintiff failed to meet that <em>prima facie </em>burden. That is so because the record is completely devoid of any evidence regarding the cause of the second collision. The record reveals only that the plaintiff\u2019s truck came to rest pinned against a barrier on the center median and that Lorenz was concerned that, if plaintiff got out on the passenger side, she might be injured by passing traffic. No evidence reveals what caused the second vehicle to collide with plaintiff\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Further, to the extent that (as recognized in <em>Baggett </em>and other decisions) distinct causation can be circumstantially inferred from substantial temporal or spatial attenuation of the separate collisions, the record here was legally insufficient to support such an inference. The time between the two successive collisions was brief\u2014 almost certainly akin to the time in <em>Baggett </em>\u2014 and the record does not disclose the distance between the points of impact. On this record, any inference as to the causal dynamics of the second collision would be impermissibly speculative.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>In sum, this limited record is insufficient to support a determination of multiple \u201caccidents\u201d for purposes of UIM coverage. Accordingly, the trial court erred in failing to apply a single policy limit of $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Reversed and remanded with instruction to apply $500,000 limit of liability to judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\"> Plaintiff raises a threshold objection of nonpreservation but, as explained below, 252 Or App at 29, we reject that challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\"> The facts are derived from Lorenz\u2019s testimony, which is the only direct account of the April 16,2004, incident in the record. At trial, plaintiff testified that she did not \u201cremember all aspects of what happened in [the] accident,\u201d in part, because she was unconscious \u201cfor at least some period with each collision.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b41-10\"> Although the pertinent policy section is titled \u201cuninsured motorist coverage,\u201d and the quoted provision refers to \u201can uninsured motor vehicle,\u201d the policy provides underinsured motorist coverage. <em>See </em>ORS 742.502(2)(a) (\u201cUnderinsurance coverage shall be equal to uninsured motorist coverage less the amount recovered from other motor vehicle liability insurance policies.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\"> At that stage, plaintiff argued that \u201cthe number of accidents is <em>an issue of fact\u201d </em>and that \u201c[i]f the court concludes that it cannot direct a verdict, then factual findings need to be made before the court can apply its interpretation of the policy and make a determination regarding the number of \u2018accidents\u2019 that occurred.\u201d (Emphasis added.) On appeal, however, plaintiff takes a qualitatively different <em>position </em>\u2014 viz., that the number of accidents is a question of law. Plaintiff no longer contends that further factual findings are necessary to decide the issue. At oral argument before this court, plaintiff\u2019s counsel opened by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">\u201cI agree with [defense counsel] that the two accident issue is a matter of law. It is interpretation of an insurance policy: What does an insurance policy mean? <em>There are facts in the record already that you can make that determination on.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adn\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\"> In other words, if we conclude that a single policy limit applies, because there was only \u201cone automobile accident,\u201d defendant does not request a new trial for damages to be apportioned between the two <em>collisions.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b48-7\"> Given that conclusion, we have no occasion to address the parties\u2019 dueling contentions regarding putative apportionment in the event of two accidents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b51-6\"> In the context of insurance policies covering property damage \u201ccaused by accident,\u201d the Supreme Court has explained that \u201can \u2018accident\u2019 is an incident or occurrence that happened by chance, without design and contrary to intention and expectation.\u201d <em>St. Paul Fire v. McCormick &amp; Baxter Creosoting, </em>324 Or 184, 206, 923 P2d 1200 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although that broad definition of \u201caccident\u201d informs the understanding of the general nature of any automobile \u201caccident\u201d \u2014 that is, what distinguishes an \u201caccident\u201d from a \u201cnon-accident\u201d \u2014 it is of little assistance in determining what distinguishes a single accident from multiple accidents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\"> Again, as noted, the policy\u2019s declarations page provides that the \u201cCOVERAGE[] AND LIABILITY LIMIT[]\u201d for the UIM policy is a \u201cSINGLE LIMIT\u201d for \u201cEACH ACCIDENT\u201d of $500,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b54-6\"> Indeed, plaintiff contends that the court <em>inBaggett </em>itself erred in its particular application of that formulation given that (in plaintiff\u2019s characterization) the two collisions in <em>Baggett </em>were \u201cseparated by a significant period of time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b55-8\"> The court explained that the trial court could have reached the same conclusion under either the \u201ccausation theory,\u201d under which the court circumscribes an accident \u201cfrom the standpoint of conduct forming the causative act,\u201d or under the \u201ceffect theory,\u201d under which the court makes that determination \u201cfrom the point of view of a person sustaining injury.\u201d 404 F2d at 881.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b56-7\"> Plaintiff does not contradict the allocation of that burden. Indeed, at oral argument we inquired, \u201cUltimately, is it the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof to demonstrate two accidents instead of one in this case?\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel responded, \u2018Yes, Your Honor, I think it would be.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\"> Finally, as noted, plaintiff posits that the fact that Lorenz retained (or at least regained) control of the UIM-insured vehicle between the collisions is probative of whether two accidents occurred. <em>See </em>253 Or App at 36. That contention, predicated on <em>Rawls </em>and <em>Szczepkowicz, </em>is unavailing here. In both of those cases, the insured driver\u2019s continued control of his vehicle indicated that the first collision did not cause the second collision. Here, in material contrast, plaintiff was a passenger in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>a vehicle that was struck by two different vehicles. Lorenz\u2019s control of the truck in which plaintiff was injured had no bearing on the causal connection (or lack thereof) between the collision with Turner and the collision with Oliver.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
