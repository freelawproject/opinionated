Defendant contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) the trial court erred in allowing plaintiff\u2019s two expert witnesses to provide opinion testimony regarding plaintiff\u2019s credibility and (2) the admission of the experts\u2019 diagnoses that plaintiff had been sexually abused, in the absence of physical findings, constituted plain error under <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), and <em>State v. Jury, </em>185 Or App 132, 136, 57 P3d 970 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 504 (2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court did so err and, accordingly, reverse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">We state the facts necessary to provide context for the testimony at issue on appeal. In 2008, when she was 24, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant, alleging that he had subjected her to sexual and physical abuse when she was between the ages of 11 and 14. Defendant had been married to plaintiff\u2019s mother during the time of the alleged misconduct. Plaintiff alleged, among other things, that defendant would dress himself in women\u2019s clothing\u2014 including, particularly, nylon stockings \u2014 and sometimes, while so clothed, defendant would \u201cplay\u201d with plaintiff by tying her up and encouraging her to try to escape. Plaintiff further alleged that, during the episodes when plaintiff was restrained, defendant would sometimes straddle her and make a \u201crocking motion\u201d while on top of her. Plaintiff also alleged that defendant encouraged her to wear nylons and, when she did, he would rub her legs. Defendant categorically denied all allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Defendant moved <em>in limine </em>to prohibit \u201cany mention, evidence, argument or other reference *** [t]hat Plaintiff\u2019s expert witness has determined\u201d that \u201cany fact alleged by Plaintiff in her Complaint to be true.\u201d Defendant supported the motion \u201cupon the ground that the information is irrelevant, and/or usurps the prerogative of the trier of the facts.\u201d The court denied defendant\u2019s motion and ruled that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u201cso long as the Plaintiff! ] establish [es] a proper foundation for the testimony, the witness will be entitled to offer her opinions on those issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">Plaintiff testified at trial regarding the above-outlined allegations. Plaintiff also provided testimony from two expert witnesses, plaintiff\u2019s mental health counselor, Dawn Hill, and Dr. Cynthia Steinhauser, who had administered a psychosexual evaluation of plaintiff. Plaintiff did not produce any physical evidence of the alleged abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Critical to our analysis and disposition is Hill\u2019s testimony that, in her expert opinion, plaintiff was credible and, based on that determination, she had diagnosed plaintiff as being a victim of childhood sexual abuse. Specifically, Hill testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-6\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Based upon your education, your training, your experience as a licensed professional counselor and therapist, and more importantly, based upon your time with [plaintiff], do you have an opinion, to a reasonable degree of probability, as a licensed professional counselor, of whether [plaintiff] is a victim of childhood sex abuse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-7\">\u201c[HILL]: Yes, I do. I believe she is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-8\">\u201c [PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Is there any doubt about that in your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-9\">\u201c[HILL]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-10\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: During your 37 visits with [plaintiff], did you get any indication that [plaintiff] is a malingerer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-11\">\u201c[HILL]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-12\">\u201c [PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: That she is hallucinating?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-13\">\u201c[HILL]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-14\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: That she has delusions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-15\">\u201c[HILL]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-16\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did you find the events that she chronicled to you over 37 visits to be consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>with what you have seen in your experience the victims of childhood sex abuse go through?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-4\">\u201c[HILL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-5\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: And with regard to her symptoms and the diagnosis, which we will get to in just a minute that you made of [plaintiff], is your diagnosis and her symptoms consistent with victims of childhood sex abuse, based upon your experience?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-7\">\u201c[HILL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-8\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Leading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-10\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-11\">\u201c [PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Given that you made the diagnosis that [plaintiff is] a victim of childhood sex abuse, given that you\u2019ve made the diagnosis that she suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome, do you have an opinion, as her treating counselor, as to the cause of her post-traumatic stress syndrome?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-12\">\u201c[HILL]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-13\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: What is that opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-14\">\u201c[HILL]: Childhood sex abuse over a three-year period [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-15\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-16\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: You testified earlier you made the diagnosis that [plaintiff] is a victim of childhood sex abuse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-17\">\u201c[HILL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-18\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: In order to make that diagnosis, did you happen to determine whether she was an accurate reporter\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-19\">\u201c[HILL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-20\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u2014of what happened to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-21\">[HILL]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>&lt;(* </em>* * ^ <em>Hi</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-4\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: And in treating [plaintiff], did you see, Counselor Hill, one scintilla, one shred of evidence that would indicate she\u2019s malingering, or to use your phrase, [\u2018[making it up?[\u2019]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">\u201c[HILL]: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-6\">Later, on cross-examination, Hill testified, \u201cIn my education and experience over time, and based on my experience over ten years, I believe [plaintiff] to be credible.\u201d On redirect, plaintiff\u2019s counsel again asked Hill for her opinion regarding plaintiff\u2019s credibility:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-7\">\u201c [PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: You\u2019ve been treating and dealing with people like [plaintiff] for ten years.

And so based on that, * * * I believe that she has reported the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-13\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: And if you thought she was a liar, would you spend 37 hours with her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-14\">\u201c[HILL]: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s second expert witness, Steinhauser, echoed Hill\u2019s testimony in the following exchange:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-16\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: And what [plaintiff] told you what happened to her, in your opinion, is that sex abuse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-17\">[STEINHAUSER]: Absolutely. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u2021 \u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-4\">\u201c [PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did you reach a diagnosis as to [plaintiff\u2019s] conditions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-5\">\u201c[STEINHAUSER]: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: To a reasonable degree of probability, as a licensed professional counselor, what is your diagnosis of [plaintiff]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-7\">\u201c[STEINHAUSER]: First, sexual abuse of a child. Two, physical abuse of a child. And three, post-traumatic stress syndrome, chronic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Further, on cross-examination, Steinhauser testified, \u201cI believe that all of the evidence suggests that the events did occur as [plaintiff! described them.\u201d On redirect, Steinhauser again commented on plaintiff\u2019s credibility and further suggested that defendant was less likely to be credible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-9\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: And finally, in your opinion, as you testified on cross-examination, the events, as described by [plaintiff], the abuse she described, is it more likely than not absolutely true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\">\u201c [STEINHAUSER]: Absolutely true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-11\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Any doubt in your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-12\">\u201c[STEINHAUSER]: None whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-13\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Based on 30 years of experience?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-14\">\u201c[STEINHAUSER]: Thirty-three [sic] experience.

You\u2019re done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-22\">\u201c[STEINHAUSER]: I really don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Well, you can now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">\u201c[STEINHAUSER]: Okay. What I was going to say is, what\u2019s more likely is that an alleged perpetrator is going to lie about the abuse, rather than a victim \u2014 alleged victim lie about \u2014 or fabricate a story of abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">No physical evidence substantiated or corroborated plaintiff\u2019s allegations of abuse or Hill\u2019s and Steinhauser\u2019s diagnoses of physical and sexual abuse. Nor did plaintiff adduce testimony from any eyewitness to the purported abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Defendant testified as the only witness for the defense and flatly denied all of plaintiff\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff, which included a money award of $52,960 in economic damages and $1.5 million in noneconomic compensatory damages. The jury further determined that plaintiff was entitled to recover punitive damages, and the court awarded plaintiff an additional $3 million in punitive damages. The trial court entered a general judgment against defendant. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Defendant contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) the trial court erred in allowing plaintiff\u2019s two expert witnesses to provide opinion testimony regarding plaintiff\u2019s credibility, and (2) the admission of the experts\u2019 diagnoses that plaintiff had been sexually abused, in the absence of physical findings, constituted plain error under <em>Southard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">On appeal, in support of his first assignment of error, defendant relies on <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 657 P2d 1215 (1983), <em>State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 756 P2d 620 (1988), \u201cand their progeny,\u201d for the proposition that \u201cblatant and repeated vouching for Plaintiff\u2019s credibility by her expert witnesses [is] reversible error.\u201d With respect to that assignment of error, defendant argues that his pretrial motion \u201cfunctions as [an] objection sufficient to preserve error, even absent objection during trial.\u201d Defendant argues, in the alternative, that, even if we decide that his motion <em>in limine </em>was insufficient to preserve that issue for appeal, the error is apparent on the face of the record and we should exercise our discretion to consider and correct the error. With respect to his Southard-based assignment of error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>defendant acknowledges that his appellate contention was unpreserved, but he invokes plain error and urges that we exercise our discretion to consider and correct that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Plaintiff remonstrates that defendant\u2019s assignments of error are unpreserved and, in all events, do not establish error, much less plain error. We address plaintiff\u2019s substantive responses in detail later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">As an initial matter, we agree with plaintiff that defendant failed to preserve the issues that he raises on appeal. Defendant\u2019s amorphous motion <em>in limine </em>did not alert the court to any specific objection, and defense counsel failed to contemporaneously object to the admission of the vouching testimony or sexual abuse diagnoses at trial. Nevertheless, for the reasons explained below, we conclude that the court plainly erred in allowing the two expert witnesses to comment on plaintiff\u2019s credibility. Moreover, the trial court also plainly erred in allowing those same experts to provide diagnoses of child sexual abuse in the absence of corroborating physical evidence of such abuse. We further determine that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to review and correct the trial court\u2019s errors in those respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The exercise of our discretion to review and correct unpreserved error is a two-step process. We must first determine whether the asserted error is an \u201cerror of law apparent on the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45. In <em>Jury, </em>we explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">\u201c[f]or error to be considered apparent on the face of the record for purposes of ORAP 5.45, it must satisfy three criteria: (1) it must be legal error; (2) it must be \u2018apparent,\u2019 such that \u2018the legal point is obvious, not reasonably in dispute\u2019; and (3) it must appear on the face of the record, such that we \u2018need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it, and the facts that comprise the error are irrefutable.\u2019 <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">185 Or App at 135. We further explained that \u201c\u2018error apparent\u2019 must be determined by reference to the law as of the time the appeal is decided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136. If we conclude that the asserted error is plain, then, in the second step, we must determine whether to exercise our discretion to correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>it. In making that determination, we consider, among other factors,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-4\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way ***.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-5\"><em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">We first examine whether the trial court erred in admitting the testimony by both Hill and Steinhauser explicitly stating their opinions that plaintiff was truthful in her accounts of the alleged abuse. Defendant\u2019s position ultimately rests on the premise that, notwithstanding the absence of a contemporaneous objection, the trial court was nonetheless required, <em>sua sponte, </em>to cut off or strike the vouching testimony. Although \u201cthe universe of circumstances in which a trial court is compelled to act, in the absence of a motion or objection by a party, is extremely limited,\u201d <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>250 Or App 516, 531, 280 P3d 1046 (2012) (Haselton, C. J., concurring in part, dissenting in part), the circumstances here fall within that \u201cextremely limited\u201d universe. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The principle that a witness may not comment on the credibility of another witness is \u201cobvious, and not reasonably in dispute.\u201d In <em>Middleton, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">\u201cWe expressly hold that in Oregon a witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth. We reject testimony from a witness about the credibility of another witness [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">294 Or at 438. In <em>Milbradt, </em>the Supreme Court emphatically reiterated that clear proscription:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-10\">\u201cWe have said before, and we will say it again, but this time with emphasis \u2014 we really mean <em>it </em>\u2014 no <em>psychotherapist may render an opinion on whether a witness is credible in any trial conducted in this state. </em>The assessment of credibility is for the trier of fact and not for psychotherapists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">305 Or at 629 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Further, the trial court has an independent obligation to preclude or strike such testimony. The <em>Milbradt </em>court initially \u201csuggested\u201d that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-4\">\u201cif counsel attempts to elicit similar testimony the trial judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>should summarily cut off the inquiry before a jury is contaminated by it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 630. Thereafter, in <em>State v. McQuisten, </em>97 Or App 517, 776 P2d 1304 (1989), we, citing <em>Milbradt, </em>held that \u201cthe trial court had a duty, <em>sua sponte, </em>not to allow testimony which commented on a witnesses] credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520 (citing <em>Milbradt, </em>305 Or at 629-30); <em>see also State v. Lowell, </em>249 Or App 364, 366-70, 277 P3d 588, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 378 (2012) (holding that the trial court committed plain error by allowing an investigating detective to testify that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think that [the defendant] was being very honest\u201d during his interview).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Most recently, we reaffirmed and enforced that principle under circumstances that are similar to those here. In <em>State v. Hollywood, </em>250 Or App 675, 282 P3d 944 (2012), the defendant had allegedly sexually abused a nine-year-old girl, S. D. There was no physical evidence of sexual abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 676. At trial, in explaining her diagnosis that S. D. had been sexually abused, a CARES evaluator and pediatric nurse practitioner, Reilly, testified that S. D. \u201chad difficulty with timing in sequence in recounting the abuse but that \u2018doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s lying about something, she\u2019s just not capable of framing it in that context.\u2019\u201d Id Reilly also testified that S. D. \u201cdoes not have a problem with lying,\u201d that S. D. was \u201cvery consistent\u201d in recounting details of the alleged abuse, and that, in Reilly\u2019s opinion, \u201cthere is no lying going on about what she\u2019s telling us in this evaluation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677. The defendant\u2019s counsel did not object to that vouching testimony, and the trial court did not, <em>sua sponte, </em>strike it. <em>Id. </em>The jury convicted defendant of one count of first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sexual abuse of a child. <em>Id. </em>at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">On appeal, the defendant contended that it was plain error for the trial court to have admitted Reilly\u2019s vouching testimony under <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 234 P3d 117 (2010). We agreed. <em>Hollywood, </em>250 Or App at 678-79 (citing <em>Milbradt, </em>305 Or at 630; <em>McQuisten, </em>97 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>App at 520). In deciding to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion to correct the error, we explained that \u201cthe harm in this case was significant; because there was no physical evidence of sexual abuse, the credibility of S. D.\u2019s allegations was at the heart of the state\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The operative legal principles consistently reiterated over nearly 30 years, from <em>Middleton </em>and <em>Milbradt </em>through <em>Hollywood, </em>are patent and beyond reasonable dispute: It is legally impermissible under Oregon law for a witness to comment on the credibility of another witness, and, in enforcing that principle, trial courts are obligated, <em>sua sponte, </em>to exclude and, if necessary, strike testimony that comments on a witness\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Further, the applicability and correct application of those principles in this case are beyond reasonable dispute and do not require us to \u201cgo outside the record or choose between competing inferences.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355. Rather, as the extended excerpts of Hill\u2019s and Steinhauser\u2019s testimony set out above disclose, that testimony <em>{e.g., </em>\u201cDo you have any shred of concern, any doubt in your mind whatsoever, that what [plaintiff] told you is the absolute truth? *** I have no doubt\u201d; \u201c[W]hat\u2019s more likely is that an alleged perpetrator is going to lie about the abuse, rather than a victim \u2014 alleged victim lie about \u2014 or fabricate a story of abuse\u201d) partakes of explicit vouching for plaintiff\u2019s credibility. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of a more blatant and pervasive violation of the <em>Middleton! Milbradt </em>proscription. <em>Cf. State v. Remme, </em>173 Or App 546, 558, 23 P3d 374 (2001) (explaining that \u201cit is one thing to educate the jury about an unusual phenomenon bearing on credibility, but it [is] quite another to \u2018connect the dots\u2019 explicitly by eliciting testimony relating that phenomenon\u2019s specific application to a particular witness\u2019s testimony\u201d and \u201c[a]t least the last \u2018dot\u2019 must be left \u2018unconnected\u2019\u201d). The trial court plainly erred in failing to act to preclude that testimony or, at least once elicited, to strike the testimony and take appropriate measures, including by admonition, to prevent its recurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">We turn then to whether this is an appropriate case in which to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion. Here, as in similar or analogous cases, the gravity and centrality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the error militates decisively in favor of correction of the error. Here, as noted, the vouching was egregious: Hill and Steinhauser emphatically and repeatedly offered their respective opinions that plaintiff was truthful in her accounts of the alleged abuse. <em>See </em>253 Or App at 4-8. Those comments on plaintiff\u2019s credibility were especially potentially prejudicial because, given the lack of physical evidence of abuse and the absence of eyewitness testimony, this case reduced to a classic swearing contest, with the outcome depending very substantially, perhaps exclusively, on the jury\u2019s determination of the parties\u2019 relative credibility. Indeed, because Hill and Steinhauser testified as expert witnesses, their opinions may well have carried special weight with the jury. <em>See, e.g., Lowell, </em>249 Or App at 370 (explaining that, where the case \u201cboiled down *** to a credibility contest between the complainant and defendant, evidence commenting on the credibility of either was likely to be harmful,\u201d especially where that testimony was \u201ccouched in terms of [the witness\u2019s] expertise in identifying untruthfulness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The erroneous admission of the vouching testimony is, alone, sufficient to require reversal and remand. If, however, there could be any doubt as to the necessity of a new trial, the erroneous admission of the expert diagnoses of sexual abuse buttresses the correctness of our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">As noted, defendant contends that admission of Hill\u2019s and Steinhauser\u2019s expert diagnoses of sexual abuse constituted plain error under <em>Southard, </em>where the Supreme Court held that a diagnosis of sexual abuse is not admissible under OEC 403 because the \u201cmarginal\u201d probative value of the diagnosis is outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant. 347 Or at 140-42. Further, <em>in Lupoli, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that, where an alleged victim makes claims of sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence of the alleged abuse, a sexual abuse diagnosis is \u201cbased ultimately and only\u201d on whether the witness who provides the diagnosis believes the alleged victim\u2019s report of the alleged abuse. 348 Or at 361. Thus, in those circumstances, as here, vouching testimony and a diagnosis of sexual abuse are inextricably related. We acknowledged that reality in <em>Hollywood </em>when we held that the harm of admitting the vouching testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>in that case was \u201csignificant; because there was no physical evidence of sexual abuse, the credibility of [the alleged victim\u2019s] allegations was at the heart of the state\u2019s case.\u201d 250 Or App at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Plaintiff contends, nevertheless, that there was no error here, much less plain error under <em>Southard </em>(and, by necessary implication, <em>Lupoli), </em>because those cases arose in the criminal context and have not been extended to civil litigation. In a related sense, plaintiff asserts that, given differences between the criminal and civil contexts, the extension of <em>Southard </em>(and <em>Lupoli) </em>to the latter is subject to reasonable dispute, precluding plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">We understand plaintiff\u2019s position in those respects to rest on several propositions, some of which are interrelated, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\"><em>First, </em>plaintiff posits that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">\u201ccivil cases and criminal cases are different in major respects. Most importantly, criminal defendants are protected by Constitutional guarantees that are inapplicable in civil cases. Simply put, a civil defendant is not going to jail if he loses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">In a related sense, according to plaintiff, \u201cin a civil case, [diagnostic] testimony is not unfairly prejudicial to defendant because the stakes are not as high as in a criminal case and Constitutional rights do not come into play.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\"><em>Second, </em>plaintiff contends, because a proponent is subject to different standards of proof in criminal and civil cases, the same testimony carries different evidentiary weight in the two contexts \u2014 and is <em>less </em>likely to affect the outcome in a civil case than in a criminal case. Specifically, in plaintiff\u2019s view,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">\u201cin a criminal case where guilt has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, each piece of evidence bears more of the relative weight of the case. In contrast, in a civil case with redundant evidence in the record, quite a bit of evidence could be seen as surplusage \u2014 it does not take much evidence to tip the scales towards a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-11\"><em>Third, </em>plaintiff posits that in a criminal case in which the state charges a defendant with sexual abuse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201c[t]he only substantive issue in the trial\u201d is whether the charged conduct occurred, whereas \u201cthe plaintiff in a civil case has to prove that she was injured by the defendant\u2019s conduct, [and] not only that the defendant committed the conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">None of those propositions has plausible merit. Accordingly, none implicates a reasonable legal dispute as to the propriety of extending the analysis of <em>Southard </em>and <em>Lupoli </em>to civil litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s first proffered distinction rests on a patently erroneous understanding both of the nature of procedural protections afforded in a civil proceedings and of <em>Southard\u2019s </em>rationale. That purported distinction proceeds, at least implicitly, from the specious premise that liberty interests are always and necessarily to be afforded greater procedural protection than property interests, regardless of their relative magnitude or the severity of the attendant consequences. In all events, that premise is not only insupportable, but it is also inapt because, in <em>Southard, </em>the court\u2019s decision was based on OEC 403, not on any constitutional prescription. Notwithstanding plaintiff\u2019s contrary contentions, we discern no principled reason why the court\u2019s OEC 403 balancing analysis in that criminal case should obtain different results in this civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s second proposed <em>distinction </em>\u2014 viz., that in criminal sexual abuse prosecutions the state must prove only culpable conduct while in a civil case, the plaintiff must prove both tortious conduct and injury \u2014 is, at best, a <em>non sequitur. </em>Even assuming, without endorsing, plaintiff\u2019s overbroad characterization of the state\u2019s burden in the criminal context, the fact remains that, in both contexts, proof of culpable conduct is an essential element of the proponent\u2019s (the state\u2019s or the plaintiff\u2019s) case. Just as expert diagnosis testimony that is inadmissible under <em>Southard </em>may impermissibly affect the determination in the criminal context as to whether culpable conduct actually occurred, the same is true in the civil context with respect to the determination of the conduct element of a tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s third and final proffered distinction\u2014 pertaining to differing standards of proof \u2014 is, frankly, counterintuitive. As a matter of logic and common sense, the potentially prejudicial impact of erroneously admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>evidence proffered by the party with the burden of persuasion would, at least generally, seem to be greater where the burden of persuasion is by a mere preponderance rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Finally, plaintiff asserts that, even if the error is plain, we should decline to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion here because the gravity of the error is materially different in the civil context. That assertion appears to be predicated on the same purported distinction between defendant\u2019s liberty and property interests that we addressed above, and we reject it for the same reasons. Plaintiff also contends that we should decline to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion here because, according to plaintiff, defendant made a tactical choice \u201cto allow Plaintiff\u2019s experts to testify that they based their diagnoses of Plaintiff on her own statements in order to attack the methodology and substance of the diagnoses on cross examination and in closing argument.\u201d Ironically, as support for that proposition, plaintiff relies on <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 228 P3d 688 (2010), where we <em>rejected </em>the state\u2019s contention that the defendant may have had tactical reasons for wanting the diagnosis of sexual abuse admitted into evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 512. Plaintiff emphasizes, nevertheless, our observation in <em>Lovern </em>that the defendant had objected to the admission of a diagnosis of sexual abuse, albeit on different grounds (lack of foundation). <em>Id. </em>at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Plaintiff accords unwarranted weight to our observation in <em>Lovern. </em>Here, as in <em>Lovern </em>\u2014 and a bevy of our <em>post-Southard </em>plain error cases in which we reversed criminal convictions and remanded \u2014 the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Southard </em>issued after the trial. Accordingly, defendant did not waive an objection predicated on then-extant case law. <em>State v. Feller, </em>247 Or App 416, 421, 269 P3d 110 (2011) (\u201cGiven that state of the law, the only inference that we draw from defendant\u2019s failure to object is that counsel understood that an objection would be futile and, instead, attempted, as much as possible, to combat any adverse effect the expert evidence would have on the jury\u2019s view of the case.\u201d). In all events, since <em>Southard, </em>and after <em>Lovern, </em>we have \u201crepeatedly held that it is plain error for a trial court to admit a medical expert\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of physical findings to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>diagnosis,\u201d <em>State v. Codon, </em>247 Or App 756, 759-60, 270 P3d 409 (2012), and we have also repeatedly rejected arguments that a defendant might have had tactical reasons for desiring the admission of a diagnosis of sexual abuse. <em>See, e.g., Feller, </em>247 Or App at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">In sum, the trial court erred in failing to preclude vouching testimony by plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses and in admitting the expert diagnoses of sexual abuse, and those errors, either individually or collectively, were not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b23-7\"> The judgment in this case was entered before <em>Southard </em>was decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b23-8\"> Our disposition obviates the need to reach defendant\u2019s other assignments of evidentiary error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
