On appeal, she challenges a supplemental judgment of restitution entered 104 days after her judgment of conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant contends that the court erred in imposing restitution because (1) the supplemental judgment was entered after the 90-day period allowed under ORS 137.106(l)(b), and the court did not find good cause for extending that time, and (2) the record lacks evidence to support the amount of restitution imposed. The state concedes that the trial court erred in its imposition of restitution; we agree and accept that concession. Thus, the only issue on appeal is the proper disposition of the case. Defendant urges us to reverse the supplemental judgment outright;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the state, on the other hand, argues that the proper remedy is to \u201cvacate the supplemental judgment and remand for a hearing for the trial court to determine whether good cause existed to extend the restitution determination and, if so, the amount of economic damages.\u201d We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The relevant facts are few and undisputed. On April 2, 2010, defendant was convicted, after a bench trial, of fourth-degree assault constituting domestic violence. Sentencing took place immediately after trial. At sentencing, the prosecutor asked the court to impose $299 in restitution for damage to the victim\u2019s property (a model car and camera). Defendant asked for documentation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>trial court responded that it would \u201cset a restitution hearing in 90 days\u201d to resolve the matter if the parties were unable to come to agreement in the meantime. The court then set the restitution hearing for July 1, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The court entered the judgment of conviction and sentence on April 14, 2010. Then, although the restitution hearing scheduled for July 1 never occurred,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on July 27, 2010, the trial court nonetheless entered a supplemental judgment imposing restitution in the amount of $358.95. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We review sentencing decisions, including restitution awards, for legal error. <em>State v. Noble, </em>231 Or App 185, 189, 217 P3d 1130 (2009); <em>State v. Ferrara, </em>218 Or App 57, 67-68, 178 P3d 250, <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 539 (2008). ORS 137.106 provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201c(1) When a person is convicted of a crime, or a violation as described in ORS 153.008, that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court, prior to the time of sentencing, evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall include one of the following in the judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201c(b) A requirement that the defendant pay the victim restitution, and that the specific amount of restitution will be established by a supplemental judgment based upon a determination made by the court within 90 days of entry of the judgment. In the supplemental judgment, the court shall establish a specific amount of restitution that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages as determined by the court. The court may extend the time within which the determination and supplemental judgment may be completed for good cause. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">In this case, the trial court determined the amount of restitution, without a hearing or evidence as to the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>of damages, and entered a supplemental judgment imposing that obligation 104 days after entry of the original judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, as the state concedes, and we agree, the trial court erred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Consequently, as noted, the only question presented by this appeal concerns the proper disposition of the case. The state contends that remand is appropriate \u201cto determine whether the trial court has authority to impose restitution in a supplemental judgment and, if so, the proper amount.\u201d In particular, the state asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">\u201cAt the hearing, the state can make a record to establish that \u2018good cause\u2019 existed to impose restitution outside the 90-day window. For example, the state can make a record whether it provided defendant with the restitution documentation, and defendant manifested her agreement or acquiescence in the state\u2019s proposed amount, or whether the state provided defendant with notice of the proposed supplemental judgment, and defendant failed to object. At the hearing, the state can also make a record that establishes the proper amount of restitution \u2014 either by establishing the precise amount of economic damages or by establishing that defendant expressly or implicitly agreed to the state\u2019s proposed amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The state initially relies primarily on <em>State v. Tippetts, </em>239 Or App 429, 433, 244 P3d 891 (2010), as support for its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>In <em>Tippetts, </em>the state conceded that the trial court had plainly erred in imposing restitution in the absence of evidence that the victims had suffered economic damages, and, as in the present case, the only dispute was over the appropriate disposition. The state urged us to remand for resentencing, at which time the state could present its evidence. The defendant argued against a remand, \u201cso that the state does not have a second opportunity to present evidence of economic damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431. We agreed with the state, concluding that the defendant\u2019s position was \u201cinconsistent with a long line of restitution cases,\u201d beginning with <em>State v. Edson, </em>329 Or 127, 985 P2d 1253 (1999), in which the Supreme Court interpreted ORS 138.222(5)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to require remand of the entire case for resentencing \u201cso long as there \u2018remain options that the trial court permissibly could adopt on resentencing.\u2019\u201d <em>Tippetts, </em>239 Or App at 432 (quoting <em>Edson, </em>329 Or at 139). In arriving at that conclusion, we distinguished <em>State v. Canady </em>/ <em>Calhoun, </em>225 Or App 299, 201 P3d 225 (2009), and <em>State v. Biscotti, </em>219 Or App 296, 182 P3d 269 (2008) \u2014 restitution cases in which we did <em>not </em>remand for resentencing \u2014 because, in each of those cases, we held, as a matter of law, that good cause did not exist to extend the time to determine restitution under ORS 137.106(l)(b), and the trial court had erred in concluding otherwise. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, in those cases, \u201cthere was nothing to resentence: the sentencing court no longer had statutory authority to impose restitution and so, in the words of <em>Edson, </em>there were no \u2018options that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>permissibly could adopt on resentencing[.]\u201d\u2019 <em>Tippetts, </em>239 Or App at 433 (brackets in <em>Tippetts).</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Here, the state points out that \u201cthe trial court did not hold a restitution hearing, and whether that court has authority to impose restitution depends on facts that appear outside the record\u201d; thus, as in <em>Tippetts, </em>we should remand for the court to make that determination. In other words, as we understand the state\u2019s argument, the court may or may not have had the authority to impose the restitution award that it did, depending on whether the salient facts \u2014 which are unknown given the court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing\u2014 support a conclusion that there was good cause to extend the time to determine restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The state\u2019s reliance on <em>Tippetts, </em>however, is misplaced. That line of cases, beginning with <em>Edson, </em>provides little guidance in this context because the statute on which those cases are predicated \u2014 ORS 138.222 \u2014 applies only in felony sentencing. <em>See State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 91, 251 P3d 1234 (2011) (confirming that, since the enactment of the sentencing guidelines in 1989, ORS 138.222 governs appeal and review of sentences imposed for felonies; ORS 138.040 and ORS 138.050 govern with respect to misdemeanor sentences); <em>Edson, </em>329 Or at 136 (scope of appellate review and the appellate court\u2019s disposition options following judgment of conviction on a felony committed in 1994 governed by ORS 138.222). In <em>Edson, </em>the Supreme Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u201c[t]he scope of an appellate court\u2019s review and the range of options available to that court when it concludes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the trial court erred are dictated by applicable statutes and generally are dependent on the type of trial court decision under consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">329 Or at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Here, defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor after a trial. Thus, ORS 138.040,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rather than ORS 138.222, governs. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u201c(1) The appellate court may review:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\u00abHi * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">\u201c(b) Any disposition described under ORS 138.053[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] as to whether it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">\u201c(A) Exceeds the maximum allowable by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">\u201c(B) Is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">\u201c(2) If the appellate court determines the disposition imposed exceeds the maximum allowable by law or is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual, <em>the appellate court shall direct the court from which the appeal is taken to impose the disposition that should be imposed.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">The state contends that subsection (2) \u201cprovides additional support for the state\u2019s argument about the appropriate disposition\u201d in this case.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>does not explain how that is so, and we do not understand the text emphasized above to require, or even suggest, the result advanced by the state. Instead, the statute simply does not address the question implicated here. In other words, \u201cthe disposition that should be imposed\u201d in this case could be (1) as the state suggests, an award of restitution, in an amount determined by the trial court after a hearing on the evidence, if the trial court determines on remand that there was good cause to extend the statutory 90-day period to determine restitution; or (2), as defendant suggests, no award of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">We turn to the underlying statute and the nature of the trial court\u2019s decision. As we have previously emphasized, \u201cthere is nothing \u2018hortatory\u2019\u201d about ORS 137.106(l)(b); rather, \u201c [i] t plainly establishes a 90-day deadline for the issuance of a supplemental judgment ordering restitution.\u201d <em>Biscotti, </em>219 Or App at 300,300-01. In <em>Biscotti, </em>we noted that it was \u201cobvious\u201d from the 2003 amendments to the statute\u2014 which enacted the 90-day deadline to replace the previous wording that simply required the court to order \u201cprompt payment of restitution whenever possible,\u201d ORS 137.106(4) (2001) \u2014 \u201cthat the legislature wanted to ensure more timely restitution for crime victims [.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303. Thus, timeliness is a significant consideration in the trial court\u2019s determination of restitution. Allowing the court \u2014 at this late stage, that is, long after the 90-day period has expired \u2014 to reopen the record and determine whether, at the time that it made its restitution award, good cause existed to extend the 90-day deadline, would undermine that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">On the other hand, necessarily inherent in the notion of \u201cprompt\u201d restitution for crime victims is the legislature\u2019s desire that victims ultimately be awarded the restitution to which they are entitled. That intent is plainly evident from the text of the statute. Under ORS 137.106(1), if the court finds that a victim suffered economic damages, the court <em>must </em>order the defendant to pay the victim restitution in an amount that \u201cequals the full amount of the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>economic damages as determined by the court,\u201d unless the victim consents otherwise. That is the case whether restitution is ordered at the time of sentencing, ORS 137.106(l)(a), or established by a supplemental judgment within 90 days of the entry of the judgment of conviction, ORS 137.106(l)(b). Reversing the supplemental judgment of restitution outright, without an opportunity for the trial court to determine whether, at the time that the court made that determination, good cause existed to extend the 90-day period, would frustrate that clear legislative goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">In <em>State v. Landreth, </em>246 Or App 376, 265 P3d 89 (2011), the trial court held a restitution hearing 98 days after entry of the defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction, and, upon the defendant\u2019s objection, concluded that good cause had been shown to extend the 90-day deadline to determine restitution. On appeal, the defendant suggested that the trial court lacked \u201cauthority to even consider the matter of restitution after the ninetieth day beyond the date of the judgment because the court had not, at that point, made a determination of \u2018good cause\u2019 to permit the issue to be decided after 90 days.\u201d Id. at 379. We disagreed, holding that nothing in the text or context of ORS 137.106(1) precluded the trial court from making the good-cause determination after the fact \u2014 that is, after the expiration of the 90-day period. <em>Id. </em>at 380.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Landreth, </em>although in a different procedural posture from this case, suggests that ORS 137.106(1) does not preclude us from directing the trial court to <em>now </em>decide whether there was good cause to extend the 90-day period and, if there was, to determine whether an award of restitution was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Defendant does not point to any legal principle\u2014 statutory, constitutional, or otherwise \u2014 that might compel a contrary conclusion, and we are not aware of any. Defendant cites <em>State v. Johnson, </em>242 Or App 279, 255 P3d 547, <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 530 (2011), but that case is unavailing. In <em>Johnson, </em>the court entered an amended judgment purporting to modify an erroneous term in an earlier judgment by providing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the sentence in the case was to be served consecutively to one previously imposed. We held that the court lacked authority to do that, either under ORS 138.083,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> because the judgment did not contain any \u201cerroneous term,\u201d or under the court\u2019s \u201cinherent\u201d authority. 242 Or App at 285-86. Consequently, we reversed the amended judgment and remanded with instructions to reinstate the original judgment. Defendant argues that <em>Johnson </em>stands for the proposition that, \u201c [i] f a trial court modifies a sentence without authority, the modification is void and the proper remedy is for this court simply to reverse the judgment containing the modification.\u201d Here, however, we cannot say that the trial court lacked authority to modify the sentence. That is, if there was good cause for the trial court to extend the 90-day deadline to establish restitution (and the court thereafter found, from evidence presented by the state, that the victim suffered economic damages), then the court acted within its authority in entering the supplemental judgment; if there was not, then the court lacked the necessary authority to do so. The problem is that, because the trial court did not hold a hearing to determine the good-cause question, the issue of the court\u2019s authority was never decided. <em>Cf. Biscotti, </em>219 Or App at 304 (concluding that the trial court lacked good cause to extend the deadline as a matter of law). Thus, <em>Johnson </em>does not assist defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">We conclude that the appropriate disposition in this case is to vacate the supplemental judgment and remand for the trial court to determine (1) whether the failure to include a requirement of restitution in the original judgment precludes the court from now awarding restitution, <em>see </em>253 Or App at 613 n 4; (2) if not, whether, at the time the court entered the supplemental judgment, there was good cause to extend the restitution determination; and (3) if so, the amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Supplemental judgment vacated and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\"> Although defendant also appealed her judgment of conviction, she does not raise any assignment of error pertaining to it; accordingly, we affirm that judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\"> Defendant uses the term \u201cvacate\u201d; however, that disposition generally indicates that the court is free to impose the same ruling on remand, a result defendant opposes here. <em>See </em>Bryan A. Garner, <em>A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage </em>632 (2d ed 1995) (\u201cVacate\u201d is \u201cused to denote an appellate court\u2019s wiping clean the judgment slate. The effect is to nullify the previous decision, usually of a lower court, but not necessarily to dictate a contrary result in further proceedings.\u201d). Although, admittedly, our cases are not entirely consistent on this point, <em>compare State v. Biscotti, </em>219 Or App 296, 182 P3d 269 (2008) (vacating supplemental judgment of restitution where court erred in determining that there was good cause to extend the time for determining restitution), <em>with State v. Murrell, </em>242 Or App 178, 255 P3d 574 (2011) (reversing award of restitution under similar circumstances), \u201creverse\u201d is the more appropriate terminology where, as here, a party seeks to overturn the judgment outright.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\"> The only indication in the record as to why the restitution hearing did not take place as scheduled is the notation, \u201cCANCELLED PER DA PHONE CALL,\u201d that appears in the trial court\u2019s O JIN register.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\"> We also observe that, contrary to the recitals in the supplemental judgment prepared by the district attorney\u2019s office, the original judgment did <em>not </em>include \u201c[a] requirement that the defendant pay the victim restitution,\u201d the specific amount to be established by supplemental judgment, as required by ORS 137.106(l)(b). Although the money award in the original judgment contained a line item for restitution, that item was left blank, as was a \u201ccheck the box\u201d option indicating that the amount was \u201cto be determined.\u201d Defendant does not raise any issue with respect to that deficiency, and, given that our disposition of this appeal requires a remand, we leave it to the trial court to consider on remand the consequences of that omission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\"> As the state also acknowledges, preservation principles are inapposite in this circumstance, because nothing in the record indicates that defendant had notice of, or a prior opportunity to object to, the trial court\u2019s restitution ruling before the court entered the supplemental judgment. <em>See State v. DeCamp, </em>158 Or App 238, 241, 973 P2d 922 (1999) (\u201cA party cannot be required to raise an objection contemporaneously with a trial court\u2019s ruling or other action when the party was not on notice of the trial court\u2019s intended action and had no opportunity to be present when the trial court acted.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b634-4\"> At the time <em>Edson </em>was decided, the relevant portion of ORS 138.222(5) (1997) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u201cIf the appellate court determines that the sentencing court, in imposing a sentence in the case, committed an error that requires resentencing, the appellate court shall remand the entire case for resentencing.
