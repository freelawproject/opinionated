The position may or may not be correct. This court does not decide or reach the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-20\">Under the circumstances, the trial court should first have the opportunity to have the attorney general\u2019s views on a right to a hearing which may be submitted to it by brief. Then if the district court decides a hearing should be held, it can send for the petitioner who is in Leavenworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-21\">F.emanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
