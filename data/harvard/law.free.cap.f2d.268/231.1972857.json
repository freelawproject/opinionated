This is a trademark opposition instituted by appellee which was dismissed January 31, 1958, by the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences upon appellant\u2019s (applicant\u2019s) motion. From this dismissal, appellee-opposer appealed to the Commissioner of Patents on January 15, 1959. Assistant Commissioner Leeds reversed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences and ordered the case to proceed to trial. Appellant has appealed from this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">The order of the Assistant Commissioner is an interlocutory order, and, as such, is not appealable.
