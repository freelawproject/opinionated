Here there is no allegation by way of fact or conclusion that Hagen had any duty to file a sales tax return. The complaint does not say that Hagen made any sales or performed any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>taxable service or that he collected any sales taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Furthermore, the case tried on a stipulation of facts teeters because it is doubtful whether the stipulation includes the element of willfulness, which is in the Palmer sales tax ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Thus, we cannot accept the invitation of the appeal to pass on the validity of Palmer\u2019s sales tax ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">POPE, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
