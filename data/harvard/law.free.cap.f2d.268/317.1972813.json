We will attempt to clarify and correct the basis for our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-17\">We initially expressed doubt that the defendant\u2019s officers were guilty of fraud per se because of our doubt that the naked \u201cintent to deceive\u201d element was adequately established. We next held that a \u201cgrowing minority\u201d of jurisdictions, including Louisiana, recognize a fiduciary relationship or a position of confidence existing between the directors and officers of a corporation and the individual stockholders, especially when the former purchase shares of stock from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>latter. And we held that, when this fiduciary duty is violated, it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">\u201c * * * immaterial whether its breach is described as constructive fraud, unjust enrichment, fraudulent breach of trust, breach of fiduciary obligation, gross negligence, or otherwise, and whether the remedy is given by a constructive trust, restitution, or accounting. These are all relative terms describing broad equitable concepts. The standard of a fiduciary\u2019s duty to his beneficiary, depending upon the instant relation and the facts of the particular case, lies somewhere between simple negligence and willful misconduct or fraud with the intent to deceive. The actual intent to deceive is not required where one party is so placed in such an advantageous position to the other. Actual fraud will afford redress in the absence of the special relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We concluded by holding that Louisiana has long recognized the fiduciary relationship in situations like the present case, and that these Louisiana decisions \u201cfully answer appellant\u2019s contentions that Louisiana\u2019s limited equity jurisprudence will prevent our imposition of a \u2018constructive trust\u2019 or \u2018equitable lien\u2019 or \u2018right of restitution\u2019 for the breach of the fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiffs by defendant\u2019s officers.\u201d Then, we listed the ways in which this confidential relationship was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">We believe that all of what was said above is good law, both in common-law States and in Louisiana, except for the possible misleading construction which could be placed on the statements which describe the breach of this duty and the remedy in broad equitable concepts as applying literally to Louisiana law. We agree with appellant that the Louisiana Civil Law prohibits the imposition of a constructive trust or equitable lien on property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">We stated that a \u201cgrowing minority\u201d of jurisdictions recognize the existence of a fiduciary relationship inuring from the officers or directors or majority stockholders to the individual or minority stockholders, particularly concerning the purchase of stock from a shareholder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The next question presented is which law should determine this relationship \u2014 that of Delaware or Louisiana?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\"> It is well settled that a federal court in a diversity case must apply the eonflict-of-laws rule of the state in which it sits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>While Louisiana conflict-of-laws is silent on which law determines whether such a fiduciary relationship exists in a foreign corporation, its various conflict-of-laws rules are generally the same as in other states.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, we must look to the general law.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>A number of cases have held that the conflict-of-laws rules of the forum require that court to refer to the \u201claw of the State of incorporation to determine the extent and nature of relationship between corporation and stockholder, corporate officer or director and stockholder and between stockholders inter sese,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> while the law of the place of the wrong determines the quantum of the breach of duty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Apparently, Delaware imposes no fiduciary duty on the part of officers or directors or majority stockholders in buying stock from the minority or individual stockholders.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In strict logic, a strong case is made that, if this Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>opinion is based exclusively on the breach of fiduciary obligations owed by directors and majority stockholders of a foreign corporation to minority stockholders, and if literal compliance is given to those decisions holding that the State of incorporation sets the standards for all personal relationships between persons connected with the corporation, the opinion is faulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Those decisions (listed in footnote 6, supra) are, however, in our opinion, either inapplicable or unsound where the only contact point with the incorporating state is the naked fact of incorporation, and where all other contact points, such as, residence of parties and actors, situs of property, lex loci delicti \u2022or contractus, place where corporation is conducting its only or principal place of business, et cetera, are found in another jurisdiction. Certainly, in such a situation the charter of the corporation and even non-repugnant statutory laws of the state of incorporation limiting corporate powers should govern the internal affairs of the corporation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When, however, the situation is such as here, where neither the charter nor the statutory laws of the incorporating state are applicable, and <em>all </em>contact points are in the forum, we believe that the laws of the forum should govern.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This was precisely the situation in Blazer v. Black, supra, note 6, 196 F.2d 139, involving a suit by a former stockholder of a dissolved corporation against its former president for damages for the alleged fraudulent conversion of the stockholders\u2019 stock before dissolution. The corporation was organized under the laws of Illinois but all other contacts were in Kansas. The court reversed the lower court\u2019s judgment for defendant, holding that, under the minority view of Kansas, the director was a fiduciary when negotiating with a stockholder for purchases of shares. The court did not discuss the law of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">In the case of Mayflower Hotel Stockholders Protective Committee v. Mayflower Hotel Corp., supra, note 6, 193 F.2d 666, the District of Columbia Circuit had held in a prior appeal (84 U.S. App.D.C. 275, 173 F.2d 416) that the directors or majority stockholders occupy a fiduciary relation toward the minority stockholders when selling stock control, relying on Supreme Court decisions which arose under federal statutes or which were diversity cases prior to Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 1938, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188. On the second appeal, after the defendants presented the question that Delaware law should control such fiduciary relations, the court declined to consider whether the \u201claw of the case\u201d applied to second appeal matters determined on a first appeal (193 F.2d at page 669) and held, as a concurrent ground for imposing these high standards, that the District of Columbia and Delaware law is in substantial accord in imposing a fiduciary relationship on a majority stockholder regarding transactions between corporations with interlocking directorates. 193 F.2d at page 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Most of the other eases listed in footnote 6, supra, involve situations where the courts were seeking to impose the fiduciary rule of the state of incorporation in order to escape the inequitable rule of the forum (generally Delaware).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"> However, in view of our holding hereinafter that the district judge was not clearly erroneous in holding that the actions of appellant through its officers constituted actionable fraud under Article 1847, LSA-Civil Code, what has been said concerning the choice of laws to determine the duty owed by officers, directors, or majority stockholders to the minority stockholders may not be necessary for the disposition of this case. That is true because, as will be seen, the broad scope of fraud in Louisiana covers situations where the law imposes an obligation on the party with superior knowledge to disclose facts within his knowledge to the other and to deal in an atmosphere of trust and confidence. Since appellant\u2019s officers had such superior knowledge, Louisiana fraud rules demanded open and disclosed dealings with utmost fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">As stated earlier, the equitable remedies of constructive trust or equitable lien are alien to the civil law. Without these remedies and with the rule that \u201cconstructive fraud,\u201d found in the law of fiduciaries and characterized by the lack of the \u201cintent to defraud,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is impossible under Article 1847,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Louisiana courts have an awkward time imposing liability for the breach of a fiduciary\u2019s duty to disclose or the breach of other fiduciary relations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In some cases involving a relationship of confidence between the parties, the Louisiana courts have used the terms of common-law equity, ordinarily obnoxious to the civil law, to describe the breach and remedy for breach of fiduciary duty, such as, \u201cbreach of trust\u201d and \u201cconstructive trust.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Normally, however, the Loui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>siana courts, in finding liability for a breach of a fiduciary duty, have based such liability on \u201cfraud\u201d as encompassed in Article 1847 of the LSA-Civil Code. This is true in cases involving both corporate fiduciaries<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and other fiduciar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ies <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, the breach of the relationship is called fraud and the remedy is, of course, a rescission of the contract or damages.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> By bringing such rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>tionship under the broad heading of fraud, the Louisiana courts have, in effect, reached the same results as would be reached under the common-law \u2014 re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>suits which seem to common-law lawyers hard to obtain under a literal interpretation of the Civil Code.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">It is also apparent that these same results are achieved when the Louisiana courts hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">\u201cIn determining whether or not fraud has been proved, the situation of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the transaction may be taken into consideration,\u201d Winzey v. Louisiana Industrial Life Ins. Co., La.Ct.App., 1940, 195 So. 67, 69;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">and when they hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">\u201cConsiderable stress is laid by counsel for plaintiff on the question of the proof that is generally required to show that fraud exists. Whilst it is true that in Article 1848 of the [LSA-] Civil Code it is provided that fraud, like every other allegation, must be proved by him who alleges it, however, that same article further provides that \u2018it may be proved by simple presumptions, or by legal presumptions as well as by other evidence. The maxim that fraud is not to be presumed, means no more than that it is not to be imputed without' legal evidence.\u2019 Courts have always acknowledged how difficult it is for one to prove fraud by positive and direct testimony, realizing full well that those who indulge in it generally prepare themselves in such a manner as to cover up and leave no traces of their practice behind them. In an early case, Simon-Gregory Dry Goods Co. v. Newman, 50 La.Ann. 338, 23 So. 329, the Court stated that: \u2018While fraud is never to be presumed, courts of justice \u201crecognize the cunning concealment in which it shrouds its devious practices and the difficulty of tracing it by direct proof.\u201d \u2019 We can well conceive of such a situation in this case where such practices may well have been indulged in and it becomes next to impossible to put our finger on any particular piece of direct testimony to show actual fraud on the part of Griffing. As a matter of fact his fraud wasn\u2019t active but rather of a passive nature in that he failed to disclose the information which he was in justice and in equity bound to disclose to the other party to the contract who was not on an equal footing with him. He suppressed the truth, and therefore the case comes within the rules laid down in our Civil Code,\u201d Griffing v. Atkins, supra, 1 So.2d 445, 450;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">and when they hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-12\">\u201c * * * \u2018Fraud,\u2019 as the word is used in our Code and in courts of equity, as relates to contracts, \u2018comprises all acts, omissions and con-cealments involving a breach of legal or equitable duty and resulting in damage to another\u2019,\u201d Thieme v. Collier, 1930, 13 La.App. 661, 128 So. 730, 731;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">and when they hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-14\">\u201c * * * While a purchaser is under no obligation to inform a prospective vendor as to the value, the title or the condition of the property involved, he, individually, or as agent for his principal, having made representations and statements as to the value, the title or the condition of the property, knowing them to be false or reckless or without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>knowledge of their truth or falsity, is under the solemn obligation to make correct representations and tell the whole truth, without concealment or suppression of any material facts, especially if there exists an inequality of knowledge, as where the seller does not reside near the land and the purchaser does and is familiar with it,\u201d American Guaranty Co. v. Sunset Realty &amp; Planting Co., 1945, 208 La. 772, 23 So.2d 409, 449;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">and when they hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">\u201c \u2018Two things are necessary to constitute fraud: the intention to defraud, and actual loss or damage, or such strong probability of it as will induce a court to interfere.\u2019 (Slocomb v.

Mc-Kendrick, 1953, 223 La. 62, 64 So.2d 844, 846;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">and when they hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">\u201cThe rule of equity, briefly stated, is that a purchase by a trustee or agent per interpositam personam carries fraud on its face.

Zeller, 1913, 132 La. 222, 61 So. 209, 212.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">We have not overlooked the matters pretermitted on pages 753 and 754 of 263 F.2d, but we think that those matters have been sufficiently covered in the opinions of the district court and of this Court and that the contentions there pre-termitted are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">In our original opinion we wrote too much in the language of the traditional equity jurisprudence familiar to lawyers in common-law states. The evidence viewed in the light of the civil law, including the principles just discussed, removes the doubt which we held \u201cthat the \u2018intent\u2019 element necessary as the basis for actual fraud was adequately established.\u201d In view of the confidential relationship existing between the parties, and considering the circumstances surrounding the transactions, we now hold that the district court was not clearly erroneous in holding that the necessary \u201cintent\u201d had been established to constitute actionable fraud in Louisiana.

He is not accountable to the stockholder for withholding information from him which affects the value of the stock, but to the corporation, the whole body of stockholders, he stands in a fiduciary relation which requires him to exercise the utmost good faith in managing the business affairs of the company with a view to promote, not his own interests, but the common interests, and he cannot directly or indirectly derive any personal benefit or advantage by reason of his position distinct from the coshare-holders * * * \u201d (114 A. 224, 228.)

Hibernia Homestead Ass\u2019n, La.App., 1939, 186 So. 757, 758, 764, a case relied on by this Court in its prior opinion, the plaintiff sued \u201cto recover the damages she claims to have sustained as the result of a scheme allegedly concocted by the defendants by which she charges that she was fraudulently induced to sell to the homestead 17 shares of its capital stock (par value $100 per share) for $50 per share.\u201d After fully discussing the fiduciary duty owed by defendant directors to the plaintiff, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-18\">\u201cIt is to be observed here that the defendant directors were not purchasing plaintiff\u2019s stock with their own funds. On the contrary, they were using the assets of the corporation for that purpose. It seems too plain for extended argument that, under such circumstances, they became trustees for all of the stockholders and that, if they concealed in bad faith any facts from any one of the persons affected by the plan they devised, they should be made to respond for their deceit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-21\">And the court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-22\">\u201cA careful analysis of plaintiff\u2019s petition and the exhibits attached thereto justifies the conclusion that she states a case of actionable fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-23\">The case was revei-sed for trial and after judgment for defendants, plaintiff prosecuted her second appeal. The court in Markey v. Hibernia Homestead Ass\u2019n, La.App., 1943, 13 So.2d 791, 795, states: \u201c * * * jn 0ther words, the complaint is that the defendants fraudulently devised a scheme to unjustly enrich themselves at plaintiff\u2019s expense. It was because of these charges that we, in our first opinion (see La.App. 186 So. 757), reversed the judgment of the court below and sustained plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. Later, in a similar ease (but where no allegations of actionable fraud were set forth), the Supreme Court maintained an exception of no cause of action in a suit by a stockholder of a homestead to have a sale of her stock to the homestead rescinded. See Weasel v. Union Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, 198 La. 219, 3 So.2d 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-25\">\u201cThe evidence in the case discloses, beyond question, that there is no foundation in fact for plaintiff\u2019s charge that the Directors of the homestead conspired to recapture her stock for their own benefit * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b381-26\">While the court had presented the question of whether or not \u201cbad faith\u201d needs to be shown when misrepresentations are made by a defendant in a fiduciary capacity, the court held that no misrepresentations were made, and did not decide this question:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-27\">\u201cCounsel for plaintiff contends that, in spite of the fact that the Board of Directors had no intention of enriching themselves at plaintiff\u2019s expense, the defendants are, nevertheless, responsible because,\u2014 (1) they misrepresented to her the sound, or book value, of her stock * * *. And it is further argued that, in view of the fiduciary relationship existing between the defendants and the stockholders of the homestead, it is immaterial whether the alleged misrepre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>sentations were made by the defendants in bad faith or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u201cThe first contention, that the defendants misrepresented the value of the homestead stock, is wholly without merit. The various communications mailed to the shareholders exhibit that the defendants made no representations with respect to the value of the stock * * (13 So.2d 791, 796.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In Pool v. Pool, La.App., 1943, 16 So.2d 132, 133, also cited in the first opinion, the suit was against the directors individually to recover for the individual liability imposed on plaintiff after the liquidation of the corporation, \u201call of which was caused by the ineptness, lack of skill, malfeasance, neglect, actionable deceit and fraud on the part of the defendants.\u201d After setting out the liability of directors to individual stockholders for \u201cwilful neglect of duty, gross negligence on their fraudulent breach of trust\u201d and after holding that the prescription of ten years would apply \u201cfor the reason that the relation between the defendants as directors and plaintiff as a stockholder was a fiduciary relationship and their duty to him was a special duty and not one which they owed to the general public,\u201d the court reversed the case and allowed plaintiff to amend his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">In Commercial Nat. Bank in Shreveport v. Parsons, 5 Cir., 1944, 144 F.2d 231, 238-239, the court stated that \u201ca hard bargain driven by fiduciaries in such circumstances is presumed to be fraudulent and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">In the case of Wessel v. Union Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, 1941, 198 La. 219, 3 So.2d 594, 595, 598, 599, not cited in the first opinion, the plaintiff alleged that defendant was guilty of fraud because it induced her to sell her stock at a price which was less than its book value or its value on the open market. The plaintiff alleged that:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">\u201c * * * the association and its officers knew or should have known that the stock had a greater value than that which they represented in the circular letter, and that by means of this letter the president and secretary of the association conspired to conceal and did conceal the true value of the shares of stock, and thereby took an unfair advantage of their fiduciary relation and of the trust and confidence which the plaintiff and other shareholders had and were entitled to have in the officers and directors of the association.\u201d 3 So.2d 594, 595. The court, in holding for the defendant homestead association, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">\u201cIt is declared in the third paragraph of article 1847 of the [LSA-] Civil Code that a false statement made by a party to a contract of sale, as to the value of the object of the sale, is not such a fraud, \u2018such an artifice\u2019, as will give to the other party the right to annul the sale, if the object was of such a nature and in such a situation that he who was induced by the false statement to enter into the contract \u2018might with ordinary attention have detected the falsehood\u2019. Therefore, if the statement in the circular letter which induced the plaintiff to sell her shares of stock for $50 per share, that the listing of the stock would be reduced to $38 on the nineteenth day after the date of the circular letter, should be regarded as a false statement, it was not a false statement of which the plaintiff may complain, because \u2018with ordinary attention\u2019 she could have learned all that any one else could know about the value of her shares of stock. On account of the fiduciary relation of the officers and directors to the stockholders of a corporation, the third paragraph of article 1847 of the [LSA-] Civil Code might not be deemed applicable to this case if the president and secretary of the Union Homestead Association had withheld from the plaintiff any information concerning the value of her shares; but that is not the case.\u201d 3 So.2d 594, 598-599.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b382-17\">.

Surely, the statute makes no distinction in this regard and it is not our function to write such an exception into the law. Nulsen v. Herndon, 176 La. 1097, 147 So. 359, 88 A.L.R. 236. True enough, a majority of the common law states provide authority for the prevailing opinion but those pronouncements are founded on the constructive trust or equitable lien doctrine, which is unknown in Louisiana; albeit, the antithesis of the provisions of our Code dealing with privileges.\u201d 51 So.2d 815-816.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">In Griffing v. Atkins, La.App., 1941, 1 So.2d 445, 449, 450, an ignorant Negro intervened in the suit seeking to rescind a sale of a $1250 diamond ring, which he had found, and which was purchased from him by a jeweler for $130.00. The court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">\u201cThe ground on which Sims, the interve-nor, seeks to set aside the sale is of course one arising out of the Articles of our [LSA-] Civil Code relating to error and fraud. Under Art. 1819, there are four defects of consent which will invalidate any contract entered into by the parties, viz.: \u2018Error; Fraud; Violence; Threats.\u2019 We are concerned with the first two, but in reality this case involves the second thereof for the reason that Art. 1832 provides that: \u2018In all cases, however, when the information, which would have destroyed the error, has been withheld by the other party to the contract, it comes under the head of fraud, and invalidates the contract.\u2019 The article relative to the nullity of contracts from fraud is Art. 1847. The preliminary statement of that article is the most important as it defines fraud, as it applies to contracts, as \u2018the cause of an error bearing on a material part of the contract, <em>created or continued by artifice, with design to obtain some unjust advantages to the one party, or to cause cm inconvenience or loss to the other\u2019 </em>(italics scoring ours). From this definition, the article then lays down twelve certain rules which it says are drawn therefrom. In rule 4, we find particular reference to false assertions constituting an artifice regarding objects that require particular skill or habit, or any difficult or inconvenient operation to discover the truth or falsity of the assertion; examples are given therein but they are not exclusive. Rule 5 provides that fraud arises from some false assertions made as to the value or quality of the object forming the subject of the contract or by the suppression of what is true regarding the same. Rule 6 provides that: \u2018The assertion and suppression, mentioned in the last preceding rule, mean not only an affirmation or negation by words either written or spoken, but any other means calculated to produce a belief of what is false, or an ignorance or disbelief of what is true.\u2019 These rules contemplate that in a contract of sale of the very nature of the one with which we are now concerned that where the parties are on an unequal footing, and not dealing at arms length, the one possessing the superior knowledge regarding the value or the quality of the object is held to the exercise of the greatest care and caution in conducting himself and must not take undue advantage of the other party, who, as it happens in this case, is one totally ignorant of the value or quality of the object and who was attempting to obtain information relative thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">\u201cIn this case, Sims went to Roumain\u2019s store upon the solicitation of one of the employees where he had the right to expect a full and complete disclosure of the facts and of the truth regarding the ring. He did not know Roumain, Collins or Griffing. He went there for technical advice as to the character and value of the ring. All of these, in our opinion, were in a fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary relationship towards him, and Sims had a right to expect, in fair dealing, the true information which he had been invited to seek there; and no one, especially under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the circumstances as we view them, where all of them had the knowledge of the ring\u2019s true character and value, should have taken advantage of him and attempted to buy the ring at a price which was so much out of proportion to its true value.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\">. The remedy given by the district court as affirmed by this Court is a rescission of the sales of plaintiffs\u2019 stock to defendant, a recognition of the plaintiffs as the owners of said stock, and an order for accounting following judgment for plaintiffs \u201cagainst defendant for their pro rata portion of the assets of defendant distributed in liquidation, said portions to be credited with the amount each plaintiff received for his stock.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b384-16\">.
