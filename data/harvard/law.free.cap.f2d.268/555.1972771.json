On the contrary, the effect of the rulings is to leave the libel standing for trial on the merits, meaning by the merits the issues on which liability as distinguished from amount of damages may finally depend. See The Maria, 2 Cir., 1933, 67 F.2d 571. The District Court\u2019s rulings are clearly interlocutory. But since they do not de termine \u201cthe rights and liabilities of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>parties,\u201d they are not interlocutory orders of the kind made appealable by Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">In this situation it is pertinent to quote the language used by this court in Jarka Corporation v. Rederii, 1 Cir., 1940, 110 F.2d 234, 235, in which, in dismissing an appeal from a decree overruling exceptions to a libel <em>in personam </em>under the statutory provision preceding .\u00a7 1292(a)(3), supra, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">\u201cAppeals lie, not from all interlocutory decrees in admiralty, but only from such interlocutory decrees as determine \u2018the rights and liabilities of the parties.\u2019 44 Stat. 233, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 227. The decree below merely determines that the libel states a good cause of action. It does not determine the rights and liabilities of the parties, because at the trial the libellant may fail to prove his case. Stark v. Texas Co., 5 Cir.,, 1937, 88 F.2d 182; The Maria, 2 Cir., 1933, 67 F.2d 571; see Schoen-amsgruber v. Hamburg American Line, 1935, 294 U.S. 454, 55 S.Ct. 475, 79 L.Ed. 989; H. Lissner &amp; Co., Inc. v. Oceanic Steam Navigation Co., 2 Cir., 1929, 30 F.2d 290.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On like reasoning the court reached the same result in The Maria, supra, which arose upon an interlocutory decree dismissing exceptions to a libel <em>in rem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The present statute has been given the same construction in the following cases: Rogers v. Alaska Steamship Co., 9 Cir., 1957, 249 F.2d 646; Cummings v. Re-deeriaktieb Transatlantic, 3 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 275; cf. The Fort Fetterman, 4 Cir., 1956, 236 F.2d 221.

Lauro, 2 Cir., 1955, 228 F.2d 222 (per curiam); In re Wills Lines, Inc., 2 Cir., 1955, 227 F.2d 509, certiorari denied Tankport Terminals, Inc., v.

Lambert, 6 Cir., 1951, 187 F.2d 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">An order will be entered in each case dismissing the appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
