Gibson was convicted under two counts charging embezzlement <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and two counts charging obtaining money by false pretenses. All the sentences were made concurrent.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-21\">We summarize the testimony of the Government\u2019s witnesses with respect to the embezzlement counts: In September, 1956, Jacob N. Bigelow approached Gibson, who was doing business as a building contractor under the style of \u201cAssociated Contractors,\u201d and informed him that he desired to have a house built. Gibson asked Bigelow if he had a lot and the latter responded that he had not; that he knew of a vacant lot at the northwest corner of 19th Street and Bunker Hill Road, N. E., but did not know whether it was for sale. Several days later Gibson telephoned Bigelow that the land was for sale, that he had \u201ctied it up,\u201d and that if Bigelow would bring to his office a down payment of $3,500 he would get the land for him and build on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-22\">Bigelow and his wife went to Gibson\u2019s office on September 26, 1956, to arrange for the purchase of the lot and the construction of a house thereon. Gibson told them he had purchased the lot for Bige-low or that he held an option to purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>it. A written contract was then prepared by Gibson\u2019s secretary. Bigelow,, his wife and Gibson signed the contract; and Bigelow delivered to Gibson $1,176 in cash, a cashier\u2019s check in the amount of $2,000, and another check payable to Bigelow\u2019s order in the amount of $324. Bigelow testified their agreement was that the $3,500 was to be used by Gibson to purchase the Bunker Hill Road lot for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">\"The written contract, however, provided only that Gibson was \u201cTo perform all work necessary and furnish all meter\u00ed-ais [sic] to build a single family dwelling to be erected on Parcel 158/55 located at 19th Street and Bunker Hill Road, N. E.,\u201d in accordance with certain plans and specifications, and that Bigelow and his wife (\u201cthe Owners\u201d) were \u201cto pay the Contractor * * * for the above mentioned work\u201d the sum of $24,250, $3,500 of which was to be paid upon the signing of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">A few days after the signing of the contract, Bigelow was informed by appellant that the check in the amount of $324 had been returned on account of insufficient funds. On November 30, 1956, Bigelow delivered to Gibson $324 in cash to replace the bad check.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">From time to time following the execution of the contract and the making of the down payment, Gibson assured Bige-low he had purchased the land, had the building permit and was ready to build. In reply'to Bigelow\u2019s periodic inquiries, he offered various reasons why he had not yet begun construction. Finally, after complaining to the United States Attorney, Bigelow confronted Gibson at the latter\u2019s office in February, 1958, and told him he had learned the land had not been purchased for him, that Gibson had never tried to buy it, and had never obtained or even applied for a building permit. Bigelow demanded return of his money and Gibson refused; At a subsequent hearing at the United States Attorney\u2019s office, Gibson told an assistant United States Attorney he had purchased the lot through a straw. Given an opportunity to prove title, Gibson failed to appear at a later hearing date; thereupon a warrant for his arrest was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Gibson in fact never owned or held an option on the Bunker Hill Road lot. He had no connection with the owner of the lot and had never made inquiry of the owner with reference to its purchase. Nor had he applied for a permit to build on the lot. At his trial, he stated Bigelow had told him from the beginning that he, Bigelow, owned the lot, and that their agreement, pursuant to which the down payment was made, was only for the construction of a house on the lot Bigelow claimed to own.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">The jury found Gibson guilty of embezzlement in respect to the sums of $3,176 and $324, which together constituted the down payment paid to Gibson by Bigelow. On appeal Gibson urges that the evidence adduced at the trial does not support the verdicts on these counts. The two sums constituting the down payment from Bigelow, he contends, did not come into his possession by virtue of any employment or agency relationship, but were paid to him pursuant to his contract to build a house.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">It is true the written contract provides that the $3,500 down payment was to be in partial payment for construction of a house; but there was also ample evidence from which the jury could find, despite the terms of the written instrument, that Gibson had agreed to purchase the lot for Bigelow, that Bigelow thought the written contract embodied the purchase of the lot as well as the construction, that Gibson knew Bigelow so believed, and that the sums totalling $3,500 were delivered to Gibson as agent to purchase the lot for Bigelow.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">Whether it was error for the trial court to allow the jury to give legal effect to the oral agreement and understanding of the parties for the purpose of establishing the relationship between them in respect to these payments, depends upon the applicability and effect of the parol evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\"> In general, where the parties to a contract have reduced their agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ment to a writing intended to cover the transaction between them, the law deems the writing to be the sole memorial of the act, and deprives of legal effect all the other utterances and understandings of the parties. 9 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2425 (3rd ed. 1940). However, the parol evidence rule is binding only between those persons who are parties to the contract or their privies, and does not apply in this case where the controversy is between the government and a party to the contract. \u201cThe people prosecuting for a crime committed in relation to a contract are not parties to the contract and are not bound by it. They are at liberty in such a prosecution to show the true nature of the transaction.\u201d People v. Chait, 69 Cal.App.2d 503, 159 P.2d 445, 454 (1945). See also Landa v. Commissioner, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 196, 206 F.2d 431 (1953); Harrington v. Emmerman, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 23, 27, 186 F.2d 757 (1950); Spund v. Cafritz Const. Co., 60 App.D.C. 102, 48 F.2d 1014 (1931); Commonwealth v. Sherman, 182 Pa.Sup. 319, 126 A.2d 480 (1956) ; State v. Morin, 131 Me. 349, 163 A. 102 (1932); State v. Davison, 74 N.H. 10, 64 A. 761, 765 (1906) ; People v. Walker, 85 App.Div. 556, 83 N.Y.S. 372, affirmed 178 N.Y. 563, 70 N.E. 1105 (1904); 9 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2446 (3rd ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Furthermore, under the parol evidence rule extrinsic evidence varying the terms of a written contract may be introduced where one of the parties to the contract was mistaken as to its terms and his mistake was induced by the fraud of the other party or was known to the other party. 9 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 2415, 2416 (3rd ed. 1940). Cf. 3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 610; Tokio Marine and Fire Ins. Co. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 18 F.Supp. 720, 722 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1937); New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Jones, 1 F.Supp. 984 (D.C.E.D.Ky.1930) ; Beatty v. Donahue, 249 S.W.2d 33, 35 (Ky. 1952) ; Warren v. Osborne, 154 S.W.2d 944, 946 (Tex.Civ.App.1941); Daly v. Simonson, 126 Iowa 716, 102 N.W. 780 (1905). As earlier stated, there was adequate evidence here that Bigelow mistakenly believed the written contract he signed conformed to the oral agreement, and that Gibson knew he was so mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The jury therefore was free to consider and give legal effect to the parol agreement between Gibson and Bigelow for the purpose of determining their relationship in respect to the two sums delivered to Gibson upon the signing of the contract. The evidence so considered was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that Gibson received the $3,500 as agent to purchase the Bunker Hill Road lot for Bigelow and that he wrongfully converted it to his own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Appellant raises additional questions concerning his conviction on two counts of false pretenses on the consolidated indictments. Since the sentences on those counts are each less than the sentence imposed on the embezzlement counts, the validity of which we sustain, and are concurrent therewith, it is not necessary for us to examine his contention regarding them. Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 85, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943); Matthews v. United States, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 29, 240 F.2d 890 (1957); Wanzer v. United States, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 412, 208 F.2d 45 (1953). We do not think the fact that the concurrent sentences are on counts contained in consolidated indictments rather than in a single indictment warrants a distinction between this case and Hirabayashi.
