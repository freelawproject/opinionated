The oral judgment merely declared that the two sentences should be served consecutively without specifying which sentence would be served first.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-16\">The District Court properly treated appellant\u2019s motion as one under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and correctly concluded that \u201cthe motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the defendant is entitled to no relief.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> United States v. Daugherty, 1926, 269 U.S. 360, 46 S.Ct. 156, 70 L.Ed. 309. The denial of the motion without hearing therefore is</p>\n<p id=\"ATd\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-13\">.

This case is not like Gilliam v. United States, - U.S.App.D.C. -, 269 F.2d 770, No. 14,900 (D.C.Cir.), June 18, 1959, where the written sentence did not conform to the sentence as pronounced and was later corrected without a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
