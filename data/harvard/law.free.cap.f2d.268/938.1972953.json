The Board adopted the trial examiner\u2019s finding that respondents violated Section 8(a)(3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (3), by discharging Harrington for his union activity. The only question for decision here is whether that finding is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">The respondents, Harlan B. Browning and Roy J. Rasco, are partners engaged in the manufacture and retail distribution of bakery products in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The products are sold house to house by truck route salesmen. Phillip Harrington was employed by respondents in March, 1955 as a route salesman. Admittedly he showed excellent sales ability and, of those engaged in like employment, was the best income producer for the partnership. In other respects, Harrington\u2019s conduct as an employee left much to be desired, and the record sustains the Board\u2019s conclusion that the respondents had valid cause to discharge him for that reason if they desired to do so. The Board found, however, that the discharge was occasioned by Harrington\u2019s union activity, rather than by his misconduct. We think also that the record sustains this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-16\">The history of Harrington\u2019s union activity begins in July, 1956. Sometime during that month, a sales manager overheard part of a conversation between Harrington and another employee concerning the possible advantages of union organization of the route salesmen. A similar incident occurred in November, 1956, at which time Harrington was warned not to talk to the other men about the union. On both occasions the sales manager remarked that continued union agitation would result in the termination of Harrington\u2019s employment. In early January, 1957 Harrington made inquiry of an official of the Teamster\u2019s Union for information concerning the unionization of respondents\u2019 salesmen. He was given some application cards, and from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>time to the date of his discharge, was the leader in recruiting the route salesmen into the Union. With the assistance of other employees, 22 of the respondents\u2019 more than 30 route salesmen were signed up. On February 4, 1957, the respondents\u2019 sales manager questioned Harrington about the union movement and learned that he had signed an application card and had succeeded in getting a large number of other salesmen to do so. The sales manager criticized the union in strong language and threatened to have nothing more to do with Harrington or any of those who had joined it. He also warned that Browning, the partner in charge of sales, would close the plant rather than deal with the union. The substance of this conversation was given to the respondent Browning, who also had displayed a general anti-union attitude. On February 6, representatives of the Teamster\u2019s Union informed Browning that the Union represented a majority of the route salesmen and displayed the signed cards. Browning refused to talk to the representatives or to recognize the Union as the representative of the employees. On February 7, Browning sent for Harrington and discharged him. Browning\u2019s testimony indicates that he told Harrington that he was being discharged because of prior misconduct, but Harrington\u2019s version of what was said could be construed otherwise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">Our review is limited to an examination of the entire record to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the finding that Harrington was discharged because of his union activity. Findings of the Board will not be set aside unless a fair estimate of all the evidence discloses that they are clearly erroneous. \u201cThe substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 464, 95 L.Ed. 456. See also N.L.R.B. v. Midwestern Instruments, Inc., 10 Cir., 264 F.2d 829, certiorari denied 79 S.Ct. 1451.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">There is no substantial conflict in the evidence presented here. The real dispute centers around inferences which the facts suggest. From all the evidence, the Board would have been warranted in inferring that Harrington\u2019s union activity either did or did not occasion the respondents\u2019 decision to discharge him. Under these circumstances, the Board\u2019s conclusion will not be interfered with. As said in the Universal Camera case, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-10\">\u201c * * * a court may [not] displace the Board\u2019s choice between two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>fairly conflicting views, even though, the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it <em>de novo.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">N.L.R.B. v. Midwestern Instruments, Inc., supra.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See also N.L.R.B. v. Empire Mfg. Corp., 4 Cir., 260 F.2d 528; N.L.R.B. v. West Point Mfg. Co., 5 Cir., 245 F.2d 783; N.L.R.B. v. Coats &amp; Clark, Inc., 5 Cir., 231 F.2d 567; N.L.R.B. v. Carpet, L. &amp; R. T. Layers, 10 Cir., 213 F.2d 49; N.L.R.B. v. Dant, 9 Cir., 207 F.2d 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">The respondents contend that the trial examiner\u2019s report reveals that his choice between these two conflicting inferences was based on improper reasoning. The examiner thought that the length of time that respondents tolerated Harrington\u2019s tardiness indicated that they had adjusted to this shortcoming. Respondents point to the equally long period during which they knew of Harrington\u2019s union activity without taking action, and argue that the examiner could just as well Rave concluded that they condoned this leadership in the union movement. While it is true that the Board might have accepted this latter version of the evidence, the record does not compel such a finding. We are convinced that the Board\u2019s conclusion that Harrington\u2019s union activity was the real reason for his discharge and was one of several actions taken by respondents to discourage the union organization of the route salesmen finds substantial support in the record. See N.L.R.B. v. WTVJ, Inc., 5 Cir., 268 F.2d 346; N.L.R.B. v. Empire Mfg. Corp., supra; N.L.R.B. v. Midwestern Instruments, Inc., supra; compare N.L. R.B. v. Arthur Winer, Inc, 7 Cir., 194 F.2d 370, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 819, 73 S.Ct. 15, 97 L.Ed. 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">The Order of the Board will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-17\">.

As to what was said at the time of discharge, Harrington testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">\u201c * * * He said, \u2018Well, you have been causing me too much trouble.\u2019 I said, \u2018Mr. Browning, what do you mean by causing you too much trouble?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Well,\u2019 he says, \u2018you have been slapping the hand that feeds you\u2019 and I said, What do you mean I have been slapping the hand that feeds you\u2019 and he says, \u2018You know what I am talking about, man, let\u2019s not go into details about that. I have another beef, you have been coming in late.\u2019 I said, \u2018What do you mean coming in late?\u2019 He said, Well, you are always the last man to leave the dock.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m not always the last man to leave the dock\u2019 but he says, \u2018Irregardless, I\u2019m going to have to let you go, and I\u2019ll talk to Howard about it this evening.\u2019 I said, What have I done, Mr. Browning?\u2019 and I says, \u2018Is there something that happened on my route?\u2019 He says, \u2018No, if I had thirty more men like you, I would have it made. You are the best salesman I have got\u2019 and I said, Well, is it for union activities?\u2019 He says, \u2018I\u2019m not going into any subject about the union\u2019 and he said, we talked, and I asked him, I said, \u2018Well, haven\u2019t I been doing a good job selling your merchandise?\u2019 He says, \u2018Yes, you\u2019re doing the best.\u2019 I said, What do you mean by causing you too much trouble?\u2019 He said, \u2018You know what I mean, I don\u2019t have to make any pictures for you.\u2019 He says, \u2018I\u2019ll talk to Howard tonight and we\u2019ll let you know how much time you can have.\u2019 and that evening when I came in, Mr. Howard said, Well, boy, Mr. Browning told me to let you go.\u2019 That is it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b999-8\">. A statement of this Court in N.L.R.B. v. Midwestern Instruments, Inc., is applicable here [264 F.2d 830] : \u201cThere is substantial conflict in the evidence in this case. There is evidence from which the examiner and the Board could have found that Neuman was discharged for valid reasons and not in violation of the Act, rather than as found by the Board that he was discharged in violation of the Act.
