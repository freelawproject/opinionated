The facts and issues are set forth in detail in the opinion of Judge Morris, reported at 1953, 111 F.Supp. 593.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After considering the contentions advanced, it is clear to us that appellant has never been an American citizen. See, in addition to the authorities cited in 111 F.Supp. at 597, the legislative history of Section 5 of the Act of March 2, 1907, ch. 2534, 34 Stat. 1229,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the statutory provision relied on by appellant. H.R.Doe. No. 326, 59th Cong., 2d Sess. 33, 35 (1906); see also H.R.Rep. No. 1110, 67th Cong., 2d Sess. 2, 3 (1922). The judgment of the District Court must therefore be Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-17\">. The reasons for the delay in bringing on the appeal need not be recited here. We note, however, that appellant does not appear to have been personally neglectful of the appeal, nor has his present attorney \u2014 one of several retained from time to time by appellant \u2014 been dilatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b640-28\"> Now 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1432.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
