The order of the District Court stated that the motions to proceed in forma pauperis and to vacate the sentence were without merit and frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">Appellant has filed a motion in this Court to proceed in forma pauperis in the appeal from the order of the District Court. He has had the assistance of court-appointed counsel in the preparation of the brief in support of said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">The Court being of the opinion that the appeal is without merit and that it was not error on the part of the District Judge to overrule appellant\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, It Is Ordered that appellant\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis be and is denied.
