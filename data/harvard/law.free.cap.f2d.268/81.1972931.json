It thus does not present a situation which warrants the application of the so-called Me-Nabb-Mallory rule. Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L. Ed.2d 1479. This case is ruled in all respects by Papworth v. United States, 5 Cir., 256 F.2d 125, in which case we discussed the inapplicability of the Mallory rule to cases where confessions are made to federal officers by an accused who is in the custody of state officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-23\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
