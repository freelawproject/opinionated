Rule 304 was adopted pursuant to Section 145, which authorizes the Commissioner to \u201cappoint\u201d the time within which suits under that section may be brought.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Plaintiff-appellant\u2019s complaint under Section 145 was filed in the District Court one day late, i. e., on the sixty-first day after the decision of the Board of Appeals. When the Commissioner filed an answer raising the point, plaintiff petitioned the Commissioner for an extension of time within which to file suit. The Commissioner ruled that he was without authority to grant any such extension. Plaintiff then filed a supplemental complaint asking the District Court to declare that the Commissioner has such authority, which he may exercise in his discretion. This was denied by the District Court, which granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">Rule 183 of the Patent Office Rules provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-12\">\u201cIn any extraordinary situation, when justice requires, any requirement [of these rules] which is not a. requirement of the statutes may be-suspended or waived by the Commissioner in person on petition of the-interested party, subject to such other requirements as may be imposed.\u201d 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.183 (1949).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am-\">We think the sixty-day provision iir Section 304 of the Rules, made pursuant to the authority given the Commissioner by <em>Section 145 to </em>\u201cappoint\u201d the time for bringing suit, is not a \u201crequirement of' the statutes\u201d within the meaning of Rule 183. Accordingly, under the Rules as presently drawn, the Commissioner may suspend or waive the sixty-day limit of Rule 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">The judgment of the District Court will be reversed and the cause remanded. On remand, the District Court shall render a declaratory judgment decreeing (1) that the Commissioner has power in his-discretion to permit a late filing of the-complaint under Rules 183 and 304 of the-Patent Office Rules of Practice, and (2) that he should reconsider appellant\u2019s petition for an extension of time and render decision with respect thereto on its-merits. Pending the Commissioner\u2019s action, the original complaint shall be held in abeyance. We express no opinion oa other matters argued to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-7\">. Buie 304 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">\u201cThe time for * * * commencing a civil action * * * is sixty days from the date of the decision of the Board of Appeals or the Board of Patent Interferences.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-9\">. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">\u201cAn applicant dissatisfied with the decision of the Board of Appeals may unless appeal has been taken to the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, have remedy by civil action against the Commissioner in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia-if commenced within such time after such-decision, not less than sixty days, as the-Commissioner appoints. The court may adjudge that such applicant is entitled\u2019 to receive a patent for his invention, as: specified in any of his claims involved<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the decision of the Board of Appeals, as the facts in the case may appear and' such adjudication shall authorize the-Commissioner to issue such patent on: compliance with the requirements of law.
