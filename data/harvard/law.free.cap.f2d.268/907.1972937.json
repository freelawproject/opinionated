Having to no avail attacked (since January 3, 1959) the \u201cterritorial\u201d court\u2019s jurisdiction in that court and being under the threat of impending trial there, Parker asks us to issue a writ of prohibition or a writ of mandamus to stop the proceedings there. Petition to file the petition heretofore lodged is granted and the petition is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-17\">It seems clear that the effect of the Enabling Act is to generally restrict this court\u2019s jurisdiction on decisions or judgments rendered in Alaska after January 3,1959, to those coming up from the newly created U. S. District Court for the District of Alaska. It is possible that the \u201cDistrict Court for the District of Alaska\u201d is in existence now and is just not staffed, or it may be that it comes into existence when the President appoints <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>the federal district judge therefor. That is a question we do not decide. No one has suggested that the \u201cterritorial court\u201d which continues to act is the new United States District Court for the District of Alaska. And, such a suggestion could have no sensible basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">It would appear that the amendments to Titles 18 and 28 made by Section 12 of the Enabling Act would automatically restrict our Alaska jurisdiction on \u201cnew business\u201d to the United States District Court for the District of Alaska. Further, we think that is the net express effect of Sections 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, when read together.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">The subject of this petition presents a very practical problem for all Alaska. This court is asked to ascertain and define the nature of the continued interim United States District Court (with its four divisions) for the Territory of Alaska and to base its decision herein upon that determination. In our view it would be unwise to accept the invitation. We believe that having said the interim court is not the United States District Court for the District of Alaska we cannot speak authoritatively beyond that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">We are urged by Parker to issue a writ to protect our eventual jurisdiction when Parker\u2019s problems come to us through the United States District Court for the District of Alaska. We can predict that there will be life in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, but that Parker would have some cause for appeal or that he would even be prosecuted there is too speculative for us to issue an extraordinary writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">In the spirit of helpfulness we might give our views on the current Alaska court situation, but if we cannot speak with the authority of a pronouncement that is required for decision, we deem it unwise to speculate as to the nature of the interim court. Thus, we must leave it on the basis of that which it is not, rather than on that which it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">Sections 12-18, Alaska Enabling Act.
