Horton, 92 Texas, 21, in which it was held that a bicycle was not exempt to an \u201carchitect and building superintendent,\u201d although it was in substance \u2022alleged that a bicycle or some other means of rapid locomotion was necessary in the prosecution of that \u201ctrade or profession-\u201d The reasons .given in the able opinion of Justice Eainey in that case, and expressly approved by the Supreme Court, are equally applicable to the case at bar, and need not be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The plea of reconvention alleged, though in very general terms, that appellees had sustained damage from the wrongful suing out of the writ of injunction \u201cin the sum of the value of said property,\u201d and so the court found. The plea was not excepted to, and' the record contains no statement of facts. We could not, therefore, disturb the judgment for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Whether or not we should give damages for delay,'the case having been submitted on suggestion of delay, is not so clear; but we have finally \u2022concluded to affirm the judgment without adding such damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"Ai5\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Counsel for appellant calls our attention to the fact that there is a bill of exceptions in the record which contains a statement of all the facts proven on the trial affecting the issue of damages, which it is insisted should be treated as a statement of facts; but in thus seeking to have us pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the judgment, the learned counsel must have overlooked the rule of practice long since established in this State by the decisions of our Supreme Court, that it is inadmissible to substitute a bill of exceptions for a statement of facts. Carolan v. Jefferson, 24 Texas, 230, and Roundtree v. City of Galveston, 42 Texas, 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">We must therefore adhere to the conclusions already announced,' and overrule the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
