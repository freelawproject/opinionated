It also provides: \u201cJustices of the peace shall have jurisdiction in civil matters of all cases where the amount in controversy is two hundred dollars or less, exclusive of interest.\u201d Id., see. 19. Our statute follows the Constitution, and fixes the jurisdiction of the two courts in civil cases by the same amounts, exclusive of interest. Rev. Stats., arts. 1154, 1568.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Rule 19 for district courts provides that notes and all other written instruments may be filed with the petition as exhibits, and referred to and made a part of it, \u201cbut will not thereby relieve the pleader from making the proper allegations of which said exhibits may be the evidence in whole or in part.\u201d In Burks v. Watson, 48 Texas, 114, Chief Justice Roberts said the puropse of an exhibit is to set forth in detail that which the pleading has in more general terms alleged, but not to supply entirely the omission of allegations necessary to present a good cause of action. An exhibit to the petition, therefore, may be said to be made in aid or in elucidation of allegations; but it does not by itself constitute allegations upon which issues may be formed, irrespective of the allegations made in relation to it.\u201d See also Guadalupe County v. Johnston, 1 Texas Civ. App., 713; Macdonald v. Railway, 60 Texas, 594; Seastrunk v. Loan Co., 34 S. W. Rep., 466, and cases cited. These cases but declare the elementary principles of pleading. That part of the note which stipulates for attorney\u2019s fees is not declared on in the petition, and the praj^er for such fees is not of itself sufficient to supply the want of an allegation of a promise to pay them. The matter in controversy in this ease was $200, exclusive of interest, and the county court had no jurisdistion thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
