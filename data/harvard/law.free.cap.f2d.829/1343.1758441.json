In the ensuing lawsuit, the district court held that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 gave no remedy for discrimination against aliens by private persons, deciding, as well, other questions not pertinent here. It did so despite our contrary decision in <em>Guerra v. Manchester Terminal Corp., </em>498 F.2d 641 (1974), because it believed that <em>Guerra </em>had been wrongly decided and was no longer good law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A panel of our court reversed, 808 F. 2d 1082; and we took the appeal en banc to resolve the issue \u2014 a vexed and difficult one of its very nature, rendered more urgent by recent developments in Immigration Law familiar to anyone likely to read these words.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-22\">The question is whether in this day and time we should link together inseparably the legal protections accorded all persons against race-prejudice by their fellows in our society with those accorded the foreign nationals among us against alienage discrimination. Reflection persuades us that they would be curious mates in harness: the impulses that might move Smith, a white United States citizen, say, to discriminate against Jones, a black United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>citizen, are unlikely, we think, to bear much in common with those which might move him to discriminate against Kirov, a Ukranian citizen of the U.S.S.R. legally resident in this country \u2014 let alone against Lopez, an illegal Mexican immigrant. Yet \u00a7 1981, which commences with the phrase \u201cAll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d applies equally to Jones, Kirov and Lopez, if given its broad, literal meaning. It has been said that there is no greater injustice than to treat unequal things equally,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we are not disposed to do so in this instance unless the Congress has clearly demanded it. This it has not done in the instance of \u00a7 1981, a statute of all but Constitutional sweep and breadth; and, for the reasons that follow, we decline to yoke \u00a7 1981\u2019s protections against alienage discrimination to those against discrimination on racial grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">\n<em>The Statute and Its History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqNl\">Section 1981 declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-6\">All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, to be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefits of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1419-7\">Since 1968, when the Supreme Court, in <em>Jones v. Alfred Mayer Co., </em>392 U.S. 409, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189, commenced recalling the Civil War Rights Statutes into service after a century\u2019s desuetude, countless words and endless energy have been expended by courts, including the Supreme Court, in attempts to assign meaning and rational limits to these broad and majestic enactments. The extreme difficulty of this task stems in great part from the Court\u2019s initial rejection, in <em>Jones, </em>of what seems the natural interpretation of \u00a7 1981: that it directs States and Territories to grant each and every group of humans, no matter how defined or classified, the same rights in their <em>courts </em>and under their <em>laws </em>as they grant white citizens \u2014 no more, no less. If this natural construction be rejected, another is not easily found, much as though a student had been told that any answer was acceptable as the sum of two plus two except four and directed to find another suitable one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Four members of the Court have since expressed varying degrees of disagreement with this rejection, see <em>Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160, 186-214, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2602-2615, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976); but it of course forecloses the acceptance of any such construction by us. Whatever \u00a7 1981 may mean, then, it is not what it seems to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-11\">The panel opinion in this appeal, as well as <em>Jones </em>and subsequent Supreme Court opinions, laboriously traced and retraced the genesis of the Civil War Statutes in the 1866 Civil Rights Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the 1870 Voting Rights Act;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and there is scant need to do so again today. Suffice it to say that <em>Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160,170, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2594, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976), determined that \u00a7 1981 derived in part from \u00a7 1 of the 1866 Act. The concern in <em>Runyon </em>was racial discrimination in matters of private contract, and the Court\u2019s emphasis fell naturally and properly on that source for \u00a7 1981 which treated of racial discrimination against citizens and others. Insofar as it extends protection against non-racial discrimination to aliens, however, \u00a7 1981 of necessity derives from a different source\u2014 the 1866 Act having had nothing to say on the subject of alienage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-12\">As the Supreme Court has noted, the 1866 Civil Rights Act \u2014 which concerned it<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>self primarily with <em>racial </em>discrimination against <em>citizens </em>\u2014 was principally motivated by a Congressional purpose to extirpate the Black Codes, Southern laws imposing a wide range of civil disabilities upon the newly-freed blacks. <em>General Building Contractors Ass\u2019n. v. Pennsylvania, </em>458 U.S. 375, 386, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 3147, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982). Section 16 of the 1870 Voting Rights Act, by contrast, from which \u00a7 1981\u2019s protection for aliens is derived, had a different source \u2014 a legislative stream that sprang from the solicitude of its sponsor, Senator Stewart of Nevada, toward Chinese aliens subject to degrading treatment under the laws of California.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">Section 16 had its genesis in a resolution proposed by Senator Stewart and unanimously approved by the Senate on December 6, 1869:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-5\">RESOLVED, That the Committee on the Judiciary be requested to inquire if any States are denying to any class of persons within their jurisdiction the equal protection of the law, in violation of treaty obligations with foreign nations and of <em>section one of the fourteenth amendment </em>to the Constitution; and if so, what legislation is necessary to enforce such treaty obligations and such amendment, and to report by bill or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acl\">Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-10\">About a month later, Senator Stewart introduced a bill, S.365, which became a foundation of the law which we construe.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In doing so, he described his view of the effect of S.365:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-11\">The original civil rights bill protected all persons born in the United States in the equal protection of the laws. This bill' extends it to aliens, so that all persons who are in the United States shall have equal protection of our laws. It extends the operation of the civil rights bill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>which is well known in the Senate and to the country, to all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States. That is all there is in the bill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">Cong. Globe at 1536.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">It is chiefly on the basis of part of this passage, the assertion that the bill \u201cextends the operation\u201d of the 1866 Act to aliens, that our panel in <em>Guerra, </em>498 F.2d at 653, and the district court in <em>Espinoza v. Hillwood Square Mutual Ass\u2019n., </em>522 F.Supp. 559 (E.D.Va.1981), which followed <em>Guerra\u2019s </em>reasoning, concluded that \u00a7 16 was meant to forbid private alienage discrimination. This construction of his words, however, follows only on the assumption that Senator Stewart viewed the 1866 Act as reaching private discrimination \u2014 a dubious assumption indeed in view of his repeated reference to equal protection of the laws. As the passage quoted below makes perhaps too amply clear, his remarks are literally peppered with such references. Considering these and the actual words of S.365, it seems far more likely that Senator Stewart viewed the bill as directed at state action. The Revisers thought likewise in 1874, giving \u00a7 1981 its present title \u201cEqual Rights Under the Law\u201d; and the Supreme Court remained of that view at least as late as the <em>Civil Rights Cases, </em>109 U.S. 3, 16, 3 S.Ct. 18, 24, 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883) and probably much longer, <em>see Hurd v. Hodge, </em>334 U.S. 24, 31, 68 S.Ct. 847, 851, 92 L.Ed. 1187 (1948) (\u00a7 1982 \u201cis directed [at] governmental action\u201d and \u201cdoes not invalidate private restrictive agreements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">But to return to the legislative history of \u00a7 16, S.365 next surfaced when Senator Stewart offered a slightly modified version as part of Senator Edmund\u2019s S.810, aimed to enforce fifteenth amendment voting rights. His remarks in doing so evidence unmistakably that he, as author and original sponsor, saw the provisions as implementing the fourteenth amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-9\">While [Chinese aliens] are here I say it is our duty to protect them. I have incorporated that provision [S.365] in this bill on the advice of the Judiciary Committee, to facilitate matters and so that we shall have the whole subject before us in one discussion. It is as solemn a duty as can be devolved upon this Congress to see that those people are protected, to see they have <em>the equal protection of the laws, </em>notwithstanding that they are aliens. They, or any other aliens, who may come here are entitled to that protection. If the <em>State </em>courts do not give them <em>the equal protection of the law, </em>if public sentiment is so inhumane as to rob them of their ordinary civil rights, I say I would be less than man if I did not insist, and I do here insist that that provision shall go on this bill, and that the pledge of this nation shall be redeemed, that we will protect Chinese aliens or any other aliens whom we allow to come here, and give them <em>a hearing in our courts; let them sue and be sued; let them be protected by all the laws and the same laws that other men are. </em>That is all there is in that provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-10\">Why is not this bill a good place in which to put that provision? Why should we not put in this bill a measure to enforce both the <em>fourteenth </em>and fifteenth amendments at once? The <em>fourteenth amendment </em>to the Constitution says that no <em>State </em>shall deny to any person <em>the equal protection of the laws. </em>Your treaty says that they shall have <em>the equal protection of the laws. </em>Justice and humanity and common decency require it. I hope that provision will not be left off this bill, for there is no time to take it up as a separate measure, discuss it, and pass it at this session.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1421-11\">Cong. Globe at 3658 (emphasis added). What more could he have said?</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-12\">The Senate passed H.R.1293 (including the provisions of S.365) the following day. Cong. Globe at 3690.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The rest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>legislative history of \u00a7 16 in both the House and the Senate<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> *is completely consistent with the soliloquy of its author and original sponsor Senator Stewart. <em>See </em>generally <em>McCrary, </em>427 U.S. at 195-205, 96 S.Ct. at 2606-2611 (White, J., dissenting) (reviewing the history of \u00a7 16 of the 1870 Act as part of his unsuccessful argument that \u00a7 1981 was derived entirely from the 1870 Act). Whatever the intentions behind the 1866 Act, it seems clear that the 1870 Act was passed as a statutory implementation of the fourteenth amendment, and that the Congressional intent as to it was to curtail <em>state </em>action discriminating unfairly against aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">Thus the legislative history: To us. it appears to indicate with great clarity that Congress\u2019s intent in passing \u00a7 16 was, in Senator Sherman\u2019s trenchant formulation, to <em>\"... </em>protect the Chinese against the local laws of California____\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 16 was never reenacted by the Congress, as was the 1866 Act as \u00a7 18 of the 1870 Voting Rights Act; and there is no further intent for us to seek than that with which it was originally passed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In Senator Stewart\u2019s recurring phrase, \u201cThat is all there is in the bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-13\">\n<em>Later Developments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-14\">Matters did not rest there, however. As we note above, in 1968 the Supreme Court entered upon a series of landmark decisions that called the Nineteenth Century Civil Rights Statutes back into service. The first of these, <em>Jones v. Alfred Mayer Co., </em>392 U.S. 409, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189, declared that \u00a7 1982 \u2014 a companion to \u00a7 1981 governing rights in property \u2014 forbade <em>private racial </em>discrimination. Justice Harlan, joined by Justice White, dissented, characterizing the opinion as \u201cmost ill-considered and ill-advised\u201d and raising against it the arguments rehearsed again by our panel at 808 F.2d, at 1092-1097. These need not be repeated here. Suffice it to say that, although they did not carry the day, by the time the Court next spoke in the general area they had apparently persuaded at least four members of it that <em>Jones </em>was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-15\">For eight years after <em>Jones </em>came <em>Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976), in which the Court transposed the \u00a7 1982 reasoning of <em>Jones </em>onto \u00a7 1981, holding that racial discrimination in matters of private contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>generally was forbidden by it. By now, serious misgivings about this course of reasoning had begun to trouble some members of the Court. Justice White, joined by (then) Justice Rehnquist, filed an eloquent dissent which built upon that of Justice Harlan in <em>Jones. </em>Justice Powell, conceding that he was almost persuaded by Justice White\u2019s reasoning, declined to join his dissent because he felt obliged to adhere to <em>Jones </em>and other recent decisions of the Court which he had joined; and Justice Stevens, declaring a firm \u201c...conviction that <em>Jones </em>was wrongly decided\u201d and \u201cwould have amazed the legislators who voted for\u201d the Civil Rights Act of 1866, nevertheless adhered to it as \u201can important part of the fabric of our law.\u201d 427 U.S., at 189, 190, 96 S.Ct. at 2604.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">But none of these opinions decides the question in today\u2019s case: whether these venerable enactments extend to forbidding citizens of the United States to draw <em>private </em>distinctions between other citizens and aliens on grounds, not of race, but of <em>nationality </em><footnotemark>12</footnotemark>. For us, of course, there is no question whether to adhere or not to <em>Jones </em>and <em>McCrary; </em>they are part of our marching orders, mandates which we can either obey or seek other work. But that is not the issue. The issue is whether, because the Supreme Court reasoned in a particular manner on one subject, we are obliged to extend that reasoning, when it seems to us \u2014 and not to us only \u2014 severely flawed, to a new series of situations to which the Court has not yet spoken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">The dissent cuffs the issue away in a few paragraphs simply reiterating the extension in <em>Guerra </em>\u2014 without stated reasoning or explanation \u2014 of <em>Jones\u2019s </em>faulty analysis from <em>racial </em>discrimination to private distinctions based on nationality. We think a decision which mandates, among other things, that a Libyan or Iranian citizen cannot legally be denied employment as a designer of coding equipment with a defense contractor on the grounds of divided loyalty merits a brief explanation of why it is thought to be required by statute. Convinced that a proper subordination does not require such a course of action and that good conscience argues against it, we decline to embark upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-9\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-10\">For the reasons expressed by Justice White in his <em>McCrary </em>dissent, and echoed by most observers who take the view that words have an ascertainable meaning, it seems to us beyond serious dispute that the reasoning of <em>Jones </em>and <em>McCrary </em>cannot stand of its own force. The Supreme Court\u2019s last expressions on the subject of whether \u00a7 1981 was intended to reach <em>private, racial </em>discrimination are to be found in <em>McCrary, </em>however; and these reflect the considered judgment of the Court as then constituted that, right or wrong, the issue has been decided and laid to rest. This is the voice of authority, and there\u2014 for our Court \u2014 the matter ends: it reaches such discrimination. Neither reason nor authority, however, constrains us to rule that it forbids the drawing of private distinctions between persons based on <em>citizenship. </em><footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-11\">Certainly reason does not; by the time of Justice Powell\u2019s resignation, a majority of the sitting Justices who had expressed official views on the point had concluded that <em>Jones </em>was wrongly decided. If it was, there is no occasion to extend its flawed reasoning to a new subject. Clearly authority does not require us do so, as the Court has not spoken to the issue and has hinted, at least, that it regards it as an open one.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It cannot be denied, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>that construing the same language to mean one thing as applied to one subset of \u201cpersons\u201d \u2014 blacks \u2014 and another as applied to a different one \u2014 foreign nationals \u2014 is awkward and undesirable. Indeed, it was on that basis that Justice White, assuming that the answer to the issue before us could only be as we decide it today, argued against the <em>McCrary </em>result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-4\">[A]s noted above, \u00a7 1977 [present \u00a7 1981] of the Revised Statutes was passed by Congress with the Revisers\u2019 unambiguous note before it that the section derived solely from the Fourteenth Amendment statute, accompanied by the confirmatory sidenote \u201cequal rights under the law.\u201d Second and more importantly, the majority\u2019s argument'is logically impossible, because it has the effect of construing the language <em>\u201cthe same rights to make </em>... <em>contracts ... as is enjoyed by white citizens, </em>\u201d contained in \u00a7 1977 of the Revised Statutes, to mean one thing with respect to one class of \u201cpersons\u201d and another thing with respect to another class of \u201cpersons.\u201d If \u00a7 1981 is held to be a reenactment of the Thirteenth Amendment statute aimed at private discrimination against \u201ccitizens\u201d and the Fourteenth Amendment statute aimed at state-law-created legal disabilities for \u201call persons,\u201d including aliens, then one class of \u201cpersons\u201d \u2014 Negro citizens \u2014 would, under the majority\u2019s theory, have a right not to be discriminated against by private individuals and another class \u2014 aliens \u2014 would be given by the same language no such right. <em>The statute draws no such distinction among classes of persons. It logically must be construed either to give \u201call persons\u201d a right not to be discriminated against by private parties in the making of contracts or to give no persons such a right. Aliens clearly never had such a right under the Fourteenth Amendment statute (or any other statute); \u00a7 1977 is concededly derived solely from the Fourteenth Amendment statute so far as coverage of aliens is concerned; and there is absolutely no indication that aliens\u2019 rights were expanded by the reenactment of the Fourteenth Amendment statute in \u00a7 1977 of the Revised Statutes of 187j. </em>Accordingly, the statute gives no class of persons the right not to be discriminated against by private parties in the making of contracts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">427 U.S., at 205-6, 96 S.Ct. at 2611 (first emphasis in original; second emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-7\">In the teeth of his argument, however, the Court did as it did; and in at least one later instance it has construed identical language to mean one thing as to one group, another as to a different one. <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978) (\u201cprevailing party\u201d in Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Fee Statute means one thing as to party plaintiff, another as to party defendant). In today\u2019s case, given the fact that \u00a7 1981 is a redactor\u2019s amalgam of two different enactments, each aimed at a different group, the objection, while troubling, carries less force than it would in such a case as <em>Christiansburg, </em>where a single enactment was differentially construed in respect of persons so as to favor plaintiffs over defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">Thus it appears that in today\u2019s case nothing in Supreme Court precedent forbids us to accord the words of \u00a7 1981 \u2014 as they apply to aliens \u2014 their natural meaning. Relieved of the <em>Jones </em>and <em>McCrary </em>gloss, applied by the Court to the subset of race-based distinctions, it is patent that these words circumscribe state action only. And, in addition to their obvious intent, various circumstances and developments since their resurrection as to race in <em>Jones </em>reinforce this conclusion. Many of these are peripheral and circumstantial, but added together they have weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-9\">One of these is the very innocence displayed by several well-informed observers present on the factual scene of any suspicion that \u00a7 1981 might have been intended to control citizens in their private dealings with non-citizens. That it was not so intended, Justice White, in his dissent partially quoted above, thought so obvious that he founded an argument upon it, one that \u00a7 1981 could not be held to cover private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>racial discrimination because to hold that it did would logically compel a parallel and unthinkable holding that it covered alien-age. And a few years before, in <em>Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co., </em>414 U.S. 86, 94 S.Ct. 334, 38 L.Ed.2d 287 (1973), \u00a7 1981 was not even advanced by counsel as an alternate ground in that lawsuit\u2019s attempt to equate alienage with \u201cnational origin\u201d discrimination for Title VII purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">As for Congress\u2019s view of the matter, it can scarcely be an oversight that, although it included the categories of \u201crace, color, religion, sex [and] national origin\u201d in the general Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>that of <em>citizenship </em>is nowhere to be found; and the Supreme Court has expressly held that the term \u201cnational origin\u201d as there employed does not embrace it. <em>Espinoza v.

Co., </em>414 U.S. 86, 94 S.Ct. 334, 38 L.Ed.2d 287 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">Instead, when Congress determined that because of its Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 there was reason to fear serious and widespread discrimination in employment on the basis of alienage, it enacted \u00a7 274B(a)(l) of that Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324B) to prevent this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-7\">It is an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or other entity to discriminate against any individual (other than an unauthorized alien) with respect to the hiring, or recruitment, or referral for a fee ... the discharging of ... [an] individual ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-8\">(A) because of such individual\u2019s national origin, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-9\">(B) in the case of a citizen or intending citizen ... because of such individual\u2019s citizenship status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-11\">These actions are hardly those of a legislator which was of the view that alienage is a category appropriately yoked to race in anti-discrimination legislation,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or that \u00a7 1981 already prohibited private employment discrimination on alienage grounds to the same rigorous and stringent degree as <em>McCrary </em>declares that it forbids such racial discrimination. Had such a law, with such prohibitions, been already in place, there would have been no occasion for the heroic exertions that must have been called for to pass such a provision as \u00a7 1324B. And, on the other hand, if \u00a7 1981 has been correctly interpreted by <em>Guerra </em>to protect all aliens, legal and <em>illegal, </em>from employment discrimination, then it necessarily follows that the 1986 Immigration Act either \u201crepeals\u201d \u00a7 1981 to the extent that it has been read to protect <em>illegal </em>aliens from employment discrimination or remits illegals to whatever their \u00a7 1981 remedies may be, while denying them any under the 1986 Act. Neither result seems one that Congress likely intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-12\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-13\">However laudable its cause and purpose, the reasoning which led the Supreme Court to construe \u00a7 1981 as reaching private racial discrimination has now been called in serious question by three present members of the Court itself, as well as by the late Justice Harlan and by retired Justice Powell. In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate for us to extend that reasoning across the board to forbid all private alienage distinctions, especially when the language of the statute is to the contrary, when the original enactment from which it was drawn even more clearly was limited to public alienage discrimination alone, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>when reasonable inferences from later Congressional enactments indicate a contrary intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">Racial and citizenship distinctions are things of a different kind. The former is, for the individual, immutable; the latter is not. The former our polity and increasingly our society as well are resolved, and rightly resolved, to have done with, root and branch, as representing an evil, always and everywhere. The latter is not so readily and roundly condemned: when all is said and done, patriotism remains a civic virtue; and one whose allegiance is bound to another nation may not be suited for certain callings in ours, as the Supreme Court itself has recognized.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And while the alien guest is not without his own special claims upon us, arising from our moral tradition,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> they are of a different quality from those grounded in our common humanity. For these reasons, we conclude that <em>Guerra </em>was wrongly decided and that its extension of the faulty <em>Jones </em>analysis, by simple fiat and without supporting reasoning, from race to nationality was improper. We overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">Except as modified by the panel opinion and by this opinion, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court and REMAND the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1418-13\">.

HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Asm\">specially concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-7\">I add this explanation of my resolution of what for me is the most difficult issue in this case \u2014 whether we are being faithful to our obligation as an inferior court to obey decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-8\">Obedience by inferior courts to the command of the Supreme Court is essential to the administration of our complex court structure. For the Supreme Court to fulfill its unique role set by Article III, the federal system simultaneously must encourage candid expression by inferior courts while demanding acceptance of the Supreme Court\u2019s role as the final arbiter. This inherent tension now is increased because the Supreme Court\u2019s annual capacity for written opinions is approximately 150, an apparent constant, while inferior courts are producing a rapidly increasing number of decisions. This reality reinforces the traditional values of stare decisis. As an inferi- or court we must not allow our version of a \u201ccorrect\u201d result to deceive us into semantic games of reformulation and hair splitting in order to escape the force of a fairly resolved issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-13\">The notion that as an inferior court we are free to strip content from principle by confining the Supreme Court\u2019s holding to the precise facts before it is a heady assertion indeed; that notion ignores our role. Our duty to the Supreme Court precedent is broader than our duty to abide our own precedent and that of courts on our level. When the duty of obedience flows horizontally and not vertically, a later court may appropriately after due regard for our necessary dependence upon panel harmony in a multi-panel court and to the values of stare decisis such as predictability and settlement of expectation, confine the first case to its facts by concluding, in the words of Karl N. Llewellyn, that: \u201cThis rule holds only to redheaded Walpoles in pale magenta Buick cars.\u201d Our duty is different when the reach of precedent is vertical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-14\">We are about words and ideas, not mechanics, and defining the margin of our duty is a slippery undertaking. That Justices Harlan and White detailed the statutory interpretation that we repeat today is not enough. It is true that at least five members of the court (before Justice Powell\u2019s retirement) have been persuaded that the earlier readings of history were wrong, but at least two of the five Justices would adhere to the holdings of <em>Jones </em>and <em>Runyon, </em>though they rested on a view of history the Justices no longer credit. Accepting these holdings our result admittedly is awkward. While it is awkward to conclude that identical statutory language reaches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>private discrimination on the basis of race but not alienage, the awkwardness is not conclusive. Justice Stevens has pointed out, the awkwardness arises because \u201c[t]he Court has broadened the coverage of \u00a7 1981 far beyond the scope actually intended by its authors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">The difficulty of two meanings in identical language is also mitigated by the circumstance that the Court, although abiding the holdings of <em>Jones </em>and <em>Runyon, </em>has been willing to make \u00a7 1981 fit with principles of the fourteenth amendment, even where \u00a7 1981\u2019s text might indicate otherwise. The Court did so in <em>General Building Contractors Ass\u2019n v. Pennsylvania, </em>458 U.S. 375,102 S.Ct. 3141, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982), holding that \u00a7 1981 prohibits only wilful racial discrimination. Justice Stevens explained that because in his reading the 39th Congress never intended for \u00a7 1981 to reach employment discrimination, the legislative history was an improbable source for answering the question of whether the statute should be read to forbid only intentional conduct. Because the statute itself did not require proof of intent \u201ca logician would be comfortable in concluding that no such proof should ever be required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>458 U.S. at 406,102 S.Ct. at 3158.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">Justice Stevens then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A04K\">Nevertheless, since that requirement tends to define the entire coverage of \u00a7 1981 in a way that better reflects the basic intent of Congress than would a contrary holding, I concur in the conclusion [that intent must be shown] ... insofar as it relates to the statutory protection of equal opportunity but, perhaps illogically, would reach a different conclusion in a case challenging a denial of a citizen\u2019s civil rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1427-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 406, 102 S.Ct. at 3158.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-8\">This suggests that the Court could accommodate <em>Jones </em>and <em>Runyon </em>with the conclusion that \u00a7 1981, in parallel with the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments, reaches private racial discrimination but requires state action for discrimination against aliens, in spite of the absence of supporting statutory language and the seeming incongruity that results. The vertical command of precedent in <em>Jones </em>and <em>Runyon, </em>then, although not completely clear, is not much more than the <em>ratio decidendi: </em>\u00a7 1981 reaches private racial discrimination. In these unique circumstances where the Justices themselves have peeled cases to their holdings, we are justified in declining an extension that in other circumstances we might properly be duty bound to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-10\">The matter is further complicated because we are asked to interpret a congressional enactment. Courts must be particularly circumspect in reconsidering decisions interpreting statutes. Just as a working federal judiciary demands vertical adherence to precedent, there is a point at which the orderly accommodation of law-making and law-interpreting demands that we resist reconsideration because Congress may well have acquiesced in prior statutory interpretations. Yet I see little reason to believe that Congress has assumed the <em>extension </em>of \u00a7 1981 that we today reject, especially given that, as Judge Gee notes, Congress has acted in a way inconsistent with the view that private discrimination against aliens is prohibited. Congress, however, has not signaled its disagreement with the Court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 1981 reach of private <em>racial </em>discrimination. <em>See Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160, 174 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2596 n. 11, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-11\">As made plain by this separate writing, I find the issue of precedent to be difficult, and it is only after pause that I have found the side of the line on which this case falls. While this is a close case, this is not a seldom encountered task. Only recently we confronted a similar problem in dealing with border searches. There, Judge Reavley, Judge Garwood and I concluded that <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>422 U.S. 891, 95 S.Ct. 2585, 45 L.Ed.2d 623 (1975), could not be given the restrictive reading that others would give it and we followed its command. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>825 F.2d 853, 873, 874 (5th Cir.1987). Persuaded that today we are adhering to a principled line, I agree that having ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>plained our position we ought to stand in place pending further direction from our superiors.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1428-4\">REAVLEY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AnB\">with whom POLITZ, RANDALL, JOHNSON, JERRE S. WILLIAMS, and W. EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">The majority today overrules <em>Guerra v. Manchester Terminal Corp., </em>498 F.2d 641 (5th Cir.1974), and holds that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 does not reach private discrimination based on alienage. I respectfully insist that this holding is foreclosed to us by the decisions of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">As early as <em>Takahashi v. Fish and Game Commission, </em>334 U.S. 410, 419, 68 S.Ct. 1138, 1142-43, 92 L.Ed. 1478 (1948), the Court, after quoting the predecessor of section 1981, stated: \u201c[t]he protection of this section has been held to extend to aliens as well as to citizens.\u201d The Court reiterated its commitment to this principle in <em>Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 377, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 1855, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971). In <em>Runyon v. McCrary, </em>427 U.S. 160, 168, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2593, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976), the Court stated: \u201c[i]t is now well established that ... 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 prohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts.\u201d Thus, under <em>Takahashi, </em>section 1981 bans discrimination based on alienage, and, under <em>Runyon, </em>it bans discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts. From these two premises the holding of <em>Guerra </em>necessarily follows: section 1981 forbids private discrimination based on alienage. By what lights can we construe this statute giving \u201cfull and equal benefits of all laws\u201d to benefit unequally the persons it protects?</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">The root and trunk of the majority\u2019s holding is the conviction that the legislative history of section 1981 as outlined by the Court in <em>Runyon </em>is erroneous. The author of a law review article is quoted in footnote 6 to say that the Court has misread the legislative history of the statute. Then we are told that the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning is \u201cseverely flawed.\u201d Suffice it to say that while authors of law review articles enjoy the luxury of finding Supreme Court reasoning \u201cseverely flawed,\u201d the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is not at liberty to decide a case on this ground. Incidentally, this court has followed the dictate of that \u201cflawed\u201d reasoning for a long time. Our leading case in this area is <em>Sanders v. Dobbs Houses, Inc., </em>431 F.2d 1097 (5th Cir.1970). As we said in <em>Guerra, </em>\u201c[w]e held in <em>Sanders ... </em>that \u00a7 1981 extends to private discrimination in employment, and we have reaffirmed Judge Clark\u2019s cogent <em>Sanders </em>opinion many times since.\u201d 498 F.2d at 654 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-9\">With due respect for Aristotle\u2019s injunction which constricts the majority, I take the law from the Supreme Court. But perhaps we should recall that Aristotle also said: \u201cby nature some are free, others slaves,\u201d <em>Politics </em>1254b32, and \u201cthe best state will not make the mechanic a citizen.\u201d <em>Politics </em>1277b33. Personally, I prefer the familiar maxim that \u201call men are created equal.\u201d It seems likely that the latter sentiment, rather than the Aristotlean one, imbued the intent of Congress when section 1981 was enacted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
