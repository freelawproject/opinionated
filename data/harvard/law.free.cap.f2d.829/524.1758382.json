An administrative law judge determined that he was not disabled within the meaning of the Act and was therefore not entitled to disability benefits. The district court affirmed the Secretary\u2019s determination, finding it supported by substantial evidence. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-25\">Appellant first asserts that the administrative law judge failed to fully and fairly develop the facts of his claim by not requesting a psychiatric or psychological examination to explore appellant\u2019s claimed non-exertional impairments. See <em>Kane v. Heckler, </em>731 F.2d 1216, 1219 (5th Cir.1984). Appellant argues that assertions of his examining physicians \u201cwere sufficient to place the Secretary on notice that a psychiatric or psychological examination was crucial to correct adjudication.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>It is clear that the claimant has a burden of proving his disability by establishing a physical or mental impairment. <em>Cook v. Heckler, </em>750 F.2d 391, 393 (5th Cir.1985); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(5)(A). Under the applicable regulations, if sufficient medical or other evidence is not provided by the claimant, the secretary is required to make a decision based on the information available. See 20 CFR \u00a7 404.1516 (1986). Under some circumstances, however, a consultative examination is required to develop a full and fair record. 20 CFR \u00a7 404.1517 (1986). The decision to require such an examination is discretionary. In <em>Turner v. Califano, </em>563 F.2d 669, 671 (5th Cir.1977), we stated \u201c[t]o be very clear, \u2018full inquiry\u2019 does not require a consultative examination at government expense unless the record establishes that such an examination is <em>necessary </em>to enable the administrative law judge to make the disability decision.\u201d (emphasis in original). See also <em>handsaw v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>803 F.2d 211, 214 (6th Cir.1986) (adopting <em>Turner\u2019s </em>expression that the AU\u2019s decision to require consultative examination is discretionary).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">At the outset, we note that appellant did not list a mental non-exertional impairment in his original request for benefits. Moreover, there is no indication in the record that he ever requested a consultative examination. Appellant relies solely on the following statements of examining physicians to support his claim of non-exertional mental impairments. First, in January 1984, when appellant was seen for chest pain he stated that \u201che had become emotionally upset\u201d and then developed severe left pre-cordial chest pain, associated with diaphoresis, nausea, and shortness of breath. Second, during a November, 1984 disability determination examination, appellant reported to a physician that he had become grouchy, angry, and depressed about his situation of being unable to work. \u201cMere sensitivity about loss of ability to perform certain chores, however, does not even approach the level of a mental or emotional impairment as defined by SSA regulations.\u201d <em>Fraga v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 1296, 1305' (5th Cir.1987) (citing 20 CFR Subpart P, App. 1, Listing 12.00). Thus, we conclude that not only did appellant fail to meet his burden in proving a non-exertional mental impairment, but that appellant also failed to raise a suspicion concerning such an impairment necessary to require the AU to order a consultative examination to discharge his duty of \u201cfull inquiry\u201d under 20 CFR \u00a7 416.1444 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Appellant also asserts that, contrary to the Secretary\u2019s determination, his cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> obesity, and manifestations of these ailments in debilitating pain render him unable to perform the full range of light work activities under 20 CFR \u00a7 404.-1567(b) (1986). We conclude, however, that the record contains substantial evidence supporting the AU\u2019s conclusion that none of these impairments alone, or in combination, prevented appellant from performing the full range of light work activities, or from performing his past relevant work. First, while appellant has a history of cardiovascular disease, the AU concluded that it was not manifested by signs, symptoms, and objective medical findings that meet or equal the requirements of a listed impairment in 20 CFR part 404, Subpart P, App. 1, Reg. 4. Additionally, while appellant has been seen on several occasions for complaints of chest pain, these episodes have been resolved during hospital stays, from the last of which appellant was discharged in \u201csatisfactory\u201d condition. Second, appellant also has a history of and is being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>treated for diabetes mellitus. This is a remediable condition and therefore is not disabling under the Act. <em>Epps v. Hams, </em>624 F.2d 1267, 1270 (5th Cir.1980). The record shows that when appellant follows his prescribed insulin treatment, the condition is controlled. There is no evidence of significant diabetic retinopathy or any motor disfunction. Third, appellant\u2019s hypertension was within the range considered mild to moderate by the medical profession. Appellant\u2019s hypertension was not shown to be disabling. <em>Lovett v. Schweiker, </em>667 F.2d 1, 3 (5th Cir.1981). Fourth, appellant claims that the AU gave no consideration to his obesity. While appellant did not raise this issue until his district court complaint, the record does not support such a contention. At the time of the hearing, it was reported that appellant weighed approximately 290 pounds. Under the Secretary\u2019s regulations, however, appellant\u2019s weight would have to exceed 328 pounds to satisfy the definition of obesity. 20 CFR part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1, \u00a7 10.10, table I.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Finally, appellant contends that the AU gave insufficient weight to his complaints of pain produced by his various ailments. The AU concluded that in light of the objective medical evidence the allegations of \u201csevere, uncontrollable illness and restriction of function for light work\u201d were not credible. While it is clear that the AU must consider subjective evidence of pain, <em>Scharlow v. Schweiker, </em>655 F.2d 645, 648 (5th Cir.1981), it is within his discretion to determine its debilitating nature. <em>Jones v. Heckler, </em>702 F.2d 616, 621-22 (5th Cir. 1983). These determinations are entitled considerable deference. <em>James v. Bowen, </em>793 F.2d 702, 706 (5th Cir.1986). The objective medical evidence and appellant\u2019s own testimony at the hearing require us to defer to the AU\u2019s credibility determination in this case. Appellant testified that he was taking nitroglycerine to relieve chest pain. Moreover, the AU emphasized the discrepancy in appellant\u2019s record concerning the state of his health when he stopped working. Appellant was still working when he applied for disability insurance benefits on July 10, 1984. In his application, appellant stated that he was unable to continue performing \u201chard work\u201d, implicitly suggesting he was capable of \u201clighter work.\u201d Additionally, appellant testified at his hearing that while seeking a new job, he submitted to prospective employers a resume that indicated he was in \u201cexcellent health.\u201d The AU concluded that the appellant considered himself capable of working and therefore discredited his complaints of debilitating pain. We conclude that the AU did not err in making its credibility determinations that appellant\u2019s pain did not prevent him from performing the full range of light activities or prevent him from engaging in past relevant work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-5\">. Appellant also advances the rather disingenuous argument that the district court applied the incorrect legal standard in determining the severity of his impairments, similar to that which we rejected in <em>Stone v. Heckler, </em>752 F.2d 1099 (5th Cir.1985), in denying benefits because appellant\u2019s hypertension was characterized as \"mild.\u201d While the AU correctly concluded that appellant's hypertension was of mild medical severity, he proceeded through the sequential evaluation to conclude at the fourth and fifth levels that appellant could perform past relevant work and could perform a full range of light work activities. We perceive no error similar to that found in <em>Stone v. Heckler, </em>where the claimant\u2019s request for benefits was prematurely denied based on an improper determination of \"non-severity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\">. The AU determined that appellant had the residual functional capacity to perform work related activities except for work involving lifting more than 20 pounds at a time and standing or walking more than 6 hours during an eight hour work day. The AU also concluded that appellant was capable of performing past relevant work as a janitor or a sitter despite his physical limitations. Appellant .asserts that the ALJ erred in concluding that he was capable of performing past relevant work as a sitter for an elderly gentleman because this work required lifting more than 20 pounds. Appellant argues that an inadequate record was developed concerning the physical demands of appellant's \"past relevant work\u201d and, at minimum, remand is required to fully develop the record. While the AU\u2019s determination may be upheld solely on its determination that appellant can perform the full range of light work required under 40 CFR \u00a7 1567(b), we note that simply because appellant cannot perform the lifting requirements of his past job does not mean that he is unable to perform \"past relevant work\u201d as that phrase is used in the regulations. Social Security Ruling 82-61 defines past relevant work as the actual demands of past work <em>or </em>\"the functional demands ... of the occupation as generally required by employers throughout the national economy.\u201d The Dictionary of Occupational Titles reveals that the occupation of sitter, or \"companion,\u201d one who cares for elderly, handicapped, or convalescent persons, does not impose functional duties upon appellant beyond his residual functional capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
