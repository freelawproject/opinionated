At ten o\u2019clock of the night of August 19, 1900, he was upon a platform maintained by the railway company owning and operating the line, at the side of the track, for the use of passengers on its cars. The night was dark. The platform was level with the street which the railway crossed at this point, but the other end of the platform was four feet above the ground. The plaintiff walked forward, when the car came, to enter the smokers\u2019 compartment. The platform being shorter than the car, unlighted, and having no guard rail at the forward end, plaintiff stepped off and fell four feet to the ground and. sustained a fracture of both bones of his right leg.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-5\">\u2022 July 12, 1899 (before the date of the injury), The Akron, Bedford &amp; Cleveland Company had been merged with the street railway company operating the Akron city lines, and the consolidated company thus formed was known as The Northern Ohio Traction Company, which on August 19th owned and operated the interurban line, but the interurban cars bore the name \u201cAkron, Bedford &amp; Cleveland,\u201d and the plaintiff and his attorneys' believed that the company of the same name still owned and operated the railway when the petition herein was filed</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>For brevity we now designate the two companies The A.

Ford, Snyder &amp; Henry, became the attorneys of The N. O. T. Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-7\">Summons was served on The A. B. C. Co. by copy delivered to its president, H. A. Everett, September 26, 1900. The answer to the petition was filed October 13, 1900, <em>as the answer of The A. B. C. Co., </em>but it was prepared and filed at the instance of The N. O. T. Co. by Ford, Snyder &amp; Henry, formerly attorneys of the former company, now attorneys of the latter company, who signed as \u201cattorneys for The A. B. C. Co.,\u201d though they were then under pay of The N. O. T. Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-8\">From that time till October 17, 1906, there were notices to, and continuances with the consent of, said attorneys, and a deposition was taken to which they appeared \u201cas attorneys for The A. B. C. Co.\u201d On the last-named date the plaintiff moved for leave to amend the petition by substituting the name of The N. O. T. Cot as defendant in place of The A. B. C. Co. The leave was granted, The N. O. T. Co. objecting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-9\">An amended petition was filed May 17, 1909, and the answer of The N. O. T.

The first trial resulted in a verdict for defendant. A new trial was granted and a verdict was returned for plaintiff, upon which judgment was entered for $2,000 and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Error was prosecuted to the circuit court, which reversed the judgment on the grounds: (1) That the common pleas court erred in permitting the substitution of The N.

Ong, Thayer &amp; Mansfield, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-7\">As the court of common pleas ordered the substitution of The N. O. T. Co. for The A. B. C. Co., reserving only the question of jurisdiction so to do, and no bill of exceptions was taken thereon, the only question which arises on this point concerns the power of the court to make such substitution. <em>Caldwell Furnace Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>The Peck-Williams on Heat. &amp; Vent. Co., </em>6 C. C., N. S., 629, 76 Ohio St., 585; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Benedict, </em>82 Ohio St., 302.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-8\">The court had power to make such substitution. <em>L.

S., 319.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-10\">We insist that The N. O. T. Co. was carrying on the defense of this case in the name of a fictitious party, which would not only of necessity make The N. O. T. Co. the real party to the case, but would even as to it make the judgment therein <em>res adjudicata.

Rep., 851; 2 Black on Judgments (2 ed.), Sec. 539.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-6\">. The court had power to permit amendments to pleadings by striking out or adding the name of any party \u201cin furtherance of justice.\u201d Section 5114, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-7\">Such amendments are proper, and take effect as of the beginning of the original case. <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Tobbein, </em>103 Mo., 477; <em>School Town </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>104 Ind., 168; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Bills, </em>118 Ind., 221; <em>Snider\u2019s Exrs. </em>v. <em>Young, 72 </em>Ohio St., 494.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-8\"><em>Messrs. Ford, Snyder &amp; Tilden, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-9\">The plaintiff in error says that after the consolidation of The A. B. C. Co. with another company on July 12, 1899, it was no longer in existence; that it could not sue and be sued; that it had no actual existence and was a mere fiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-10\">The old companies are declared to be in existence so far as is necessary to preserve the rights of their creditors, and they may sue and be sued. <em>Compton </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>45 Ohio St., 592; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>C. H. &amp; D. Ry. Co., </em>16 O. D., N. P., 653.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-11\">The legislature having provided certain specific cases when the statute begins to run, from the discovery of the wrong, in all other cases the statute begins to run from the date of the wrong, and not from the date of its discovery, even though it may have been fraudulently concealed. <em>Fee\u2019s Admr. </em>v. <em>Fee, </em>10 Ohio, 470; <em>Howk </em>v. <em>Minnick, </em>19 Ohio St., 462; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Pomeroy Coal Co., </em>37 Ohio St., 583; <em>State, ex rel., </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>49 Ohio St., 137; <em>A.

B. C. Co. into the defendant company, though in fact a dissolution of the constituent company, did not destroy its existence in contemplation of law for one purpose. It is deemed still to have a being to answer the suit of its creditors; the legal entity survives the merger, with its property, for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Such seems to be the rationale of the case of <em>Compton </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>45 Ohio St., 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">But the opinion in that case refers to this legal conception as a <em>fiction </em>of the chancellor to protect creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>This seems necessarily to involve the idea that the merger of the two companies is nevertheless an actual blending of the absorbed and the absorbing corporations into one composite legal person. The notion of separate entity is only a figment of the mind, not appropriate to the case at bar, for the tort-obligor here is The N. O. T. Co., not The A. B. C. Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The composite or consolidated company, by express declaration of the statute, is liable for the obligations of the component companies. So that if a judgment had been- taken in the- case against The A. B. C. Co., that judgment would have immediately become the obligation of The N. O. T. Co. Therefore The N. O. T. Co. had an interest in the case, to. defeat a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The determinative question is: Did the latter company appear in the case?</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Stipulation No. 11 in the agreed statement of facts signed and filed in the suit by the plaintiff and the now defendant, The N. O. T. Co., gives the answer to this question. By that stipulation The N. O. T. Co. admits that the answer which its <em>attorneys </em>filed in the case was only <em>ostensibly </em>the answer of The A. B. C. Co.; that The N. O. T. Co. requested its attorneys to prepare and file the answer, and paid them for that service. The inference is that the service was rendered for The N. O. T. Co. at whose instance it was performed, and that the service was for the benefit of the latter company, which paid for the service, to defend it from liability for its own wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">The conclusion,, therefore, must be that the attorneys for The N. O. T. Co. who appeared only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>ostensibly </em>for The A. B. C. Co., which'was sued by mistake, appeared <em>in fact </em>as attorneys :for and in behalf of-The N. O. T. Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Our statute of amendments is-very -liberal. In furtherance of justice the court-may ainehd ahy pleading, process or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party or; a mistake in any other respect. Section 11363,' General Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The real party who did the wrong complained of was in court. It operated the railway on which it invited the plaintiff to become a passenger, under the name A. B. C. published on the'cars. The plaintiff naturally mistook The A. B. C. Company for the owner and operator of the railway, and sued it for his damage instead of The N. O. T. Co., the real party responsible for his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The court was right in amending the proceeding by substituting the name of the real defendant for whom its own attorneys appeared and made the defense for it in fact, though <em>ostensibly </em>for the company which was sued by mistake and \u25a0 whose legal personality, franchises, assets and obligations it had absorbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Having voluntarily come into court, though in the guise of The A. B. C. Co., and filed an answer in its own defense, though ostensibly for the nominal defendant sued by mistake, The N. O. T. Co. stopped the statute of limitations from running in its favor during the long period it graciously permitted the case to be continued in the false hope that the bar of the statute would ripen.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The clever argument made by counsel for defendant in error is that The N. Q. T. Co. was free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>to let the plaintiff deceive himself to the end of time; it was not the defendant\u2019s duty to \u201cundeceive\u201d him. True; and counsel frankly state that the defendant was aware of plaintiff\u2019s mistake but contributed fn no way to that mistake. True, also. But that mistake became a mere <em>irregularity </em>in the judicial formulary of the suit when the real party came to the defense wearing the mask of the formal party. A court of law is a dangerous place for masquerade, for the law looks beneath the apparent and beholds the real.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Counsel naively, assert that The N. O. T. Co. had a perfect right to employ counsel to defend for The A. B. C. Co. Yes; but at the risk of being substituted as soon as the plaintiff discovered he had sued the wrong company and that the right one was in court defending. Counsels\u2019 mistake was in thinking their client could enjoy the privilege of defending a lawsuit and dodge the responsibility that goes with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Assenting to the plaintiff\u2019s mistake, the defendant accepted the suit and thus cured the irregularity. <em>\u201cConsensus tollit errorem </em>is a maxim of the common law and the dictate of common sense,\u201d says Broom, citing Coke, \u201cfor <em>qui facet consentir\u00e9 videtur!\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The defendant\u2019s innocent mistake of law neatly and effectually corrected the plaintiff\u2019s innocent mistake of fact, and repaired the defect in the title of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\n<em>Judgment of the circuit court reversed and that of the common pleas affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b216-10\">Shauck, C.
