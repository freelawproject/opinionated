Churchill appeared and claimed the funds in; the hands of Eaton, by virtue of a' conveyance' of all the pro-. perty belonging to the - railroad company, made to them <em>in trust, </em>for certain purposes, January!, .1857. Eaton had been treasurer before'that time, and the funds in controversy were then in his hands. The corporation still continued in possession of the railroad and other property, :managing it for their' own use. But, in case of failure, by the corporation, to pay certain' bonds and' coupons secured by the conveyance in' <em>trust, </em>it was the right' of the trustees to take possession of and manage.the property, or sell it by auction, for the purposes specified in the conveyance to them.</summary>\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b208-7\"><em>Fox, </em>for Willis <em>&amp; al.</em></attorneys>\n\n<summary id=\"b208-9\"><em>That </em>the money in'Eaton\u2019s \u2019hands,\" was embraced in the deed of trust to Willi's <em>&amp; </em>Churchill: \u2014</summary>\n\n<judges id=\"b209-5\">Tenney, C.
