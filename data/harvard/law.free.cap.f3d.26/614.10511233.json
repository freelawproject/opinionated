The district court sentenced Towe to 108 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Towe appealed his sentence, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court erred by grounding his base offense level on the amount of precursor chemicals actually seized by the police, rather than on the amount of amphetamine that the seized chemicals could have produced. This Court found Towe\u2019s argument without merit and affirmed the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>In 1992, Towe filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, arguing that the district court erred by not reducing his base offense level for acceptance of responsibility. Concluding that Towe\u2019s claim \u201cis not cognizable under the limited scope of relief available under \u00a7 2255,\u201d this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Towe\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">In the instant \u00a7 2255 motion, Towe attacks his sentence on three grounds. He argues that: (1) he was entitled to be re-sentenced under the retroactive amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 involving waste materials used in manufacturing amphetamine; (2) he was entitled to be re-sentenced under the retroactive amendment to \u00a7 2D1.1 involving \u201creverse sting operations\u201d; and (3) the district court erred by not reducing his base offense level for acceptance of responsibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following the Government\u2019s response to his motion, Towe moved to amend his motion to assert only his first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The district court addressed all three of Towe\u2019s arguments. The court concluded that Towe\u2019s first two issues were without merit and that Towe\u2019s third issue already had been raised and rejected. The court also noted that \u201cMovant demonstrates a tendency to abuse the writ in requesting the same relief again.\u201d Towe\u2019s motion was dismissed with prejudice. Subsequently, the district court denied as moot Towe\u2019s motion to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\n<em>OPINION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The Government argues that Towe\u2019s claim is not cognizable in this \u00a7 2255 proceeding because a district court\u2019s technical application of the Guidelines does not give rise to a constitutional issue. Relief under \u00a7 2255 is reserved for transgressions of constitutional rights and for a narrow range of injuries that could not have been raised on direct appeal and would, if condoned, result in a complete miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Vaughn, </em>955 F.2d 367, 368 (5th Cir.1992). Nonconstitutional claims that could have been raised on direct appeal, but were not, may not be asserted in a collateral proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Although Towe\u2019s claim that his sentence was calculated incorrectly is not of constitutional dimension, Towe\u2019s challenge to his sentence based on the amended \u00a7 2D1.1 provision could not have been raised on direct appeal because he was sentenced in 1990, his direct appeal was decided in 1991, and the amended guideline did not go into effect until November 1, 1993. U.S.S.G., App.C, Amd. 484. Therefore, the issue is whether Towe has been subjected to a complete miscarriage of justice by the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Vaughn, </em>955 F.2d at 368. Towe\u2019s sentence was valid at the time it was rendered. The district court\u2019s failure to apply a guideline that was not effective at the time of sentencing does not give rise to a complete miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">However, in a motion to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion, Towe requested that his motion be treated as a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if such a reduction is consistent with the applicable policy statements issued in the Sentencing Guidelines. When a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the Guideline range applicable to that defendant has been lowered as a result of a retroactive amendment, such as Amendment 484, U.S.S.GApp. C, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment may be considered under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, p.s. The district court should have addressed Towe\u2019s motion to amend and thus addressed Towe\u2019s motion as a motion to modify his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962) (the denial of a motion to amend without substantial reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">Towe argues that Amendment 484, which modified application note 1 to \u00a7 2D1.1, requires that he be re-sentenced. He argues that, although Amendment 484 was not effective until November 1, 1993, it is designated to have retroactive effect. The Guidelines provided that Amendment 484 be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>retroactively; therefore, it would apply to Towe\u2019s 1990 sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Unless otherwise specified, the weight of a controlled substance set forth in the drug equivalency table refers to the entire weight of any mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of a controlled substance. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Prior to 1993, \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), comment. (n. 1.) provided that a \u201cmixture or substance\u201d had the same meaning as that in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (prohibiting the manufacture of controlled substance). This Court interpreted application note 1 to allow the calculation of a base offense by using the weight of a mixture containing a small amount of controlled substance. <em>See United States v. Sherrod, </em>964 F.2d 1501, 1509 (5th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 832, 121 L.Ed.2d 701 (1992), \u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1367, 122 L.Ed.2d 745 (1993), \u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1422, 122 L.Ed.2d 791 (1993), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 834, 122 L.Ed.2d 111 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">Amendment 484 altered application note 1 to provide that a \u201c[m]ixture or substance does not include materials that must be separated from the controlled substance before the controlled substance can be used.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, n. (1). Noting that the amendment addressed an inter-circuit conflict regarding the meaning of the term \u201cmixture or substance,\u201d as used in \u00a7 2D1.1, the Guidelines indicate that waste products which are used to remove impurities or form the precipitate of a controlled substance are not to be used in calculating the base offense level. Amendment 484, U.S.S.G. App. C (1993) (citing <em>Sherrod, </em>964 F.2d at 1509).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Towe argues that he was \u201carrested in an illicit drug laboratory with a flask containing 28.26 pounds of a mixture or substance containing 12.00 percent phenylacetone (1,538.2438 grams). The other 88.00 percent of the mixture or substance was waste water and waste by-products of the manufacturing process (weighing 24.8688 pounds) that were not controlled or marketable substances[.]\u201d The Government argues that Amendment 484 does not apply to the facts of Towe\u2019s case because, although chemicals such as formic acid, formaldehyde, and hydrochloric acid were present \u201cin this case,\u201d they were not included in determining the quantity of drugs possessed. The district court agreed, concluding that the 28.26 pounds of substance upon which Towe\u2019s offense level was based did not contain any additive chemicals. However, this Court\u2019s opinion addressing Towe\u2019s direct appeal supports Towe\u2019s claim that the total weight of the substance was considered, despite the presence of waste materials. Although this Court stated that Towe\u2019s offense level was based \u201con the 28.26 pounds of phenylacetone actually seized,\u201d this Court cited authority holding that \u201cin most cases where a compound containing a detectable amount of controlled substance has been seized, the total weight of this compound will be considered.\u201d <em>See United States v. McKeever, </em>906 F.2d 129, 133 (5th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1070, 111 S.Ct. 790, 112 L.Ed.2d 852 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">This Court has not yet interpreted the application of Amendment 484. Since the Amendment is applicable to the present ease, Towe\u2019s sentence would not be proper if based on an amount of mixture which contained waste products. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 1). However, it is unclear whether Towe was sentenced based on 28.26 pounds of phenyl-acetone, or based on 28.26 pounds of a substance containing only 12.00 percent phenyl-acetone. The presentence report (PSR) states simply that the total amount of drugs consisted of 28.26 pounds of phenylacetone, and the transcript of the sentencing hearing is contradictory.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">Under these circumstances, we believe justice will be best served by vacating the district court\u2019s judgment and remanding the ease with directions to grant the motion to amend and thus to address the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district court should then determine the actual amount of controlled substance upon which the sentence was based in light of the application of Amendment 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">The order dismissing Towe\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\">. Towe does not raise his original issues 2 and 3 on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
