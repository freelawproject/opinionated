The complaint also contained a count for unfair competition which was dismissed, but from which the plaintiff has not appealed. The defendant moved to dismiss the copyright count because the watch was not copyrightable, and so Judge Dimock decided. Hence he found it unnecessary to hold whether \u00a7 13 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, forbade an action for infringement because the plaintiff had obtained no certificate of registration. He held the design patent valid and infringed, and summarily granted a permanent injunction against the defendant because it had put in evidence all the earlier watches on which it relied as anticipations, and he thought that he was in as good a position to determine the issue of invention as he would have been after a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-20\">It is indeed true that only by an inspection of the design patent and of the actual watches put in evidence can their similarities and differences be compared; and that of course is true, not only as to the watches of the parties to the action, but as to those that the defendant put in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>evidence as anticipations. We shall not try to improve upon Judge Dimock\u2019s verbal description of the plaintiff\u2019s design patent and of the defendant\u2019s alleged infringing watch. That was as follows (155 F.Supp. 933-934):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Galaxy is a wrist watch made to sell at $325. Its distinctive feature is the appearance of its face. In place of numerals there are jeweled \u2018sticks\u2019 of equal length and width except the stick of the six o\u2019clock position which is shortened to permit the introduction of the name \u2018Le Coultre \u00a9.\u2019 The watch has no hands in the usual sense. Instead, transparent and practically invisible rotating discs, concentric with the round face, are substituted and, at a point at the perimeter of each disc, is a round mounting containing a jewel, one mounting being smaller than the other and presumably serving as an hour \u2018hand\u2019 while the larger indicates the minutes. At the axis of the discs appears a polygonal metal head cut with facets like a rose-cut diamond. Inside the ends of the sticks, and concentric with the discs, there is a circle graduated into sixty minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Elegance Constellation is made to sell at $295. In general appearance it is very similar to plaintiff\u2019s Galaxy, the difference being: (1) The sticks at the four quarter positions are the only ones that are jeweled while the others are knurled with much the same effect. (2) Instead of a short stick at six o\u2019clock, it is at twelve o\u2019clock and the word, \u2018Benrus\u2019 there appears. (3) Instead of the two round jewel holders on the invisible discs, there appears on one an arrow-shaped metallic indicator scored so that it reflects the light from two planes and on the other a triangular metallic indicator in which a jewel is mounted. (4) The head at the axis is flat and cut with a six pointed star instead of simulating a rose-cut diamond. (5) The circle inside of the ends of the sticks is not graduated into minutes. (6) Instead of the conventional attachments for the wrist band which appear on plaintiff\u2019s Galaxy, the Elegance Constellation employs lugs, of a shape somewhat similar to the angular points of the jaws on a pair of pliers, which give the watch case the effect of tapering from the greatest diameter of the watch to the point where it meets the wrist band.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">We first take up the copyright count. We do not think it necessary to decide whether the plaintiff\u2019s watch was copyrightable under \u00a7 5(g) of Title 17 U.S.C. which allows the copyrighting of \u201cworks of art; models or designs for works of art\u201d; arguendo, we will assume that it was. We think, however, that even so, \u00a7 13 of Title 17 forbade any action for infringement of the copyright when the Register of Copyrights had refused, as he did, to accept the watch as copyrightable under \u00a7 5(g). It is true that the few decisions on the question leave the answer uncertain. In White-Smith Music Pub. Co. v. Goff, 1911, 187 F. 247, the First Circuit affirmed a judgment dismissing an action for infringement in which the Register had refused to register the publication; but the only question discussed either in the Circuit Court of Appeals, or in the District Court (180 F. 256), was whether the plaintiff was entitled to an extension of the original copyright, which had expired. Judge Putnam did indeed say (187 F. 247) that, \u201calthough registration was refused, yet it [the plaintiff] fully complied with the requirements of law, and is entitled to maintain this suit if it had any statutory right to the extension.\u201d So far as appears, the defendant did not raise the objection, and it was not necessary to the decision which was against the plaintiff on the merits. The quotation was at best a dictum, and we do not deem it an authoritative precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">The next decision was of this court in 1921 (Lumiere v. Path\u00e9 Exchange, Inc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>275 F. 428), affirming a judgment dismissing an action for infringement, though without prejudice, because the copyright owner, the plaintiff, had deposited with the Register only one, instead of two, copies as the statute required. The point was not raised or decided whether, had the plaintiff deposited two copies and the Register refused to issue any certificate under \u00a7 209 of Title 17, the action would have succeeded. Thus this decision also did not pass upon the issue here at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Bouv\u00e9 v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation, 1941, 74 App.D.C. 271, 122 F.2d 51, was an appeal from a judgment of the District Court, 33 F.Supp. 462, in an action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 81(b), 28 U.S.C. to compel the Register to issue the certificate authorized by \u00a7 209 of Title 17. The question was whether a collection of \u201ccontributions to periodicals\u201d was a single \u201cbook\u201d and might be registered as such for a single fee. The Register refused to \u201cregister\u201d the \u201cwork\u201d except upon payment of a separate fee for each contribution, and both the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that he was subject to what, for brevity, we may still speak of as a \u201cmandamus.\u201d In discussing the Register\u2019s powers the court said (122 F.2d at page 53) that \u201cin light of recent trends and the divergent philosophies of different schools of thought as to what constitutes <em>art, </em>to sajr nothing of the large possibilities inherent in <em>plastic works of a scientific or technical character, </em>it seems obvious that, unless the Register has some power to control deposits for copyright, it may soon become necessary to build a new library annex. It seems obvious, also, that the Act establishes a wide range of selection within which discretion must be exercised by the Register in determining what he has no power to accept.\u201d It decided that his refusal was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and that the judgment of the District Court compelling him to register the \u201cbook\u201d was correct. It is the rule in the District of Columbia as well as elsewhere that \u201cmandamus\u201d should not go when another adequate remedy exists. United States ex rel. Frey v. Robertson, 1933, 61 App.D.C. 394, 63 F.2d 457; Calf Leather Tanners\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Morgenthau, 1935, 65 App.D.C. 93, 80 F.2d 536, 542. Therefore, the affirmance of the judgment below necessarily presupposed that no action for infringement would lie in which the question of \u201cregistration\u201d could be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In the case at bar it might be argued that the Register\u2019s decision whether the plaintiff\u2019s wrist watch was a \u201cwork of art\u201d within \u00a7 5(g) of Title 17 involved such an exercise of discretion that \u201cmandamus\u201d will not go to review it. It is true that \u201cworks of art\u201d is a loose phrase whose perimeter is hard to define; nevertheless, the decision here did not demand the exercise of a discretion that was conclusive with the Register. There were no disputed facts; and the mere fact that the meaning of the phrase, \u201cworks of art,\u201d admits of debate does not make it different from many statutes whose interpretation is every day regarded as reviewable by courts. The situation was wholly unlike that disclosed in Panama Canal Co. v. Grace Line, Inc., 1958, 356 U.S. 309, 78 S.Ct. 752, 2 L.Ed.2d 788, where the court said that \u201cthe * * * conflict rages over questions that at heart involve problems of statutory construction and cost accounting\u201d where there were \u201cmatters on which experts may disagree\u201d (356 U.S. at page 317, 78 S.Ct. at page 757), and where \u201cthe decision to act or not to act is left to the expertise of the agency burdened with the responsibility for decision\u201d (356 U.S. at page 318, 78 S.Ct. at page 758).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">We find confirmation of our conclusion in the text of the last sentence of \u00a7 13, for it denies the right to sue for infringement \u201cuntil the provisions of this title with respect to the deposit of copies and registration of such work shall have been complied with,\u201d and that imports more than the mere \u201cdeposit of copies.\u201d Since the owner must submit an application and pay the required fees in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>order to make a deposit, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 202.3(b) (1952 ed. Supplement V), we can think of no other added condition for \u201cregistration\u201d but acceptance by the Register. We therefore affirm the judgment on the first count because the plaintiff did not succeed in \u201cregistering\u201d his wrist watch as a \u201cwork of art\u201d under \u00a7 5(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Coming next to the design patent, we agree that Judge Dimock was justified in holding that the defendant had put in evidence all the prior art in the form of earlier disclosures and earlier watches on which it wished to rest its defense of anticipation. If validity was to be determined only by a comparison of these with the disclosure, and that was the whole of any possibly relevant evidence, it would have been proper to decide the claims summarily. However, we do not read the patent act quite so narrowly; the validity of design patents like that of all patents depends upon the general state of the industry involved. The amendment of 1952 \u2014 \u00a7 103, Title 35, \u2014 provides that \u201ca patent may not be obtained * * * if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">A design patent has no claims, so that it is impossible to select any specific combination of the features of the design on which alone its validity may rest; it will cover any combination of the component parts disclosed that is in fact new and was beyond the compass of a designer of ordinary skill. In the case at bar there were in the prior art \u201csticks\u201d and \u201cfloaters\u201d in combination, as for example in Gardner\u2019s clocks in 1946 (Des. Pats. 146,101 and 146,102). \u201cSticks,\u201d although not jewelled, were at times made of metal, and raised above, or depressed below, the face of the watch to catch the light and sparkle so as to give somewhat the effect of a jewel (Dupertuis, Des. Pat. 129,370 (1940); Exhibit 12, Defendant\u2019s Appendix, p. 74a). Moreover, in Exhibit 22 (Jaeger, No. 257,783 (1949) ) the face of the watch, which shows only the ends of the hour and minute hands in combination with \u201csticks\u201d was very close in appearance to the combination of \u201csticks\u201d and \u201cfloaters\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s patent here. However, even though we should say that this was <em>pro tanto </em>an equivalent of a combination of \u201csticks\u201d and \u201cfloaters,\u201d we do not find anywhere in the record such a combination in which these two elements were jewelled or otherwise made to sparkle.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">The issue, as we view it, is what was in fact the combination that caught the taste of the public and succeeded in attracting purchasers in large number; for a design patent like this, that has no utility as such, is directed only to appearances that please the taste. Assuming that the combination of \u201csticks\u201d and \u201cfloaters\u201d was old, that of making them sparkle was not. Moreover, a number of years had passed before the patent was applied for, during which all the elements of the design were disclosed; yet this combination had not been shown. That is a situation in which it was permissible to say that since the combination had been at hand for so long and turned out to be esthetically pleasing, it was a legitimate inference that it was not obvious to those skilled in the art. Nevertheless, it seems to us that it was necessary to adduce the testimony of those so skilled as to whether in their judgment it was the combination of the three elements that constituted the attraction of the watch. Without such testimony we cannot say that the success of the watch was not due to the skill of the patentee in marketing its goods. We must therefore await a trial in which the conditions of the industry may be explored before we pass upon the issue of validity. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for such a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"agf-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>We need not discuss the defendant\u2019s further defense that it was not possible to secure both a copyright and a design patent upon the same disclosure. The Supreme Court in Mazer v. Stein, 1954, 347 U.S. 201, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630, did, indeed, decide that the same disclosure might support a design patent and a copyright, but it expressly refused to decide whether the grant of either monopoly precluded that of the other. On the other hand in Korzybski v. Underwood &amp; Underwood, Inc., 1929, 36 F.2d 727, we held that the grant of a patent presupposed a dedication to the public of the disclosure, except so far as the statute specifically reserved it to the patentee. Since we are holding that there was no enforceable copyright in the watch, we need not now reconsider our decision; for we do not think that a copyright which is not enforceable, even though it may be theoretically in existence, is an obstacle to securing and enforcing a patent. The doctrine of Korzybski v. Underwood &amp; Underwood, Inc., supra, must rest upon the assumption that the owner of the statutory monopoly has some power to protect his \u201cwork,\u201d for otherwise any dedication would be without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The judgment dismissing the copyright count will be affirmed. The judgment granting a permanent injunction upon the design patent count will be reversed, and the cause remanded for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\">. See Lyon v.

All the judges who have passed upon the issues have substantially agreed that copying of plaintiff\u2019s watch would call for some remedial action by the court, but we have disagreed on the rationale to support this conclusion. The prevailing view to date appears <em>to </em>be that we should rest upon infringement of a design patent, a view which presents pitfalls and has limitations, as I shall endeavor to point out. To me the more workable, though possibly more novel, course is that of copyright infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">As the opinion herewith subsumes, a design patent is after all a patent, i. e., a government grant of a monopoly for a limited time for the development and exploitation of a really new contribution as the product of inventive genius\u2014 something more than \u201cwould have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. We have often stressed that \u201cit is not enough for patentability to show that a design is novel, ornamental and pleasing in appearance\u201d; it must be \u201cthe product of invention\u201d; \u201cthe conception of the design must require some exceptional talent beyond the range of the ordinary designer familiar with the prior art.\u201d Gold Seal Importers v. Morris White Fashions, 2 Cir., 124 F.2d 141, 142; Alfred Bell &amp; Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, 2 Cir., 191 F.2d 99, 104; General Time Instruments Corp. v. United States Time Corp., 2 Cir., 165 F.2d 853, 854, certiorari denied 334 U.S. 846, 68 S.Ct. 1515, 92 L.Ed. 1770. As we know, it is difficult for things mechanical to meet this test; it is substantially more difficult for mere ornamental designs to do so. In such crowded competitive fields as that of ornamented wrist watches it would seem well-nigh impossible to produce anything which can fairly be considered new invention, or a real advance over the prior art. At the most there can be only some rearrangement of well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>known elements. Just as our standard for mechanical patents which combine known elements is high, see, e. g., Jungersen v. Baden, 2 Cir., 166 F.2d 807, affirmed 335 U.S. 560, 69 S.Ct. 269, 93 L.Ed. 235, so in terms of the protection afforded, it should be no less high in the case of a design patent. Knickerbocker Plastic Co. v. Allied Molding Corp., 2 Cir., 184 F.2d 652, 654. Doubtless it is because of these quite obvious difficulties that, to my knowledge, our court has never sustained a design patent challenged for lack of novelty. If this patent eventually survives, it will indeed mark the case as novel.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">But for my part I do not see how this patent can possibly prevail against the prior art; there is literally nothing in it which can be considered even new. This, I think, is almost, if not quite, admitted with commendable candor in the opinion herewith, which calls the roll of some of the pertinent prior patents and shows the lack of novelty in the prior art of \u201csticks\u201d and \u201cfloaters\u201d in various combinations for clock or watch dials. The three patents cited in the opinion, those of Gardner, Dupertuis, and Jaeger, are particularly striking and \u2014when seen in illustration more vivid than cold description \u2014 really leave nothing more to be imagined. It is urged that the use of jewels to catch the light and sparkle can be relied on as a dependable element of novelty. But this is surely incorrect. For this element appears in previous patents, indeed as early as the Blumstein Design Patent 96,642 of 1935 for a \u201cwatch dial\u201d which used only four numerals, instead of twelve, and provided \u201cindications\u201d for the intermediate hours, \u201cthe indications being provided with baguette precious stones and the numerals being studded with precious stones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Even more striking, if possible, on this point was the deposition testimony of plaintiff\u2019s experts. Thus Sadow, one of its officers, testified that before plaintiff\u2019s watch came on the market sticks were used \u201cquite commonly,\u201d that he had seen <em>\u201ca </em>great many watches with jewels on the sticks,\u201d and that jeweled sticks and individual gems had been employed in line on a stick. Schwalm, a manufacturer of watch dials, went even further to testify that \u201c[djiamonds on the dials in place of numbers are a common practice\u201d for some 20 years before. Here I am attempting not a complete exposition, but only a brief summary of all the wealth of evidence disclosed of record ; thus I have not by any means covered all the prior watches, such as the Swiss \u201cMystere,\u201d whose \u201cintriguing sweep second\u201d surely forestalls plaintiff\u2019s conception. About all that Sadow could claim as an advance was the profusion of diamonds, i. e., the number, appearing on his dial. How that can constitute invention is not apparent to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Since the lack of invention seems to me so thoroughly demonstrated, I do not perceive the occasion for or any utility in the remand for a trial. It should be noted that this was not a judgment rendered upon mere affidavits; there were before the court, in addition to the many exhibits of the prior art, three important and revealing depositions, with full examination and cross-examination \u2014 the two noted above and a third that of a vice-president of the defendant. The opinion suggests a reaching out for some means by expert or industry testimony of sustaining a patent whose weaknesses have become apparent. But a reading of these depositions shows that nothing really new or informative can be expected beyond what these gentlemen, skilled in all aspects of the business, have already told us. I venture to suggest that any of us can write out in advance and almost word for word the testimony of the new opposing experts which the remand may be expected to produce. And I suggest that in no event can such testimony gloss over or obscure what the prior art has taught us. There may well develop an amusing, if unconvincing, anomaly in that the opinion seems to seek the impossible, namely, expert evidence that commercial success here was not at all due to advertising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>stimulation! But however the experts may jump on this point \u2014 and the exigencies they will face are intriguing\u2014 the earlier designs simply cannot be obliterated. The device of summary judgment should not be cloaked in pure theory, but should be viewed in purely practical settings. When it is so clear that further trial cannot add anything at all material to the process of decision, I do feel that the remand is rather an abomination to expectant litigants and harassed trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">On the other hand, the copyright concept affords a different emphasis, one much more directly in point in a case such as this than the patent concept of novelty or new invention. It is that of a prohibition for a term (one longer of course than that of the patent monopoly) against direct copying. Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 217, 218, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630; Alfred Bell &amp; Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, supra, 2 Cir., 191 F.2d 99, 101, 103.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Is not that the more direct issue here? The only difficulty, it seems to me, is our somewhat hidebound conception that copyright is somehow limited to writings. But this idea is now thoroughly dispelled by the Supreme Court, which in 1954 in the Mazer case upheld copyright protection of china statuettes of male and female dancing figures used as bases for fully equipped electric lamps. Justice Reed\u2019s scholarly opinion, with its detailed historical r\u00e9sum\u00e9, obviously gave new stimulus to the uses of copyright protection. It was the subject of extensive discussion in the law reviews, of which the comments in 39 Cornell L. Q. 725 and 68 Harv.L.Rev. 517 are perhaps representative. Already the Copyright Office had given a broad interpretation to the \u201cworks of artistic craftsmanship,\u201d such as \u201cartistic jewelry,\u201d as covered in the Regulations, 37 CFR \u00a7 202.10(a) (formerly \u00a7 202.8), 17 U.S.C.A. following \u00a7 207; note Justice Douglas\u2019 complaint in the Mazer case of the articles which have been copyrighted: \u201cstatuettes, book ends, clocks, lamps, door knockers, candlesticks, inkstands, chandeliers, piggy banks, sundials, salt and pepper shakers, fish bowls, casseroles, and ash trays.\u201d 347 U.S. 201, 221, 74 S.Ct. 460, 472. So in response to this precedent we have affirmed the copyright of ornamental jewelry, such as pins, bracelets, earrings, and the like, Boucher v. Du Boyes, Inc., 2 Cir., 253 F.2d 948, certiorari denied Du Boyes, Inc. v. Boucher, 357 U.S. 936, 78 S.Ct. 1384, 2 L.Ed.2d 1550; and the district court has supported the copyright of a necklace, Trifari, Krussman &amp; Fishel, Inc. v. Charel Co., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 134 F.Supp. 551. Hence I would conclude that these highly ornamented watches were equally entitled to copyright with the ornamental lamp bases in Mazer v. Stein, supra, 347 U.S. 201, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The opinion herewith, while assuming copyrightability for the purposes of decision, finds a technical barrier against all relief under <em>the </em>Copyright Act because the Register of Copyrights had refused a certificate. It should be noted that plaintiff sought registration first on September 13, 1955, and again on January 4, 1957, in each case with appropriate fee; and each time a certificate was refused by an official signing himself \u201cChief, Examining Division,\u201d on the ground that the work deposited was not a proper subject for registration of copyright. This was, therefore, purely a ruling of law which was erroneous and beyond the authority of the official making it. For reasons which I shall advance I doubt if the ministerial grant of a certificate is a condition precedent to a suit for copyright; but however this question is answered, it seems to me clear that a plaintiff situated as is this one is entitled to at least interim relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>against a defendant wrongdoer over whom the court has obtained jurisdiction. The plaintiff should at any rate have an injunction preventing further wrongdoing until it is able to seek mandamus against the Register in the District of Columbia. This act of simple justice \u2014 in view of the nature of copyright and the supplemental relief admittedly allowable on registration\u2014 would seem to me so clearly an obligation of a court of equity that most of the discussion of copyright in the opinion I find not immediately pertinent. But in view of its importance, as well as its bearing on the grant of either intermediate or final relief, I shall now discuss the issue of possible fetters upon suit for copyright infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The question arises because in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, at the end of a substantial and detailed direction for prompt deposit of copies with the Register, aimed specifically at a copyright owner with right already secured by appropriate publication, there is a concluding sentence providing that no action for copyright infringement shall be maintained \u201cuntil the provisions of this title with respect to the deposit of copies and registration of such work shall have been complied with.\u201d Quite obviously this puts the condition of complying with the law, including the deposit of copies, upon the copyright owner before he sues, though, under the case law cited below, it does not prevent or destroy the earlier accruing of a <em>right </em>to damages or profits. Here the plaintiff has complied with the requirements put upon it, and the only question is whether it must also assume the risk of waiting \u2014 perhaps until its right is lost by limitation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or otherwise \u2014until the Register has performed his statutory duties. So to conclude is to read this serious prohibition into the single word \u201cregistration,\u201d thus giving it a meaning which not merely is not required, but is actually belied by both the immediate context and the general statutory scheme of copyright.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">At the outset we should have in mind the distinction at times overlooked between copyrights and patents and between the respective duties and authorities of the Register of Copyrights and the Commissioner of Patents. A patent is a governmental <em>grant, </em>made by the Commissioner after careful examination and in the exercise of important quasi-judicial functions, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 131-135, with intramural appeal, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 134, and ultimate appeal to the courts, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 141-146 \u2014all as strictly provided by law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But beginning with the way in which copyright is obtained, the entire scheme of the Copyright Act is altogether different. Sec. 10 of 17 U.S.C. sets the tone by providing that copyright of a work is secured \u201cby publication thereof with the notice of copyright required by this title.\u201d That is all a defendant ever has to know to be on notice of plaintiff\u2019s right. After copyright has been thus secured, the applicant is directed to deposit two copies in the Copyright Office, together with a claim of copyright, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 13; this claim is made on an appropriate form, with statutory registration fee, 37 CFR \u00a7 202.3; the Register makes appropriate entry in his book, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 208; and the person recorded as the claimant is entitled to a certificate of registration, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 209. Note that 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 says nothing about the necessity for purposes of suit of this certificate, so fully described in purpose and effect in \u00a7 209. The whole implication throughout is that the Register must carry out the provisions of the law and has no judicial or discretionary functions such as has the Commissioner of Patents. True, there have been occasional attempts to find some area of discretion for the Register, as in Bouv\u00e9 v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., 74 App.D.C. 271, 122 F.2d 51; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>yet, as <em>that </em>case itself demonstrated, the ultimate conclusion has to be that it is his duty to obey the law and that mandamus will issue to require him to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Hence the one clear decision on the point says and holds: \u201cand, although registration was refused, yet it [complainant] fully complied with the requirements of law, and is entitled to maintain this suit if it had any statutory right to the extension [of the copyright].\u201d White-Smith Music Pub. Co. v. Goff, 1 Cir., 187 F. 247. This is very clearly decision and not dicta, both from its form of expression and from the fact that, once the right to sue was settled, adjudication was then made on the merits. Moreover, while Washingtonian Pub. Co. v. Pearson, 306 U.S. 30, 59 S.Ct. 397, 83 L.Ed. 470 \u2014 reversing the restrictive decision below, Pearson v. Washingtonian Pub. Co., 68 App.D.C. 373, 98 F.2d 245 \u2014 is not explicit on our present issue, its holding and discussion certainly tend in the same direction. It held that the right to sue under the Act for infringement is not lost by mere delay in depositing copies of the copyrighted work, a delay there of fourteen months after the date of publication and six months after the infringement. Thus the Court says, for example : \u201c * * * proper publication gives notice to all the world that immediate copyright exists. One charged with such notice is not injured by mere failure to deposit copies. The duty not to infringe is unaffected thereby. A certificate of registration * * * apparently may be obtained at any time and becomes evidence of the facts stated therein.\u201d 306 U.S. 30, 40-41, 59 S.Ct. 397, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Against this reasoning only this Circuit is cited as opposed; but even here the authority cited does not bear this out. In Lumiere v. Path\u00e9 Exchange, 2 Cir., 275 F. 428, where a suit was dismissed <em>without </em>prejudice, the court actually held that plaintiff had failed to take the proper steps; he had failed to file a proper registration <em>after </em>publication, and his first registration to claim copyright in an unpublished work did not carry over after publication. Hence it does not cover our case. Note, too, that the majority (following L. Hand, J., below) held that the right to sue was not lost, but only postponed until proper registration \u2014 the view later accepted in Washingtonian Pub. Co. v. Pearson, supra, 306 U.S. 30, 59 S.Ct. 397, 83 L.Ed. 470. So, two district judges have followed what they thought was the decision to hold suit merely postponed: Knox, J., in Rosedale v. News Syndicate Co., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 39 F.Supp. 357, and Noonan, J., in Algonquin Music, Inc. v. Mills Music, Inc., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 93 F.Supp. 268. (The only other case brought up, United States v. Backer, 2 Cir., 134 F.2d 533, dealt only with the question of the applicant\u2019s compliance with the statutory requirements.) In the Rosedale case Knox, J., says that he would properly accept the claim after formal registration by way of supplemental complaint. This eminently correct procedure points the way to clearly permissible procedure here; for we should at least direct the district court to hold this case, continuing the injunction, until plaintiff could persuade the Register to comply with the law and could then file a supplemental complaint, F.R.Civ.P., rule 15(d). No other way would fairly give the plaintiff the protection which the law has designed for it. But I add, Why go through all this crisscross, this unnecessary and delaying confusion of suits, when White-Smith Music Pub. Co. v. Goff, supra, 1 Cir., 187 F. 247, defines the simple and direct course ?</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Hence I would continue the injunctive relief granted by Judge Dimock below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>but on quite different grounds and to a quite different end than he has asserted in his opinion, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 155 F.Supp. 932.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-5\">.
