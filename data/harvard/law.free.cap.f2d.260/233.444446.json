In his \u201cClassification Questionnaire,\u201d filed December 28, 1951, he made no claim to being a conscientious objector. He was classified by the Local Board on March 7, 1952, as I-A, and was so notified. On June 23, 1953, he was given notice to report for examination on June 29, 1953, and on July 2, 1953, was advised of his acceptability for military service. He was mailed a form to complete, regarding his dependents, on August 17, 1955. He appeared at the Local Board on August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>22, 1955, and asked for deferment on the \u25a0ground of conscientious objection to war. He was furnished the \u201cSpecial Form For Conscientious Objector\u201d to fill out, which he completed and returned to the Local Board on August 29, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah5r\">Under the caption \u201cParticipation in Organizations,\u201d the defendant stated that he was a member of a religious sect or organization, namely the Radio Church of God, 363 Grove Street, Pasadena, California; that he became a member in January 1955; and that he attended Church in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"ao1-dedup-0\">The defendant signed paragraph (B) of \u201cSeries 1. \u2014 Claim for Exemption.\u201d That paragraph of the \u201cSpecial Form For Conscientious Objector\u201d reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlM\">\u00ab/\u25a0dn t t. \u201e (B) I am, by reason of my re- . , . . . , . ligious training and belief, con- . .. , . , ..... seientiously opposed to participation . <em>f </em>. <em>% * </em>,, m war m any form and I am further ___\u201e ,. . conscientiously opposed to partid-pation in noncombatant training and service in the Armed Forces.

In other wordS; (If <em>I </em>should do and knowing it was wrong I would have willfully sinned.) This I believe would be an unpardonable Sin. No man on earth is working for my Salvation. Only I can choose Right from Wrong, for my own personal Salvation. If I am to be in God\u2019s Church I must obey his commandments. Therefore I am appealing to you the President of the Board, please take this into consideration. It is not my Will to stay out of the Service, but God\u2019s will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajk-dedup-0\">He was given notice to appear before the Local Board, and did so on October 21, 1955, when his case was reopened. He was again Classified I-A. He appealed from the action of the Local Board. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>His file was transferred to the Department of Justice for investigation and a hearing pursuant to Section 6(j) of the Act. The defendant was furnished a.r\u00e9-sum\u00e9 of the reports of the Federal Bureau of Investigation with respect to his claim for exemption, and he was accorded , . \u201e ,, TT . a hearing before the Hearing Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"Agn\">The Chief of the Conscientious Objector Section of the Department of Justice, on June 21, 1956, sent his report and recommendation to the Appeal Board, Western District of Missouri, from which we quote the following: \u00b0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ane\">. , ,, , The Hearing Officer found that statements of the registrant and of his wife were reasonably forthright, and he did not doubt that the registrant is \u2018intending to be sincere in his claim to exemption on the grounds of religious training and belief.\u2019 However, the Hearing Officer found that registrant \u2018is still somewhat immature in his thinking, and that he has not established satisfactorily that the religious beliefs on which he bases his claim to exemption are firm and unalterable convictions resulting from training or teaching in the family, or upon training or teaching in the church, or even upon consistent and profound personal study and research.\u2019 \u2018Notwithstanding the earnest assertions of the registrant that he could not conscientiously participate in war in any form,\u2019 the Hearing Officer opined that \u2018on the whole record the registrant\u2019s claim to exemption from both combatant and noncombatant training and service in the armed forces on the ground of religious training and belief has not been convincingly established.\u2019 Consequently, he concluded that the registrant has failed to sustain his conscientious objections to either combatant or noncombatant military training and service by reason of his religious training and beliefs. Accordingly, he recommended that registrant\u2019s claim be not sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A60\">\u201cIn arriving at our conclusion, we take particular note of registrant\u2019s statement to the Hearing Officer that he still has a lot of reading to do; that he has not yet completely read through the Bible, and that he could change his mind. Based upon registrant s assertions, and m view ,, \u201e ,, \u2019 \u25a0 of the findings of the Hearing Officer, the Department of Justice con-eludes that registrant has failed to establish that his alleged objections to military service are based upon deep-seated conscientious convictions arising out of religious training and belief. Accordingly, the Department recommends that the registrant\u2019s c]aim be nQt sustained <em>by </em>your Board <em>\u00bb </em>\u2018</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anh\">\u201e , , J\u00ed\\AppeaJ B\u00b0\"d \u201c N\u00abYembef 29&gt; \u2019\u00ed7 ^\u00b0te \u00b0fAfiIe ^ daf1\u2018 ^ *\u201cA; 0n December 14&gt; <em>1956\u2019 </em>the defendant was ordered to appeaJ- &amp;r induction on January 2, 1957. <em>f6 </em>dld not appear&gt; and hls P\u2122secution 0 owe</p>\n<p id=\"AZoO\">The contentions of the defendant are: (1) that he made a prima facie case for a conscientious objector classification, an&lt;t that there was no evidence to combat it; (2) that the Local Board gave an untenable reason for its classification; (3) that the Government failed to establish the geographical jurisdiction of the Local Board; and (4) that the trial court erred in quashing a subpoena issued by the defendant to bring in (a) the F.B.I. reP\u00b0rts concerning his character and the good faith of his claimed conscientious objections to war, and (b) the report Dm Hearing Officer of the Department Justice to the Attorney General on the same subject.</p>\n<p id=\"Avv\">Section 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 62 Stat. 604, 612, 65 Stat. 75, 86, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 456(j), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahu-dedup-0\">\u201cNothing contained in this title [sections 451-454 and 455-471 of this Appendix] shall be construed to require any person to be subject to combatant training and service in the armed forces of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>States who, by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form. Religious training and belief in this connection means an individual\u2019s belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARD\">The only question which gives us serious concern is whether there was any basis in fact for rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim for exemption. The answer to that question, we think, is to be deduced from the teachings of the Supreme Court in Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 122-123, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567, and Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 74 S.Ct. 152, 98 L.Ed. 132. In the Dickinson case the selective service authorities had denied Dickinson\u2019s claim for exemption as a minister. He had failed to report for induction, was prosecuted, and convicted. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 203 F.2d 336. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, and, by a six to three decision, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"A9h\"> As we understand the Dickinson case, it is authority for the proposition that if there is no basis in fact for the classification which a local board gives a registrant, its action in that regard is beyond its jurisdiction (at page 394 of 346 U.S., at page 156 of 74 S.Ct.) and is subject to review by the courts. The Supreme Court, after stating that \u201cDickinson\u2019s claims were not disputed by any evidence presented to the selective service authorities, nor was any cited by the Court of Appeals,\u201d said: \u201cThe task of the courts in cases such as this is to search the record for some affirmative evidence to support the local board\u2019s overt or implicit finding that a registrant has not painted a complete or accurate picture of his activities. We have found none here.\u201d (Page 396 of 346 U.S., at page 157 of 74 S.Ct.) The Court also said: \u201cBut when the uncontroverted evidenee supporting a registrant\u2019s claim places him prima facie within the statutory exemption, dismissal of the claim solely on the basis of suspicion and speculation is both contrary to the spirit of the Act [Universal Military Training and Service Act] and foreign to our concepts of justice.\u201d (Page 397 of 346 U.S., at page 158 of 74 S.Ct.)</p>\n<p id=\"auk-dedup-0\">Mr. Justice Jackson, who wrote the dissenting opinion in the Dickinson case, said on page 399 of 346 U.S., on page 159 of 74 S.Ct., after stating that the local board or the Appeals Board disbelieved Part of the registrant\u2019s testimony or doubted^ his good faith: \u201cUnder today\u2019s decision, it is not sufficient that the hoard disbelieve the registrant. The board must find and record affirmative evidence that he has misrepresented his case \u2014 evidence which is then put to the test of substantiality by the courts. In short, the board must build _ a record.\u201d That this appraisal of the majority opini\u00b0n Is substantially correct seems to be borne out by later opinions of the Supreme Court, namely, Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 381, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428; Sicurella v. United States, 348 U.S. 385, 75 S.Ct. 403, 99 L.Ed. 436; and compare Gonzales v. United States, 348 U.S. 407, 75 S.Ct. 409, 99 L.Ed. 467.</p>\n<p id=\"auz-dedup-0\">The ^a\u00eddt \u00b0t this Court in this case is obviously to determine whether there is aiW affirmative evidence in the record to support the conclusion of the selective service authorities that the defendant had \u201cnot Painted a complete or accurate picture of his activities,</p>\n<p id=\"AZn\">On behalf of the Government it is contended that when the defendant in the Special Form in which he made his claim for exemption, answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question, \u201cAre you a member of a religious sect or organization,\u201d and stated that it was the \u201cRadio Church of God,\u201d he did not paint an accurate picture of his activities; and that this affirmatively appears from his and his wife\u2019s statements to the Hearing Officer. According to the report of the Department of Justice to the Appeal Board, the registrant told the Hearing Officer \u201cthat he still has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>a lot of reading to do; that he has not yet completely read through the Bible; and that he could change his mind\u201d; and his wife said \u201cthat they actually began studying the teachings of the church about two years ago\u201d and \u201cthat they had been furthering their understanding of the teachings of the Church of God and have been making regular contributions to the church ever since,\u201d and also said \u201cthat while they both do believe in the teachings of the church, \u2018until we are baptized we are not actually in God\u2019s Church.\u2019 \u201d The defendant then stated \u201cthat he felt that he did not yet know enough about it to become a member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AY9\">The statement of the defendant in the Special Form that he was a member of the Radio Church of God was inaccurate in that he had not been baptized, but it was apparently no more than a technical misstatement. The Hearing Officer and the Department of Justice laid no stress on it. The sincerity of the defendant was not doubted by the Hearing Officer, who, \u201cNotwithstanding the earnest assertions of the registrant that he could not conscientiously participate in war in any form, * * opined that on the whole record the registrant\u2019s claim to exemption from both combatant and noncombatant training and service in the armed forces on the ground of religious training and belief has not been convincingly established.</p>\n<p id=\"azn-dedup-1\">It seems to us that the defendant succeeded in making a prima facie case for the exemption which he claimed, His situation, we think, does not differ substantially from that of the registrant in the Dickinson case. The selective service boards and the Department of Justice, rather obviously, were not convinced that the defendant here was what he claimed to be, and therefore denied his claim. It seems quite evident that mere \u25a0disbelief is not enough, and that there must be some affirmative evidence to support the rejection of the claimed exemption, or something in the record which substantially blurs the picture painted by the registrant and casts doubt on his sincerity or the genuineness of his claim, See Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 382-384, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"AaBA\">Qur conclusion is that the conviction 0f -\u00bfbe defendant cannot be sustained, Other questions raised need not be considered.
