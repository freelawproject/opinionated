Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit because the section of the Statute under consideration is free from ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">We agree with the conclusion of District Judge Weick, from his memorandum filed in this cause, that: \u201cThis question is no longer an open one as the Supreme Court construed the section to operate retrospectively and upheld the law. Mulcahey v. Catalanotte, 353 U.S. 692, 77 S.Ct. 1025, 1 L.Ed.2d 1127; Lehmann v. United States ex rel. Carson, 353 U.S. 685, 77 S.Ct. 1022, 1 L.Ed.2d 1122.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
