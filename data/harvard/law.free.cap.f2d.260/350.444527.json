Ample evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that Green, defendant\u2019s assistant foreman, had notice of Watson\u2019s condition; and his failure to act therefore consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>tuted a breach of duty owed the plaintiff. \u201cDuty * * * is measured by the scope of the risk which negligent conduct foreseeably entails.\u201d 2 Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts \u00a7 18.2 (1956). Green\u2019s failure to dismiss Watson created a risk \u2014that a fight would result \u2014 which was reasonably foreseeable; and, given well-known human proclivities of workmen, so was the likelihood that one of the two quarreling employees would resort to a dangerous instrument, such as a gun, and thereby injure an innocent bystander. This conclusion accords with New York law, applicable here. McCrink v. City of New York, 296 N.Y. 99, 71 N.E.2d 419; Rafsky v. City of New York, 257 App.Div. 855, 12 N.Y.S.2d 560; Ford v.
