Textile Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO was then certified as the designated collective bargaining representative of the employees in the unit found appropriate, and Olson, clinging to its claim of illegal pre-election conduct by Textile, has concededly and persistently refused to bargain with that Union. Its steadfast refusal to bargain on the grounds certification was improperly issued precipitated the Board\u2019s order against Olson on April 10, 1958 under \u00a7 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq. See also 120 National Labor Relations Board No. 60. In this latter proceeding Olson raised again the objections interposed by it in the representation case. Reaffirming its decision in the representation case, the Board held Olson\u2019s refusal to bargain violated \u00a7 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act, ordered this Employer to cease and desist from its unfair labor practices, and directed Olson to bargain with Textile. Olson has petitioned our court for review of this last Board order and, by its answer to that petition the Board asks for enforcement of the challenged order issued April 10, 1957. Through its petition for review Olson picks at the thread of pre-election conduct in the hope of unravelling all that lies behind the order, brought here for review, and as justification for its non-recognition of the certification. But that thread is bound up with power and discretion granted to the Board by Congress. National Labor Relations Board v. National Plastic Products Co., 4 Cir., 1949, 175 F.2d 755. Of course, if the Board\u2019s action is <em>ultra vires </em>the Act, then its order will be denied enforcement in our court, and such illegal action is present when and if the Board tolerates, and by its order approves, an election at which the employees have been deprived of making free choices of their bargaining representatives. See e. g. National Labor Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>lations Board v. Trinity Steel Co., 5 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 120. Whether the challenged election was fairly conducted is for the Board\u2019s determination reviewable by us for the purpose of ascertaining if that Agency kept within reasonable bounds when functioning under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Counsel for Olson presented an oral argument before the trial examiner on his client\u2019s objections and from that part of the record, certainly, it is clear that he is contending the Board should have allowed Olson to underscore the reasons why the campaign literature infected the election, but there was absent any issue worth considering further. Prattle rather than precision is the dominating characteristic of election publicity and even this situation is not an exception. After studying this record and the campaign materials we think the Board\u2019s discretion remained within permissible limits. Wilson Athletic Goods Mfg. Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 7 Cir., 1947, 164 F.2d 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The Board\u2019s order here on review will be enforced and relief sought by petitioner, Olson, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Enforcement ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-4\">. \u201cThe Employer\u2019s first objection concerns written campaign material distributed by Petitioner in which, the Employer alleges, Petitioner either expressly or impliedly averred that if Petitioner lost the election the Employer would alter the wages and working conditions of the employees to their detriment but that Petitioner expected to receive more than two-thirds of the 900 votes that would be cast. The Employer\u2019s contention that these statements constituted threats and misrepresentations which affected the results of the election is patently without merit as they contained neither assertions which the employees could not evaluate nor threats within the Petitioner\u2019s power to \u2022carry out.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u201cThe Employer\u2019s third objection concerns a campaign banner which Petitioner displayed near one of the Employer\u2019s \u2022buildings while voting was in progress. As the banner could not be observed by anyone in the immediate vicinity of the polling place, and bore no resemblance to a sample ballot, we find tbe Employer\u2019s contention, that display of this banner constituted improper electioneering and was tantamount to circulation of an improperly altered sample ballot, to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u201cThe Employer\u2019s fourth objection concerns a bulletin distributed by Petitioner which alleged that in the past the Employer had lost \u201cThe Ford Contract\u201d because the Employer was not unionized and concluded, \u2018Get Ford Back \u2014 Vote \u2018Yes\u2019 \u2014 Vote TWUA!\u2019 The Employer\u2019s contention that Petitioner thereby promised employees a benefit in exchange for an affirmative vote is plainly without merit; as found by the Regional Director, Petitioner\u2019s assertion was evidently an opinion or prediction of one consequence of Petitioner\u2019s victory and it was, in any event, a benefit not within the power of Petitioner to confer upon the employees.\u201d 118 N.L.R.B. 1274, 1276 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
