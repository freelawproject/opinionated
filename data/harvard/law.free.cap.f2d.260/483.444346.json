She appeals her conviction on the ground, among others, that the court erroneously instructed the jury that the law provides that a person aiding and abetting a principal offender may be charged as a principal. The objection the defense made to the instruction was that it was not justified by the facts in that the alleged principal \u2014 the co-indictee \u2014 had been held to be not guilty and the case against him had been dismissed. This objection was not sound. As said in Meredith v. United States, 4 Cir., 1956, 238 F.2d 535, 542,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-15\">\u201cconviction of the principal actor is not a prerequisite to conviction of the aider and abettor. It need only be established that the act constituting the offense was in fact committed by someone. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZJ\">Accord, Colosacco v. United States, 10 Cir., 1952, 196 F.2d 165, 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">Since the evidence against appellant was quite strong we have no occasion in this case to exercise our discretion to consider other possible defects in the instructions not called to the attention of the trial court. Indeed, under all the circumstances, it seems probable that a more explicit and complete instruction on aiding and abetting would have harmed rather than helped accused\u2019s case, and that the failure by trial counsel to ask for, or by the trial court to give, such an instruction was not in any way prejudicial to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-17\">We have carefully considered all the appellant\u2019s contentions, ably presented by counsel appointed by this court. Finding no reversible error in respect of the instruction, or in any other respect, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AD-1\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-13\">. 68A Stat. 550 (1954), as amended, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a) (Supp. V, 1958); 35 Stat. 614 (1909), as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (Supp. V, 1958), 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
