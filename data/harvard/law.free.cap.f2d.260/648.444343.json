This, in our judgment, is not sufficient ground for the allowance of a claim to conscientious objection to non-combatant military service. We are in accord with the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Tomlinson v. United States, 216 F.2d 12. In a prosecution for refusing to submit to induction, the defendant is not entitled to the full report made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but only to a fair r\u00e9sum\u00e9 thereof. Blalock v. United States, 4 Cir., 247 F.2d 615; United States v. Nugent, 346 U.S. 1, 73 S.Ct. 991, 97 L.Ed. 1417.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-27\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
