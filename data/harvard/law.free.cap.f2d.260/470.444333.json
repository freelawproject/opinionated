After a hearing lasting four days, that petition was dismissed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused to permit an. appeal <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-24\">He then applied in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for a writ of habeas corpus, from the denial' of which the present appeal was taken,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>We allowed him to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in this Court, and we appointed counsel for him. He, nevertheless, complains of his representation here and has sent voluminous letters and other communications repeating his grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">We have examined all of his contentions and find no merit in any of them. It does not appear that any grounds exist which have not been, or could not have been, asserted in the Courts of the District of Columbia on appeal or in the proceedings under Section 2255 of Title 28 U.S.C.A., in the District of Columbia, upon which an extensive hearing has already been had; and as no transcript of the testimony could aid him in presenting any matter that is open for consideration here, we think that the Court below has committed no error in refusing to order a transcript to be furnished him at the Government\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
