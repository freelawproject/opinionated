As stated by the court below in its memorandum opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201cThe evidence submitted is not sufficient to enable the Court to find as a fact that during critical months of the year, even if Bagdad ceased its pumping operations, that water would reach the Zannaras point of diversion * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7az\">\u201cPlaintiffs [Zannaras and Robinson] baving failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant [Bagdad] has appropriated any of plaintiffs\u2019 water, they are not entitled to an injunction.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b644-16\">JAMES ALGER FEE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b644-17\">In this suit, Zannaras, Robinson and U. S. Tungsten Corporation, hereinafter called \u201cZannaras,\u201d sought an injunction against Bagdad Copper Corporation, hereinafter called \u201cBagdad,\u201d to prevent the use, in different manner and quantity, of the water of a stream to the detriment of the vested rights of plaintiffs as prior appropriators of the waters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court held the evidence was insufficient to enable the court \u201cto find as a fact that during critical months of the year, even if Bagdad closed its pumping operations, that water would reach the Zannaras point of diversion.\u201d Upon the record, this Court is compelled to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-18\">By the findings of the trial court in a previous case between the identical parties, it was found (1) that plaintiffs \u201care down stream prior appropriators and hold certificate of water right No. 1341, from the State, for 3,000,000 gallons of water annually, dated January 2, 1945, with priority to such water from August 27, 1940,\u201d and that their \u201cwater right was lawfully acquired and initiated prior to the acquisition by [Bagdad] * * * of its water right,\u201d (2) that their certificate of water right was not obtained by fraud, (3) that the water right was not forfeited by nonuse, and (4) that for approximately five summer months in each year there was no water at the diversion of Zannaras \u201cdue mainly to [Bagdad\u2019s] * * * pumping operations.\u201d The judgment in that case decreed that Zannaras have the right to take water at this lower point of diversion \u201cwithout interference by [Bagdad\u2019s] * * * use, above.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-21\">Plaintiffs did not set up in the complaint the basis of the previous decree, but did allege the facts, the priority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>of their water right and the interference by defendant. The affirmance of the previous decree by this Court had not been announced either when the latter complaint had been filed or when the suit of Bagdad now before us was tried. However, the complaint was sufficient to permit proof of the facts underlying the previous decree which this Court affirmed. But there is another circumstance, which, whatever was decided in the prior case, may be controlling here. Although the action by plaintiffs and the prior suit by Bagdad were separate, the record shows that the two were so inseparably meshed together that whatever was decided in one is controlling in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The trial court was then in error in two particulars. It was held in effect that the Bagdad use did not infringe upon the rights of Zannaras and that the burden of proof was upon Zannaras to show that water would have reached the point of diversion of Zannaras.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Both these positions are wrong. The evidence shows that Bag-dad was pumping continuously year around. The junior appropriator must prove that the stream in its natural condition, without interference by a junior appropriator, would not have reached the point of diversion of Zannaras during the critical months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Next, it would be fantastic to insist that the senior appropriator, as Zannaras was found to be by the trial court in the previous case, has the burden of proof to show that the diversion of Bagdad did not diminish the flow of water during the critical months. The junior appropriator, Bag-dad, must establish by a preponderance of evidence that no action of his diminished the water which arrived at the point of diversion of the lower senior appropriator.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">It is axiomatic in water law that the appropriator, be he junior or be he senior, always has the burden of establishing that a change in his diversion or in his use of water has not affected the rights of other appropriators<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and even, in some states, of riparians.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>This brings us to the second mistake\u2019 of the trial court. The burden was upon the junior appropriator and not upon the senior. When the trial court entered a finding that it was unable to find whether water would have reached the point of the Zannaras diversion even if Bagdad ceased its pumping operation, the case was decided for Zannaras.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Unfortunately, the judgment reads against Zannaras and in favor of Bag-dad.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-15\">. \u201cUnder the doctrine of appropriation, he who is first in time is first in right, and so long as he continues to apply the water to a beneficial use, subsequent appropriators may not deprive him of the rights his appropriation gives, either by diminishing the quantity or deteriorating the quality.\u201d Arizona Copper Company, Limited v.
