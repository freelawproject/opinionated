BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">Emerging from this 900-page record after a jury trial, verdict and judgment which the plaintiffs, Betty Bush, a professional woman golfer, and her husband consider inadequate for injuries sustained when her Thunderbird crashed into a small railway motorcar near Pensacola, Florida, are two simple questions. Did the Court err in (1) giving the usual railroad right of way charge since the railroad vehicle was a small motorcar, not a large train or locomotive, or in (2) failing to give the jury an explanatory illustration of a computation under Florida\u2019s railroad comparative negligence statute ?</p>\n<p id=\"b923-21\">For our purposes, the setting may be briefly summarized. The accident occurred where the Railroad\u2019s track crosses U. S. 90A, a main arterial highway. The crossing is protected by gates and flashing lights. The flasher bears a warning \u201cStop on Red Signal.\u201d It is undisputed, indeed the Railroad admits, that the wheels of this small motorcar were insulated so that the car would not activate the gates or flasher. It is likewise uncontradicted that no warning signal of any kind was given by the motorcar as it approached or entered the crossing. A warning signal was impossible for, although apparently regularly equipped with a horn, none was on the motorcar the day of the accident as it had been taken off for repair. The motorcar was approximately five feet long, six feet in height and four feet wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">There was the usual conflict on the occurrence of the accident itself. According to the plaintiffs, the motorcar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>could not be seen until it was 15 to 30 feet from the crossing and it ran through the crossing at an unreduced speed of approximately 30 mph. Mrs. Bush, traveling alone, on seeing this hit her brakes and swerved to the right in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid collision. On the other hand, the Railroad\u2019s version was that the motorcar stopped or had virtually stopped a few feet from the crossing. At that time those in the motorcar saw the plaintiff\u2019s Thunderbird approaching approximately 200 to 300 feet away. They considered that the approaching Thunderbird was far enough away to permit them to cross the intersection. They fixed the plaintiff\u2019s speed at 60 mph. The physical facts show that the motorcar was nearly through the intersection at the time the Thunderbird hit it on its right rear wheel. This knocked the motorcar completely off the track, causing injury to at least one of its occupants as well as the claimed injuries to Mrs. Bush.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">There was thus the makings of the everyday run-of-the-mill tort liability case with evidence demanding that the underlying issues concerning the Railroad\u2019s fault and the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence be resolved by the jury. This was done. By its verdict of $5,000 for Mrs. Bush and $650 for her husband (the full amount of incurred medical hospital bills), it is patent that the jury found the Railroad at fault. It may or may not have determined that Mrs. Bush was contributorily negligent. The Railroad insists that the damage phase of the case had such weaknesses that the jury may well have awarded to Mrs. Bush, as presumably it had to the husband for his out-of-pocket expenses, 100% of her actual damages. The plaintiff insists, however, that from the colloquy between Court and two jurors when the jury returned to report some difficulty in connection with its deliberations, it is quite probable that the jury considered Mrs. Bush\u2019s damages of a much greater dollar value, and that this $5,000 verdict was the result of their mistaken application of the Court\u2019s instructions on Florida comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">It is this approach which leads her counsel to urge, with great earnestness and a skill which wrings from it every drop of possible merit, the argument that the two errors, while formally distinct, are interrelated and hence more, not less harmful. That is, if the Court\u2019s instructions were erroneous on the Railroad\u2019s so-called right of way, it must inevitably have affected the verdict adversely to the plaintiff. First, it subjected the Railroad to a lesser duty which in the comparative balance lowered the Railroad\u2019s percentage of contribution. Conversely, if the Railroad had the precedence, it subjected the approaching motorist to the duty to keep clear, and this would enhance the percentage of her contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">We may assume that this is correct and that error would certainly not be in the harmless category, F.R.Civ.P. 61, 28 U.S.C.A. There must first be error, however, and here we find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The portion of the charge specifically excepted to stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-9\">\u201cThe duties and obligations of a railroad company and of a traveler on the highway at a public crossing are mutual and reciprocal. The trains have the right of way, and it is the duty of a highway traveler to give them precedence, but it is also the duty of a railroad company to exercise reasonable care for the safety of travelers on the highway, to give warning of a train\u2019s approach which will be reasonably effective in the circumstances and to have its train or ether machinery under control appropriate to the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">Not unnaturally this careful Judge considered himself to be on safe grounds for the words complained of were a verbatim repetition of what we declared the law to be in Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Pidd, 5 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 153, 155. And the plaintiffs, whether out of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>recognition that the rule as there stated is correct, or because for tactical reasons they are unwilling to undertake what they might regard as a formidable task of seeking an outright reversal of it, do not attack it frontally. The claim is that Pidd does not apply to a railway motorcar and in any case is conditioned on the privileged train first giving warning, see Continental Improvement Co. v. Stead, 1877, 95 U.S. 161, 164, 24 L.Ed. 403, 405; Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. v. Golay, 10 Cir., 1946, 155 F.2d 842, 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">We need not determine this in the precise terms of these two contentions. For we do not think that, considering the charge as a whole as must be done, any such idea of a peremptory privilege or right of way was given to the jury. In this analysis without so deciding we may assume, although the Court did not say so literally, that \u201ctrain\u201d as used in the charge included a railway motorcar.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">In the first place, the use of the term \u201cright of way\u201d in Pidd and similar cases is not meant as a grant of a peremptory privilege. It is but a recognition of the physical nature of a railroad. Trains and railway motorcars can run only on tracks. They cannot turn or swerve or duck or dodge save as the track permits. Trains, too, are large and incapable of being stopped as quickly as an automobile, so that motorists must reckon with the fact that when an automobile approaching a crossing comes into the view of an engine crew, the momentum of the train may make it impossible to stop despite immediate and decisive actions. Trains also must, for the public benefit and welfare, adhere generally to schedules without which there would be chaos on the rails and public censure for nonperformance of public duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Second, and more important, the brief excerpt of which complaint is now made, and even more so the remaining portions of the charge as a whole, makes plain that heavy duties rest upon the Railroad. The excerpt speaks in terms of duties which are \u201cmutual and reciprocal\u201d and then plainly states that the railroad must exercise reasonable care for approaching travelers, must give effective warning and must have the train (motorcar) under reasonable control.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">The charge here was nearly 20 printed pages in length. With great pains it submitted the full theories of the plaintiffs and the defendant. In the concluding part of the charge, obviously constructed with great care in advance, the seven main questions were itemized by number. The first was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-10\">\u201c1. Was there any negligence on the part of the defendant [Railroad] <em>as </em>alleged?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">The reference to \u201cas alleged\u201d was significant. Previously the Court had spelled out exactly what the plaintiffs claimed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These claims of fault encompassed those reflected by the proof. These included the entire absence of any warning device by flasher signal or otherwise at the crossing, the absence of any horn or whistle on the motorcar, the manner in which the motorcar ran through the crossing without lookout or regard for closely approaching vehicles, and the like. Several times the Court stated that if the jury from a preponderance of the evidence found the Railroad was negligent \u201cas alleged\u201d they should, on a further finding of proximate cause, return a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">To laymen comprising the jury this was to say in a way decisive and understandable to them that this very same Railroad as to which a certain \u201cright <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>of way\u201d was ascribed had these other duties to satisfy and a failure was a breach of that duty and hence negligence. Nor did the Court leave this to even such an obvious inference, for immediately preceding<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the excerpt objected to, the Court spelled out in detail the full nature of the Railroad\u2019s manifold duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\"> On the second point, concerning the failure to give the jury an illustrative example of the comparative negligence statute, plaintiffs candidly state that the error here asserted is not for the giving of the initial charge. This charge,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to which no exception was taken, stated the instruction in the words and paraphrase of the Florida statute. The complaint is that when the jury returned because of a reported difficulty in their deliberations, it became evident from questions of two jurors that the jury was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>fused on the application and the Court\u2019s paraphrasing of the Florida statute in the event they should find that the plaintiff and defendant were each guilty of equal negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">As is so often the case, the colloquy between members of the jury and the Court was not illuminating. The jury\u2019s unfamiliarity with legal terms, the reticence to speak out, a feeling of incompetence even to phrase an intelligent question frequently lead, as was perhaps likely here, to uncertainty as to what was really troubling the jurors. One juror seemed to speak in terms of the Court\u2019s instruction as to the Railroad\u2019s negligence. During this exchange another juror chimed in, \u201cIf we find equal negligence, that is something we want to know about, too.\u201d Immediately thereafter<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Court recharged the jury on the significance and effect of negligence by the defendant and by the plaintiffs and the application of comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">While it is true that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel immediately after the jury withdrew registered an objection and requested that the Court submit an explanatory illustration, which an hour or so later he reduced to written form,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we certainly see no basis for concluding that the Court could not accept at face value the assurance from the several inquiring jurors that the Court\u2019s further charge made it clear, and that they did \u201cunderstand that now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">We may assume that had the Court felt that the jury might still be laboring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>under some uncertainty or confusion, the giving of explanatory illustrations would have been permissible and desirable. As to the requested one, or one of like substance, the Court might well have thought that it would be treated as a comment by him on the weight of the evidence as indicating his view that it was a 50/50 ease. With that possibility he might further have concluded that to avoid that consequence a number of illustrations would have been required weighting the percentages now for the defendant, now for the plaintiff. From that might have come, whether articulated or not, the intuitive judgment that the more explanation offered, the worse would be the confusion. The Court as much as said so for after reciting the assurances given'by the jurors that all was now clear, note 4, supra, the matter was terminated by the the Court saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-4\">\u201cHowever, if the Jury should come back in asking for further charges on the same point, then we will consider the giving of some charge of this nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The Judge was certainly authorized in assuming that this jury, having once sought further instructions which were patiently given, would not hesitate to return again if the matter continued in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Illustrative explanations may certainly be proper and helpful. Nothing we say is intended to forbid or discourage their use. But their use must of necessity be committed to the informed discretion of the Trial Judge. It will be a rare case indeed in which, after a technically correct charge on controlling legal principles to which no objection is taken, the failure to give a purely illustrative example will cast the Judge into error.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Neither of these points, or the general one embracing them for failure to grant a new trial, present error authorizing reversal. The jury heard the case and returned its verdict. There it ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-6\">. \u201cIn this ease the plaintiff, Betty Bush, contends that the actionable negligence on the part of the defendant railroad consisted in (a) negligently operating, maintaining or controlling said railroad motorcar, (b) in the negligent construction, operation or maintenance of the railroad crossing at State Road 10 [U.S. 90 A], and (c) in negligently failing to provide adequate warning signals or warnings to approaching motor vehicles or railroad motorcars and traffic on said crossing, and (d) in negligently failing to have said railroad motorcar under such control as to yield the right of way to vehicular traffic proceeding along State Road 10 [U.S. 90 A].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-5\">. The Court charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-6\">\u201cIt is the duty of the railroad company to exercise all ordinary and reasonable care and diligence in the operation of its trains to avoid injury and damage to persons and property, and it is your province to determine in this case from all of the evidence whether or not the railroad complied with this duty. The language \u2018all ordinary and reasonable care and diligence\u2019 is not susceptible of any hard and fast definition, but varies with the circumstances and conditions of each particular case. In determining whether the railroad exercised all ordinary and reasonable care and diligence, you may consider the character of the crossing, the amount of travel that might be reasonably expected there, the existence or nonexistence of obstructions, the nature and character of warning devices, the existence or non-existence of warning devices, the condition of the track and equipment, the speed of the motorcar in relation to the environment, the signals given of the motorcar\u2019s approach. In fact, all of the circumstances should be considered, and, if you find that the employees of the railroad company in charge of the motorcar failed to use that degree of care and caution that was reasonably demanded by the circumstances, you should find the railroad guilty of negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b926-7\">. \u201cThe Court charges the Jury that it was the duty of Betty Bush to exercise reasonable and proper care in the operation of her vehicle in approaching the place where the accident occurred and at the place where the accident occurred. Likewise, the defendant and its employees had a duty to exercise reasonable and proper care in the operation of the motorcar and in maintenance of the crossing where the accident occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-8\">\u201cNow, I am going to read you a chapter of the Florida statutes, which is section 768.06 [F.S.A.], as follows, and I quote:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-9\">\u201c \u2018No person shall recover damages from a railroad company for injury to himself or his property, where the same is done by his consent, or is caused by his own negligence.
