Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 7482, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7482. The sole question presented is whether the Tax Court was correct in refusing to find that the transaction herein involved constituted a \u201csale or exchange\u201d of property within the meaning of section 117 (a) (4) and (j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 117(a) (4), (j). If there was such a \u201csale or exchange\u201d then taxpayers were entitled to treat the consideration received by them for the cancellation of a contract as capital gain<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rather than ordinary income.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The facts, as found by the Tax Court are not disputed and many were stipulated. They are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"adu-dedup-0\">These facts deal with the distribution of gasoline under a \u201cmaster\u201d supply contract between General Petroleum Cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>poration (hereinafter referred to as General) and Olympic Refining Company (hereinafter referred to as Olympic).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">On the facts found, the Tax Court held that the agreement of July 26, 1950, was not intended to, and did not effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>a <em>sale </em>or exchange by The Progress Co., a partnership (hereinafter called Progress), to Olympic of the former\u2019s rights under the Progress-Olympic contract, but was intended to terminate and cancel those rights. It held that under that contract, the rights of Progress \u201ccame to an end and vanished,\u201d and that there existed no sale or exchange essential as a basis for capital gain. Hence, the Tax Court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s opinion that the amount received under this contract of July 26, 1950, was ordinary income, taxable as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">If this contract be considered merely as an agreement whereby Olympic paid Progress (the partnership) and Olympie-Progress Oil Co., a second and separate corporation (hereinafter called Olympic-Progress), in advance, the estimated value of future income from the existing purchase and supply contracts between them, then tax on ordinary income was clearly payable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201c * * * [I] f one, entitled to receive at a future date interest on \u00e1 bond or compensation for services, makes a grant of it by anticipatory assignment, he realizes taxable income as if he had collected the interest or received the salary and then paid it over. That is the teaching of Helvering v. Horst, 311 U.S. 112, 61 S.Ct. 144, 85 L.Ed. 75, and Harrison v. Schaffner, supra [312 U.S. 579, 61 S.Ct. 759, 85 L.Ed. 1055]; and it is applicable here. As we stated in Helvering v. Horst, supra, 311 U.S. 117, 61 S.Ct. 147, \u2018The taxpayer has equally enjoyed the fruits of his labor or investment and obtained the satisfaction of his desires whether he collects and uses the income to procure those satisfactions, or whether he disposes of his right to collect it as the means of procuring them.\u2019 There the taxpayer detached interest coupons from negotiable bonds and presented them as a gift to his son. The interest when paid was held taxable to the father. Here, even more clearly than there, the taxpayer is converting future income into present income.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. P. G. Lake, Inc., 1958, 356 U.S. 260, 267, 78 S.Ct. 691, 695, 2 L.Ed. 743.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADa\">The Tax Court found, with respect to the essentials listed in \u00a7 117(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, that the subject of the contract of July 26, 1950, was \u201cproperty,\u201d that such property, was \u201cused in the'trade or business\u201d; and has been held \u201cmore than 6 months.\u201d The sole remaining question: Was this a \u201csale or exchange\u201d? The Tax Court found it was not.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">It may well be, as argued by appellant, that there is a conflict in the different circuits as to what constitutes \u201cordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>nary income,\u201d on the one hand; and what constitutes capital gain from \u201cthe sale or exchange\u201d of property within the meaning of \u00a7 117(a) (4) and (j), on the other. Respondent concedes it cannot distinguish Jones v. Corbyn, 10 Cir., 1950, 186 F.2d 450, but urges it was erroneously determined, and points out the strong dissent to it written by Judge Phillips, and the subsequent statement by Judge Swan of the Second Circuit in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Starr Bros., 1958, 204 F.2d 673, at 674: \u201cWith due deference to the majority opinion, we respectfully agree with Judge Phillips\u2019 dissent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">All other cases which are apparently in conflict with the result here reached in the Tax Court are sought to be differentiated by respondent on their facts; that they are cases involving the transfer, not of a mere or \u201cnaked\u201d contractual right, but of an interest in property; \u201ca more substantial property right which does not lose its existence when it is transferred.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. McCue Bros. &amp; Drummond, Inc., 2 Cir., 1954, 210 F.2d 752, 753. In other words, it is urged that certain rights continue to exist as property of the transferee-payor in those cases which find an exchange. Typical examples seem to be those cases involving a lease, i. e., the surrender by lessee of leased premises to lessor before the lease expires (Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. McCue Bros. &amp; Drummond, Inc., supra; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Golonsky, 3 Cir., 1952, 200 F.2d 72); or a release from a lease\u2019s covenant restricting the lessor (Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Ray, 5 Cir., 1954, 210 F.2d 390); or Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Goff, 3 Cir., 1954, 212 F.2d 875, where the taxpayer had title to four hosiery manufacturing machines placed in a manufacturing plant, as well as the exclusive right to buy the output of those machines, and transferred both title and exclusive right to the manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The government first points out that by its terms, the agreement of July 26, 1950, between Progress Co., a partnership, Olympic-Progress Oil Co., a corporation, and Olympic Refining Co., a corporation, was denominated a \u201cMutual Termination Agreement\u201d \u2014 and it released all rights and claims between the parties, terminated all contract obligations, and wiped out all differences. But this alone is not controlling.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">What property could Olympic be said to \u201cacquire\u201d by reason of the July 26, 1950 contract? The right to purchase from General Petroleum a maximum quantity of 3% million gallons of gasoline a month ? Olympic already had this right by reason of its contract of November 19, 1945, with General, as extended. That purchase and supply contract between General and Olympic was not affected in any way by the Mutual Termination Agreement. The purchase and supply contract existed as it always had, until terminated by General and Olympic five days later on July 31st, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">The Mutual Termination Agreement was just that; it terminated not only Olympic\u2019s contractual obligation to Progress and to Progress-Olympic; it settled all claims, including those of Progress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>against Olympic arising out of past deliveries of gasoline. Thus it was more than a sale, it was a clearing up of various disputes, and, we think, falls aptly within the language of the court in Commissioner v. Starr Bros., supra, relied upon by the government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\">\u201cUndoubtedly the taxpayer\u2019s rights under the 1908 contract were property; and we will assume ar-guendo, as does the Commissioner, that they were a capital asset. The decisive issue is whether there was a \u2018sale or exchange\u2019 of such capital asset when the contract was terminated in 1943. To refer to the contract as a grant of a \u2018franchise\u2019 tends, we think, to becloud analysis of the legal relations. What the taxpayer gave in return for the cash payment was <em>a release of United\u2019s contract obligations, </em>chief of which was its promise not to sell its products to other dealers in New London. Such release not only ended the promisor\u2019s previously existing duty but also destroyed the promisee\u2019s rights. <em>They were not transferred to the promisor; they merely came to an end and vanished.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.] Id. 204 F.2d at page 674.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The Mutual Termination Agreement did actually terminate the rights of Progress and Olympic-Progress to obtain certain gallonage monthly from Olympic. It cancelled out other disputes and claims as well, but its principal object, result, and \u201ceffect\u201d was to terminate rights, not continue them, nor transfer them \u2014 nor sell them \u2014 nor exchange them. By the terms of the contract of July 26,1950, no title, right of possession or interest in any gasoline was acquired by the Olympic Refining Co. It had precisely what it had had before, a contractual right to enforce its purchase and supply contract of October 19, 1945, previously entered into with General and it no longer was required to sell to Progress. As the Tax Court said, the Termination Agreement was not an assignment of Progress\u2019 right to purchase from General,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">\u201c * * * because Progress never acquired the right, by assignment or otherwise, to purchase gasoline from General under the Progress-Olympic contract. That contract gave Progress the right to have its gasoline requirements supplied by Olympic, and the evidence indicates that its purchases were made from Olympic. The General-Olympic contract was a separate and distinct transaction which gave Olympic the right to purchase gasoline from General, and which provided Olympic with a source of supply which enabled it to enter into contracts to sell gasoline to Progress and others. In the circumstances we cannot agree that the substance of the transaction of July 26, 1950, was a transfer from Progress to Olympic of the right of Progress to purchase 2,250,000 gallons of gasoline per month from General.\u201d [Tr. p. 32.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Petitioners urge this Court \u201cto face economic realities\u201d and cite Texas Trailercoach, Inc. v. Com\u2019r, 5 Cir., 1958, 251 F.2d 395. In Hansen v. Com\u2019r, 9 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 585, we cited that same case with approval. But recognizing economic realities does not permit us to rewrite the law, nor to avoid the plain meaning of contractual obligations clearly expressed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.

Their essence is determined not by subleties of draftsmanship but by their total effect. See Helvering v. Clifford, 309 U.S. 331, 60 S.Ct. 554, 84 L.Ed. 788; Harrison v. Schaffner, 312 U.S. 579, 61 S.Ct. 759, 85 L.Ed. 1055;\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. P. G.

Before the obligation to pay taxes on alimony received from a former spouse was placed on the person receiving it, a taxpayer husband obligated to pay alimony under a property settlement agreement might suddenly find his former wife has remarried and his obligation to pay at an end. Cf. Int. Rev. Code of 1939, \u00a7 22 (k), \u00a7 23 (u), as amended by Ch. 619, \u00a7 120; 56 Stat. 816 (1942), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 22(k), 23(u). From the standpoint of economic realities the taxpayer had received a pay raise, and his income has been increased, yet legally that was not true. Economic realities may be considered, but cannot require the discard of legal principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b563-5\">. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Starr Bros., supra, 204 F.2d at page 674.</p>\n<p id=\"Ack-\">We incidentally call attention to the reasoning of Judge Swan (in Commissioner v. Starr Bros., supra) with respect to the effect of the absence of any specific statutory reference to contracts such as those here under consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\">. \u201cWhen Congress has wished to tax as capital gains receipts which would not fall within the ordinary meaning of \u2018sale or exchange\u2019 of assets, it has dealt specifically with such transactions, as in subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 117. See Helvering v. William Flaccus Leather Co. [1941] 313 U.S. 247, 251, 61 S. Ct. 878, 881, 85 L.Ed. 1310. We regard as significant the absence of any statutory provision treating the termination or modification of a selling agency contract as a sale or exchange.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Starr Bros., supra, 204 F.2d at pages 674-675.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">We also note as respectable authority the analogous line of cases holding that payment received for a covenant not to engage in competitive business was ordinary income, not gain realized on disposal of a capital asset.
