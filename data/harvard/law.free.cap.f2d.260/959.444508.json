The case was presented to the jury upon a charge to which no objection is made, the defendants\u2019 sole contention being that there was insufficient evidence produced to support a finding by the jury that they or any of them were members of the conspiracy which was shown to have existed. We have carefully considered the evidence in the light of the appellants\u2019 arguments. No useful purpose would be served by reciting it here in detail. It is enough to say that we are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict in the case of each of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-33\">The judgments of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
