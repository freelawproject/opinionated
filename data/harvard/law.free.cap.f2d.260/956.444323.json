United States, 5 Cir., 240 F.2d 1. The only other contention that there cannot be consecutive sentences where one of the counts on which he is adjudged guilty was that he participated in a conspiracy to do the substantive act for the commission of which he has also been found guilty has been adjudicated against appellant in Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-18\">The judgment is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
