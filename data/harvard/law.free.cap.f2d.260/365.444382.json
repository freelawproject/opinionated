Such motion is addressed to the sound judicial discretion of the trial court. United States v. Johnson, 327 U.S. 106, 66 S.Ct. 464, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>90 L.Ed. 562. Reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment in disallowing the motion must be based upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion. Winer v. United States, 6 Cir., 228 F.2d 944; Sharp v. United States, 6 Cir., 195 F.2d 997. No such showing has been made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The affidavit of Devers was that of a narcotic law violator who did not point the finger of accusation toward Smith, in exculpation of appellant, until after Smith had been murdered and could not contradict him. The other affiant, Thomas, an employee at the United States Public Health Service Hospital where the crime was committed, testified at the trial' of appellant, but held back his later statement casting suspicion toward the deceased Smith until after the trial and conviction of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The experienced and able District Judge Ford cannot be but upheld in his refusal to believe the affiants upon whose assertions a new trial is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The judgment of the United States District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
