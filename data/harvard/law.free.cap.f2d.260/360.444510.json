The facts are fully stated in the opinion filed in the District Court by Judge Layton, 161 F.Supp. 835, and need not be repeated here. Suffice it to say that we are in full accord with the conclusion of the district court, for the reasons stated in Judge Layton's opinion, that the uncontroverted facts, as to the existence of which no genuine issue existed, disclosed that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of Delaware law and that the Delaware doctrine of the last clear chance was not applicable. The district court accordingly did not err in entering summary judgment on the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-18\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
