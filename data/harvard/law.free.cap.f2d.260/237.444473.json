Blair<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the amount of $10,000, under the provisions of the National Service Life Insur-anee Act of 1940, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar8\">The insured, while in the Armed Forces and engaged in combat in Korea, was captured, and thereafter, on or about February 22, 1951, died while a prisoner of war.</p>\n<p id=\"APf\">Thereafter, Geraldine A. Blair,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the divorced wife of the insuredj and Elease Blair,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the mother of the insured, filed separate claims with the Veterans\u2019 Administration, each claiming to be the sole beneficiary under the Pollcy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVG\">The Board of Appeals of the Veterans\u2019 Administration made a final order deny-the application of Geraldine and held that the mother was the sole beneficiary under the policy. Geraldine then instituted this action against the United States to recover as beneficiary under the policy and the mother intervened and asserted her claim to recover on the policy, The case was submitted on documentary evidence. From a judgment in favor of the mother, Geraldine has appealed,</p>\n<p id=\"AGQ\">The facts are not in dispute. On August 8, 1943, Geraldine and the insured were married and on the same date the insured first entered the Armed Forces of the United States. On October 18, 1943, the insured made application for National Service Life Insurance, designating Geraldine as his principal beneficiary and his mother as contingent beneficiary. On November 23, 1945, the insured was separated from his first tour of duty and his National Service Life Insurance lapsed on January 18, 1946, . , \u201e . \u2019 for nonpayment of premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"anr-dedup-1\">Thereafter, Geraldine on May 6, 1947, obtained a decree of divorce from the insured\u2019 The defle <em>ad^dged^ </em>bhe msUred nob tbe f^her of,the jtwo minor children of Geraldine, referred to in note 4, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"Aaz\">On March 9, 1948, the insured reenlisted in the Army of the United States for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>a period of three years. On that date, and while his insurance was still in a state of lapse, the insured executed an \u201cOath And Certificate Of Enlistment.\u201d On the same form with the Oath of Enlistment appeared a \u201cDesignation of Beneficiary.\u201d In this designation the msured stated that he was divorced and that he had no children and made the following entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au1\">\u201cIn The Event Of My Leaving No Widow Or Child, Or Their Decease Before Payment Is Made, I Then Designate As My Beneficiary The Following Relative * * * Elease Blair (Mother) 1160 Bellevi-dere Drive, Oklahoma City, Okl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEM\">\u201cIn The Event Of The Death Or Disqualification Of The Last-Named Dependent Relative Before Payment Is Made, I Then Designate As My Beneficiary The Following Relative * * * Mnro-nrpt T.neillp Blair (Sister) 1160 Bellevidere Drive, Oklahoma City, Okla.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKU\">The Designation of Beneficiary following the Oath of Enlistment and on the same form as the oath was not intended to serve as a notice to the Veterans\u2019 Administration and was not a document to be filed with that Administration, and it , ... . . , . . , was not so filed. It was intended to serve , \u201e , , , . . purposes wholly unrelated to insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"aut-dedup-1\">After execution of his Oath of Enlistment and Designation of Beneficiary, insured was transferred to Fort Knox, Kentucky, and on March 17, 1948, with- , . . \u2019 . , \u201e, \u201e . out designating any change of beneficiary . , ,, <em>, </em>, . . ... ,. on appropriate Veterans Administration \u201e , . . . forms, executed an application tor rein-,T f. . \u201e . T . \u201e statement of his National Service Life _ . , Insurance and an allotment was made to ,. . <em>n </em>, . pay the premiums from his army pay. Thus, at that time, although he had an opportunity to do otherwise, the insured in reinstating his National Service Life insurance did not change his original designation of beneficiary, wherein Geraldine was named as principal bene-fieiary and the mother as contingent beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"ALkP\">On January 28, 1949, insured recognized the children as his sons and designated them on Form \u201cRecord of Emergency Data for the Armed Forces of the United States\u201d as the persons to receive his six months gratuity pay.</p>\n<p id=\"AN0\">In Apr\u00fc 1949\u00a1 the insured discontin_ ued an a]\u00a1otment Me to hig mother and execyted an allotment for the gup. port of the childreIL</p>\n<p id=\"Ak2s\">, Thereafter, the insured wrote three letters to his mother relative to his National S\u2122, Llie Insurance. In each of the three letters he \u201cSeated to his mother that she was a beneficiary under e P0 IC^'</p>\n<p id=\"aku-dedup-0\">The single question presented by this aPPeal is whether insured changed the beneficiary of his National Service Life Insurance policy from Geraldine to the mother by indicating his intention so to d\u00b0 and by doing some affirmative act to effectuate such intention.</p>\n<p id=\"A4qG\">This court had occasion to consider a closely analogous case in Bradley v. United States, 10 Cir., 143 F.2d 573. In that case one Bradley was killed while serving on duty with the United States Araiy. His mother, Lena M. Bradley, and hif widow\u2019 \u201c Mae Bradley filed separate claims with the Veterans Ad- ..... .... , , ,, , ministration, each claiming to be the sole bene\u00ediciary under a ?10&gt;ooo life insurance policy issued to him under the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"AIeA\">w, ,, ,. . . .. . , When the policy was originally issued .. ,. the mother was designated as the benefi- . ... ,. ,. ... ciary and the question there was whether \u201e ,, . ,, . . . . . Bradley who thereafter married had ef- \u201e ,. . . . ,. , \u201e . \u201e fectively changed the beneficiary from . . ,, ... . \u201e his mother to his wife,</p>\n<p id=\"AKW\">Shortly after his marriage Bradley executed a \u201cconfidential personal report\u201d required of all flying officers, on a prescribed form and addressed to the United States Army Airport, Windsor Locks, Connecticut. Among other things, it stated: \u201cGovernment Insurance; Yes, Amount: $10,000.00, Type: government, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Beneficiary: Ann M. Bradley, Location of policy, will or other important papers: with wife.\u201d On the next day Bradley lost his life.</p>\n<p id=\"adm-dedup-0\">Bradley\u2019s wife testified that prior to the execution of the confidential personal , _ ,, . , , , , _ report Bradley had expressed to her an intention to change the beneficiary in his policy from his mother to her. Her testimony in that respect was fully corroborated by testimony of his comrades in the military service. Mrs. Bradley further testified that after Bradley had executed the confidential personal report he told her he had taken care of the insurance at the army base.</p>\n<p id=\"Amc\">This court held that the burden of proving a valid change of beneficiary was on the widow and such burden required a showing of positive and unequivocal acts on the part of Bradley, designed to effectuate his expressed intentions to so change the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"AcY\">We further held in this regard that as to the confidential report relied on by the widow as the \u201cpositive and unequivocal act\u201d [143 F.2d 577] that it was no notice of any kind to the Veterans\u2019 Administration, no direction to it to change the beneficiary, and that it did not express or indicate even indirectly or inaptly a desire to have the beneficiary changed.</p>\n<p id=\"A_q\">,, , In the instant case the only evidence relied on by the mother to show an affirmative act by the insured was the statements in the form he filled out at the time of his second enlistment.</p>\n<p id=\"Akm\">We are of the opinion that such evidence does not adequately meet the test of \u201cpositive and unequivocal acts,\u201d as required by the decision in the Bradley case, supra, and the finding by the trial court to the effect that the evidence established a \u201cpositive and unequivocal\u201d act to effectuate a change of beneficiary is clearly erroneous. See, also, Parker v. United States, D.C.Colo., 125 F.Supp. 731.</p>\n<p id=\"AIj\">Accordingly, the judgment of the lower iourt is Reversed and Remanded with instructions to render a judgment in favor of Geraldine.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ARX\">.
