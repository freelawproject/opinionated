During 1982 to 1992, Thomas Arthur was thrice tried, convicted, and sentenced to death for Wicker\u2019s murder. After his third death sentence in 1992, Arthur for the next 24 years has pursued, unsuccessfully, dozens of direct and post-conviction appeals in both state and federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">In addition, starting nine years ago in 2007 and on three separate occasions, Arthur has filed civil lawsuits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 challenging the drug protocol to be used in his execution. This is Arthur\u2019s third such \u00a7 1983 case, and this current \u00a7 1983 case was filed in 2011. For the last five years Arthur has pursued this \u00a7 1983 case with the benefit of lengthy discovery. The district court held a two-day trial and entered two comprehensive orders denying Arthur \u00a7 1983 relief. Those orders are the focus of the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">After thorough review, we conclude substantial evidence supported the district court\u2019s fact findings and, thus, Arthur has shown no clear error in them. Further, Arthur has shown no error in the district court\u2019s conclusions of law, inter alia, that: (1) Arthur failed to carry his burden to show compounded pentobarbital is a feasible, readily implemented, and available drug to the Alabama Department of Corrections (\u201cADOC\u201d) for use in executions; (2). Alabama\u2019s consciousness assessment protocol does not violate the Eighth Amendment or the-\u2019 Equal Protection Clause; and (3) Arthur\u2019s- belated firing-squad claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-11\">I. CONVICTION AND APPEALS</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-12\">The \u2022 Alabama Supreme Court summarized the facts underlying Arthur\u2019s criminal conviction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-13\">More than 20 years ago, Arthur\u2019s relationship with his common-law wife ultimately led to his brutally murdering a relative of the woman. Arthur shot the victim in the right eye with a pistol, causing nearly instant death; He was convicted in a 1977 trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-14\">While on work release during the life sentence, Arthur had an affair with a woman that ultimately led to his brutally murdering that woman\u2019s husband, Troy Wicker, in 1982. Arthur shot Wicker in the right eye with a pistol, causing nearly instant death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1272-15\">Ex parte Arthur, 711 So.2d 1097, 1098 (Ala. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-16\">In 1982, Arthur was convicted and sentenced to death for Wicker\u2019s murder, but the Alabama Supreme Court reversed that conviction in 1985. Arthur v. King, 500 F.3d 1335, 1337 (11th Cir. 2007). In 1987, Arthur was again convicted and sentenced to death, but that conviction was overturned by Alabama\u2019s Court of Criminal Appeals in 1990. Id. After his third trial in 1991, Arthur was again convicted of Wicker\u2019s murder and sentenced to death in 1992. Id. This time, his conviction and sentence were affirmed. Id. He did not file a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. Id. at 1337-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>At his third sentencing proceeding, Arthur asked for a death sentence, stating that a capital sentence would provide him better prison accommodations, more access to the law library, more time to devote to his appeal, and a more extensive appeals process. Arthur v. Thomas, 739 F.3d 611, 614 (11th Cir. 2014). Arthur told the jury that he did not believe he-would be executed. Id. Arthur\u2019s murder of Wicker was a capital offense under Alabama law because Arthur had been convicted of another murder in the 20 years preceding his second murder. See Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-5\u201440(a)(13) (1975); Arthur v. State, 71 So.3d 733, 735 (Ala. Crim. App. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-4\">In 2001, after exhausting his state court remedies, Arthur filed a federal habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Arthur v. Allen, 452 F.3d 1234, 1238, 1240-43 (11th Cir.), modified on reh\u2019g, 459 F.3d 1310 (11th Cir. 2006). The district court dismissed the \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely, but granted a certificate of appealability as to Arthur\u2019s claims of actual innocence, statutory tolling, and equitable tolling. Id. at 1243. In 2006, this Court affirmed the dismissal of Arthur\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, concluding that Arthur had not shown actual innocence or entitlement to statutory or equitable tolling. Id. at 1253-54.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court denied Arthur\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. Arthur v. Allen, 549 U.S. 1338, 127 S.Ct. 2033, 167 L.Ed.2d 763 (Mem.) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">With this background, we turn to Arthur\u2019s current \u00a7\u00a11983 case, challenging Alabama\u2019s use of midazolam in its lethal injection protocol. To place Arthur\u2019s cur-i-ent \u00a7 1983 claim in context, we review the history of lethal injection in Alabama and how Alabama has had to change the drugs used due to unavailability. For years, Arthur challenged the use of sodium thiopen-tal and then pentobarbital. But now that the ADOC has not been able to procure sodium thiopental or pentobarbital and has had to switch to midazolam, Arthur is currently challenging midazolam and now asks to go back to sodium thiopental or pentobarbital as his preferred alternatives. We thus review in great detail how this case got here today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">II. HISTORY OF LETHAL INJECTION IN ALABAMA</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-10\">When Arthur was sentenced to death, Alabama executed inmates by electrocution. See McNair v. Allen, 515 F.3d 1168, 1171 (11th Cir. 2008). On July 1, 2002, the Alabama legislature adopted lethal injection as the state\u2019s preferred form of execution. Id. The legislature allowed inmates already under a sentence of death a 30-day window to choose electrocution as their method of execution, after which time they would be deemed to have waived the right to request a method other than lethal injection. Ala. Code \u00a7 15\u201418\u201482.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-11\">Alabama\u2019s method-of-execution statute further provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-12\">If electrocution or lethal injection is held to be unconstitutional by the Alabama Supreme Court under the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, or held to be unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court under the United States Constitution, or if the United States Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>preme Court declines to review any judgment holding a method of execution to be unconstitutional under the United States Constitution made by the Alabama Supreme Court or the United States Court of Appeals that has jurisdiction over Alabama, all persons sentenced to death for a capital crime shall be executed by any constitutional method of execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">Id. \u00a7 15-18-82.1(c). The' Alabama statute does not prescribe any particular method of lethal injection; the legislature left it to the ADOC to devise the policies and procedures governing lethal injection executions, and exempted the ADOC from the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act in exercising that authority. Id \u00a7 15-18-82.1(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">The ADOC has used a three-drug lethal injection protocol since it began performing executions by lethal injection in 2002. See Brooks v. Warden, 810 F.3d 812, 823 (11th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Brooks v. Dunn, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 979, 193 L.Ed.2d 813 (2016). Each drug in a three-drug protocol is intended to serve a specific purpose. The first drug should render the inmate unconscious to \u201censure[] that the prisoner does not experience any pain associated with the paralysis and cardiac arrest caused by the second and third drugs\u201d; the second drug is a paralytic agent that \u201cinhibits all muscular-skeletal movements and, by paralyzing the diaphragm, stops respiration\u201d; and the third drug \u201cinterferes with the electrical signals that stimulate the contractions of the heart, inducing cardiac arrest.\u201d Baze v. Rees, 553 U.S. 35, 44, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 1527, 170 L.Ed.2d 420 (2008) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-9\">The third drug in the ADOC protocol has always been potassium chloride, and the second drug has always been a paralytic agent\u2014either pancuronium bromide or rocuronium bromide. Brooks, 810 F.3d at 823. However, the ADOC has changed the first drug in its protocol twice. Id. From 2002 until April 2011, it used sodium thiopental as the first drug in the three-drug sequence. Id. But a national shortage of sodium thiopental forced states, including Alabama, to seek a replacement for sodium thiopental as the first drug in the series. See Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.S. -, -, 135 S.Ct. 2726, 2733, 192 L.Ed.2d 761 (2015) (explaining that the sole domestic manufacturer of sodium thiopental ceased production of the drug in 2009 and exited the market entirely in 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-14\">From April 2011 until September 10, 2014, Alabama used pentobarbital as the first drug. Brooks, 810 F.3d at 823. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201c[bjefore long, however, pentobarbital also became unavailable.\u201d Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2733. Arthur has acknowledged that Alabama\u2019s supply of commercially manufactured pen-tobarbital expired on or around November 2013. From September 11, 2014, until the present, Alabama has used midazolam as the first drug in the series. Brooks, 810 F.3d at 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-15\">Currently, Alabama\u2019s lethal injection protocol calls for the administration of: (1) a 500-mg dose of midazolam, (2) followed by a 600-mg dose of rocuronium bromide, and (3) finally, 240 milliequivalents of potassium chloride. This lethal injection protocol involves the same drugs, administered in the same sequence, as the protocol at issue in Glossip. 135 S.Ct. at 2734-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-16\">III. 2011: COMPLAINT ABOUT PENTOBARBITAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-17\">Arthur\u2019s execution date is currently set for November 3, 2016. This is the sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>time that Alabama has scheduled his execution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and this case is Arthur\u2019s third \u00a7 1983 challenge to lethal injection as the method of his execution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-4\">In May 2007, shortly after the State filed a motion to set an execution date, Arthur filed a \u00a7 1983 action challenging Alabama\u2019s lethal injection protocol which in 2007 included sodium thiopental as the first drug. (CM/ECF for the U.S. Dist. Ct. for the S.D. Ala., case no. 1:07-cv-342, doc. 1 at 1-2, 6; doc. 15 at 11). The district court dismissed that complaint based on laches, and this Court affirmed. (Id., docs. 19, 20, 27, 28). In October 2007, Arthur filed a second challenge to Alabama\u2019s lethal injection protocol, which the district court again dismissed for unreasonable delay, and this Court affirmed. (CM/ECF for the S.D. Ala., case no. 1:07-cv-722, docs. 1, 22, 23, 28, 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">In April 2011, Alabama switched from using sodium thiopental to pentobarbital as the first drug in its lethal injection protocol. Brooks, 810 F.3d at 823. On June 8, 2011, Arthur filed another \u00a7 1983 complaint in federal district court, challenging Alabama\u2019s new lethal injection protocol, especially its use of pentobarbital as the first drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">As amended, Arthur\u2019s complaint raised three \u00a7 1983 claims: (1). the ADOC\u2019s use of pentobarbital as the first drug in its three-drug lethal injection protocol violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment; (2) the ADOC\u2019s secrecy in adopting and revising its lethal injection protocol violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause; and (3) the ADOC had materially deviated from its lethal injection protocol by failing to conduct a \u201cconsciousness assessment\u201d during an earlier execution, thereby violating the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. Arthur also alleged that Alabama\u2019s lethal injection statute violated the state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-12\">The district court dismissed Arthur\u2019s Eighth Amendment and Due Process claims on statute-of-limitations grounds and his Equal Protection claim for failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Arthur v. Thomas, 674 F.3d 1257, 1259 (11th Cir. 2012). Because Alabama began its lethal injection protocol in 2002, the district court determined that Arthur\u2019s 2011 complaint challenging it was banned by the two-year statute of limitations applicable to \u00a7 1983 claims. Id. Arthur appealed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-13\">This Court reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal as to only Arthur\u2019s Eighth Amendment and Equal Protection claims. Id. at 1262, 1263. As to the Eighth Amendment claim, this Court concluded that Arthur\u2019s allegations and his filed affidavits created factual issues as to whether Alabama\u2019s new lethal injection drugs and procedures constituted such a significant change in the lethal injection protocol as to warrant a new limitations period and some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>factual development, including discovery. Id. at 1260-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">As to the Equal Protection claim, this Court held that Arthur had \u201calleged enough facts to constitute a plausible Equal Protection claim because he alleges that Alabama has substantially deviated from its execution protocol\u201d by failing to perform the pinch test as part of the required consciousness assessment. Id. at 1263. Accepting Arthur\u2019s particular allegations as true at the early Rule 12(b)(6) stage, this Court remanded for further factual development. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">In the years after this Court\u2019s 2012 remand, the parties conducted extensive discovery. Before the final hearing on Arthur\u2019s \u00a7 1983 challenge to pentobarbital, the State was no longer able to procure pentobarbital. In September 2014, the State changed its lethal injection protocol to substitute midazolam hydrochloride for pentobarbital as the first drug, and rocuro-nium bromide for pancuronium bromide as the second drug in its three-drug cocktail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">IV. 2015: SECOND AMENDED , COMPLAINT ABOUT MIDAZOLAM</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-7\">On January 7,2015, after receiving leave from the district court to amend his 2011 complaint, Arthur filed a complaint (the \u201cSecond Amended Complaint\u201d), raising two claims. Arthur raised an \u2019Eighth Amendment claim, alleging that the ADOC\u2019s use of midazolam as the first drug \u201ccreates a substantial risk of serious harm because ... there is a high likelihood that midazolam will fail to render [him] insensate from the excruciatingly painful and agonizing effects of the second and third drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-8\">Despite challenging pentobarbital for more than three years, Arthur now suggested that he would prefer for the State to use a one-drug protocol of compounded pentobarbital in his execution instead of midazolam. Arthur\u2019s Second Amended Complaint recycled his earlier argument about pentobarbital, which was that it would cause him to suffer a drop in blood pressure and then a heart attack. Arthur now made the same claim about midazo-lam, alleging that he had \u201cclinically significant obstructive coronary disease\u201d and that the State\u2019s use of midazolam created a substantial risk that he would suffer a painful heart attack before losing consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-10\">Arthur\u2019s Second Amended Complaint also raised an Equal Protection claim, alleging that the ADOC had \u201cmaterially deviated from their written execution protocol, impermissibly burdening Mr. Arthur\u2019s right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d Arthur claimed that Alabama employs a lethal injection protocol that requires a \u201cconsciousness assessment\u201d after the first drug is injected. This consciousness assessment has three parts: (1) calling the inmate\u2019s'name, (2) gently stroking his eyelash, and (3)-pinching his arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">Arthur\u2019s Second Amended Complaint alleged that during \u201cnumerous executions,\u201d including the 2011 execution of Eddie Powell, witnesses did not observe the pinch test being performed. Arthur also alleged that the\" ADOC failed to adequately train its personnel in how to perform properly the consciousness assessment. He claimed that there existed a \u201csignificant risk that Defendants will deviate from their protocol in [his] execution,\u201d thus burdening his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-12\">In March 2015, the district court elected to stay Arthur\u2019s \u00a7 1983 case challenging midazolam until after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Glossip v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>Gross.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\">V. JUNE 2015: GLOSSIP IS DECIDED</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court decided Glossip, holding that, in order to challenge successfully a method of execution, a plaintiff must plead and prove: (1) that the proposed execution method presents a risk that is \u201c \u215b <em>or very likely </em>to cause serious illness and needless suffering,\u2019 and give rise to \u2018sufficiently <em>imminent </em>dangers,\u2019 \u201d and (2) that there is \u201can alternative [method of execution] that is \u2018feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduce[s] a substantial risk of severe pain.\u2019 \u201d 135 S.Ct. at 2737 (quoting Baze, 553 U.S. at 50, 52, 128 S.Ct. at 1530-31, 1532) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">After Glossip, the district court subsequently lifted its stay of proceedings in this case, and the parties conducted some additional discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">On August 25, 2015, Arthur sought leave to file a third amended complaint, seeking (1) to switch back to compounded pento-barbital as an alternative method of execution, (2) to suggest sodium thiopental and a firing squad as additional alternative methods, and (3) to include additional allegations that midazolam was constitutionally inadequate. The district court granted Arthur leave to amend his complaint except as to the firing squad as an alternative method of execution. The district court concluded, inter alia, that \u201cexecution by firing squad is not permitted by [Alabama] statute and, therefore, is not a method of execution that could be considered either feasible or readily implemented by Alabama at this time.\u201d The district court set trial to begin on January 12,2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-10\">VI. OCT. 2015: THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-11\">On October 13, 2015, Arthur filed his Third Amended Complaint, alleging substantially identical claims to those raised in his Second Amended Complaint and requesting single-drug protocols of compounded pentobarbital or sodium thiopen-tal as alleged feasible alternative methods of execution. The ADOC filed (1) a \u201cMotion to Dismiss and, In the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d arguing that Arthur\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim was untimely, that both claims should be dismissed for failure to state a claim, and that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether compounded pentobar-bital or sodium thiopental are known and available alternatives; and (2) a \u201cMotion for Summary Judgment of Arthur\u2019s Eighth Amendment Claim,\u201d arguing again that compounded pentobarbital and sodium thi-opental are not known and available alternatives and, further, that Arthur failed to present any evidence showing how compounded pentobarbital could be administered to prevent a painful heart attack.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ADOC\u2019s motions included arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>regarding its present inability to obtain either pentobarbital or sodium thiopental.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">On January 7, 2016, the district court issued an order limiting the issues at trial to: (1) Arthur\u2019s Equal Protection claim, and (2) the availability of alternative methods of execution. The district court wrote that, if Arthur met his burden to prove an alternative method of execution that is feasible and readily available, the court would schedule a second phase of trial to address other issues, such as whether the use of midazolam \u201cpresents a risk that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering, and give rise to sufficiently immin\u00e9nt dangers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">The district court held \u00e1 two-day bench trial on January 12 and 13,2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">VII. TRIAL EVIDENCE ABOUT ALTERNATIVE DRUGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-7\">A. Arthur\u2019s Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-8\">As noted above, although for four years Arthur, had challenged pentobarbital as the first drug, one of his requested alternatives is now a single drug of compounded pentobarbital. Arthur called Dr. Gaylen M. Zentner to testify about compounded pen-tobarbital.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-9\">Dr. Zentner obtained a Ph.D. in pharmaceutics and was a lic\u00e9nsed pharmacist in Utah for 40 years. After obtaining his Ph.D., Dr. Zentner taught pharmacy at the University of Connecticut, including teaching in the compounding lab. He worked for 13 years for a large pharmaceutical company in their \u201cadvanced drug delivery dosage form design unit.\u201d He was later in charge of \u201call formulation and dosage form design\u201d at another large pharmaceutical company. He had held two adjunct professorships in pharmacy. Since 2012, Dr. Zentner had worked as an \u201cindependent consultant\u201d to the pharmaceutical industry. He testified that he had-hands-on experience with manufacturing drugs and he had personally compounded drugs, although he had no experience preparing compounded pentobarbital sodium. The district court accepted Dr. Zentner as an expert witness in the fields of pharmaceutical chemistry, manufacturing, and compounding.</p>\n<p id=\"AVx\">Dr. Zentner testified that, in his opinion, \u201cthe talent, expertise, and facilities to perform sterile compounding\u201d existed within Alabama and that \u201call ingredients required to formulate a compounded preparation of pentobarbital sodium\u201d were \u201creadily available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AsN\">Dr. Zentner explained that, in its pure form, pentobarbital sodium was a white powder, which could be compounded with other ingredients to form an injectable solution. He described pentobarbital as a \u201clong-known and well-established drug product\u201d that was \u201cavailable to the medical sciences for decades.\u201d He stated that Nembutal, the trade name for an industrially manufactured version of injectable pento-barbital sodium, was available for sale in the United States. He said that pentobar-bital sodium for injection was listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book, which listed all \u201capproved drugs\u201d in the United States. The Orange Book stated that there were no active patents on this drug, meaning that anyone was permitted to make it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-15\">Dr. Zentner described the process of compounding a solution of pentobarbital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>sodium, calling it \u201ca very- simple matter\u201d and a \u201cstraightforward process,\u201d During his testimony, Dr. Zentner relied on a 2015 article from the Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods that described the preparation of an injectable pentobarbital sodium solution by laboratory scientists that was essentially identical to the commercial product and was stable for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\">Dr. Zentner contended that there were \u201cnumerous sources\u201d for both the active and inactive ingredients needed to-compound pentobarbital, including professional drug sourcing services. He said that these ingredients were available for sale in the United States and could be found through an Internet search. For example, Dr; Zent-ner found pentobarbital sodium listed on a drug manufacturer\u2019s product listing, which listing indicated that the drug was produced in the United States. He stated that other manufacturers might offer it for sale or the drug could be synthesized in a lab. He said that he knew of one lab that would be willing to synthesize the drug and he suspected \u201call of them would be willing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">Dr. Zentner stated that he conducted an Internet search of sterile compounding pharmacies in Alabama from the listing available on the Accreditation Commission for Health Care\u2019s Web site, and found 19 such pharmacies, although two were essentially the same company. Dr. Zentner gave his list to the ADOC. Dr. Zentner contacted two of these pharmacies, and they said that they did perform sterile compounding. Dr. Zentner admitted that he did' not ask them whether they would be willing to compound pentobarbital for use in an execution by the ADOC. In his deposition, Dr. Zentner clarified that he did not ask these two pharmacies any questions whatsoever regarding compounded pentobarbital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-9\">Accordingly, Dr. Zentner could only give his opinion that (1) pentobarbital sodium is available for purchase in the United States* and (2) there are compounding pharmacies that \u201chave the skills and licenses to perform sterile compounding of pentobarbital sodium.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-10\">On cross-examination, Dr. Zentner admitted that he had not contacted any drug companies at all about their willingness to sell pentobarbital to the ADOC for executions. He also admitted that he was unaware that the company that currently owned Nembutal had restrictions in place to keep that drug from being purchased for use in lethal injections. Dr. Zentner admitted that he had no knowledge of whether the pharmacies that he found would be able to procure pentobarbital, nor did he ever personally attempt to purchase the drug from a manufacturer. He stated that one drug synthesis company that he has a \u201clong-term relationship\u201d with was \u201cwilling to discuss\u201d producing compounded pentobarbital. Dr. Zentner admitted that sodium thiopental is not listed in the FDA Orange Book, meaning it is not an approved product in the United States, although he stated that it is \u201cavailable offshore and conceivably could be imported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-11\">B. ADOC\u2019s Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-12\">Anne Adams Hill,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ADOC\u2019s general counsel, testified on behalf of the agency. Hill explained that, as part of her job, she was \u201croutinely\u201d in contact with other states\u2019 departments of corrections and that the subject of pentobarbital and lethal fil-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>jection came up in her conversations. Her job required her to constantly look for ways to procure new drugs and new sources for drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">Hill was aware that, in 2015, Georgia, Missouri, Texas, and Virginia executed inmates using a single-drug protocol of compounded pentobarbital. Hill testified that she contacted representatives from the departments of corrections in these four states in the fall of 2015 in an effort to obtain compounded pentobarbital. With respect to these four states she recalled asking \u201cspecifically if they had compounded pentobarbital and, if they did, if they would be willing to provide it to the [ADOC] and, if not, if they would provide us their source.\u201d All four refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">Hill stated that she was not aware of whether these four states had exclusive contracts with their drug sources, but that all four had refused to name those sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">Hill reiterated her deposition testimony that, in between September 2014 and November 2015, she had contacted 11 potential sources of pentobarbital, including those 4 states and 7 pharmacies within Alabama. She asked these pharmacies whether they would be willing to compound pentobarbital and provide it to the ADOC, and they all said no.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">Hill also testified that, in December 2015, she reached out to all of the 18 pharmacies on Dr. Zentner\u2019s list<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> regarding their willingness and/or capability to compound pentobarbital for the ADOC\u2019s use. None of the pharmacies agreed to provide the drug to ADOC, with two saying they were incapable of obtaining the ingredients, another claiming that it no longer did compounding, yet another- saying it only produced one drug, and the remainder stating that \u201cthey\u2019re not able to compound pentobarbital.\u201d In total, Hill testified that she reached out to \u201cat least 29\u201d potential sources in an attempt to procure compounded pentobarbital for the ADOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-11\">Hill admitted that she did not contact drug manufacturers, buying groups, or drug synthesis labs in an effort to find pentobarbital, nor did she conduct any Internet searches to obtain the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-12\">Hill also testified that she had made- no effort since September 2014 to obtain sodium thiopental and made no efforts to determine whether it could be imported. Hill said that she did not think sodium thiopen-tal was available in the United States, and she was not aware of any other state that had access to sodium thiopental.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-13\">VIII. TRIAL EVIDENCE ABOUT \u25a0 CONSCIOUSNESS -\u2022 ASSESSMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-14\">Since October 2007, the ADOC\u2019s written execution 'protocol has' included a three-step consciousness assessment, to be performed, after the administration of the first drug, but before administration of the second and third drugs. The purpose of this assessment is to ensure that the inmate has been rendered unconscious by the first drug. The assessment has three parts: (1) calling the inmate\u2019s name; (2) fluttering the inmate\u2019s eyelash; and (3) pinching the inmate\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-15\">A. Arthur\u2019s Evidence on the Consciousness Assessment</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-16\">Arthur presented four witnesses who attended prior executions at Holman Correc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>tional Facility, where Arthur is housed. These witnesses included three attorneys who worked for the Federal Defenders Office for the Middle District of Alabama and the videotaped deposition of Don Blocker, a volunteer lay minister at Holman. To varying degrees, they all testified that they did not see prison staff perform the pinch test at these executions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> All four witnessed the executions from the viewing room reserved for the inmate\u2019s family, and they had a clear view of the inmate\u2019s left side.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\">Two of the attorneys, however, admitted that them view of the inmate was obstructed when a correctional officer stepped up to the gurney to perform the consciousness assessment. All three attorneys admitted that, at the time of the executions they saw, they were unaware that there was even a consciousness assessment that was supposed to be performed. Similarly, Blocker acknowledged three times on cross-examination that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that he did not see parts of the consciousness assessment that were performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">At trial, Arthur also presented Dr. Alan David Kaye, who holds a medical degree and a Ph.D. in pharmacology.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He completed a residency in anesthesia and was currently employed'as the chairman of the anesthesia department at Louisiana State University (\u201cLSU\u201d). He is the director of anesthesia services at LSU\u2019s \u201cflagship\u201d hospital, has authored articles and books, and maintains an active anesthesiology practice. The court accepted Dr. Kaye as an expert witness in the field of anesthesiology.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">Dr. Kaye explained that \u201csedation\u201d is understood by people in his field as a continuum. This can range from \u201cmild sedation \u2018in which- a person can easily respond to verbal cues,\u201d to moderate sedation, deep sedation, and, finally, anesthesia, \u201cthe deepest level of the continuum.\u201d In his opinion, 'Alabama\u2019s consciousness assessment \u201cis inadequate to measure deep sedation or anesthesia.\u2019\u2019 While Dr. Kaye has not witnessed any executions in Alabama, he opined that the ADOC had not \u201cadequately administered\u201d the assessment that was in place. Dr. Kaye gave four reasons for his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">First, from reviewing the testimony of certain ADOC personnel, Dr. Kaye opined that \u201cit appears that the consciousness assessment may not have been performed at all in a number of prior executions.\u201d Second, statements given by certain ADOC personnel gave the impression to Dr. Kaye that their training was inadequate because they did not know how to properly perform the pinch test and/or communicate the results of the assessment. Third, again based on the prior testimony of certain ADOC officials, it was Dr. Kaye\u2019s opinion that members of Alabama\u2019s execution team do not pinch inmates with sufficient force. Fourth, it appeared to Dr. Kaye that members of the execution team did not adequately communicate the results of the consciousness assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-9\">Dr. Kaye testified that, in anesthesiology medical practice, you have to perform \u201cthe hardest pinch that you can pinch,\u201d hard enough to braise. Dr. Kaye explained, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>\u201cAs firm and as hard as you can. Not in a mild way; not in a moderate way. In a very significant way.\u201d Dr. Kaye testified that the ADOC personnel\u2019s testimony\u2014that (1) \u201cWe don\u2019t inflict pain on people\u201d; (2) \u201cI pinch hard enough that [a conscious person] would jerk their arm away from me\u201d; and (3) \u201c[I pinch] hard enough to wake [the inmate] if he\u2019s asleep\u201d\u2014are all inadequate to meet the proper threshold and speaks to the lack of training and inadequacy of the safeguard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">B. ADOC\u2019s Evidence on the Consciousness Assessment</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">The ADOC presented the testimony, either live or through deposition designations, of six current or former ADOC personnel, all of whom testified that all parts of the consciousness assessment were performed at every execution that they witnessed and/or participated in.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">At trial, Hill, the ADOC\u2019s general counsel, testified that she had attended nine or ten executions since the implementation of the consciousness assessment and observed all parts of the assessment being performed in all of those executions. Hill stated that, in her role as the ADOC general counsel, she had never received any information that the assessment was not performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">Hill testified that she viewed the executions from the commissioner\u2019s viewing room, which is positioned directly in front of each inmate\u2019s feet as he lies on the gurney, and that her view was not obstructed. Hill was present at Powell\u2019s execution, and she testified that all parts of the assessment were performed at Powell\u2019s execution. She said that the correct and complete performance of the consciousness assessment is something she looks for in the executions that she attends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-8\">Hill stated that correctional officers are aware that the consciousness assessment is a mandatory part of the execution protocol, and they are trained on how to perform it. They are instructed to perform the pinch test on the back of the inmate\u2019s left arm and to \u201cpinch hard.\u201d Hill stated that correctional officers practice performing the consciousness assessment before an execution. They are also trained to look for \u201cany reaction\u201d from the inmate and to report any reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-9\">The ADOC also presented the deposition testimony of: (1) G.C., Holman\u2019s warden from 2002 until 2009; (2) A.P., the Holman warden who succeeded G.C.; (3) D.C., the former captain of Holman\u2019s execution team; (4) W.H., the execution-team captain who succeeded D.C.; and (5) C.S., the chaplain at Holman. The wardens and captains testified that they were trained on the consciousness protocol, knew it was mandatory, and understood its purpose and importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">The wardens both testified that they were present at executions and all parts of the assessment, including the pinch test, were performed at every execution that they witnessed. Similarly, the captains of the execution team testified that they personally performed every aspect of the assessment, including the pinch test, at every execution. The Holman chaplain testified that he has witnessed approximately 40 executions at the prison since 1997. He witnessed the execution of Eddie Powell, and remembered seeing the consciousness assessment performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-11\">G.C. testified that he was the warden when the consciousness assessment was implemented and that ADOC representatives explained the assessment to him and told him when it should be performed. He testified that a team consisting of himself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>D.C., Hill, and former ADOC Commissioner Kim Thomas all agreed that inmates should be pinched on the back of the arm because it was \u201cinconspicuous\u201d but \u201cfairly sensitive.\u201d G.C. testified that he sat in the control room with another officer during executions and, on the warden\u2019s command, that officer would \u201cradio[ ] to the correctional personnel that\u2019s in the execution chamber that it\u2019s time to perform the consciousness test.\u201d If there was any reaction from the inmate, the procedure was for the officer in the execution chamber to radio back to the officer in the control room, but if the officer performing the consciousness assessment stepped away from the inmate, \u201cthat was [his] cue to proceed\u201d with administration of the second and third drugs. G.C. testified that, during his tenure as warden, no inmate ever reacted to administration of the first drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\">A.P. succeeded G.C. as warden and also testified that, once the officer performing the consciousness assessment stepped away from the inmate, he knew he could proceed with the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">D.C. was the captain of the execution team at Holman until his retirement in 2009 and was the captain when the consciousness assessment was introduced. It was his practice to do all three steps of the assessment simultaneously. He testified that, if the inmate showed any reaction to the consciousness assessment, he would turn and face the warden. In performing the pinch test, D.C. would pinch hard enough that, \u201cif it was a conscious person, they would jerk their arm away from me.\u201d He never received any reaction in the nine or ten executions in which he participated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">W.H. succeeded D.C. as the execution-team captain at Holman in 2009. As captain, W.H. would pinch the inmate\u2019s arm \u201chard enough to wake him if he\u2019s asleep.\u201d W.H. testified that he received oral, written, and physical training regarding the consciousness assessment from A.P., D.C., and another officer. W.H. testified that A.P. instructed him to stay at his place by the gurney if the inmate reacted. W.H. stated that no inmate ever reacted after he performed the consciousness assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">IX. DISTRICT COURT\u2019S APRIL 15, 2016 ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-9\">After setting out the factual background and procedural history of the case, the district court proceeded, first, to consideration of Arthur\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim. The district court summarized the trial testimonies of Dr. Zentner and ADOC attorney Hill on the issue of alternatives to midazolam\u2014namely, pentobarbital and sodium thiopental. The district court then made these findings of fact, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-10\">(1) The ADOC\u2019s supply of commercially manufactured pentobarbital, Nembutal, expired around November 2013, and the commercial supplier of Nembutal is prohibited from providing it for use in executions. Thus, Nembutal is no longer available to the ADOC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-11\">(2) When a drug is no longer commercially available, but remains listed in the FDA Orange Book, a licensed pharmacist may legally create the drug through compounding or some other process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-12\">(3) Pentobarbital sodium is the active ingredient in compounded pentobarbital, and there is a formulation for compounding an injectable solution of pento-barbital sodium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-13\">(4) Georgia, Missouri, Texas, and Virginia have all performed executions using compounded pentobarbital after Nembutal became unavailable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-14\">(5) The ADOC has attempted to obtain compounded pentobarbital for use in ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>ecutions from the departments of correction in all four of these states, but those efforts were unsuccessful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-4\">(6) The ADOC has contacted all of the accredited compounding pharmacies in Alabama to ascertain whether any of these pharmacies would be willing and able to provide compounded pentobarbi-tal to the ADOC, but those efforts have been unsuccessful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-5\">(7) Thus, pentobarbital is not feasible and readily implemented as an execution drug in Alabama, nor is it readily available to the ADOC, either compounded or commercially.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-7\">(8) Per the FDA Orange Book, sodium thiopental is no longer legally available in the United States, and there is no evidence that the FDA has approved the import of sodium thiopental from other countries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-8\">(9) Thus, sodium thiopental is unavailable to the ADOC for use in lethal injections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">The district court then made these conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-10\">(1) Arthur has the burden to plead and prove a known and available alternative method of execution under Glossip. It is Arthur\u2019s burden to identify an alternative method that is both feasible and readily implemented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5W-\">(2) To meet his burden, Arthur proposed execution with a one-drug protocol of either compounded pentobarbital or sodium thiopental.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-12\">(3)Dr. Zentner\u2019s testimony that the active ingredient for pentobarbital is \u201cavailable for purchase\u201d and that there are compounding pharmacies that could \u201chypothetically\u201d perform compounding did not meet Arthur\u2019s burden \u201cto prove that compounded pentobarbital is readily available to the \u25a0 ADOC \u25a0 for use in lethal injections. That it should, could, or may be falls far short' of-Arthur\u2019s burden.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-15\">(4) Further, Arthur\u2019s proof that (i) other states have procured compounded pento-barbital for use in their executions, (ii) \u201cwith effort it can be compounded,\u201d and (iii) \u201cindications on the internet\u201d are that pentobarbital is available for sale all fail to meet Arthur\u2019s burden to show that the drug was readily available to the ADOC. \u201cAt best, it proves a \u2018maybe.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-16\">(5) The fact that compounded pentobar-bital was available to other states \u201cat some point over the past two years does not, without more, establish that it is available to Alabama.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-17\">(6) .Although the ADOC did not have the burden of proof on this .issue, Hill\u2019s testimony lent \u201cfurther support for. the finding that compounded pentobarbital is not presently available to the ADOC.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-18\">(7) Arthur also failed to carry his burden of showing that sodium. thiopental was an available alternative because sodium thiopental is not legally available in the United States and evidence of its possible availability overseas does not satisfy Glossip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-19\">(8) Therefore, \u201cArthur sufficiently pleaded an Eighth Amendment claim, but he failed to meet his burden of proof. Defendants are entitled to judgment in their favor on Arthur\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>The district court then proceeded to evaluate Arthur\u2019s Equal Protection claim, which is based .on the consciousness assessment. After summarizing- the evidence on this claim, the district court made these findings of fact, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-4\">(1) In October 2007, the ADOC adopted a consciousness assessment in order to provide an \u201cadditional safeguard to lethal injection executions' to ensure that an inmate is unconscious\u201d before the second and third drugs are administered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-5\">(2) While there' was conflicting testimony as to whether the ADOC performed the pinch' test at all executions after October 2007, the district court credited the testimony of ADOC\u2019s witnesses over that of Arthur\u2019s witnesses. The district court gave two reasons for these findings. First, Hill and the other ADOC witnesses are all present or former ADOC employees who were knowledgeable about the consciousness assessment and were.trained \u201cto understand how, why, and when it is performed.\u201d Second, it found Arthur\u2019s witnesses, while \u201ctruthful from their perspective,\u201d to be \u201cless direct and less probative\u201d because (i) testimony that they \u201cdidn\u2019t see\u201d something' is less probative than testimony that it \u201cdidn\u2019t happen\u201d; and (ii) Arthur\u2019s witnesses had obstructed views of the execution and/or did not know to look for the various steps of the consciousness assessment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-6\">(3) Based on the evidence and these findings, \u2022 the district court found that \u201cthe evidence establishes that the. pinch test was performed in all executions that the ADOC has conducted after the ADOC adopted the consciousness assessment and incorporated it as a mandatory part of the written execution protocol.\u201d The district court found that any contradictory evidence did not \u201covercome\u201d the direct testimony from current and former AD\u00d3C wardens and other personnel who said \u201cwithout equivocation that they performed the assessment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-9\">(4)Further, because the consciousness assessment had been performed in every instance, the district court found that there was no deficiency in training, practice, or procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1285-10\">The district court then made these conclusions of law, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-11\">(1) The evidence that Arthur presented was \u201cinsufficient to prove that that [sic] the ADOC had inconsistently applied the protocol\u2019s mandatory consciousness assessment by failing to' perform the pinch test during sortie executions, or has \u201cotherwise ' deviated substantially from its execution protocol.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-12\">(2) Further, Arthur\u2019s Equal Protection challenge \u201cto the general adequacy of the ADOC\u2019s consciousness assessment, claiming that it should meet certain training and medical standards but does not, also fails.\u201d In support, the district court relied on language from Baze and Glossip to hold .that \u201c[t]he Eighth Amendment does not require that such medical training and standards or procedures be employed,\u201d noting that the Supreme, Court held in Baze that a consciousness assessment \u201cmuch simpler than the one implemented by the ADOC\u201d was not required under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>Eighth Amendment. Indeed, the district court wrote,' there is no constitutional requirement that a state perform a consciousness assessment at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-4\">(3) Accordingly, \u201cArthur\u2019s attempt to apply a medical standard of care to execution procedures and training for them, in this case, procedures that are not required by the\" Eighth Amendment, does not state a plausible equal protection claim. This principle is applicable to Arthur\u2019s Equal Protection claim challenging the \u2018adequacy\u2019 of the consciousness assessment and the training therefor, including the force used in the pinch test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-5\">(4) For these reasons, the district court held that the ADOC was entitled to judgment on the Equal Protection claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">After entering judgment in the ADOC\u2019s favor, the only issue remaining, concerned the interplay of the current protocol with Arthur\u2019s alleged idiosyncratic health issues and medical condition, which the district court would address later.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">X. AS-APPLIED CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">On May 6, 201\u20196, as to Arthur\u2019s as-applied claim based on his alleged health issues, the ADOC filed a motion for .judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, for' summary judgment.\" ADOC\u2019s motion argued that, to the extent that Arthur even adequately alleged an Eighth Amendment as-applied challenge based on his health concerns, the Defendants were entitled to summary judgment because (1) Arthur had failed to produce evidence of a genuine disputed \"fact that the use of mi-dazolam is \u201csure or very likely to cause serious illness or needless suffering\u201d by causing him to experience a painful heart attack; (2) Arthur had still failed to produce evidence of a genuine disputed fact that there are known and available alternatives that are feasible, readily implemented, and significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain; and (3) the district court should reject the \u201csham affidavits\u201d offered by Arthur in support.</p>\n<p id=\"Azo7\">The ADOC attached to its motion a November 16, 2015, declaration by Dr; J. Russell Strader, Jr., Arthur\u2019s witness, and a transcript of Dr. Strader\u2019s December 8, 2015, deposition. Notably, Dr. Strader\u2019s November 2015 declaration about midazo-lam is his third declaration filed in this case. We first review Dr. Strader\u2019s two prior declarations about pentobarbital before addressing his declaration about mi-dazolam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-12\">A. Dr. Strader\u2019s 2013 and 2015 Declarations About Pentobarbital</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-13\">In his first declaration back in March 2013, Dr. Strader criticized the use of pen-tobarbital for Arthur\u2019s execution. Athough Arthur wants pentobarbital used now, that Aabama cannot obtain it and must use midazolam, it is relevant to consider Arthur\u2019s previous position about pentobarbi-tal. Back in 2013, Dr. Strader opined that (1) Arthur\u2019s \u201clikelihood of having clinically significant obstructive, coronary disease [\u201cCAD\u201d] is at least 70%\u201d; (2) for people with CAD, the use of a 2,500-mg dose of pentobarbital was likely to induce a rapid and dangerous reduction in blood pressure, thereby triggering a heart attack; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>the heart attack would occur more quickly than the appropriate sedation; and (4) \u201c[g]iven the slower onset of the sedative effects of pentobarbital, it is likely that [Arthur] would experience the pain of said heart attack until such time as the sedative effects have onset to a sufficient degree to diminish the pain of the heart attack.\u201d (Emphasis added). In short, Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion about pentobarbital was that it would take a longer duration of time to induce appropriate sedation than that required for the onset of myocardial ische-mia/infarction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\">In his March 2013 declaration about pentobarbital, Dr. Strader stated that he was a board-certified cardiologist and the current Chief of Cardiovascular Services at a Texas hospital. As part of his routine clinical practice, he assessed the cardiovascular risk of patients scheduled to undergo surgery and anesthesia and, in particular, he assessed the likelihood that a patient would suffer a heart attack during or immediately after a cardiac procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">Dr. Strader\u2019s declaration included explanations of the \u201cHemodynamic and Anesthetic Actions of Pentobarbital and Thio-pental,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> along with an overview of the relevant aspects of cardiovascular anatomy and physiology, coronary atherosclerosis, and myocardial ischemia/infarction. His declaration included an explanation that a coronary artery needs to be 70% obstructed before it is hemodynamically significant. It also stated that, \u201c[i]n clinical practice, myocardial ischemia and infarction can occur due solely and exclusively to a drop in blood pressure\u201d and that this drop in blood pressure may be due to anesthesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">Dr. Strader\u2019s March 2013 declaration admitted that he had not examined Arthur but had reviewed his medical records only up until 2009. Although Dr. Strader\u2019s declaration did not indicate precisely what records he reviewed, approximately 68 pages worth of Arthur\u2019s medical history was included with the ADOC\u2019s summary judgment motion. These medical records indicate that Arthur has repeatedly refused to be seen by a doctor since at least 2009. Arthur was seen in the prison infirmary on January 17, 2009, where he complained of chest pain and atrial fibrillation. Arthur, however, refused medical care on this occasion, including a refusal to submit to an electrocardiogram (\u201cEKG\u201d) on January 20, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">The medical records include dozens of similar waivers, signed by Arthur, refusing various medical treatments. These waivers extend from 2009 until 2015. There is no indication that Dr. Strader, as of his first declaration in 2013, had access to or reviewed any probative post-2009 medical records for Arthur. There is also no reference, much less a diagnosis, to Arthur\u2019s ever having had a heart attack in his medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">According to Dr. Strader\u2019s review of Arthur\u2019s medical records as of 2009, Arthur was then 71 years old, with a history of hypertension (high blood pressure) and atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rhythm). In June 1999, Arthur visited the prison clinic and he complained of being short of breath, sweaty, and dizzy. According to the prison report, an EKG was performed at that time, and it was \u201cabnormal.\u201d Dr. Strader opined that these symptoms are \u201cidentical to those experienced by persons with ongoing myocardial infarction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-10\">In October 2004, Arthur was hospitalized for abdominal surgery, and he suffered from atrial fibrillation during that hospitalization. However, an echocardio-gram performed around that time came back \u201cessentially normal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>According to Dr. Strader, an EKG dated January 15, 2009. showed \u201catrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, along with Q waves in the inferior leads (leads II and aVF),\u201d Dr. Strader opined that, \u201c[t]he abnormalities on this [EKG]\u201d indicated that Arthur had suffered a prior heart attack. A request for a cardiology consult, dated January 26, 2009, indicated that Arthur was experiencing chest pain and rapid heart rate, '</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">After reviewing these medical documents through January 2009, Dr, Strader opined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-5\">Arthur\u2019s abnormal [EKG] showing evidence of a prior myocardial infarction,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> history of recurrent atrial fibrillation, age, presence of hypertension, and symptoms of recurrent chest pain, all of which are independent risk factors for coronary heart disease, confer a risk of having clinically significant obstructive coronary artery disease of at least 70% at a minimum, and possibly greater.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">Dr. Strader opined that the use of pen-tobarbital would cause\u2019 a drop in blood pressure and a heart attack in Arthur before the onset of the drug\u2019s sedative effect. Dr. Strader admits the sedative effect from pentobarbital will occur but opines that Arthur will experience pairi from a heart attack \u201cuntil such time\u201d as the sedative effect reduces the pain. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-7\">After Alabama changed the first drug from pentobarbital to midazolam, Dr. Strader switched positions and wrote a second declaration. This time, in that second declaration, Dr. Strader now suggested pentobarbital should actually be used in Arthur\u2019s execution but only as a one-drug protocol. Dr. Strader opined that if pento-barbital were used as a one-drug protocol and-\u201cadministered gradually and with due consideration for Mr. Arthur\u2019s medical condition,\u201d he did not believe that Arthur would suffer a heart attack before being properly anesthetized. Dr. Strader\u2019s second declaration was conclusory and gave no specifics on what \u201cadministered gradually\u201d would mean or what steps would be necessary as \u201cdue consideration for Mr. Arthur\u2019s medical condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-10\">B. Dr. Strader\u2019s Nov. 16, 2015 Declaration</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-11\">In his third declaration, Dr. Strader now criticizes the use of midazolam for use in executions, using precisely the same reasoning (and often the exact same wording) used in his earlier declaration condemning pentobarbital. Specifically, Dr. Strader now opines that (1) Arthur\u2019s likelihood of having obstructive CAD is at least 70%; (2) for patients with obstructive CAD, a large bolus dose of midazolam is \u201chighly likely\u201d to rapidly reduce blood pressure in patients with' this disease, thereby triggering a heart attack; (3) the heart attack would occur before.the appropriate sedation from midazolam; and .(4) given the length of time between the onset of heart attack and the onset of sedation, \u201cit is likely that Mr. Arthur would experience the . pain of the heart attack until the sedative effects take effect to a sufficient degree to diminish the pain of the heart attack, which could occur several minutes after the onset of the heart attack,\u201d While the drug at issue was different; Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion and reasoning remained the same\u2014that Arthur was \u201clikely\u201d to experience the pain of a heart attack before being fully sedated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-12\">Dr. Strader\u2019s November 2015 declaration is essentially a recycled version of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>original March 2013 declaration, but with the following added information about mi-dazolam:</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\">\u2022 As part of his routine clinical practice, Dr. Strader administers \u201cmidazolam to patients for the purpose of achieving sedation for invasive cardiac procedures.\u201d Dr. Strader has performed approximately 3,500 invasive cardiac procedures in cardiac patients using midazolam as a sedative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">\u2022 As to Arthur\u2019s likelihood of having CAD, Dr/ Strader updated Arthuris age to 73 years old-, deleted his earlier declaration\u2019s reference to Arthur\u2019s normal echo-cardiogram report in October 2004, and added a paragraph regarding Arthur\u2019s family history of \u201cheart trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">\u2022 In Dr. Strader\u2019s clinical experience, \u201cwhere midazolam in small doses (2-5 mg) is used to sedate patients undergoing invasive cardiac procedures, midazolam\u2019s sedative effects generally take 5 minutes or more to take effect\u201d and the hemodynamic effects of the drug can occur more quickly, within 1-2 minutes. (Emphasis added). He stated that, when used in clinical doses, midazolam typically produces a 10-20% drop in blood pressure. Dr. Strader opined that, when.midazolam is given in the large 500 mg bolus dose contemplated by the ADOC protocol, it is \u201chighly likely that such drop in blood pressure would occur more quickly than it would occur in the administration of a clinical dose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">\u2022 Dr. Strader explained that the hemo-dynamic effects of midazolam occur more quickly than the sedative effects because the effect on vasculature is immediate, while the drug must travel to and affect the brain before sedation takes place. Dr. Strader, however, acknowledged that there is no \u201cinstitutional experience\u201d regarding a 500-mg dose of midazolam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">C. Dr. Strader\u2019s Dec. 8, 2015 Deposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">In his 2015 deposition, Dr. Strader elaborated on this opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-10\">1. Likelihood of Arthur having CAD</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-11\">\u25a0 Dr. Strader reviewed Arthur\u2019s medical records but admitted that he had never personally examined Arthur, had never spoken to Arthur, and had never spoken to any doctors who had treated Arthur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-12\">Based on the medical records provided to him, Dr. Strader noted that Arthur had high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and abnormalities on his EKGs that were \u201chighly suggestive of coronary disease.\u201d Dr. Strader testified regarding the incident in June 1999 (where Arthur visited the prison clinic with complaints of being short of breath, sweaty, and dizzy and then had an EKG come back with \u201cabnormal\u201d results), and he stated that Arthur\u2019s symptoms and his abnormal EKG made it \u201cpossible\u201d that Arthur had a heart attack back in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-13\">Dr. Strader reiterated his opinion from his. declaration .that the abnormal EKG, taken on January 15, 2009, was \u201cdiagnostic\u201d of Arthur having suffered a previous heart attack, although Dr. Strader could not say when this prior heart attack occurred. When' asked if he could diagnose a previous heart attack based just on an EKG, Dr. Strader replied, \u201cYes. Absolutely.\u201d Dr. Strader also referenced the January 2009 request for a cardiology consult contained in Arthur\u2019s medical records, but admitted that he did not know whether Arthur was ever actually evaluated by a cardiologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-14\">2. Midazolam Leads to a Drop in Blood Pressure</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-15\">In Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion, if you administered even a 100-mg dose of midazolam to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>a patient, such large doses \u201care expected to have ... rapid, significant hemodynamic effects.\u201d He explained that \u201chemodynamic effect\u201d means a drop in blood pressure. To correct this issue, he suggested that doctors would give \u201cpressors,\u201d very large amounts of IV fluids and medication, to stabilize the blood pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">Dr. Strader testified that, in his clinical practice, drops in blood pressure from 2-5 mg doses of midazolam can occur \u201cwithin just a minute or two, sometimes sooner.\u201d He went on to say that, \u201cextrapolating off of that experience to this very large dose, you would expect to see an extremely rapid and very large drop in blood pressure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">He explained that, for people with obstructed arteries, this rapid blood-pressure drop could result in a heart attack, because \u201cyou have to maintain a certain amount of pressure in order to keep fluid going through a tube that\u2019s got a fan-amount of blockage in it. This is ... applied physics.\u201d He further explained that older people, starting at around age 70, tended to have bigger drops in blood pressure in response to the administration of midazolam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">In his deposition, Dr. Strader reviewed the medical articles and other material that he cited in his November 2015 declaration, which he stated lent support to the idea that midazolam leads to a drop in blood pressure. Dr. Strader admitted that (1) none of the articles or materials dealt with such high doses, and (2) none of the articles or materials explicitly stated that midazolam should not be used on people with CAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-7\">3. The Heart Attack Would Occur Before Sedation</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-8\">Dr. Strader stated that, based on his clinical experience, the sedation effects of a clinical dose of 2-5 mg of midazolam typically take about five minutes to take effect. He testified that he would typically use this dosage of midazolam on patients before \u201cinvasive cardiac procedure[s].\u201d (Emphasis added). When a patient is administered a clinical dose of midazolam (2 to 5 mg), the patient goes into a deep sleep. They can be aroused and spoken to, but they are \u201cvery comfortable.\u201d (Emphasis added). He explained that in his clinic, he would titrate the midazolam, giving it in small doses until appropriate sedation was achieved. Dr. Strader admitted that he normally gave some sort of pain medication, such as fentanyl, along with the midazolam, but that this was not required. He could proceed with the procedure using midazolam alone, although it would require a higher dose. He stated that the largest dose of midazolam he ever administered to a patient was a 20-mg dose, used because the patient had no sedative response to the medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-11\">While he opined that a 100-mg dose of midazolam would cause sedation within \u201cthree to five minutes,\u201d he could not give an exact time because such a dose is \u201cfar outside of the realm of anybody\u2019s clinical experience\u201d and, indeed, the time to sedation \u201ccould be a very wide range.\u201d When asked about a 250-mg or 500-mg dose of midazolam, Dr. Strader stated that, \u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody really knows to what degree [sedation] would onset.\u201d Dr. Strader then indicated he would need to defer to an anesthesiologist about the onset time of sedation from a 500-mg dose of midazo-lam:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-12\">Q. Now, in an execution, is it your opinion that it would take five minutes before a person becomes unconscious if they\u2019re administered 500 milligrams of midazolam?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>[Objection]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-4\">A. No, I don\u2019t think I gave any opinion as to\u2014as to the timing for ... consciousness to abate.... In a clinical setting, I would defer that to an anesthesiology colleague who is, you know, more familiar with the concept of consciousness. That\u2019s outside my realm of practice. Again, I think you\u2019d see a very rapid decrease, almost instantaneous decrease in blood pressure, and hemodynamic effects would be virtually instantaneous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-7\">Q. But regarding the sedative effects, you just don\u2019t know how long?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-8\">A. I think it would take longer; how much longer, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAI4\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-9\">Q. But you can\u2019t give us a specific amount of time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-10\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-11\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-12\">A. I don\u2019t think anybody can give you a specific amount of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-13\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-14\">Dr. Strader later stated he was aware that anesthesiologists use midazolam to induce anesthesia but he had never done that as it was outside the scope of his area of practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-15\">Q. Have you ever known an anesthesiologist to use midazolam to cause unconsciousness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-16\">[Objection]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-17\">A. I would assume that anesthesiologists use midazolam in part of their routine practice for the\u2014you know, in anesthesia. I don\u2019t know the details of what they do, or when they choose, or why they choose what they choose, so ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-19\">Q. But are you aware of it being used to induce anesthesia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-20\">[Objection]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-21\">A. I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s approved for that use, and I think some anesthesiologists use it for that purpose. I don\u2019t have any direct knowledge of what they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-24\">Q. Okay. So you\u2019re never involved in a procedure where an anesthesiologist might use midazolam to induce anesthesia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-25\">[Objection]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-26\">A. No, I don\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s outside the scope of my clinical practice. You know, I just let them choose what they need to choose[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-27\">(Emphasis added). Similarly, when asked if he knew whether midazolam \u201cis ever used to maintain anesthesia,\u201d he replied that the drug \u201ccarries an indication for that[, but] I wouldn\u2019t have direct knowledge any particular anesthesiologist\u2019s use of it for that reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-28\">Dr. Strader explained that anesthesiologists were not present when he performed his invasive cardiac procedures, and there was no policy or procedure on how much midazolam to give patients. Dr. Strader reiterated that he uses midazolam \u201cin patients with coronary disease all the time in routine clinical practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-29\">4. Gradual Administration of Pentobar-bital</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-30\">Despite stating in his first declaration that a 2,500-mg bolus dose of pentobarbi-tal was also likely to induce a heart attack, Dr. Strader reiterated his conclusion from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>his second declaration that, if pentobarbi-tal were administered-gradually as part of a one-drug protocol, he did not believe that Arthur would suffer a heart attack before being properly anesthetized. Dr. Strader admitted he would not know how to administer 2,500 mg of pentobarbital gradually and he would defer on that matter to an anesthesiologist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-4\">A. I wouldn\u2019t know how gradual to do it. I know that the analogy holds to what we do with cardiac patients in the cath lab with midazolam. You know, again, we use small doses gradually over longer periods of time in order to prevent acute onset of myocardial ischemia and acute drops in blood pressure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-5\">Q. So when you\u2019re talking about 2,500 milligrams, how long would that take\u2014[Objection]\u2014if you administered the drug gradually?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-6\">[Objection]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-7\">A. I would have no idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-8\">Q. I mean, are we talking minutes or hours\u2014-[Objection]\u2014-or do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-10\">A. I would\u2014I would defer that to an anesthesiologist who has more experience with the drug.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-11\">Q. Well, I mean, you\u2019re the one making the sworn declaration, and you said, \u201cadministered gradually,\u201d and I\u2019m asking you, you know, how gradually would you have to administer it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-12\">[Objection]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-13\">A. Yeah. Again, I think it\u2019s the general concept that gradual administration in small doses, you know, is the general paradigm to prevent adverse effects. Exactly what \u201cgradual\u201d would be defined as in this instance I wouldn\u2019t\u2014I wouldn\u2019t know specifics or have specifics to recommend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-15\">Dr. Strader also would not know how to administer a large dose of midazolam gradually but would defer to an anesthesiologist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-16\">Q. Okay. Do you have the same opinion on if midazolam is used in a one-drug protocol\u2014[Objection]\u2014if it was administered gradually?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-17\">A. I think the general paradigm holds in order to avoid adverse effects with these medications, you administer them in low doses slowly. To what extent midazolam would produce full unconsciousness or anesthesia, again, I would defer that to an anesthesiologist. It\u2019s outside of my scope of practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-20\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-21\">D. Dr. Buffington\u2019s Nov. 23, 2015 Declaration</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-22\">As to midazolam, the ADOC offered a declaration from Dr. Daniel Buffington, an expert witness in the field of pharmacy. Dr. Buffington is a clinical pharmacologist who holds a Doctor of Pharmacy and Master of Business Administration degrees. He is on the faculty of the University of South Florida Colleges of Pharmacy and Medicine, and he is also the president of the American Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-23\">Dr. Buffington agreed with Dr. Strader that a common clinical dosage of midazo-lam is 2 to 5 mg, and that the 500-mg dosage contemplated in the ADOC\u2019s protocol \u201cis well beyond the dosage of any existing therapeutic application.\u201d Dr. Buffing-ton explained that, when clinical doses of midazolam (2-5 mg) are used as an \u201canes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>thetic induction agent, sedation occurs ... within 2-2.5 minutes without narcotic pre-medications or other pre-medications with sedative effects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-4\">Dr. Buffington stated that the medical literature \u201ccontradicts Strader\u2019s theoretical concerns\u201d and \u201c[t]here is no scientific or medical evidence to support the theory or concerns that midazolam (IV), at low or high dosages, would result in a significant hypotensive event ... prior to the onset of sedation, or is capable of inducing or worsening ischemic cardiac damage, acute cardiac events, excruciating pain and/or suffering.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> According to Dr. Buffington, a rapid infusion of midazolam could result in induction of anesthesia in as little as 30 seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">E. Midazolam Package Insert</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">The ADOC also submitted the midazo-lam manufacturer\u2019s package insert with its summary judgment motion. The insert states that sedation is achieved in 3 to 5 minutes after IV injection, and that, when midazolam is given as an anesthetic induction agent, \u201cinduction of anesthesia occurs ... in 2 to 2.5 minutes without narcotic premedication or other sedative premedi-cation.\u201d (Emphasis added),</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-9\">F. Dr. Strader\u2019s March. 29, 2016 Declaration</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-10\">In February 2016, the district court ordered the parties to meet and confer about a possible modified execution protocol. On March 8, 2016, as part of these negotiations, Arthur\u2019s counsel sent a l\u00e9tter to the ADOC about gradual administration of mi-dazolam, requesting a trained professional to use several pieces of medical monitoring equipment and to administer other medication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al2H\">[Arthur\u2019s] , position is that a protocol designed to administer midazolam gradually and with due consideration for Mr. Arthur\u2019s medical condition\u2014including with medical monitoring of Mr. Arthur\u2019s health by \u00e1 trained' professional during the protocol with the use of an electroencephalogram,. an electrocardiogram, a bispectral index monitor and/or other appropriate methods [which] may reduce to some extent the likelihood of Mr. Arthur suffering the pain of a heart attack during administration of the protocol, although it would not ameliorate those risks entirely or address the other previously identified reasons why the use of midazolam in a three-drug execution protocol is violative of Mr. Arthur\u2019s constitutional rights. Such a modified protocol may also require the administration of other medication to prevent cardiac complications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1293-18\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-19\">. Arthur also submitted Dr. Strader\u2019s fourth declaration, dated March 29, 2016. Dr. Strader stated, that he was ethically prohibited from suggesting modifications to a lethal injection protocol. Accordingly, he merely explained what precautions are taken and procedures followed when administering midazolam in a clinical setting. Those precautions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-20\">\u2022 administration of midazolam \u201cat a gradual rate closer to that used in clinical practice\u2014i.e., 0.5 mg to 2 mg at a time, repeated every 2 to 4 minutes,\u201d along with;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>\u2022 a trained professional (although this person need \u00a1not have a medical degree);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-4\">\u2022 who assesses the patient\u2019s response to the- prior dose before continuing with another; \u25a0 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-6\">\u2022 continuous EKG monitoring;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-7\">\u2022 continuous pulse oximetry monitoring; \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-8\">\u2022 frequent -blood pressure monitoring;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-9\">\u2022 the ability to give fluids and medication via IV to raise blood pressure; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-10\">\u2022 use of the opioid fentanyl.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-11\">Ultimately,'the negotiations reached an impasse with the parties unable to agree on a modified execution protocol.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-12\">XI. MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-13\">On May 13, 2016, Arthur mov\u00e9d for a new trial on his Eighth Amendment claim. He claimed that, three months after the trial, he discovered new evidence that compounded pentobarbital is available to the ADOC. He alleged that, after trial, the ADOC proffered Dr. Buffington as an expert for deposition in another case,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> on March 17, 2016; Arthur alleged that Dr. Buffington said that he \u201cpersonally knew compounding pharmacists who would be willing to compound pentobarbital for ADOC.... To obtain pentobarbital ... defendants would \u2018just have to ask\u2019\u2014-which they did not do.\u201d Arthur attached only excerpts from Dr. Buffington\u2019s deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-16\">The ADOC opposed Arthur\u2019s motion for a new trial, arguing that Arthur had misrepresented Dr. Buffington\u2019s testimony. The ADOC submitted a more fulsome excerpt from Dr. Buffington\u2019s March 17, 2016, deposition testimony, which reflects that Dr. Buffington actually testified that (1) he knows pharmacists who are capable of compounding pentobarbital and would do it for the ADOC, but that (2) he would have to check with them first before he could give their names to the ADOC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-17\">Q. And would you be willing to compound pentobarbital for the State of Alabama?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-18\">A. I can identify numerous other individuals who would be probably more readily capable based on equipment and site and instrumentation to do that, but I know that there are multiple facilities that can do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-19\">Q. Would they do it for the Alabama Department of Corrections?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-20\">A. We\u2019d just have to ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-21\">Q. Okay. Is it something\u2014There\u2019s a lot of controversy around\u2014The whole reason that we\u2019re here is because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>there\u2019s been a crackdown on certain drugs by the manufacturers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-4\">A. Well, I wouldn\u2019t call it a crackdown. I would say limited market availability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-5\">Q. Right.

Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ4\">Subsequently, Dr. Buffington contacted these pharmacists but none were willing to compound pentobarbital for the ADOC or even allow Dr. Buffington to reveal their names. To show this, the ADOC submitted an affidavit from Dr. Buffington, dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>April 22, 2016. Dr. Buffington, averred that, \u201c[n]one of the 15 pharmacists that I contacted were able and willing to supply compounded pentobarbital for use in lethal injections to the ADOC. In addition, none of the pharmacists provided me permission to share their names and contact information with the ADOC or counsel for the Defendants.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-9\">In his affidavit, Dr. Buffington further stated that he had testified at his earlier deposition that \u201cthe use of pharmaceuticals in lethal injections is an area of open discussion in the pharmacy community and that some colleagues I have encountered at professional events such as national conventions and conferences have commented that they would be willing to compound pentobarbital for use in lethal injections.\u201d Dr. Buffington explained that, after that deposition, counsel for the defendants asked him to contact pharmacists and pharmacies \u201cto inquire if any were willing to be contacted directly by the ADOC concerning the performance of this type of technical service.\u201d To this end, he contacted 15 pharmacists, both within and outside of Alabama, and asked them \u201cabout their capability to compound sterile pentobarbi-tal for intravenous [IV] use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">Dr. Buffington concluded that he maintained his belief that \u201cthere are pharmacists in the United States that are able to compound pentobarbital for use in lethal injections because other states have been reported to have obtained [it],\u201d but he was not able to locate any that were willing and able to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-12\">XII. DISTRICT COURT\u2019S JULY 19, 2016 ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-13\">The district court wrote that, \u201c[d]istilled to its essence, Arthur\u2019s as-applied claim is that his cardiovascular issues, combined with age and emotional makeup,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> create a constitutionally unacceptable risk of pain that will result m a violation of the Eighth Amendment if he is executed under the ADOC\u2019s current protocol.\u201d The district court applied, as it must, the same Baze/Glossip standard to Arthur\u2019s as-applied challenge as it applied to his facial challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-16\">As to Arthur\u2019s health issues, the district court concluded Arthur\u2019s Third Amended Complaint had failed to plead adequately or properly an \u201cas-applied\u201d claim and, alternatively, the district court questioned whether Arthur had presented sufficient evidence of any truly \u201cunique health concerns\u201d as to his execution. But in \u201can abundance of caution\u201d the district court considered the merits of Arthur\u2019s as-applied claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-17\">Because that \u201cas-applied\u201d claim was based on Dr. Strader\u2019s declarations, the district court examined the methodology and foundation, or lack thereof, underlying Dr. Strader\u2019s opinions. The district court ultimately concluded that Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion was speculative and unreliable under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). We thus review the district court\u2019s analysis of Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion and then its reasons for excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-18\">The district court pointed out that these facts are undisputed: (1) Dr. Strader has never examined Arthur; (2) Arthur has repeatedly refused to submit to medical examination; and (3) Arthur has not been seen or examined by a cardiologist since 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>Turning first to the alternative-method prong in Arthur\u2019s as-applied- claim, the district court determined that \u201cArthur failed entirely\u201d to establish the existence of a known and available alternative. To the extent Arthur 'relied on a one-drug protocol of pentobarbital dr sodium thiopental, the district court found these options were \u201cforeclosed\u201d for the reasons given in its earlier order.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-4\">The district court found that Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion\u2014that Arthur\u2019s blood pressure would drop before sedation took effect\u2014is \u201cspeculative and unreliable when extrapolated from a clinical dose of 2 to 5 mg, to a non-elinieal, bolus dose of 500 mg.\u201d The district court noted that there was no record evidence regarding whether a time \u201cgap\u201d\u2014between midazolam\u2019s hemodynamic effects and its sedative effects at a 500-mg dose\u2014would occur at all or, if such a gap does occur, in what sequence it would occur. The district court then \u201cventurfed] into [the] technical thicket\u201d of available medical and scientific evidence, parsing it into four parts: (1) the hemodynamic and anesthetic effects of midazolam; (2) a clinical dose for sedation; (3) a clinical dose for anesthesia; and (4) a 500-mg bolus dose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">First, the district court noted that there was evidence that clinical doses of midazo-lam were known to produce a drop in blood pressure. Moreover, Dr. Strader characterized the drug as both a sedative and an anesthetic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">The district court noted Dr. Strader\u2019s testimony that, with a clinical dose (2-5 mg) of midazolam, there was typically a gap of three to four minutes between the hemodynamic effects and the sedation effects of midazolam in clinical practice. But Dr. Strader acknowledged that none of the medical literature he relied on cautioned against using midazolam for patients with CAD and, indeed, Dr. Strader himself used midazolam routinely to sedate his cardiac patients during invasive cardiac procedures. Taking Dr. Strader\u2019s claim that he, as a cardiologist, had performed approximately 3,500 cardiac procedures with mi-dazolam as a sedative and only 24 of those patients experienced a heart attack after being sedated, the district court calculated that less than 1% of those 3,500 patients suffered a heart- attack following the administration of a clinical dose of midazo-lam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">The district court also analyzed the evidence regarding use of midazolam for \u201canesthesia.\u201d Dr. Strader had administered midazolam only for sedation purposes\u2014 which is a lighter level of sedation than full anesthesia. Dr, Strader \u201chad no opinion as to what would be a clinical dose of midazo-lam sufficient to induce anesthesia.\u201d However, the midazolam package insert explains that, even at small clinical dosage levels, midazolam can induce both sedation and anesthesia in as little as 2 minutes without narcotic .premedication. In- other words, if a 2-5 mg dose of midazolam produced sedation or anesthesia in two minutes, Arthur had failed to show how long it took a 500-mg dose to achieve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>anesthesia or that both the blood pressure drop and a heart attack would occur before a 500-mg dose achieved anesthesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">The district court also pointed out that: (1) Dr. Strader had experience with small doses; (2) Dr. Strader declined to offer any opinion about the length of time it would take a 500-mg dose of midazolam to render a patient unconscious, reiterating many times that anesthesia was outside his field of expertise; and (3) nevertheless, Dr. Strader \u201cremained of the opinion that the sedative effects of a 500-mg bolus dose would take longer than the hemodynamic effects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">The district court rejected Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion of the time gap as unreliable under Daubert. The district court stressed three reasons. First, Dr. Strader was incapable of saying how much time it would take a 500-mg dose to render a patient unconscious and, therefore, \u201cit is impossible for him to extrapolate a sequence of hemody-namic effect and sedation.\u201d Second, any theoretical \u201cgap\u201d between hemodynamic and sedative effects is speculative because this gap is connected with much lower dosages. Third, Dr. Strader himself has never administered more than 20 mg of midazolam during his career. In short, Arthur had provided no \u201cadmissible medical expert opinion testimony to establish either the clinical dosage of midazolam necessary to induce anesthesia or the time-frame within which that would occur.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">Even as to whether Arthur has CAD in the first place, the district court determined that, because Arthur had not submitted to a medical examination since 2009, Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion that Arthur suffered from CAD also \u201cborders on being speculative and unreliable.\u201d As the district court explained, \u201c[b]oth must exist\u2014the heart condition and the gap [in time between the hemodynamic effects and the sedation effects of midazolam] Dr. Strader expects\u2014for there to be a realistic likelihood of the heart attack\u201d before sedation takes effect. Based on the evidence as presented, the court determined that \u201cit cannot be said that a heart attack is sure or very likely at all; one cannot make that connection from the medical evidence.\u201d Therefore, Arthur had failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact of a \u201csure or very likely risk of severe pain in the application of Alabama\u2019s execution protocol as applied to him,\u201d and this failure \u201cdooms his as-applied Eighth Amendment claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-8\">As to Arthur\u2019s motion for a new trial, the district court concluded that \u201cArthur\u2019s \u2018new evidence\u2019 is nothing but generic testimony from Dr. Buffington describing passing conversations he has had with other pharmacists during national conventions concerning the use of pharmaceuticals, including pentobarbital, for lethal injection.\u201d However, in his subsequent affidavit, Dr. Buffington actually admitted that he contacted 15 pharmacists and none were willing or able to provide compounded pento-barbital for use in lethal injections for the ADOC. Thus, Dr. Buffington\u2019s earlier deposition testimony was not \u201clikely to produce a new result\u201d at trial, and the motion for a new trial was denied. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-9\">On July 19, 2016, the district court entered its final judgment in favor of the defendants. Arthur timely appealed the final judgment to our Court. We read the Final Judgment to encompass both the April 15, 2016 and July 19, 2016 orders. This Court ordered expedited briefing, which is now complete as of October 19, 2016. The Alabama Supreme Court has set an execution date of November 3, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-10\">XIII. RELEVANT LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">With this lengthy\u2019 procedural history in mind, we turn to Arthur\u2019s arguments on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>appeal. Before we do so, however, it is helpful to set forth the legal framework within which we must resolve Arthur\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\">A. Glossip and Baze</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">The Eighth Amendment prohibits \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VIII. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held the death penalty to be constitutional. See Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2739. \u201c[I]t necessarily follows that there must be a constitutional means of carrying it out.\u201d Id. at 2732-33 (alterations adopted) (quoting Baze, 553 U.S. at 47,128 S.Ct. at 1529) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, the Supreme Court has held that \u201csome risk of pain is inherent in any method of execution,\u201d and that the Constitution does not require \u201cthe avoidance of all risk of pain.\u201d Id. at 2733 (quoting Baze, 553 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 1529).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">The Supreme Court has required prisoners seeking to challenge a state\u2019s method of execution to meet a \u201cheavy burden.\u201d Baze, 553 U.S. at 53, 128 S.Ct. at 1533 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, in order to succeed on an Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claim, the Supreme Court has instructed that prisoners must demonstrate that the challenged method of execution presents a risk that is <em>\u201csure or very likely </em>to cause serious illness and needless suffering, and give rise to sufficiently <em>imminent </em>dangers.\u201d Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2737 (quoting Baze, 553 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 1531) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo prevail on such a claim, there must be a substantial risk of serious harm, an objectively intolerable risk of harm.\u201d Id (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">This requires more than merely showing \u201ca slightly or marginally safer alternative.\u201d Id. (quoting Baze, 553 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 1531) (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, prisoners are required to \u201cidentify an alternative that is feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduces a substantial risk of severe pain.\u201d Id (citing Baze, 553 U.S. at 52, 128 S.Ct. at 1532) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). In other words, the prisoner must demonstrate that the risk of severe pain is substantial \u201cwhen compared to the known and available alternatives.\u201d Id. (emphasis added) (citing Baze, 553 U.S. at 61, 128 S.Ct. at 1537). Thus, we must view the two \u201cprongs\u201d of the Baze/Glossip test in concert\u2014it is not enough to ask merely if the risk of severe pain is substantial. Instead, the risk of severe pain must be substantial and objectively intolerable in comparison to an alternative method that is feasible and readily implemented. Id. And that alternative method must \u201csignificantly reduce\u201d a substantial risk of severe pain. Id. \u201cAs the Supreme Court made abundantly clear in Glossip itself, the burden rests with the claimant to \u2018plead and prove\u2019 both prongs of the test.\u201d Brooks, 810 F.3d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-14\">Critical to this case, Glossip involved the same three-drug protocol that the ADOC will use in Arthur\u2019s execution. 135 S.Ct. at 2734-35. In Glossip, the Supreme Court concluded, inter alia, that the petitioner had not \u201cproved that any risk posed by midazolam is substantial when compared to known and available alternative methods of execution.\u201d Id. at 2737-38. The Supreme Court later repeated that the petitioners had not satisfied their burden of establishing that any risk of harm was substantial when compared to a known and available alternative method of execution. Id. at 2738-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">B. Feasible, Readily Implemented, and Significantly Safer</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">While the Supreme Court in Glossip did not explicitly define \u201cfeasible,\u201d \u201creadily im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>plemented,\u201d or \u201cknown and available,\u201d it upheld a factual finding that both sodium thiopental and pentobarbital were unavailable to Oklahoma by 2014 for use in executions where the state was unable to procure those drugs due to supplier problems. Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2733-34, 2738.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">And earlier in 2016, in another Alabama-execution case, this Court rejected an inmate\u2019s claim that the exact same alternatives that Arthur proposes here\u2014 namely, single-drug protocols of either pentobarbital<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or sodium thiopental\u2014 were alternatives \u201cavailable to the ADOC that significantly reduce the risk of an unconstitutional level of pain.\u201d Brooks, 810 F.3d at 819.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This Court concluded that (1) \u201cthe fact that the drug [pentobarbital] was available in those states at some point over the past two years does not, without more, make it likely that it is available to Alabama now\u201d; and (2) Brooks had not shown that \u201cthere is now a source for pentobarbital that would sell it to the ADOC for use in executions.\u201d Id. at 819-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">In that same Alabama-execution case, this Court determined that petitioner Brooks had not shown that sodium thio-pental was available. Id. at 820-21. Brooks had relied on certain news articles that other states had been able to obtain the drug, but these sources actually undermined his claim that the ADOC \u201ccould readily import sodium thiopental.\u201d Id. As to Brooks\u2019s request for a single-drug mi-dazolam protocol, this Court noted that Brooks had conceded that a midazolam-only protocol had never been used in an execution, and his concession \u201cdeeply undercut his claim that it is a known, readily implementable, and materially safer lethal injection alternative.\u201d Id. at 821-22. And given the dearth of evidence presented on the safety of this untested altei\u2019native, Brooks was unlikely to establish that it was \u201cmaterially safer than a protocol that is identical to one approved by the Supreme Court.\u201d Id. at 822 (citing Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2734-35).</p>\n<p id=\"AP0\">Viewing these precedents together, we conclude that Glossip\u2019s \u201cknown and available\u201d alternative test requires that a petitioner must prove that (1) the State actually has access to the alternative; (2) the State is able to carry out the alternative method of execution relatively easily and reasonably quickly; and (3) the requested alternative would \u201cin fact significantly reducef ] a substantial risk of severe pain\u201d relative to the State\u2019s intended method of execution. Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2737; Brooks, 810 F.3d at 819-23,</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">With this legal framework in mind, we now address each of Arthur\u2019s arguments on appeal in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">XIV. PENTOBARBITAL IS NOT AVAILABLE TO ADOC</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">Arthur claims that the district court erred in finding that he had not carried his burden to show that pentobarbital is a feasible and readily implemented alterna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>tive method of execution available to the ADOC.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\">The standard of review and burden of persuasion are critical to the resolution of this case. The Supreme Court has made unequivocally clear that, in method-of-execution challenges, (1) the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under a deferential clear error standard, and (2) the petitioner-inmate bears the burden of persuasion. Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2739. This includes the requirement that a plaintiff inmate must.\u201cplead and prove a known and available alternative.\u201d Id at 2738, 2739.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">In Glossip, the Supreme Court considered a challenge to the identical lethal injection protocol at issue in this case\u2014 midazolam, followed by a bromide-based paralytic, followed by potassium chloride. Id. at 2734-35. The dosage of midazolam is the same here as in Glossip: 500 milligrams. Id. at 2740. The Glossip plaintiffs brought a \u00a7 1983 action alleging that this protocol, particularly midazolam, created an unacceptable risk of severe pain and sought a preliminary injunction. Id. at 2731.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">The Supreme Court in Glossip affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of relief for two reasons. First, it held that the plaintiffs had not identified a \u201cknown and available alternative method of execution that entails a lesser risk of pain, a requirement of all Eighth Amendment method-of-\u00e9xecution claims.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Second, it determined that .the district court did not clearly err in finding that the prisoners failed to establish that Oklahoma\u2019s use of a large dose of midazolam in its execution protocol entailed \u201ca substantial risk of severe pain.\u201d Id We follow the Supreme Court\u2019s lead and address the requirements of the iBaze/Glossip test in that order: (1) proof of known and available alternatives; (2) proof that 500 mg of midazolam will cause a substantial risk of severe pain and that known and available alternatives will \u201csignificantly reduce\u201d that substantial risk of severe pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-11\">Here, the district' court\u2019s factual finding that pentobarbital was not available- to the ADOC for use in- executions was not clearly erroneous. On the contrary, substantial record evidence supports that finding, including (1) Arthur\u2019s own concession that, the ADOC\u2019s supply of commercially manufactured pentobarbital expired in November. 2013; (2) Dr. Zentner\u2019s inability to point to any source willing to compound pentobarbital for the ADOC; and (3) ADOC lawyer Hill\u2019s testimony that, despite contacting 29 potential sources for. compounded pentobarbital (including the departments of corrections of four states and all of the compounding pharmacies on Dr. Zentner\u2019s list), she was unable to procure any compounded pento-barbital for the .AD.OC\u2019s use in. executions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">Arthur would have us hold that if a drug is capable of being made and/or in use by other entities, then it is \u201cavailable\u201d to the ADOC; Arthur \u25a0 stresses that: (1) pharmacies throughout Alabama are theoretically capable of compounding the drug; (2) the active ingredient for compounded pento-barbital (pentobarbital sodium) is generally available for sale in the United States; and (3) four other states were able to procure and use compounded pentobarbital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>to- carry out executions in 2015.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">W\u00e9 expressly hpld that the fact that other states in the past have procured a compounded drug and pharmacies in Alabama have the skills to compound the drug does not make it available to the ADOC for use in lethal injections in executions. The evidentiary burden on Arthur is to show that \u201cthere is now a source for pento-barbital that would sell it to the ADOC for use in executions.\u201d Brooks, 810 F.3d at 820 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">To adopt Arthur\u2019s definition of \u201cfeasible\u201d and \u201creadily implemented\u201d would cut the Supreme Court\u2019s directives in Baze and Glossip off at the knees. As this Court explained in Brooks, a petitioner must show that \u201cthere is now a source for pento-barbital that would sell it to the ADOC for use in executions.\u201d 810 F.3d at 820 (emphases added). This Arthur patently did not do. Arthur\u2019s own expert witness, Dr. Zentner, could not even identify any pharmacies that had actually compounded an injectable solution of compounded pento-barbital for executions or were willing to do so for the ADOC. And when ADOC attorney\u2019Hill actually asked the pharmacies identified by Dr. Zentner if they would be willing to compound pentobarbi-tal for the ADOC, they all refused. What\u2019s more, Hill contacted no less than 29 potential sources for compounded pentobarbi-tal\u2014including numerous pharmacies and four states\u2019 departments of corrections. All of these efforts were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">And while four states had recently used compounded pentobarbital in then-own execution procedures, the evidence demonstrated that none were willing to give the drug to the ADOC or name then-source. As we have explained, \u201cthe fact that the drug was available in those states at some point ... does not, without more, make it likely that it is available to Alabama now.\u201d Brooks, 810 F.3d at 819. On this evidence, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Arthur failed to carry his burden to show compounded pentobarbital is a known and available alternative to the ADOC. An alternative drug that its manufacturer or compounding pharmacies refuse to supply for lethal injection \u201cis no drug at all for Baze purposes.\u201d Chavez v. Florida SP Warden, 742 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir. 2014) (Carnes, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">Arthur also argues that the ADOC did not make a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d to obtain pentobarbital. Glossip did not impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>such a requirement on the ADOC. In Glos-sip, the Supreme Court upheld the district court\u2019s factual finding that the proposed alternative drugs were not \u201cavailable.\u201d See Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2738. It continued, \u201c[o]n the contrary, the record shows that Oklahoma has been unable to procure those drugs despite a good-faith- effort to do so.\u201d Id, Nothing in Glossip changed the fact that it is not the state\u2019s burden to plead and prove \u201cthat it cannot acquire the drug.\u201d Brooks, 810 F.3d at 820.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The State need not make any showing-because it is Arthur\u2019s burden, not the State\u2019s, to plead and prove both a known and available alternative method of execution and that such alternative method, significantly reduces ' a substantial risk of severe pain. Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2737, 2739.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">As an alternative, independent reason for affirmance, we also conclude that even if Glossip somehow imposes a good-faith effort on the State, the ADOC made such an effort here by contacting 29 potential sources for the drug, including four other departments of correction and multiple compounding pharmacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">Under these record facts, we cannot fault at all the district court\u2019s finding that the procurement of compounded pentobar-bital was not \u201cfeasible and readily implemented as an execution drug in Alabama, nor [was] it readily available to the ADOC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">We also reject Arthur\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s ruling was a \u201cnullification\u201d of his Eighth Amendment rights. The district court even waited for Glossip to be decided and then followed Glossip\u2019s requirement that the inmate must show that the risk of severe pain from the chosen method is substantial \u201cwhen compared to the known and available alternatives.\u201d Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2737 (emphasis added). As we discussed above, Arthur did not show that his alternative was \u201cknown and available,\u201d much less (as discussed more later) that his suggested alternative \u201csignificantly reduce[d]\u201d a substantial risk of severe pain. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-10\">As for the alleged risk of severe pain in Alabama\u2019s current protocol, \u201cit is difficult to regard a practice as \u2018objectively intolerable\u2019 when it is in fact widely tolerated.\u201d Baze, 553 U.S. at 53, 128 S.Ct. at 1532. Both this Court and the Supreme Court have upheld the midazolam-based execution protocol that Arthur challenges here. Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2739-40 (noting that \u201cnumerous courts have concluded that the use of midazolam as the first drug in a three-drug protocol is likely to render an inmate insensate to pain that might result from' administration of the paralytic agent and potassium chloride.\u201d); Brooks, 810 F.3d at 818, 819 (concluding that petitioner Brooks had not established a substantial likelihood that Alabama\u2019s lethal injection protocol creates a \u201cdemonstrated risk of severe pain,\u201d and noting that this was \u201can especially difficult burden\u201d given the Supreme Court\u2019s approval of the exact same protocol in Glossip); Chavez, 742 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>1269 (affirming the dismissal of Eighth Amendment challenge to Florida\u2019s nearly identical lethal injection protocol that uses 500 mg of midazolam as the first drug).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Indeed, in Glossip, the Supreme Court emphasized that midazolam has been repeatedly and successfully used without problems as the first drug in the three-drug lethal injection protocol. 135 S.Ct. at 2734; 2740-46. The Supreme Court observed that, in October 2013, Florida became the first state to substitute midazo-lam for pentobarbital as part of a three-drug protocol. Id. at 2734. The Supreme Court stressed that, at the time that it decided Glossip in June 2015, Florida had conducted 11 executions using this lethal injection protocol (with midazolam as the first drug). Id. (citing Brief for State of Florida as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>2-3 and Chavez, 742 F.3d at 1269). The Glossip Court noted that 12 executions total (including the 11 from Florida and one from Oklahoma) had been conducted using this three-drug protocol \u201cwithout any significant problems.\u201d Id, at 2734, 2746. Since then, Florida has executed two additional inmates under that protocol. See Execution List: 1976\u2014pres-ent, Fla. Dep\u2019t of CoRR., http://www.de. state.fl.us/oth/deathrow/execlist.html (providing the list of executed Florida inmates); Execution by Lethal Injection Procedures, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr. (Jan. 9, 2015), http://www.de.state.fl.us/oth/deathrow/ lethal-injection-procedures-as-oL.01-09-15. pdf (describing Florida\u2019s current lethal injection protocol).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Arthur has failed to show not only that compounded pentobarbital is an available alternative to' the ADOC but also that ADOC\u2019s protocol creates a substantial risk of severe pain when compared to available alternatives. See Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2737.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">For all of these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination that the ADOC was entitled to judgment on Arthur\u2019s facial Eighth Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">XY. DISCOVERY CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\">Before leaving pentobarbital, we address one more claim Arthur raises about that drug. Arthur argues that the district court abused its discretion in limiting his discovery regarding primarily the ADOC\u2019s knowledge of and efforts to obtain compounded pentobarbital as an alternative method of execution. We review the district court\u2019s discovery decisions for abuse of discretion. Burger King Corp. v. Weaver, 169 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir. 1999); Sanderlin v. Seminole Tribe of Fla., 243 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir. 2001) (explaining that this Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to compel discovery for abuse of discretion). As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8P\">A district court has wide discretion in discovery matters and our review is \u201caccordingly deferential.\u201d A court abuses its discretion if it makes a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d or applies an incorrect legal standard. Moreover, a district court\u2019s denial of additional discovery must result in substantial harm to a party\u2019s case in order to establish an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-11\">Bradley v. King, 556 F.3d 1225, 1229 (11th Cir. 2009) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-12\">Here, the district court did not disallow all discovery about pentobarbital but did restrict the scope of some additional discovery. For example, the district court allowed additional discovery as to the \u201cavailability or unavailability of pentobar-bital or compounded pentobarbital\u201d to the ADOC, including a general description of the State\u2019s \u201cefforts to obtain pentobarbital, including whether the pentobarbital was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>obtained and, if not, the reasons why it could not be obtained.\u201d This information was precisely what Arthur needed to prove his Eighth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-4\">Accordingly, during ADOC lawyer Hill\u2019s November 2015 deposition .and again at the January 2016 trial, .Arthur questioned Hill about the ADOC\u2019s attempts to obtain compounded pentobarbital. According to Hill, although she repeatedly attempted to obtain compounded pentobarbital from various sources, including the 18 pharmacies identified by Arthur\u2019s expert witness, all of her attempts were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">Arthur complains that the district court did not require the ADOC to disclose the names of the drug suppliers who talked to the ADOC about pentobarbital during the ADOC\u2019s efforts to procure the drug for executions. Given the controversial nature of the death penalty, it is not surprising that parties who might supply these drugs are reluctant to have their names disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">Considering the district court\u2019s \u2022 broad discretion, we cannot say its decision about discovery resulted in \u201csubstantial harm\u201d to Arthur\u2019s case. See Bradley, 556 F.3d at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">On appeal, Arthur argues that \u201cif discovery revealed\u201d that ADOC did not pursue certain sources, or \u201cif discovery revealed\u201d that negotiations broke down over prices, it would impact his claim. He worries that, without access to this discovery, the ADOC \u201ccould have presented self-serving representations.\u201d All of this is pure speculation. Arthur never deposed or questioned even the prospective suppliers that his own expert identified about whether they would provide compounded pentobarbital to the ADOC. Arthur has given us no reason to think that the ADOC. lied or presented false evidence either during discovery or at trial and, indeed, the district court noted that the ADOC had claimed to produce everything of relevance. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying the discovery sought by Arthur.</p>\n<p id=\"AcTs\">XVI. AS-APPLIED EIGHTH ' AMENDMENT CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"AvL\">Because Arthur\u2019s facial Eighth Amendment claim so readily fails, Arthur turns his focus in this appeal to his \u201cas-applied\u201d Eighth Amendment claim. We explain why the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Arthur\u2019s \u201cas-applied\u201d claim.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-12\">The first hurdle for Arthur is that the pleading burden and standard of proof set forth in Baze and Glossip apply to both facial and as-applied Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claims. See Gissendaner v. Comm\u2019r, Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 803 F.3d 565, 569 (11th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Gissendaner v. Bryson, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 26, 192 L.Ed.2d 996 (2015) (\u201c[T]here is no logical reason why there should be a readily available alternative requirement in facial challenges to lethal injection protocols but hot to as-applied challenges to them.\u201d); see id. at 568-69 (holding that a Georgia death-row inmate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>had failed to adequately allege that there was a substantial risk to her personally because the state had improperly stored the particular drug to be used at her execution).</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">Thus, Arthur had the burden to present evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of disputed material fact as to whether midazolam creates a substantial risk of severe pain as applied to him uniquely \u201cwhen compared to the known and available alternatives\u201d for his execution as applied to him. Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2737; Gissendaner, 803 F.3d at 568-69. This he did not do. We address Arthur\u2019s proposed alternatives and then Arthur\u2019s allegation that midazolam will affect him differently and uniquely from other inmates by causing him to experience the pain of a heart attack a few minutes before being rendered unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">A. As-Applied Alternatives</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">As to the alternative-method requirement for his as-applied claim, Arthur has not established, as explained above, that a one-drug protocol consisting of compounded pentobarbital (or, for that matter, a one-drug protocol consisting of sodium thiopental) is a \u201cknown and available\u201d alternative to the ADOC at this time for .any inmate, much less as to Arthur on November 3, 2016. That leaves only his proposed alternative of material and extensive modifications to Alabama\u2019s current protocol, which Arthur suggests will reduce \u201cto some extent\u201d but not eliminate the risk of his having a heart attack.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">Arthur\u2019s proposed modified protocol has many components, starting with the administration of midazolam gradually. In his fourth declaration, Dr. Strader opined that administration of midazolam at a rate \u201ccloser to that used in clinical practice\u2014 <em>ie., </em>0.5 mg to 2 mg at a time, repeated every two to four minutes\u201d would reduce the risk of a precipitous drop in blood pressure. Dr. Strader\u2019s fourth declaration does not state how long these small dosages should be administered to the inmate, what the intended effect would be, how to gauge when that intended effect would be reached, at what point unconsciousness would be reached in gradual administration, or at what point the second and third drugs should be administered. Arthur concedes, as he must, that a gradual administration of midazolam has not previously ever been used in a lethal-injection execution, which alone suggests Arthur\u2019s difficulty in proving that a gradual administration is a significantly safer alternative. See Brooks, 810 F.3d at 821-22 (concluding that the petitioner had not met his burden of showing that a midazolam-only protocol was a \u201cfeasible, readily implementable, and significantly safer\u201d method of execution where such a protocol had never been used).</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-10\">Arthur\u2019s proposed modified protocol also includes extensive monitoring with multiple pieces of sophisticated medical equipment, the use of additional \u201cmedication\u201d and IV fluids, and the attendance of a \u201ctrained professional.\u201d Arthur\u2019s March 8, 2016, letter to the ADOC\u2019s attorneys requested that a \u201ctrained professional\u201d use an electroencephalogram, an electrocardiogram (\u201cEKG\u201d), and a bispectral index monitor \u201cand/or other appropriate meth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>ods\u201d to monitor Arthur throughout the execution. Arthur also requested the availability of \u201cother medication to prevent cardiac complications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-4\">Dr. Strader echoed that, \u201c[i]n the clinical setting, continuous EKG monitoring, continuous pulse oximetry monitoring ... and frequent blood pressure monitoring (every one to two minutes) are common.\u201d As to the additional medication and fluids, Dr. Strader stated that, \u201c[i]n clinical practice,\u201d if a patient is in danger of a heart attack, \u201cpressors\u201d or \u201cagents to increase blood pressure are typically given, such as intravenous phenylephrine (Neosynephrine) or intravenous dopamine.\u201d In addition, \u201cin clinical practice, the opioid fentanyl is often administered with midazolam, and the drug romazicon may be used to reverse midazolam\u2019s effects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">Again, Arthur\u2019s proposed modified protocol is light on specifics. Other than Dr. Strader\u2019s assertion that the \u201ctrained professional\u201d need not hold a medical degree, Arthur does not posit what training, or how much training, this professional must have, who this person might be or where the ADOC might find them to participate in an execution within a prison setting. Arthur does not explain how the addition of five separate monitoring machines and/or procedures would be incorporated into the ADOC\u2019s current protocol. Arthur does not state what sort of anomaly in that monitoring would require action by the trained professional, nor what those actions would include.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">While Dr. Strader stated that \u201cchanges in EKG monitoring\u201d indicating the onset of a heart attack could lead to the administration of pressors, he does not state what sort of \u201cchanges\u201d would require' this, the amount of pressors to be given, or in what order in relation to the rest of the lethal injection protocol they should be administered. Arthur does not suggest at what dosage the trained professional would administer the opioid fentanyl or the drug romazicon to the inmate or under what factual circumstances those drugs should be administered and for how long. Arthur also has presented no evidence that suppliers would provide these medicines, such as fentanyl; to- the ADOC for use in executions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">More importantly, though, is that Arthur admitted in a letter to the ADOC\u2019s counsel that his proposed modified protocol \u201cmay reduce to some extent the likelihood of Mr. Arthur suffering the pain of a heart attack during administration of the protocol, although it would not ameliorate those risks entirely.\u201d (emphases added). Glossip cautions us that prisoners cannot successfully challenge a method of execution \u201c\u2018merely by showing a slightly or marginally safer alternative.\u2019 \u201d 135 S.Ct. at 2737 (quoting Baze, 553 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 1531). But a \u201cmarginally safer\u201d alternative is, at best, all that Arthur has suggested. It is not enough to meet his burden under Glossip and Baze. See Baze, 553 U.S. at 56-57, 128 S.Ct. at 1534-35 (rejecting the petitioners\u2019 proposed alternative method of execution where there was no evidence demonstrating that it was an \u201cequally effective manner\u201d of death than the three-drug protocol used in Kentucky); Brooks, 810 F.3d at 821-22 (holding that, given the lack of available evidence regarding a midazolam-only lethal injection protocol, Brooks was unlikely to establish \u201cthat a heretofore untested lethal injection protocol ... is materially safer than a protocol that is identical to one approved by the Supreme Court [in Glos-sip.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">Alternatively, we agree with the district court that Arthur has not introduced any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>evidence of sufficient specifics to make his proposed modified protocol a viable and feasible alternative method of execution that the ADOC could \u201creadily implement\u201d for his execution on November 3, 2016. Arthur argues that he could not provide more specifics because doctors are prohibited from participating in lethal injections.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This seems contradicted by Dr. Strader\u2019s testimony, which outlines the broad components of Arthur\u2019s proposal, albeit without many of the specifics necessary to implement it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">In any event, we need not rely on ,the lack of,-specifics because Arthur has not shown-that, his proposed modified protocol will \u201csignificantly reduce\u201d any \u201csubstantial risk of severe pain\u201d or is constitutionally required<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2737. If anything, the vastly reduced levels of midazolam seem more complicated and designed to prolong the execution proceeding itself, which may create more, not less, risk of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that there was no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Arthur could meet his burden of. proof to show that his proposed material and extensive changes to the midazolam protocol would be a known and available alternative that would \u201csignificantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain.\u201d Without a proper showing on this alternative-method prong, Arthur\u2019s as-applied Eighth Amendment claim is without merit and this alone warranted the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgm\u00e9nt. However, because the district court went on to address the substantial-risk-of-severe-pain prong of ' the Baze/Glossip test, and Arthur\u2019s arguments on appeal focus on this portion of the district Court\u2019s order, we too will consider that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-9\">B. As-Applied Substantial Risk of Severe Pain</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-10\">To be clear, because, in his as-applied claim, Arthur has not carried his burden to show a known and available alternative,\" we need not reach his claim that the ADOC\u2019s use of 500 mg of midazo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>lam will cause him uniquely to suffer a heart attack a few minutes before full sedation. But we do so because it is so apparent that. Arthur\u2019s as-applied claim fails on that'separate prong too. Indeed, Arthur failed to present any admissible evidence that 500 mg of midazolam, as applied to him, will cause a heart attack before full, sedation. Dr. Strader is Arthur\u2019s only expert witness on this as-applied issue. And the district court excluded this time-gap part of his opinion testimony under Daubert.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to exclude expert testimony under Daubert for an abuse of discretion. Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 142-43, 118 S.Ct. 512, 517, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997). Under this standard, this Court defers to the district court\u2019s ruling unless it is manifestly erroneous. Quiet Tech. DC-8, Inc. v. Hurel-Dubois UK Ltd., 326 F.3d 1333, 1340 (11th Cir. 2003). This deferential standard is not relaxed even though a Daubert ruling may be outcome determinative. Kilpatrick v. Breg, Inc., 613 F.3d 1329, 1334-35 (11th Cir. 2010). In addition, the party offering the expert has the burden of proving the admissibility of the testimony by a preponderance of the evidence. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs the admission of expert testimony in federal court and provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-6\">A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-7\">(a) the expert\u2019s scientific, technical, or other specialized 'knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-8\">(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-9\">(c)the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-10\">\u2018 (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">Fed. R.

Second, the methodology used must be reliable as determined by a Daubert inquiry. Third, the testimony must assist the trier of fact through the application of expertise to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1309-14\">Kilpatrick, 613 F.3d at 1335.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-15\">Dr. Strader is a qualified cardiologist and competent t\u00f3 testify as such. But Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion testimony hinged on the existence of a measurable time gap between the hemodynamic and sedative effects of a 500-mg dose of midazolam on patients with CAD. The district court\u2019s Daubert exclusion was based on Dr. Strader\u2019s methodology being speculative and unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-16\">Dr.' Strader\u2019s opinion was based on at least five underlying ingredients in his methodology mix: (1) Arthur actually has, or is \u201chighly likely\u201d to have, a clinically significant case of CAD; (2) a 500-mg dose of midazolam will result in a precipitous and dangerous blood pressure drop in Arthur; (3) that blood pressure drop will in turn trigger a heart attack in Arthur; (4) the sedative effects of a 500-mg dose of midazolam will take longer than both this hemodynamic effect and the heart attack to occur; and (5) due to this time gap, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>Arthur is. \u201clikely\u201d to feel the pain of the heart attack for a few minutes before he is rendered fully unconscious. The district court, in effect, concluded that each of these steps in Dr. Strader\u2019s methodology were speculative and not reliable. Without even one of these steps, Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion folds like a house of cards. We explain why the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Dr. Strader\u2019s methodology was unreliable and in excluding his time-gap opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">First, we address Dr. Strader\u2019s medical opinion that Arthur \u201clikely\u201d has CAD. It is undisputed that (1) no doctor has ever actually, diagnosed Arthur with CAD; and (2) Dr. Strader himself has never examined Arthur, talked to Arthur\u2019s treating physicians, or done anything more than review the medical records given to him. Further, Arthur\u2019s medical records nowhere state that Arthur has ever had a heart attack, has ever been diagnosed with a heart attack, or has ever had a procedure performed to assess whether Arthur has any blockage in his arteries or at what level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">The most the medical records say is that Arthur had \u201cabnormal\u201d EKGs in 1999 and 2009, twice had atrial fibrillation (during his 2004 abdominal surgery and his 2009 EKG), and had a normal echocardiogram in 2004. There is no description of what was \u201cabnormal\u201d in the EKGs. Arthur did visit the prison clinic on two occasions complaining of being short of breath, dizzy, sweaty, and/or having chest pains. But these two visits (in 1999 and 2009) were ten years apart, and Arthur has never requested any medical treatment from a cardiologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">In fact, Dr. Strader relies primarily on Arthur\u2019s age, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and \u201csymptoms of recurrent chest pain\u201d as merely \u201crisk factors\u201d for coronary heart disease, as opposed to the missing diagnosis of coronary heart disease. The State argues that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to find Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion\u2014that it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that Arthur suffers from CAD\u2014\u201cborders on being speculative and unreliable.\u201d The State asserts that a \u201clikelihood\u201d is not evidence that Arthur actually suffers from an obstructive coronary heart condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">We need not resolve the CAD debate because the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding Dr. Strader\u2019s time-gap theory was speculative and not reliable. We will assume that Arthur likely has CAD and examine the next steps in Dr. Strader\u2019s methodology. Dr. Strader offered the opinion that \u201c[w]hen midazolam is administered in doses larger than those administered in clinical practice, including the 500 mg dose directed by the ADOC protocol, it is highly likely that\u201d the drag will cause a rapid drop in blood pressure and that this drop will in turn \u201cimmediate[ly]\u201d cause a heart attack in Arthur. Dr. Strader\u2019s basis for his opinion about what will happen upon administration of a 500-mg bolus dose of midazolam is based solely on his clinical experience with dosages of 2-5 mg of midazolam that he has used to sedate his own cardiac patients into a deep, but arousable, sleep for invasive cardiac procedures. Dr. Strader admitted that he had no experience with a 500-mg dose of midazolam, or any dose larger than 20 mg. See Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2742 (stating that \u201c[t]he effect of a small dose of midazo-lam has minimal probative value about the effect of a 500-milligram dose.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">In his deposition, Dr. Strader conceded that the medical literature that he relied upon did not address such large doses of midazolam nor did it expressly state that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>midazolam should not be used on patients with CAD. Indeed, Dr. Strader admitted that he uses midazolam \u201cin patients with coronary disease all the time in routine clinical practice.\u201d Dr. Strader testified that he has only observed about 24 patients (some his cardiac patients and some not) who were sedated with midazolam suffer a heart attack. If compared to the approximately 3,500 invasive cardiac procedures that Dr. Strader -has performed, that works out to less than <em>1% </em>of all his cardiac patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-4\">Nonetheless, we will assume that Arthur likely has CAD and 500 mg of midazolam will cause Arthur \u201clikely\u201d to have a drop in blood pressure and then suffer a heart attack. The most critical, but most speculative, part of Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion is his time-gap theory. According to Dr. Strader\u2019s best guess, a 500-mg dose of midazo-lam could cause sedation in three to five minutes, but the heart attack will occur \u201cimmediately\u2019 after the drop in blood pressure, which he testified happens in one to two minutes with small clinical doses of midazolam. Dr. Strader\u2019s time gap is imprecise and even, under one reading of his own testimony, it may take two minutes for the blood pressure to drop but the sedation may occur in three minutes, leaving one minute for the heart attack to start before sedation. The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding this time-gap part of Dr. Strader\u2019s testimony was speculative and unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">Here, Dr. Strader admitted he had used midazolam only for sedation, an entirely different goal than what the ADOC uses it for: anesthesia. And sedation, as Dr. Kaye testified, is different from anesthesia\u2014it is a fighter form of unconsciousness. Dr. Strader is not an anesthesiologist. While Dr. Strader testified that he was aware that midazolam was approved for use in \u201canesthesia,\u201d and he \u201cthinks some anesthesiologists use it for that purpose,\u201d Dr. Strader did not have \u201cany direct knowledge of what they do.\u201d The midazolam package insert corroborates this difference between sedation and anesthesia, noting that while \u201csedation\u201d may take 3-5 minutes, use of midazolam as an anesthetic induction agent can take as little as 2 minutes without narcotic premedication.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Even Dr. Strader acknowledges it can take up to two minutes for the blood pressure drop to occur, with the. heart attack beginning thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">Moreover, it is uncontroverted that mi-dazolam\u2019s sedative or anesthetic effect is dose-dependent, meaning that the effects of midazolam are stronger and occur more quickly with an increase in the dosage. Dr. Strader could not give an opinion about how long it would take a person to be rendered unconscious after being given a 500 mg dose of midazolam because that is \u201coutside [his] realm of practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-12\">As to his time gap estimate, Dr. Strader only extrapolated from his clinical practice of 2-5 mg of midazolam as to the onset of both the sedative and hemodynamic effects of 500 mg of midazolam. Arthur is correct that, in certain situations, opinions based on extrapolations from available data are permissible. Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2740, 2741 (explaining that \u201cbecause a 500-milli-gram dose is never administered for a therapeutic purpose, extrapolation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>reasonable.\u201d)- But merely because extrapolation may be reasonable in some circumstances, does not mean that all extrapolated opinions are reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">Simply put, Dr. Strader presented only speculative evidence regarding the first number in his attempt at a time-gap measurement. Indeed, when asked how long it would take to render a patient unconscious using a 500-mg dose of midazolam, he was never able to provide an answer, acknowledging that this was \u201coutside [his] realm of practice.\u201d The problem for Arthur is not that Dr. Strader engaged in extrapolation, it is that Dr. Strader did not have sufficient information to extrapolate from. In other words, while an opinion based on extrapolation is allowed, there must be some basis for that extrapolation. \u2018'While experts \u201ccommonly extrapolate from existing data ,.. nothing in either Daubert or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert.\u201d Joiner, 522 U.S. at 146, 118 S.Ct. at 519. Rather, the district court is allowed to \u201cconclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">When carefully analyzed, it is apparent that the methodology Dr. Strader used to reach his opinion regarding the time \u201cgap\u201d between the hemodynamic and sedative effects of midazolam was not reliable, nor was Dr. Strader qualified to testify competently as to these matters. See Kilpatrick, 613 F.3d at 1335. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Dr. Strader\u2019s ultimate opinion that Arthur was likely to suffer a heart attack upon administration of 500-mg of midazolam before being rendered unconscious was speculative, inadmissible under Daubert, and insufficient to meet Arthur\u2019s burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">Without Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion, Arthur had no evidence whatsoever to meet his burden of demonstrating that, as applied to him, Alabama\u2019s current lethal injection protocol was \u201csure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering, and give rise to sufficiently imminent dangers.\u201d Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2737 (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, there was no genuine dispute of material fact on this \u201cas-applied\u201d claim, and the district court properly granted summary judgment for the ADOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-7\">But even if Dr. Strader\u2019s opinion as to the time gap should have been admitted, it does not change the fact that Arthur has not met his burden to show a known and available alternative method of execution (for him with his health concerns) that \u201csignificantly reduce[s]\u201d a substantial risk of severe pain in Arthur. See id. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-8\">XVII. EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIM ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS ASSESSMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-9\">Arthur argues that the district court erroneously applied Eighth Amendment law from Baze and Glossip to his distinct Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection claim. Arthur claims that members of the ADOC\u2019s execution team (1) did not perform the consciousness assessment properly; and (2) were not medically or adequately trained on the consciousness assessment, which requires they pinch inmates with enough force to \u201cgauge anesthetic depth.\u201d Arthur contends that, if Alabama is to use a consciousness assessment as part of its execution protocol, the assessment should be performed adequately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-10\">At trial, the parties presented conflicting evidence as to whether the ADOC execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>tion team had adequately performed the consciousness assessment at past executions; The district \u25a0 court made a factual finding that the testimony from ADOC\u2019s witnesses were to be afforded more weight and, accordingly, it found that the assessment had been adequately performed \u201cin every instance\u201d based on ample evidence. The district court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-4\">Relying on language from Baze and Glossip, the district court also determined that the Eighth Amendment' does not require that \u201csophisticated\u201d medical training and standards be employed in a consciousness assessment during an execution; Summing up, the district court wrote that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-5\">Arthur\u2019s attempt to apply a medical standard of care to execution procedures and training for them, in this case, procedures that are not required. by the Eighth Amendment, does not state a plausible equal protection claim. This principle is applicable to Arthur\u2019s Equal Protection claim challenging the \u201cadequacy\u201d of the consciousness assessment and the training therefor, including the force used in the pinch test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">The district court did not err in rejecting the. training portion of Arthur\u2019s Equal Protection claim. Arthur\u2019s arguments ignore the district court\u2019s explicit factual finding-that \u201cthe consciousness assessment has been adequately performed in every instance in which it was required, [and] no deficiency in training, practice, or procedure is found,\u201d which led to the court\u2019s conclusion of law that the ADOC had not \u201cotherwise deviated substantially from its execution protocol.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"APt\">Moreover, we discern no error in the district court\u2019s application of Baze and Glossip to Arthur\u2019s Equal Protection claim. As we previously explained in our 2012 opinion, the crux of Arthur\u2019s Equal Protection claim was whether \u201cAlabama has substantially deviated from its execution protocol in a manner that significantly reduces inmate safeguards\u201d and whether this \u201creduction in safeguards burdens his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d Arthur, 674 F.3d at 1263. The district court\u2019s conclusions regarding whether Alabama had substantially deviated from its execution protocol thus -implicates Arthur\u2019s right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. As to this issue, the Equal Protection question necessarily intertwines with Eighth Amendment principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-9\">To satisfy Arthur, all ADOC execution team members must pinch inmates with approximately identical force and pinch as hard as they can because this is the standard used in a medical setting. But this is not what the Constitution requires. In Baze, the petitioners faulted \u25a0 Kentucky\u2019s protocol for lacking a system to monitor the prisoner\u2019s anesthetic depth. 553 U.S. at 58-59, 128 S.Ct. at 1536. Although Kentucky had other safeguards in place, including \u201cvisual inspection\u201d by the warden and deputy warden of whether, the inmate was unconscious, the petitioners requested that \u201cqualified personnel ... employ monitoring equipment, such as a Bispectrai Index (BIS) monitor, blood pressure cuff, or EKG to verify that a prisoner has achieved sufficient unconsciousness before injecting the final two drugs.\u201d Id. at 59, 128 S.Ct. at 1536. The petitioners claimed that visual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>inspection by the warden and deputy warden \u201cis an inadequate substitute for the more sophisticated procedures they envision.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court rejected the petitioners\u2019 argument, writing that \u201cthese supplementary procedures, drawn from a different context, are [not] necessary to avoid a substantial risk of suffering.\u201d Id. at 60, 128 S.Ct. at 1536.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">And in Glossip, the Supreme Court pointed to its conclusion in Baze that \u201calthough the medical standard of care might require the use of a blood pressure cuff and an [EKG] during surgeries, this does not mean those procedures are required for an execution to pass Eighth Amendment scrutiny.\u201d 135 S.Ct. at 2742. Thus, the Glossip Court concluded, \u201cthe fact that a low dose of midazolam is not the <em>best </em>drug for maintaining unconsciousness during surgery says little about whether a 500-milligram dose of midazolam is <em>constitutionally adequate </em>for purposes of conducting an execution.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">We leave for another day the question of whether an additional safeguard such as Alabama\u2019s consciousness assessment is constitutionally required under the Eighth Amendment. It is enough that the district court found that Alabama does conduct the consciousness assessment as part of its lethal injection protocol, and the Supreme Court has made clear that the safeguards implemented during an execution need not match a medical standard of care. See Baze, 553 U.S. at 58-60, 128 S.Ct. at 1536; Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2742. Thus, whether the execution team at Holman pinches inmates with the same level of force used during medical practice is not dispositive of this claim. In other words, because a medical-grade pinch is not required under the Constitution, there can be no Equal Protection claim that such a medical-grade pinch is not uniformly performed. Thus, the district court\u2019s rejection of Arthur\u2019s Equal Protection claim is due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">XVIII. FIRING SQUAD CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">Arthur argues that the district court improperly denied him leave to amend his Second Amended Complaint to plead the firing squad as an alternative method of execution. Arthur made this request in August 2015, four years after he filed this third \u00a7 1983 action back in 2011 and 13 years after Alabama adopted lethal injection as its method of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">The district court\u2019s operative order did not expressly state that its denial was based either on futility (as Arthur claims) or on prejudice and undue delay (as the State contends), although it listed all of these as reasons that it could deny leave to amend under the law. Instead, the district court concluded that \u201cexecution by firing squad is not permitted by [Alabama] statute and, therefore, is not a method of execution that could be considered either feasible or readily implemented by Alabama at this time.\u201d Even under a de novo standard of review,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend, but on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>multiple grounds, including futility, as Arthur never showed Alabama\u2019s current lethal injection protocol, per se or as applied to him, violates the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\">Again, under controlling Supreme Court precedent, Arthur had the burden to plead and prove both that (1) Alabama\u2019s current three-drug protocol is \u201csure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering, and give rise to sufficiently imminent dangers\u201d; and (2) there is an alternative method of execution that is feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduces the substantial risk of pain posed by the state\u2019s planned method of execution. Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2737 (quoting Baze, 553 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 1520) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). Arthur has not satisfied either prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">Because Arthur did not satisfy the first prong as to midazolam, that means his firing-squad claim fails in any event. Indeed, as outlined in great detail above, Arthur has not carried his heavy burden to show that Alabama\u2019s current three-drug protocol\u2014which is the same as the protocol in Glossip\u2014is \u201csure or very likely to cause\u201d Arthur serious illness, needless suffering, or a substantial risk of serious harm. See id. at 2737 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). The district court stayed Arthur\u2019s execution and then waited for Glossip to be decided. Both the Supreme Court and this Court have upheld the midazolam-based execution protocol that Arthur challenges here. See Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2739-40; Brooks, 810 F.3d at 818-19; Chavez, 742 F.3d at 1269, 1273. And even as applied to Arthur individually, Arthur did not present any admissible evidence or carry his burden to show that his execution under Alabama\u2019s lethal injection protocol would cause him to suffer a substantial risk of serious harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">As an alternative and independent ground, even if Arthur had proved midazo-lam may likely cause him harm, which he has not done, Arthur\u2019s proposed amendment failed to show that execution by firing squad is a feasible, readily implemented, and significantly safer alternative method of execution when compared to Alabama\u2019s planned lethal-injection method of execution that has been repeatedly approved by the courts and successfully carried out in the past. See Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2734, 2740-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">\u25a0 Alabama\u2019s execution statute is Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1. By way of review, that statute allows all persons sentenced to death to choose between two methods of execution, providing that death sentences \u201cshall be executed by lethal injection, unless the person sentenced to death affirmatively elects to be executed by electrocution.\u201d Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1(a) (emphasis added). Only if \u201celectrocution or lethal injection is held to be unconstitutional by the Alabama Supreme Court ;.. [or] the United. States Supreme Court ..., or if the United States Supreme Court declines to review any judgment holding a method of execution to be unconstitutional ... made by the Alabama Supreme Court or the United States Court of Appeals that has jurisdiction over Alabama\u201d can the ADOC carry out Arthur\u2019s execution by \u201cany constitutional method of execution.\u201d Id. \u00a7 15-18-82.1(c). And, finally, \u201c[i]n any case in which an execution method is declared unconstitutional, the death sentence shall remain in force until the sentence can be lawfully executed by any valid method of execution.\u201d Id. \u00a7 15-18-82.1(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">Arthur\u2019s main argument has three parts: (1) that under the Alabama statute, Alabama \u25a0 can execute him by \u201cany constitutional method \u2018ttf execution,\u201d (2) that a fir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>ing squad is, still today a constitutionally valid method of. execution, and (3) that Alabama cannot prevent him from electing to. have a firing squad as his preferred constitutional method. This claim misreads the text of the Alabama statute and Supreme Court case law and fails for multiple reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">First, it is undisputed that a firing squad is not a currently valid or lawful method of execution in Alabama. Therefore, an Alabama state trial court would be without any authority to order Arthur to be executed by firing squad, just as the ADOC would be without authority to execute Arthur by that method,.without the Alabama legislature fundamentally rewriting the state\u2019s method-of-execution statute or one of the courts named in the statute already striking down as unconstitutional either electrocution or lethal injection. But neither electrocution nor lethal injection has been declared unconstitutional by this Court, the Alabama Supreme Court, or the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">In this \u00a7 1983 suit, Arthur brings a narrow challenge to two aspects of Alabama\u2019s lethal injection protocol (midazolam and the consciousness assessment) and does hot argue or even suggest that lethal injection is per se unconstitutional\u2014in fact, the main premise of his attack on the midazo-lam protocol is that it is more painful than the prior Alabama protocol using pento-barbital. Also, Arthur does not challenge the constitutionality of death by electrocution, or allege any facts establishing that electrocution involves a substantial risk of .severe pain.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> No court has held that lethal injection (or electrocution) as applied to Arthur in this case violates the Constitution. Therefore, the ADOC would not be able to carry out Arthur\u2019s preferred death sentence without the Alabama legislature fundamentally rewriting its method-of-execution statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">Arthur argues, nevertheless, that Glos-sip. does not \u201crequire\u201d that alternative methods of execution be statutorily authorized. In his proposed allegations, Arthur points to the fact that another state, 'Utah, has conducted three executions by firing squad since 1976, the most recent taking place in 2010. Arthur implies that, since the Utah legislature has approved death by firing squad, the Alabama legislature could easily do the same. But Arthur misunderstands the state\u2019s obligation under the Eighth Amendment. States that continue to have capital punishment are free to choose any method of execution they deem appropriate, so long as they conform to the requirements of the United States Constitution, and more particularly, to the constraints found in the Eighth Amendment. This recognition\u2014that states are constrained by the United States Constitution\u2014is wholly consonant with the plain language of the Supremacy Clause. See U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2 (\u201c[The Constitution] shall be the, supreme Law of the Land .... Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d). Alabama has cho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>sen death by lethal injection or electrocution; the petitioner is not free to simply disregard those methods (and substitute his own) without satisfactorily establishing that those methods violate the constitutional command barring cruel and unusual punishment. To be clear, states remain subject to the Constitution, and the Constitution requires states to select a constitutional method of execution. But the state is not required to use Arthur\u2019s chosen method (the firing squad) unless Arthur shows the methods the state selected are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-4\">We do recognize that, in contrast to Alabama, Utah has a state statute that, while it prescribes lethal injection as the primary method of execution, allows the state to use a firing squad if (1) \u201ca court holds that a defendant- has a right to be executed by a firing squad,\u201d (2) \u201ca court holds that execution by lethal injection is unconstitutional on its face\u201d or \u201cas applied,\u201d or (3) \u201cthe sentencing court determines the state is unable to lawfully obtain the substance or substances necessary to conduct an execution by lethal intravenous injection.\u201d Utah Code Crim. Proc. \u00a7 77-18-5.5(l)-(4). Similarly, Oklahoma law provides for firing squad as the quaternary option for carrying out an execution, making it available only after execution by lethal injection, nitrogen hypoxia, and electrocution are ah declared unconstitutional. See Okla. Stat. tit. 22, \u00a7 1014 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-8\">Utah and Oklahoma are the only states that have statutes contemplating execution by firing squad, and lethal injection is still the primary method of execution in bpth of those states, as it is in every state that allows for capital punishment. Thus, to the extent that Arthur relies on dicta from Glossip<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>' concerning \u201cother acceptable, available methods,\u201d Oklahoma law expressly allowed both the firing squad and electrocution. Okla. Stat. tit. 22, \u00a7 1014 (2015).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> As we noted in Brooks, a prisoner must identify an alternative that is \u201cknown and available\u201d to the state in question to meet the requirements in Baze and Glossip. 810 F.3d at 820 (explaining that petitioners must show that \u201cthere is now a source for pentobarbital that would sell it to the ADOC for use in executions\u201d (emphases added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-9\">Arthur argues, nevertheless, that a state could \u201clegislatively exempt\u201d itself from Eighth Amendment review simply by adopting a narrow method of execution without any prescribed alternatives, thereby preventing challengers from identifying a statutorily authorized alternative method. But the Alabama legislature has au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>thorized two methods of execution\u2014lethal injection in any form and electrocution\u2014 and neither of its authorized methods has been deemed unconstitutional by a court, either per se or even as applied to Arthur. See Ala. Code. \u00a7 15-18-82.i(a), (c), (h). Arthur is not entitled to veto the Alabama legislature\u2019s constitutional choice as to how Alabama inmates will be executed because there may still be other statutorily authorized (and unchallenged) methods available. As for the dissent\u2019s argument that the state\u2019s legislative choices should not affect whether an alternative could be feasible and readily implemented, the dissent refuses to acknowledge that the Alabama statute is not simply the result of the state\u2019s \u201cwill,\u201d but it is also very much constrained by the United States Constitution. Absent a showing that Alabama\u2019s chosen methods of execution present an unconstitutional risk of severe pain, Alabama is under no obligation to deviate from its widely accepted, presumptively constitutional methods in favor of Arthur\u2019s retrogressive alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has recognized that requiring a state to amend its method-of-execution statute or to. authorize a variance from that statute \u201cimpostes] significant costs on the State and the administration of its penal system.\u201d See Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 687, 644, 124 S.Ct. 2117, 2123, 158 L.Ed.2d 924 (2004). That is particularly true where, as here, the necessary legislation would retreat from a method of execution that is employed by the overwhelming majority of states that still authorize the death penalty and is widely considered the \u201cmost humane available,\u201d and would replace it with a method of execution that has long been abandoned by almost every state in this country.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> See Baze, 553 U.S. at 62, 128 S.Ct. at 1537. As the Supreme Court has recognized, \u201c[t]he firing squad, hanging, the electric chair, and the gas chamber have each in turn given way to more humane methods [of execution], culminating in today\u2019s consensus on lethal injection.\u201d Id. at 62, 128 S.Ct. at 1538; see also id. at 42, 128 S.Ct. at 1526-27 (\u201cA total of 36 States have now adopted lethal injection as the exclusive or primary means of implementing the death penalty, making it by far the most prevalent method of execution in the United States.\u201d). The dissent\u2019s suggestion that our decision nullifies Arthur\u2019s right to a \u201chumane execution\u201d by preventing his access to execution by firing squad is peculiar, and, moreover, flatly contradicted by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-7\">In considering whether Arthur\u2019s proposed alternative is \u201cfeasible\u201d and \u201creadily implemented,\u201d it is also important to note that the firing squad is a vastly different method of execution from electrocution and lethal injection, which are the only methods of execution that Alabama has employed in the past ninety years. As far as we can tell, Alabama has never carried out an execution by firing squad or statutorily recognized it as a method for carrying out executions. Indeed, Arthur does not say that any ADOC employee would have the first idea, about how to carry out an execution by this method, and, undeniably, doing so would require a lot more than merely buying some new supplies for the ADOC to begin carrying out executions by this new method. The firing squad has not been used even in Utah since 2010. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>This sits in stark contrast to the numerous executions by lethal injection that were carried out across the country during the past decade or so. The fact that a few other states could theoretically carry out an execution by firing squad without violating their own laws tells us nothing about whether that method .is, in fact, readily implementable for use in actual executions in Alabama today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-4\">As we see it, our dissenting colleague errs in claiming that our opinion contravenes Baze and Glossip. Our dissenting colleague writes that, under our analysis, \u201cif a state legislatively rejects an alternative, the alternative is not feasible and readily implemented. ... State opposition .,. has no bearing on the \u2018feasible and readily implemented\u2019 inquiry as set forth in Baze and Glossip.\u201d This is not at all what we have said. What we say is (1) Alabama has chosen two constitutional methods of execution, (2) Arthur has not shown that they are, or that either one is, unconstitutional (per se or as applied to him), and (3) Arthur is not entitled to veto the Alabama legislature\u2019s choice of two constitutional methods of execution. Furthermore, by requiring Arthur to'show a feasible, readily implementable, and significantly safer alternative, we are abiding by the rules set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s Baze and Glossip opinions, and also giving credence to Alabama\u2019s prerogative to choose any constitutional method of execution it deems appropriate. It is true that neither Baze nor Glossip held that an execution alternative must be statutorily authorized as that, of course, was not the issue. But those opinions did not direct that we ignore constitutional state laws in employing constitutional methods of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">We are also unpersuaded by the concerns forwarded by Arthur and the dissent that giving this deference to states will effectively cut off inmates\u2019 ability to advocate for more humane alternative methods of execution, as contemplated by Baze and Glossip. We see no merit to the dissent\u2019s hypothesis that a state could, for example, offer the gas chamber as its method of execution. It seems clear that if a state\u2019s sole method of execution is deemed unconstitutional, while other methods remain constitutional (even if they are not authorized by the state statute), our inquiry into whether those other options are feasible and readily implemented would be a different one. Among other things, Alabama\u2019s statute plainly allows for other options if its statutory methods are declared unconstitutional, making those other options more feasible and readily implementable. But that is not the case here. Alabama\u2019s two methods of execution have not been declared unconstitutional, nor has Arthur even argued that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-7\">Furthermore, our dissenting colleague is concerned that our opinion will foreclose all but lethal-injection-alternative challenges \u2022 and that inmates can never win such suits due to the secrecy surrounding executions and states\u2019 admitted challenges in locating sources for the drugs. These practical constraints do not rob the State of Alabama, or any other state, of its right to choose the method of execution it wishes to use, so long as the state complies with the requirements of the United States Constitution. These constraints should also be weighed against the practical problems of instituting an untested (in Alabama) protocol for execution by firing squad. While Arthur points to Utah as an exemplar, the reality is that formulating a new protocol and locating the people and resources necessary to carry out such an alternative (even if feasible, readily implementable, and significantly safer), would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>take considerable time and would, inevitably, lead to an entire new round of legal challenges regarding the details of the protocols for constitutionally conducting an execution by firing squad. Arthur\u2019s own nine-year history of \u00a7 1983 litigation well proves that point.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">Arthur\u2019s strategy here to avoid execution is to claim that the ADOC should employ a profoundly different method of execution that is not legal in Alabama and has long been abandoned by states seeking to employ the \u201cmost humane\u201d method of execution available, lethal injection. See Baze, 553 U.S. at 62, 128 S.Ct. \u00e1t 1537. Arthur\u2019s strategic choice left him with a steep hill to climb, requiring him to show that this method of execution that is beyond the ADOC\u2019s statutory authority somehow could be feasible and readily implemented by the ADOC. He failed to surmount that obstacle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">For these reasons, the firing squad is not an alternative method of execution that is available, feasible, or readily implemented by the ADOC and, thus, the district court did not err in disallowing this third amendment to Arthur\u2019s complaint. And furthermore, absent a showing that the methods chosen by the Alabama legislature pose an unconstitutional risk of pain, either per se or as applied to Arthur, the Constitution does not compel Alabama to search for a new method. Accordingly, we find that amending Arthur\u2019s Second Amended Complaint to add the firing squad as an alternative method of execution would have been futile, and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1320-9\">XIX. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-10\">The district court did not err in entering final judgment in favor of the ADOC and against Arthur on all claims. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-11\">Given that this Court has determined Arthur\u2019s appeal lacks merit, the Court denies Arthur\u2019s motion to stay his November 3, 2016 execution for failure to show a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>likelihood of success on the merits of his claims. \u201cIt is by now hornbook- law that a court may grant a stay of execution only if the moving party establishes that: (1) he has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) he will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues; (3) the stay would not substantially harm the other litigant; and (4) if issued, the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.\u201d Brooks, 810 F.3d at 818 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Dunn, Case No. 2:12-cv-316 (M.D. Ala.), a consolidated action known as the \"Midazolam Litigation.\u201d This Court has explained that, this \"group of cases began as one lawsuit [filed in April 2012] when an Alabama death row inmate sued pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 to challenge the constitutionality of Alabama's lethal injection protocol.... [The lawsuit] evolved along with the state's new protocol, and now is known as the 'Midazolam Litigation.\u2019 Since 2012, cases brought by four other Alabama death row inmates have been consolidated into the Mi-dazolam Litigation.\u201d Brooks, 810 F.3d at 817. Petitioner Brooks himself also\u2019 successfully intervened, in the Midazolam Litigation. Id Five additional inmates joined the suit after this court decided Brooks. Brooks was executed on January 21, 2016. A search of the ADOC prison records reveals that all 10 remaining plaintiffs are currently on Holman's death row, although the State has set a December 8, 2016 execution date for one of the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1296-14\">. In his Third Amended Complaint, Arthur alleged that, because of his age and an \u201canxiety disorder,\u201d there is a high likelihood that he will suffer a \"paradoxical reaction\u201d to midazolam. Arthur offered absolutely no proof on this subject, and the district court rightly considered it abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">. Arthur had filed a declaration from Dr. Kaye who opined that midazolam would not work during the execution, whether as a large or small dose, Even in a 500-mg dose, Dr. Kaye\u2019s opinion is that midazolam is \u201cincapable of holding an inmate in an unconscious state through the administration of the second and third lethal injection drugs.\u201d Dr. Kaye admitted that midazolam is useful to induce unconsciousness and that he had used it for this purpose \u2018,'many, many times,\u201d but that it is not effective to keep a patient unconscious. Dr. Kaye opined that this is because of mi-dazolam\u2019s \u201cceiling effect,\u201d such that it stops being effective above a certain dose. - \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">. Although it is not entirely clear, it appears that the petitioner in Brooks was arguing that compounded (not commercially manufactured) pentobarbital was a known and available alternative method of execution. See Brooks, 810 F.3d at 819 &amp; n.2. Arthur's allegation that Alabama\u2019s supply of commercially manufactured pentobarbital expired on or around November 2013 also supports this presumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1300-13\">.

In this appeal, Arthur has not resurrected his claim regarding a one-drug protocol of sodium thiopental as a feasible alternative method of execution.

Arthur\u2019s claim is'only about \"compounded pentobarbital,\u201d and he makes no claim that the ADOC has access to commercially manufactured pentobarbital. Nor could he. In Glos-sip, the Supreme Court observed that Oklahoma in December 2010 became the first state to execute an inmate using pentobarbi-tal, and states \"gradually shifted to pentobar-bital as their supplies of sodium thiopental ran out.\u201d 135 S.Ct at 2733. Pentobarbital was used in all 43 executions carried out in 2012. Id. As the Supreme Court noted, \"[b]efore long, however, pentobarbital also became unavailable\u201d because \"[a]nti-death-penalty advocates lobbied the Danish manufacturer of the drug to stop selling it for use in executions.\u201d Id, \"That manufacturer opposed the death penalty and took steps to block the shipment of pentobarbital for use in executions in the United States.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court added, \"Oklahoma eventually became unable to acquire the drug through any means.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-11\">As Arthur points out in his reply brief, more than a dozen inmates (to date, seven in Texas, seven in Georgia, and one in Missouri) have been executed in 2016 using a single-drug pentobarbital protocol. See Execution List 2016, Death Penalty Information Center, http:// www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/execution-list-2016. Given Glossip, these states presumably used compounded pentobarbital in these executions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">. In support of his argument, Arthur points us to language from Baze that a state\u2019s refusal to change its method of execution \"in- the face of these documented advantages, [and] without a legitimate penological justification for adhering to its current method of execution\u201d can violate the Eighth Amendment. Baze, 553 U.S. at 52, 128 S.Ct. at 1532.

Arthur failed to specifically plead, or request, a modification of the midazolam protocol in his Second or Third Amended Complaints. The district court would have been well within its discretion to dismiss any such putative claim.

Ironically, Dr. Kaye, Arthur's other expert, opined that midazolam was \"fundamentally] unsuitable] ... as the first drug in the ADOC protocol\u201d because it was \"incapable\u201d of maintaining unconsciousness through administration of, the second and third drug. The district court found that this evidence was \"wholly inconsistent\u201d with Arthur\u2019s latest position that gradual administration of small doses of midazolam could be a feasible, readily available, and safer alternative. For this reason, the district court found that \"Arthur cannot credibly propose the use of midazolam in any argument for a remedy [he., an alternative method], based upon his own evidence.\u201d The district court did not see how Arthur can argue that midazolam in small doses can be used to painlessly render him unconscious and, in the same breath, say that the drug ought not to be used at all in any dose because it will not render him insensate during the administration of the second and third drugs. See Brooks, 810 F.3d at 822 (noting\" a similar \"fundamental tension\u201d in the petitioner's argument that a midazolam-only protocol was a known and available alternative).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-11\">As an independent and alternative ground, this testimony by Arthur's own expert witness also demonstrates that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Arthur did not meet his burden to show a known, available, and substantially safer alternative, as he was required to do in his as-applied claim. Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2737; Gissendaner, 803 F.3d at 568-69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">. We recognize that Dr. Buffington stated in his rebuttal declaration that a rapid infusion of midazolam could result in induction of anesthesia in as little as 30 seconds.

To the extent that Arthur argues that the ADOC employees disagreed on how the results of \u00e1 consciousness check should have been communicated to the warden, the point is immaterial because the ADOC-employee witnesses testified that an inmate never gave a reaction after the consciousness assessment was performed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">. The parties dispute whether we should review Arthur\u2019s firing-squad claim de novo or merely for an abuse of discretion. We generally review the denial of a motion for leave to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion. McKinley v. Kaplan, 177 F.3d 1253, 1255 (11th Cir. 1999). But a district court's decision to deny leave to amend based on futility is a legal conclusion, and we review such decisions de novo. Mizzaro v. Home Depot, Inc., 544 F.3d 1230, 1236 (11th Cir. 2008). We need not resolve this standard-of-review issue because Arthur\u2019s firing-squad arguments on appeal lack merit under even de novo review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">. The dissent admits that Arthur did not opt for death by electrocution because he did not opt for it under the statute during the allotted time frame. See Ala. Code \u00a7 15\u2014IS\u201482.1(b) (\"The election for death by electrocution is waived unless it is personally made by the person in writing and delivered to the warden of the correctional facility within 30 days after the certificate of judgment pursuant to a decision by the Alabama Supreme Court affirming the sentence of death_\u201d). But neither has Arthur claimed that execution by electrocution is unconstitutional, nor that the 30-day limit makes it unconstitutional. Thus, for purposes of the constitutional inquiry Arthur has raised, we cannot say that electrocution would not be a \"feasible and readily implemented\u201d alternative to lethal injection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">. While the dissent claims that the firing squad is a \u201cvalid\u201d alternative, the Supreme Court majority in Glossip did not opine about whether a firing squad remains a constitutional alternative to lethal injection, as that was not the issue before the Court in Glossip. The Glossip majority noted only that, back in 1879, the Supreme Court upheld a sentence of death by-firing squad, citing Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130, 25 L.Ed. 345 (1879). Glossip, 135 S.Ct. at 2732. The principal dissent in Glossip \"goes out of its way to suggest that a State would violate the Eighth Amendment if it used one of the methods of execution employed before the advent of lethal injection.\u201d Id. at 2739. But, as the majority in Glossip pointed out, if States cannot use one of the \u201cmore primitive\u201d methods used in the past and also cannot use certain drugs to carry out an execution by lethal injection, \"the logical conclusion is clear. But we- have time and again reaffirmed that capital punishment is not per se unconstitutional,\u201d Id. Here, we need not reach any issue about the constitutionality of a firing squad.'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1317-11\">.

This wide adoption of lethal injection also serves to undermine Arthur\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s holding \"will result in state-by-state variation in federal constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">. The dissent isolates Arthur\u2019s firing-squad claim (first made in 2015) from the rest of his \u00a7 1983 case and complains that Arthur has not had any chance for discovery or a trial on that claim. But this argument wholly ignores that Arthur\u2019s complaint challenging Alabama's three-drug lethal injection protocol was filed in 2011, and Alabama changed the first drug to midazolam back in 2014. Thus, Arthur has had literally years of discovery and even a 2016 evidentiary hearing to demonstrate that the midazolam drug protocol is, either per se or as applied, unconstitutional. But Arthur has never sustained his heavy burden. Arthur\u2019s firing-squad claim fails under both prongs of Glossip.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b1320-7\">. As an alternative and independent ground, we also conclude Arthur\u2019s firing-squad claim is barred by laches. See Williams v. Allen, 496 F.3d 1210 (11th Cir. 2007) (upholding dismissal of \u00a7 1983 method-of-execution action based on unreasonable delay); Jones v. Allen, 485 F.3d 635 (11th Cir. 2007) (denying a stay). The Supreme Court made clear in 2008\u2014three years before Arthur filed this \u00a7 1983 case in 2011\u2014that a petitioner-inmate had the burden to show that a proffered alternative was \u201cfeasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduce[d] a substantial risk of severe pain,\u201d such that the state\u2019s failure to adopt that alternative constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Baze, 553 U.S. at 41, 52, 128 S.Ct. at 1526, 1532. Despite this language, Arthur nevertheless waited until August 2015 before seeking to add this firing-squad alternative method to his \u00a7 1983 complaint. Such dilatory filing \u201cleaves little doubt that the real purpose behind his claim- is to seek a delay of his execution, not merely to effect an alteration of the manner in which it is carried out.\u201d Jones, 485 F.3d at 640. In light of this delay, there was no error in the district court's denying Arthur leave to amend to add his firing-squad claim in August 2015.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">.

The firing squad is a potentially viable alternative, and Arthur may be entitled to relief under <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip </em>based on that method of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">Arthur requested to amend his complaint shortly after the Supreme Court confirmed in <em>Glossip </em>that prisoners must plead and prove an execution alternative to obtain method-of-execution relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court denied Arthur\u2019s request on futility grounds, finding that the \u201cfiring squad is not permitted by [an Alabama] statute and, therefore, is not a method of execution that could be considered either feasible or readily implemented by Alabama at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">The Majority now affirms that finding. The Majority determines that the firing squad is not feasible and readily implemented because \u00a7 15-18-82.1 of the Alabama Code does not authorize the firing squad. Thus, according to the Majority, a state can restrict a prisoner\u2019s access to Eighth Amendment relief by legislatively rejecting a viable execution alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"A7-O\">The Majority\u2019s analysis of Arthur\u2019s request to amend his complaint is legally flawed and has unacceptable consequences for death row prisoners throughout this circuit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, the Majority misreads \u00a7 15-18-82.1; that statute is not a barrier to Arthur relying on the firing squad. The plain language of \u00a7 15-18-82.1 permits Alabama to turn to the firing squad under the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-10\">Section 15-18-82.1 states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-11\">(c) If electrocution or lethal injection is held to be unconstitutional by ... the United States Supreme Court under the United States Constitution, or if the United States Supreme Court declines to review any judgment holding a method of execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>to be unconstitutional under the United States Constitution made by ... the United States Court of Appeals that has jurisdiction over Alabama, all persons sentenced to death for a capital crime shall be executed by any constitutional method of execution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAt3X\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-4\">(h) No sentence of death shall be reduced as a result of a determination that a method of execution is declared unconstitutional under the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, or the Constitution of the United States. In any case in which an execution method is declared unconstitutional, the death sentence shall remain in force until the sentence can be lawfully executed by any valid method of execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1 (2002). The Majority concludes that Alabama cannot deviate from a prisoner\u2019s designated method of execution unless electrocution or lethal injection is declared per se unconstitutional.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because no court has declared electrocution or lethal injection per se unconstitutional, the Majority holds that \u00a7 15-18-82.1 forbids the firing squad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">This interpretation of \u00a7 15-18-82.1 does not pass muster. Subsection (h) allows Alabama to turn to the firing squad\u2014a \u201cvalid method of execution\u201d\u2014in \u201ccase[s]\u201d where our court declares Alabama\u2019s planned \u201cexecution method\u201d for a prisoner unconstitutional. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-18-82.1(h). Alabama\u2019s planned \u201cexecution method\u201d for Arthur is Alabama\u2019s three-drug lethal injection protocol, and Arthur claims that the protocol is unconstitutional. <em>See id. </em>If our court agreed with him, then subsection (h) would allow Alabama to utilize the firing squad to enforce Arthur\u2019s death sentence. Because this case could implicate subsection (h) and open the door to the firing squad, \u00a7 15-18-82.1 is not a barrier to Arthur relying on the firing squad. Arthur\u2019s firing-squad claim thus conflicts only with the Majority\u2019s flawed interpretation of Alabama law, not Alabama law itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-9\">Second, even if \u00a7 15-18-82.1 did not permit the firing squad here, the Majority\u2019s conclusion that the statute precludes Arthur from relying on the firing squad would <em>still </em>be erroneous. The Majority contravenes <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip, </em>as well as the Supremacy Clause, in relying on a state statute to limit Arthur\u2019s access to Eighth Amendment relief. Under <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip, </em>a state cannot make an execution alternative not feasible and readily implemented by legislatively rejecting the alternative. A state\u2019s rejection of an execution alternative is irrelevant to the \u201cfeasible and readily implemented\u201d inquiry. Moreover, in holding that a state can dictate that inquiry and foreclose an execution alternative, the Majority infringes the Supremacy Clause. The Majority\u2019s holding affords states the power to thwart viable method-'of-execution claims. That is unprecedented. States cannot render an execution alternative not feasible and readily implemented\u2014and thereby insulate themselves from constitutional scrutiny\u2014by opposing the alternative through legislation or any other means. The Supremacy Clause precludes that type of state incursion on the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-10\">Finally, the practical consequences of the Majority\u2019s mistakes are deeply trou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>bling. The Majority\u2019s decision nullifies countless prisoners\u2019 right to a humane execution. Based on the Majority\u2019s approach to \u00a7 15-18-82.1, Alabama prisoners such as Arthur must rely on lethal-injection-based execution alternatives<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to obtain method-of-execution relief. A myriad of Florida prisoners are likewise limited to lethal-injection-based alternatives because Florida has a statute that is identical to \u00a7 15-18-82.1, <em>compare </em>Ala. Code \u00a7 15\u201418\u2014 <em>82.1,.with </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 922.105 (2005). However, due to the scarcity of and secrecy surrounding lethal injection drugs, identifying an available lethal-injection-based alternative is a Sisyphean task. Consequently, relief under <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip </em>is now a mirage for prisoners across Alabama and Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">II. THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF \u00a7 15-18-82.1 PERMITS THE FIRING SQUAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">Arthur\u2019s request to die by the firing squad is not at odds with Alabama law. The plain language of \u00a7 15-18-82.1 permits Alabama to turn to the firing squad under the circumstances presented here. The Majority erroneously concludes that the statute bars Alabama from using the firing squad to execute Arthur. The Majority\u2019s misreading of the statute not only creates a faux conflict with Arthur\u2019s firing-squad claim but also impairs Alabama\u2019s ability to enforce the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">Section 15-18-82.1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1324-7\">(a)A death sentence shall be executed by lethal injection, unless the person sentenced to death affirmatively elects to be executed by electrocution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1324-9\">(b) A person -convicted and sentenced to death for a capital crime at any time shall have one opportunity to elect that, his or her death sentence be executed by electrocution. The election for death by electrocution is waived unless it is personally made by the person in writing and delivered to the warden of the correctional facility within 30 days after the certificate of judgment pursuant to a decision by the Alabama Supreme Court affirming the sentence of death or, if a certificate of judgment is issued before July 1, 2002, the election must be made and delivered to the warden within 30 days after July 1, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1324-11\">(c) If electrocution or lethal injection is held to be unconstitutional by the Alabama Supreme Court under the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, or held to be unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court under the United States Constitution, or if the United States Supreme Court declines to review any judgment holding a method of execution to be unconstitutional under the United States Constitution made by-.the Alabama Supreme Court or the United States Court of Appeals that has jurisdiction over Alabama, all persons sentenced to death for a capital crime shall be executed by any constitutional method of execution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAf1\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1324-12\">(f) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a person authorized by state law to prescribe medication and designated by the Department of Cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>rections may prescribe the drug or drugs necessary to compound a lethal injection. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a person authorized by state law to prepare, compound, or dispense medication and designated by the Department of Corrections may prepare, compound, or dispense a lethal injection. ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pABA\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-4\">(h) No sentence of death shall be reduced as a result of a determination that a method of execution is declared unconstitutional under the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, or the Constitution of the United States. In any case in which an execution method is declared unconstitutional, the death sentence shall remain in force until the sentence can be lawfully executed by any valid method of execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1. Alabama enacted this section in 2002 when it first changed its default method of execution from electrocution to lethal injection. In doing so, Alabama.shrewdly expected challenges to the constitutionality -of lethal injection and its administration of lethal injection. Section 15-18-82.1 not only prescribes lethal injection- as the default method of execution but also establishes contingency plans in the event that: (1) lethal injection is declared per se unconstitutional or (2) Alabama\u2019s lethal injection-protocol is declared unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-6\">Subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 15-18-82.1 designate lethal injection as Alabama\u2019s primary method of execution, while affording prisoners a one-time opportunity to choose electrocution as their designated method in lieu of lethal injection. And subsections (c) and (h) afford Alabama the flexibility to deviate from a prisoner\u2019s designated method of execution and specific execution protocol if either is declared unconstitutional. Those subsections serve as complementary safety valves, ensuring that Alabama can fulfill its goal of carrying out executions. Subsection (c) guarantees Alabama flexibility by providing that Alabama can utilize \u201cany constitutional method of execution\u201d if lethal injection or electrocution is struck down as per se unconstitutional. \u00a7 15-18-82.1(c). Subsection (h) complements subsection (c), as it protects Alabama\u2019s ability to carry out an execution when a prisoner successfully attacks the specific lethal-injection or electrocution protocol that Alabama plans to use to kill him. That subsection states that Alabama can turn to \u201cany valid method of execution\u201d in \u201cany case\u201d in which its planned \u201cexecution method is declared unconstitutional.\u201d \u00a7 15-18-82.1(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-8\">Arthur\u2019s designated method of execution is lethal injection, as he did not opt for electrocution during the time period allotted in subsection (b). <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-18-82.1(a), (b). Pursuant to subsection (f), the Alabama Department of Corrections has elected to carry out Arthur\u2019s lethal injection using a three-drug, midazolam-based \u2019protocol. Arthur asserts that' this planned \u201cexecution method\u201d violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-18-82.1(h). If our court agreed with Arthur, then Alabama would be able to resort to \u201cany valid method of execution,\u201d including the firing squad, to fulfill its goal of executing Arthur. <em>See id.; Glossip, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2732 (noting that the firing squad is a presumably valid, constitutional method of execution). As such, through this litigation, \u00a7 15-18-82.1(h)\u2019s safety valve could be implicated, thereby opening the door to the firing squad. The firing squad is a plausible execution alternative in Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-9\">However, the Majority departs from the plain language of \u00a7 15-18-82.1 and con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>eludes, that the-statute bars the firing squad here.-The Majority makes a threshold error by determining that Alabama currently authorizes both electrocution and lethal injection as methods of execution for Arthur. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 1316-17 (\u201cAlabama has chosen death by lethal' injection or electrocution.\u201d). Based on that finding, the Majority suggests that Arthur cannot rely on the firing squad because he has not challenged both lethal injection and electrocution. But the text of subsections (a) and (b) belie the Majority\u2019s conclusion that Alabama has \u201cchosen\u201d both lethal injection and electrocution for Arthur. Because Arthur did not opt for electrocution, he \u201cshall be executed by lethal injection.\u201d <em>See </em>Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1 (a), (b). Therefore at this time \u00a7 15-18-82.1 authorizes Alabama to kill Arthur only by lethal injection. Alabama has not \u201cchosen\u201d electrocution for Arthur merely because electrocution is mentioned in the statute as a contingency option. If that were the case, then \u201cany valid method of execution\u201d would also be \u201cchosen\u201d for Arthur. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15\u201418\u201482.1(h). Moreover, the Majority\u2019s suggestion that Arthur was required to attack electrocution <em>and </em>lethal injection to trigger \u00a7 15-18-82.1\u2019s safety valves is clearly inconsistent with the statute. Neither subsection (c) nor subsection (h) \u25a0 states that lethal injection <em>and </em>electrocution must be struck down to trigger its safety valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">The Majority also erroneously determines that under \u00a7 15-18-82.1 Alabama can turn to the firing squad <em>only </em>if lethal injection or electrocution is declared per se unconstitutional.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 1316 (suggesting that Alabama would have authority to use the firing squad if a court struck down \u201cas unconstitutional either electrocution or lethal injection\u201d). And since no court has declared either method per se unconstitutional, the Majority finds that \u00a7 15-18-82.1 precludes Alabama from using the firing squad in this case. A proper textual analysis reveals that subsection (h) forecloses this reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-7\">As noted above, subsection (h) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-8\">In any case in which an execution method is declared unconstitutional, the death sentence shall remain in force until the sentence can be lawfully executed by any valid method of execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-9\">Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1(h). At first glance, it is possible to read this sentence in a manner consistent with the Majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 15-18-82.1. That is, the sentence could be interpreted as permitting Alabama to turn to an alternative method of execution, such as the firing squad, only if lethal injection or electrocution is declared per se unconstitutional. But because, as the Majority concludes, subsection (c) stands for that exact proposition, interpreting subsection (h) to convey the same message violates an elementary rule of statutory interpretation\u2014that we must give effect to each provision. <em>See United States v. Butler, </em>297 U.S. 1, 65, 56 S.Ct. 312, 319, 80 L.Ed. 477 (1936) (\u201cThese words cannot be meaningless, else they would not have been used.\u201d). The correct interpretation of subsection (h)\u2014and the only interpretation that avoids surplus-age\u2014is that, if the specific \u201cexecution method\u201d in a \u201ccase\u201d is declared unconstitutional, Alabama can resort to \u201cany valid method of execution.\u201d <em>See </em>Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-10\">This interpretation is also consistent with the subsections immediately preced<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>ing subsection (h). Subsections (f) and (g) charge the Department of Corrections with the administration of executions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15\u201418\u201482.1(f), (g). Specifically, subsection (f) provides that the Department of Corrections shall designate who selects the drugs used in the administration of lethal injection, and subsection (g) exempts from Alabama\u2019s ordinary rulemaking procedure the Department of Corrections\u2019s \u201cpolicies and procedures\u201d for administering executions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-18-82.1(f), (g). Immediately following this discussion, subsection (h) is correctly understood to discuss the constitutionality of the Department of Corrections\u2019s chosen execution protocol. <em>See </em>An-tonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner, <em>Reading Law </em>167 (2012) (\u201cContext is a primary determinant of meaning.\u201d); K <em>Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 281, 291, 108 S.Ct. 1811, 1818, 100 L.Ed.2d 313 (1988) (\u201cIn ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute, the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue, as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.\u201d). Based on the plain language of \u00a7 15-18-82.1, the statute permits Alabama to turn to the firing squad when its planned execution protocol for a particular prisoner is declared unconstitutional. The Majority\u2019s interpretation clearly fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-4\">Yet, even assuming that the plain language of \u00a7 15-18-82.1 is ambiguous and the Majority\u2019s interpretation is plausible, the statute must still be read to permit the firing squad in this case. In the face of such ambiguity, an interpretation that \u201cfurthers rather than obstructs [the statutory textj\u2019s purpose should be favored.\u201d <em>See </em>Scalia, <em>supra, </em>at 63; <em>SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., </em>320 U.S. 344, 350, 64 S.Ct. 120, 123, 88 L.Ed. 88 (1943) (\u201c[CJourts [sha]ll construe the details of an act in conformity with its dominating general purpose.\u201d). This rule of statutory construction militates against the Majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 15-18-82.1,</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">The purpose of subsections (c) and (h) is clear: to ensure that Alabama can enforce the death penalty through an alternative form of execution when its chosen means of executing a prisoner is declared unconstitutional. Under the reading described above, \u00a7 15-18-82.1 provides Alabama the authority to (1) turn to an alternative form of execution upon a per se finding that lethal injection or electrocution is unconstitutional, <em>see </em>Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1(c), <em>and </em>(2) employ \u201cany valid method of execution\u201d when its specific execution protocol is declared unconstitutional, <em>see </em>\u00a7 15-18-82.1(h). In contrast, the Majority\u2019s interpretation affords Alabama the authority to use an alternative form of execution only when lethal injection or electrocution is declared per se unconstitutional. This reading plainly limits Alabama\u2019s ability to turn to an alternative form of execution in the face of constitutional scrutiny. The interpretation obstructs the purpose of subsections (c) and (h) and impairs Alabama\u2019s ability to enforce the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">The Majority\u2019s determination that \u00a7 15-18-82.1 precludes Arthur from relying on the firing squad is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute and the purpose underlying subsections (c) and (h). Arthur\u2019s firing-squad claim conflicts only with the Majority\u2019s flawed interpretation of Alabama law, not Alabama law itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">III. THE MAJORITY\u2019S RELIANCE ON STATE LAW CONTRAVENES <em>BAZE, GLOSSIP, </em>AND THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-9\">Even assuming that \u00a7 15-18-82.1 does not permit the firing squad under the present circumstances, the Majority\u2019s dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>missal of Arthur\u2019s claim would <em>still </em>be erroneous. The Majority\u2019s rejection of the firing squad rests on its determination that, if a state legislatively opposes an execution alternative, then the alternative is not feasible and readily implemented and method-of-execution relief is foreclosed. State law however is irrelevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry established by <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip, </em>and more fundamentally, under the Supremacy Clause, state law cannot thwart a viable constitutional claim. In relying on state law to deny Arthur relief, the Majority commits constitutional error. The Majority\u2019s decision in effect turns <em>Baze </em>and Glossip\u2019s method-of-execution test\u2014a test designed to protect the Eighth Amendment rights of death row prisoners\u2014into a test that narrows, and in many cases defeats, those rights. This transformation is not only unprecedented, it is completely unmoored from precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">A. <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">1. An Overview of <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">In <em>Baze, </em>the Supreme Court first held that a method-of-execution claimant must identify a \u201cfeasible\u201d and \u201creadily implemented\u201d execution alternative that \u201csignificantly reduce[s] a substantial risk of severe pain.\u201d <em>See Baze, </em>553 U.S. at 52, 128 S.Ct. at 1532; <em>Glossip, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2737. According to the <em>Baze </em>Court, \u201c[i]f a [sjtate refuses to adopt ... an alternative in the face of these documented advantages, without a legitimate penological justification for adhering to its current method of execution, then [the] [s]tate\u2019s refusal ... can be viewed as \u2018cruel and unusual.\u2019\u201d <em>Baze, </em>553 U.S. at 52, 128 S.Ct. at 1532. <em>Baze </em>neither placed any restrictions on the categories of execution alternatives that a claimant can rely on to demonstrate such cruel and unusual conduct, nor limited possible alternatives to those that the claimant\u2019s state has approved. <em>See id., </em>128 S.Ct. at 1532. To satisfy <em>Baze, </em>an alternative must simply have the \u201cdocumented advantages\u201d of being \u201cfeasible, readily implemented,\u201d and significantly safer than the state\u2019s designated execution method. <em>See id., </em>128 S.Ct. at 1532.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-8\">Subsequently, <em>Glossip </em>.confirmed this \u201cexecution alternative\u201d requirement, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-9\">The controlling opinion [in Baze] summarized the requirements of an Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claim as follows: ... \u25a0 the condemned prisoner [must] establish[ ] that the [s]tate\u2019s [method of execution] creates a demonstrated risk of severe pain. And he must show that the risk is substantial when compared to the known and available alternatives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1328-10\"><em>Glossip, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2737 (internal quotation marks omitted). Consistent with <em>Baze, Glossip </em>also indicated that, when attempting to satisfy the \u201cexecution alternative\u201d requirement, prisoners are neither limited to certain categories of execution alternatives nor constrained by state-approved alternatives. <em>See id. </em>at 2739 (stating that a prisoner is required only \u201cto plead and prove a known and available alternative\u201d); <em>id. </em>(rejecting the dissent\u2019s argument that \u201cthe methods of execution employed before the advent of lethal injection,\u201d such as the firing squad, are not permissible execution alternatives).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-11\">In <em>Glossip, </em>the prisoners argued that Oklahoma\u2019s lethal injection cocktail posed an unacceptable risk of cruel and unusual punishment. They proposed a different cocktail as an execution alternative. However, the Court found that the proposed cocktail was not a \u201cknown and available\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>alternative because the record showed that \u201cdespite a good-faith effort,\u201d Oklahoma was unable to procure the drugs in the cocktail. <em>Id. </em>at 2738. Due to the scarcity of those drugs, it was functionally impossible for Oklahoma to obtain them. <em>See id. </em>at 2733-34, 2738.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-4\">Our court has applied the \u201cexecution alternative\u201d requirement on multiple occasions. We have found, in accord with <em>Glos-sip, </em>that a proposed, execution alternative does not satisfy the requirement when a state is unable to obtain the materials necessary for the alternative. <em>See, e.g., Brooks v. Warden, </em>810 F.3d 812, 820-21 (11th Cir. 2016) (concluding that, due to scarcity, the lethal injection cocktail that the prisoner proposed as an execution alternative was not available to Alabama), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Brooks v. Dunn, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 979, 193 L.Ed.2d 813 (2016); <em>Chavez v. Fla. SP Warden, </em>742 F.3d 1267, 1274 (11th Cir. 2014) (Carnes, C.J., concurring) (rejecting a method-of-execution claim in part because the prisoner admitted that the relevant lethal injection drug alternatives were unavailable), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Chavez v. Palmer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1156, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2014). We have never concluded that an execution alternative fails to satisfy <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip </em>because a state has rejected the alternative by legislation or some other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-10\"><em>2. </em>The Majority\u2019s Misapplication of <em>Baze </em>and' <em>Glossip.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-12\">Although neither <em>Baze </em>nor <em>Glossip </em>holds that an execution alternative must be state authorized, the Majority imposes such a requirement on Arthur. The Majority finds that, if a state legislatively rejects an alternative, the alternative is not feasible and readily implemented. But the \u201cfeasible and readily implemented\u201d inquiry cannot serve as a vessel for the Majority\u2019s novel requirement. State opposition to an execution alternative\u2014through legislation or any other means\u2014has no bearing on the \u201cfeasible and readily implemented\u201d inquiry as set forth in <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-14\">Whether an execution is feasible and readily implemented is considered separately from a state\u2019s rejection of the alternative. Again, in setting forth the \u201cexecution alternative\u201d requirement, <em>Baze </em>emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1329-15\">[An] alternative procedure must be feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain. If a [s]tate refuses to adopt such an alternative in the face of these documented advantages, without a legitimate penological justification for adhering to its current method of execution, then a [s]tate\u2019s refusal to change its method can be viewed as \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d under the Eighth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1329-16\"><em>Baze, </em>553 U.S. at 52, 128 S.Ct. at 1532. Hence, in considering a method-of-execution claim, we determine whether a proposed alternative has \u201cdocumented advantages,\u201d such as being feasible and readily implemented, and then we consider separately the state\u2019s refusal to adopt the alternative. <em>See id., </em>128 S.Ct. at 1532. Those are clearly distinct inquiries. An alternative can have the \u201cdocumented advantages\u201d of being \u201cfeasible\u201d and \u201creadily implemented\u201d even though a st\u00e1te \u201crefuses to adopt\u201d the alternative. <em>See id., </em>128 S.Ct. at 1532. A state\u2019s decision to embrace or reject an alternative therefore does not bear on the \u201cfeasible and readily implemented\u201d inquiry. Yet, under the Majority\u2019s reasoning, when a state refuses to adopt an execution alternative\u2014by, for example, passing legislation that rejects the alternative and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>adhering to that legislation\u2014the alternative is ipso facto not feasible and readily implemented. That novel conclusion contravenes <em>Baze.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">Indeed, <em>Baze </em>and Glossip\u2019s method-of-execution standard would be internally inconsistent if the \u201cfeasible and readily implemented\u201d inquiry took into account a state\u2019s opposition\u2014via legislation or another means\u2014to an execution alternative. A state\u2019s refusal to adopt a viable execution alternative is the very conduct that gives rise to an Eighth Amendment .violation under <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip. See id., </em>128 S.Ct. at 1532. The Eighth Amendment prohibits states from ignoring an \u201cobjectively intolerable risk of harm\u201d when imposing punishment. <em>See id. </em>at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. at 1530-31 (internal quotation marks omitted). The method-of-execution standard implements this constitutional protection. When a state uses a dangerous method of execution and \u201crefuses to adopt\u201d an alternative that is feasible, readily implemented, and significantly safer than the state\u2019s method, the state ignores an avoidable risk of harm, thereby violating the Eighth Amendment. <em>See id. </em>at 52, 128 S.Ct. at 1532.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">The Majority\u2019s decision allows this exact conduct to <em>shield </em>a state from method-of-execution liability. According to the Majority, Alabama has legislatively opposed the firing squad, and that \u201crefus[al] to adopt\u201d the firing squad defeats Arthur\u2019s method-of-execution claim. <em>See id. </em>at 52, 128 S.Ct. at 1532. That application of <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glos-sip </em>is clearly inconsistent with those precedents. State law cannot render the firing squad not feasible and readily implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">B. The Supremacy Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-9\">Beyond its incongruence with <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip, </em>the Majority\u2019s treatment of state law conflicts with the Supremacy Clause. In determining that state law can thwart an execution alternative, the Majority improperly grants states the power to dictate the scope of federal constitutional relief. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2 (\u201c[The Constitution] shall be the supreme Law of the Land ... Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d). The upshot of this novel allocation of power is that a state statute can abrogate prisoners\u2019 Eighth Amendment right to a humane execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-10\">Under the Majority\u2019s decision, \u00a7 15-18-82.1 constricts Eighth Amendment relief and protects Alabama from claims that are viable under <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip. </em>The Eighth Amendment guarantees method-of-execution relief when a prisoner identifies any viable alternative. <em>See Baze, </em>553 U.S. at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. at 1531-32; <em>Glossip, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2737-39. However, because the only method of execution that \u00a7 15-18-82.1 currently authorizes for Arthur is lethal injection, Arthur must identify a viable lethal-injection-based alternative to obtain method-of-execution relief. Any other type of alternative is not contemplated by \u00a7 15-18-82.1 and is not feasible and readily implemented.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 15-18-82.1 thus severely restricts the circumstances in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>which Arthur can obtain method-of-execution relief. This narrowing of Arthur\u2019s access to relief flouts the Supremacy Clause; states cannot override the Constitution\u2019s protections. <em>See Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 582-84, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1392-93, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964) (\u201cWhen there is an unavoidable conflict between the Federal ... Constitution [and state law], the Supremacy Clause of course controls.\u201d); <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>348 F.2d 750, 752 (5th Cir. 1965) (\u201cWhen a [s]tate ... [limits] citizens [in] the exercise of their constitutional rights[,] ... the federal system is imperiled.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">The Majority\u2019s state-law determination however does not merely allow states to constrict prisoners\u2019 Eighth Amendment rights\u2014it permits states to abrogate such rights. Moving forward, a state can pass legislation requiring all executions to be performed with a certain gas chamber protocol or a certain electrocution protocol, and since the legislation would authorize only those two particular protocols, no other protocol or method of execution would be feasible and readily implemented. As a result, even in the face of evidence that both protocols are excruciatingly painful, condemned prisoners could never obtain relief from the protocols\u2014it would be impossible to meet <em>Baze </em>and Glossip\u2019s \u201cexecution alternative\u201d requirement, and <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip </em>provide the only avenue for method-of-execution relief. The state\u2019s legislation would thus nullify prisoners\u2019 right to a humane execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-9\">Although this example is merely a hypothetical, it underscores the troubling constitutional issues that arise from the Majority\u2019s decision. The decision allows state law to trump the Eighth Amendment\u2019s basic guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u25a0 <em>Contra </em>U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-10\">IV. THE MAJORITY\u2019S DECISION FORECLOSES RELIEF FOR PRISONERS ACROSS THIS CIRCUIT WHO ARE DESIGNATED TO DIE BY LETHAL INJECTION.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-11\">Prisoners in Alabama and Florida<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> who, like Arthur, are designated to die by lethal injection must now identify a viable lethal-injection-based alternative to obtain method-of-execution relief. But given the \u201cdifficult realities\u201d surrounding lethal injection drugs, that is not practicable. <em>See </em>Brief of Defendant-Appellee at 10, <em>Arthur v. Comm\u2019r, Ala. Dept. of Corr., </em>840 F.3d 1268, No. 16-15549 (11th Cir. Oct. 11, 2016) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>(noting the practical barriers to identifying a viable lethal-injection-based alternative). Due to the scarcity of and secrecy surrounding lethal injection drugs, it is all but impossible, for a prisoner to set forth a viable lethal-injection-based alternative. The Majority\u2019s decision therefore checkmates countless Alabama and Florida pris-on\u00e9rs, nullifying their' constitutional right to a humane execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">Many condemned prisoners have attempted to propose lethal injection drug alternatives in method-of-execution cases but those attempts have been futile because lethal injection drugs are extremely scarce. <em>See, e.g., Glossip, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2738 (rejecting a method-of-execution claim after finding that \u201cOklahoma has been unable to procure [two formerly widely-used lethal injection] drugs despite a good-faith effort to do so\u201d); <em>Brooks, </em>810 F.3d at 820-21; <em>Chavez, </em>742 F.3d at 1274 (Carnes, C.J., concurring) (discussing the scarcity of lethal injection drugs); <em>Sepulvado v. Jindal, </em>729 F.3d 413, 416 (5th Cir. 2013) (\u201cSince 2010, the first drug in [Louisiana\u2019s former lethal injection] procedure\u2014sodium thio-pental\u2014has been unavailable.\u201d); <em>cf. Wood v. Ryan, </em>759 F.3d 1076, 1097 (9th Cir. 2014) (Bybee, J., dissenting) (remarking that \u201cTennessee recently reauthorized the use of the electric chair as an alternative method of execution\u201d due to concerns about the unavailability of \u201cthe drugs necessary to perform a lethal injection\u201d), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 21, 189 L.Ed.2d 873 (2014); Distanislao, Note, 49 U. Rich. L. Rev. at 804-05 (\u201c[A]mid ... widespread drug shortages, capital punishment is losing its position as a functional element of American society.\u201d). In fact, Arthur himself proffered to the district court two alternative lethal injection drug compounds, but the distinct court rejected those proposed alternatives after discovery, finding, them unavailable to Alabama. <em>See Arthur v. Dunn (Dunn I), </em>No. 2:11\u2014cv-438-WKW-TFM, slip op. at 19-21, 2016 WL 1551475 (M.D. Ala. Apr. 15, 2016); Brief of Defendant-Appellee at 10, <em>Arthur, </em>No. 16-15549. And the Majority now affirms that finding. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 1301,1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-7\">Furthermore, to the extent that some limited supply of viable, alternative lethal injection drugs exists, prisoners cannot gather the information needed to use those drugs, in a method-of-execution claim because details about lethal injection drugs and their suppliers are heavily concealed. <em>See, e.g., Arthur v. Thomas, </em>674 F.3d 1257, 1263 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (noting \u201cthe veil of secrecy that surrounds Alabama\u2019s execution protocol\u201d); <em>Terrell v. Bryson, </em>807 F.3d 1276, 1281 (11th Cir. 2015) (Martin, J., concurring) (discussing Georgia\u2019s lethal injection \u201csecrecy rules\u201d). This veil of secrecy is evident here. Arthur was stonewalled in his attempts to gather information about the availability of the drugs in his proposed lethal injection compounds. According to testimony from an expert witness who asked members of the drug community about the availability of one of the compounds, \u201cnone of the pharmacists\u201d that he spoke to \u201cprovided [him] permission to share their names [or] contact information.\u201d <em>See Arthur v. Dunn (Dunn II), </em>No. 2:11-cv-438-WKW-TFM, slip op. at 41, \u2014 F.3d -, 2016 WL 3912038 (M.D. Ala. July 19, 2016). Another expert witness also spoke to the secrecy surrounding the compound, stating, \u201cI have no -knowledge of where any state has [in the past] secured [the compound].\u201d <em>See Dunn I, </em>slip op. at 11 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-10\">The scarcity of and secrecy surrounding lethal injection drugs make it basically impossible to identify a \u201cfeasible\u201d and \u201creadi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>ly implemented\u201d lethal-injection-based alternative that \u201csignificantly reduce[s] a substantial risk of severe pain.\u201d <em>See Baze, </em>553 U.S. at 52, 128 S.Ct. at 1532; <em>Glossip, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2737. This bears out in our case law. Based on my research, no prisoner has ever successfully challenged his method of execution relying on a lethal-injection-based alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\">Accordingly, the Majority\u2019s decision all but forecloses method-of-execution relief for a myriad of Alabama and Florida prisoners.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This case is telling. Arthur proffered an execution alternative that was not lethal-injection-based, but the Majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 15-18-82.1 thwarted that potentially safe and available alternative, leaving Arthur with, no choice but to rely solely on lethal-injection-based alternatives. Arthur attempted to identify such an alternative but was stymied by the limited supply of lethal injection drugs and the secrecy surrounding such drugs. Checkmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">Y. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">The Majority misinterprets Alabama law, reads a new restriction into <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip </em>that is directly at odds with those decisions, and empowers states to thwart constitutional claims. Taken together, these errors have jarring practical consequences; relief under <em>Baze </em>and <em>Glossip </em>is now a mirage for prisoners across this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-10\">Arthur is entitled to amend his complaint and proceed with his method-of-execution claim proposing the firing squad.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> I respectfully dissent;</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-11\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-12\">In offering the firing squad as an execution alternative, Arthur\u2019s proposed complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-13\"><em>Alternative </em># <em>S\u2014Firing Squad</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-14\">134. \u25a0 A third potential alternative is the firing squad. The Supreme Court has held that the firing squad is a constitutionally permissible form of. execution. <em>See Wilkerson v. Utah, </em>99 U.S. 130, 134-35, 25 L.Ed. 345 (1879) (upholding sentence of death by firing squad). Indeed, as recently-as 2010 Utah executed an inmate by firing squad. On March 23, 2015, Utah Governor Gary Herbert signed into law an- amendment providing that firing squads will serve as the backup method of execution if lethal injection drugs are not available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1333-15\">135. Protocols for execution by firing squad, which has been carried out at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>least three times since 1976 without apparent incident, are known and available. For example, under Utah\u2019s recent law, the prisoner is seated in a chair set up between stacked sandbags to prevent the bullets from ricocheting. A target is pinned over the inmate\u2019s heart. Five shooters are set up approximately 25 feet from the chair where the prisoner is seated, with .30 caliber Winchester rifles pointing through slots in the wall. The gunmen are chosen from a pool of volunteer officers. (Utah Rep. Paul Ray, the sponsor of the firing squad bill, has said that there are always more volunteers than spots on the firing squad. Upon information and belief, the same would be' true in Alabama and/or the State would otherwise be able to supply officers to carry out an execution.) The shooters\u2019 identities are kept anonymous, and one rifle is loaded with a blank so that no one knows which officer killed the inmate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-5\">136. The firing squad is a known and available alternative in the state of Alabama. Upon information, and belief, there are numerous people employed by the State who have the training necessary to successfully perform an execution by firing squad. The State already has a stockpile of both weapons and ammunition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-6\">137. Moreover, execution ' by firing squad, if implemented properly, would result in a substantially lesser risk of harm than the State\u2019s continued use of a three-drug protocol involving midazo-lam. Evidence and recent experience strongly suggest that the-firing squad is \u201csignificantly more reliable than other methods.\u201d <em>Glossip, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2796 (So-tomayor, J., dissenting). A recent study, which analyzed the contemporaneous news reports of all executions in the United States from 1900 to 2010, found that 7.12% of the 1,054 executions by lethal injection were \u201cbotched\u201d and that 0 of the 34 executions by firing squad had been botched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-9\">138.Accordingly, if implemented properly, an execution by firing squad is a known and available alternative method of execution that presents a substantially lower risk of pain and suffering than the current [Alabama Department of Corrections] protocol described above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1334-10\">Motion for Leave to File Third Amended Complaint, Exhibit A at 43-44, No. 2:11-CV-438-WKW-TFM (M.D. Ala. Aug. 25, 2015), ECF No. 256-1 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1321-8\">. In recent years, several scholars have advocated for wider use of the firing squad, <em>See </em>Deborah W. Denno, <em>The Firing Squad. </em>As \u201cA <em>Known and Available Alternative Method of Execution\" </em>Post-Glossip, 49 U. Mich. J. L. Reform 749 (2016); P. Thomas Distanislao, III, Note, A <em>Shot in the Dark: Why Virginia Should Adopt the Firing Squad </em>As <em>Its Primary Method of Execution, </em>49 U. Rich. L.

One such scholar concluded that \"the firing squad is the most viable \u2018known and available [execution] alternative\u2019.... Indeed, [it] is the only current form of execution involving trained professionals, and it delivers a swift and certain death.\u201d Denno, 49 U. Mich. J. L. Reform at 753 (quoting <em>Glossip, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2731).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">. Given that Arthur requested to amend his complaint immediately after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Glossip, </em>the Majority's conclusion that the request is barred by lach-es is unavailing. Indeed, in a similar case, the same district court judge who presided over Arthur\u2019s proceedings rejected the Majority's position. In <em>Boyd v. Myers, </em>the prisoner\u2014a few weeks after the <em>Glossip </em>decision\u2014sought to amend his complaint to include the firing squad, and the State argued that the request was untimely. <em>See </em>No. 2:14-cv-1017-WKW, slip op. at 6-7, 2015 WL 5852948 (M.D. Ala. Oct. 7, 2015). The district court judge concluded that, because <em>\u201cGlossip </em>clarified\u201d the \"execution alternative\u201d requirement and the prisoner made his request shortly after <em>Glos-sip, </em>the request was timely. <em>See id. </em>at 6, 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1322-7\">. As an initial matter, the Majority appears to confuse the posture of Arthur\u2019s firing-squad claim. Arthur has only moved to add to his complaint the firing-squad claim. He has not been provided an opportunity to proceed to discovery, summary judgment, or trial on the claim. Evidence and proof therefore have no relevance in the discussion of whether the district court erred in denying Arthur relief on this issue. However, in arguing the futility of Arthur\u2019s request, the Majority emphasizes Arthur\u2019s failure to \"present any admissible evidence\u201d\u2014a feat that Arthur is expected to accomplish in the absence of the amended pleading and corresponding discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-13\">Although a district court has discretion in whether to grant a request to amend the complaint, the court in denying the request must articulate a valid reason for the denial. <em>See </em>3-15 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 15.15 (Matthew Bender 3d ed.) (\"[A] trial court must provide a reason for denying a motion to amend.\u201d); Fed. R. Civ. P, 15(a)(2) (\"The court should freely give leave [to amend a pleading] when justice so requires.\u201d). The Majority claims that the district court could have listed several reasons for its denial here, but the court offered only one reason; futility due to an Alabama statute. We review a finding of futility de novo. <em>Mizzaro v. Home Depot, Inc., </em>544 F.3d 1230, 1236 (11th Cir. 2008). And this dissent argues that under de novo review, the Majority\u2019s finding of futility based on Alabama law is erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">. The Majority however muddies this finding, as it also appears to reach a contradictory conclusion: that Alabama cannot turn to a non-designated method of execution unless a prisoner attacks both electrocution <em>and </em>lethal injection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1324-8\">. Lethal injection is not a unitary form of execution; it is a category of execution that can be carried out using a variety of methods. I use the term '\u2018lethal-injection-based execution alternative\u201d to refer to an execution method that falls within that category.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">. Of course, this determination is inconsistent with the Majority's suggestion that Alabama cannot turn to the firing squad absent an attack on both lethal injection <em>and </em>electrocution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">. While concluding that Arthur must rely on an alternative currently authorized by \u00a7 15-18-82.1, the Majority indicates that, under its reading of \u00a7 15-18-82.1, Arthur could have obtained relief based on an alternative that is not currently authorized if he successfully raised a per se challenge to lethal injection or electrocution. However, that point is a red herring. First, a prisoner such as Arthur who Alabama plans to kill via lethal injection has no standing to challenge electrocution. Second, it strains credulity to suggest that Arthur could, at this time, raise a legitimate argument that lethal injection is per se unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>tional. Lethal injection is a category of execution that can be carried out in a variety of ways. A finding that lethal injection is per se unconstitutional would require a finding that every possible method of lethal injection is unconstitutional. Hence, it was not feasible for Arthur to successfully bring a per se challenge to electrocution or lethal injection. Such challenges do not provide a means for Arthur or others to obtain relief based on a method of execution not currently authorized by \u00a7 15-18-82.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">. These serious constitutional concerns provide yet another reason why the Majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 15-18-82.1 is improper. Even if the text of the statute is susceptible both to the reading the Majority ascribes and to the one advanced above, because the reading advanced above avoids a clash with the Supremacy Clause, it is the-one that must be employed. <em>See Clark v. Martinez, </em>543 U.S. 371, 381, 125 S.Ct. 716, 724, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1331-13\">. As previously noted, because Florida has a statute that is identical to \u00a7 15-18-82.1, the Majority\u2019s decision has the same consequences for Florida and Alabama prisoners. <em>Compare </em>Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1, <em>with </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 922.105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">. The Majority's decision may also chill the rights of prisoners outside our circuit. Several states have legislation similar to \u00a7 15\u201418\u2014 82.1. <em>Compare </em>Ala. Code \u00a7 15-18-82.1, <em>with, e.g., </em>Tenn. Code \u00a7 40-23-114 (2014); Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 431.220-223 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1333-8\">. In addition to finding that the firing squad is not feasible and- readily implemented, the Majority opines that the district court\u2019s denial of Arthur\u2019s request to amend was not error because Arthur has failed to prove that Alabama\u2019s three-drug lethal injection protocol is sure or very likely to cause serious harm. Based on the posture of this c\u00e1se, that is not a proper basis for affirming the district court. The parties have not litigated whether Alabama\u2019s protocol, as a general matter, is sure or very likely to cause serious harm. The district court dismissed all of Arthur's general method-of-execution claims based on the \u201cexecution alternative\u201d requirement, and Arthur\u2019s as-applied challenge did not present the issue of whether the protocol is sure or very likely to cause serious harm to prisoners. Because the parties have not litigated that issue, the Majority\u2019s reliance on the issue is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
