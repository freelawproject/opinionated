When they arrived at 8:20 p. m., they found that an ambulance had carried the driver to the Athens General Hospital, and they observed that the automobile had apparently hit a slick place on the highway and skidded into a telephone pole. When they arrived at the hospital some 45 minutes later, they found the defendant Hitchcock lying on one of the operating tables. They inquired of an intern and nurse if they might see the defendant, and were told by them that they could as the defendant was uninjured and only drunk. This declaration, made in the presence of the defendant, was not denied by him. Ferguson then asked the defendant what had happened and the defendant replied that he hit a slick place on the road which caused the car to go out of control. Ferguson testified that he smelled a strong odor of alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath before any treatment had been administered to the defendant, and he stated that, in his opinion, since the defendant did not talk as plainly as he should, it would be unsafe for the defendant to operate an automobile in his condition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
