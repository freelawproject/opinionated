Nonetheless, the District Court cast them both in that role and they appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">\n<em>It Happened One Night</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">At approximately 10:00 p. m. on February 21, 1973, Amos Williamson was backing a tractor-trailer into the driveway of his home. During this operation, the trailer extended across Georgia State Route 54, and an automobile driven by Kenneth Randall Smith collided with that unsubtle object. Smith was killed; his wife and a second passenger were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-16\">Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Smith brought a diversity suit in the Northern District of Georgia alleging negligence of the driver Williamson and the defective condition of both tractor and trailer. She sought $1.5 million in damages for her injuries and the wrongful death of her husband. The cast of characters named as defendants and their alleged interrelationships were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b370-18\">J.R.J. Trucking, Inc. (JRJ): owner and lessor of tractor</p>\n<p id=\"b370-19\">Rentco Division \u2014 Fruehauf Corp. (Rent-co): owner and lessor of trailer International Transportation Services, Inc. (ITS): lessee of tractor and trailer International Bakerage, Inc. (Bakerage): sublessee from ITS of tractor and trailer Williamson was alleged to be the agent of all four defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-20\">\n<em>Behind The Scenes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-21\">At the time of the accident, JRJ was the named insured under a policy issued by Carolina Casualty Insurance Company (Carolina). That policy covered both the tractor owned by JRJ and the trailer owned by Rentco. ITS and Bakerage were named insureds under a policy issued by Underwriters Insurance Company (Underwriters). Both policies were in full force and effect on February 21, 1973\u00cd</p>\n<p id=\"b370-22\">\n<em>The Director Takes Over</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-23\">During the pendency of Mrs. Smith\u2019s action, Carolina brought a declaratory judgment action against Underwriters, Rentco, ITS, Bakerage, and Mrs. Smith. It sought an adjudication of the respective rights and liabilities of the parties under the Carolina and Underwriters policies and a stay of the Smith action. Like the policies, also central to this dispute was the leasing agreement between JRJ and ITS.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-24\">Under the terms of this contract, JRJ, owner-lessor of the tractor, undertook, inter alia, the following obligations: (i) to keep the leased equipment in first-class condition and repair and to pay all operating ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>penses;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (ii) to assume responsibility for and pay wages to the drivers;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (iii) to assume full responsibility for drivers as JRJ\u2019s employees, and to hold ITS-lessee harmless from drivers\u2019 claims against ITS;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (iv) (a) to provide and keep in force property damage and public liability insurance, (b) to furnish a certificate of insurance showing ITS as the named insured and providing for notice of cancellation, and (c) to assume the expense in the event JRJ was unable to furnish evidence of insurance and ITS procured insurance on behalf of JRJ.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">ITS, an ICC carrier, assumed \u2014 as required by applicable regulations<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 exclusive possession, control and use of the leased equipment and full responsibility to the public, shippers, and all state and federal agencies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">In order that the reader can more readily understand and compare the critical provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>sions of the two policies, they are numbered in brackets and set forth below in table form.

Underwriters further contended that because any liability of ITS was vicarious, it was subrogated to the right of ITS to seek indemnity from Williamson and ultimately Williamson\u2019s insurer, Carolina. Alternatively, Underwriters asserted that if any coverage were found to exist, it was excess only and not primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court held that (i) ITS was not an additional insured under Carolina\u2019s policy by virtue of exclusion [2] of the Truck-men\u2019s endorsement; (ii) the driver Williamson was an additional insured under definition [1] of Carolina\u2019s policy by virtue of the lease which made Williamson a JRJ employee and permissive user; (iii) Williamson was an additional insured under ITS\u2019 Underwriters policy definition [4] by virtue of the lease which made him a permissive user;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Underwriters clause [5] was ineffective to exclude him from that definition under <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. v. Farmers Mutual Auto. Ins. </em>Co.;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (iv) a finding that Williamson was an additional insured under ITS\u2019 policy negated any possibility of subro-gation and indemnity; and (v) because the \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions [3] and [6] were mutually repugnant, Carolina <em>and </em>Underwriters were primary insurers with respect to Williamson. Delighted not to have been the only one cast in a primary role, but definitely unhappy with equal billing, both companies appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">\n<em>That Which They Giveth They Also Taketh Away?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">Carolina limits its attack to one aspect of the District Court\u2019s decision:<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the implicit rejection<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of the contention that Underwriter\u2019s coverage was not primary as a matter of law. Carolina\u2019s theory proceeds along the following lines. ITS is a common carrier certified by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Georgia Public Service Commission. The rig, in charge of Williamson, was operating under ITS\u2019 certificate of authority when the collision occurred. Underwriters filed on behalf of ITS certificates of insurance with the ICC and the Georgia PSC. The Underwriters policy is subject to the \u201cEndorsement for Motor Carrier Policies of Insurance for Automobile Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability under Section 215 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Interstate Commerce Act\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (ICC endorsement).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">According to Carolina, the fact that the Underwriters policy does not actually bear the ICC endorsement is of no moment. The Interstate Commerce Act and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto have the effect of,stamping the endorsement on the policy, with the concomitant effects of nullifying the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause [6] and making Underwriters the primary insurer. In support of this argument, Carolina relies principally on two Tenth Circuit decisions, <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. v. National Indemnity Co., </em>10 Cir., 1971, 435 F.2d 718, and <em>Hagans v. Glens Falls Ins. Co., </em>10 Cir., 1972, 465 F.2d 1249. In rebuttal, Underwriters relies on yet another Tenth Circuit case, <em>Carolina Casualty Ins. Co. v. Transport Indemnity Co., </em>10 Cir., 1973, 488 F.2d 790. We shall discuss these opinions in chronological sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In <em>Argonaut, </em>Executive Car Leasing hired a driver (Blankenship) from Auto Driveaway to transport an Executive car from Oklahoma to California. En route, Blankenship struck a car driven by Seymour who died as a result. Seymour\u2019s estate sued Blankenship and Auto Driveaway; Executive Car Leasing was not joined as a defendant. Executive\u2019s insurer National refused to defend the action. Driveaway\u2019s insurer Argonaut defended, settled for $55,-000, paid the judgment, and sued National on the basis that National had primary coverage. Both the National and Argonaut policies contained \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses. The Argonaut policy, however, contained the ICC endorsement, as to which the Court concluded as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">Blankenship had possession of the car under authority from Driveaway and drove negligently. The ICC endorsement, although not expressly referring to the \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions, says that no condition, provision, stipulation, or limitation of the policy \u201cshall relieve the Company [the insurer] from liability hereunder.\u201d If the Argonaut position is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>accepted, it will be relieved from any liability except for excess coverage. We <em>believe that the effect of the endorsement was to make Argonaut the primary insurer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><em>Whatever may be the liability of National under its policy, </em>we agree with the trial court that \u201c * * * Argonaut cannot escape the plain terms of its insuring agreement in this case.\u201d The ICC endorsement imposes primary liability and eliminates any need for consideration of the effect of the identical \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses. We have no question of excess because the recovery was within the limits of the Argonaut policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">435 F.2d at 720-21 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The facts in <em>Hagans </em>were slightly different. There the lessor Ryder (insured by Liberty Mutual) agreed to provide insurance covering Far-Go (lessee/ICC carrier) as an additional insured. Far-Go (insured by Glens Falls) agreed to indemnify Ryder. The driver Hagans was a Far-Go employee on Far-Go business at the time the accident occurred. <em>Both </em>policies covered Far-Go <em>and </em>its employees. Apparently the Glens Falls policy did not contain the ICC endorsement, but \u201call parties proceeded] on the premise that the policy of Glens Falls contained] such.\u201d 465 F.2d at 1252. The Court ignored the terms of the lease by which Ryder agreed to provide public liability insurance, and on the basis of <em>Argonaut </em>held that Glens Falls\u2019 coverage of Far-Go (lessee) was primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\"><em>Carolina v. Transport </em>maps out as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">Carolina/Andico-Lessor Transport/Ringsby-Lessee</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">Lease Lessor agreed to indemnify provisions lessee Lessee assumed control of driver</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">Lessor agreed to supply driver who was not to be considered employee of lessee</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">Lessor agreed to obtain public liability insurance</p>\n<p id=\"aby-dedup-0\">Policy ICC endorsement ICC endorsement</p>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">\u201e Omnibus insurance clause No comparable clause</p>\n<p id=\"AFr\">Excess only clause Excess only clause</p>\n<p id=\"b375-23\">On these facts the Court ignored the lease agreement except to the extent that the contract was considered to have established permissive use for purposes of the omnibus insurance clause. It distinguished <em>Argonaut </em>and <em>Hagans </em>on the basis that both policies contained the ICC endorsement and went on to hold first, that Ringsby-lessee<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the driver were additional insureds under the Carolina policy. Second, the driver was not an additional insured under the Transport policy because it <em>lacked </em>an omnibus insurance clause (equivalent to Underwriters provision [4] here). Third, the driver was a \u201cspecial employee\u201d of Ringsby-les-see because it had full control over the tractor-trailer. Finally,</p>\n<p id=\"A7K\">Ringsby\u2019s [lessee\u2019s] liability, if any, is vicarious; if Ringsby should be found liable it would have the right to proceed by indemnification against Freeze [the driver]. As Ringsby\u2019s subrogee, Transport [Indemnity] could then sue Freeze, a permissive user under Carolina\u2019s policy, ultimately recovering against Carolina. <em>Based on the above, and to avoid circuity of action, we hold Carolina\u2019s policy to be primary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-26\">488 F.2d at 794 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-27\"><em>Argonaut, Hagans </em>and <em>Carolina v. Transport </em>are not dispositive here. First, there are factual distinctions. In <em>Argonaut, </em>the estate did not sue Executive Leasing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the negligence action went to judgment only against Driveaway and Blankenship. While the Court clearly recognized the possibility that Executive and National had potential liability, such liability had not been established, and there is no indication in the opinion that an action against Executive was either filed or contemplated. As to <em>Hagans, </em>the Glens Falls policy held to be primary insured a lessee who had expressly agreed to indemnify its lessor. In those circumstances, there was nothing inequitable in making Glens Falls the primary insurer. <em>Carolina v. Transport </em>involved a situation where the lessee\u2019s policy contained no omnibus clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">But we approach it more fundamentally. Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the Underwriters policy bears the ICC endorsement, and assume that in this trilogy the Tenth Circuit is saying that such an endorsement makes insurance coverage primary in all circumstances and for all purposes as a matter of law, we decline to follow such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The purpose of \u00a7 215 of the Interstate Commerce Act and regulations is to assure to members of the public and shippers that a certificated carrier has independent financial responsibility, with the dollar limits prescribed, to pay for losses created by its carrier operations. On the face of the endorsement this is accomplished by reading out \u201cother insurance,\u201d \u201cexcess,\u201d or similar clauses insofar as the amount available to a third party victim would be reduced. But there is no need for or purpose to be served by this supposed automatic extinguishment of the clause insofar as it affects the insured or other insurers who clamor for part or all of the coverage. Indeed the last sentence of the endorsement (see note 18, supra) prescribes that as between insurer and insured all terms of the policy are to remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">This is substantially the same approach we took in <em>Consolidated Systems, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>5 Cir., 1969, 411 F.2d 157. There, Allstate insured Consolidated, the lessor; Citizens insured Alterman, the common carrier/lessee. Despite the fact that certificates of insurance were filed on Al-terman\u2019s behalf with the ICC and the equivalent state authority, Citizens never issued a policy to Alterman. Allstate argued that Alterman was estopped to deny primary coverage to Consolidated because of the ICC requirements. Judge Thornber-ry\u2019s opinion answered the estoppel argument for us:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The question . . . raised by this conclusion of law is whether Citizens\u2019 filings with the ICC and the Public Service Commission, either or both, constitute representations of the existence of insurance which estop Citizens from denying primary coverage to Consolidated. <em>Preliminarily, we focus on the fact that the party asserting the estoppel is Allstate, not the person injured in the collision. We make this point because we would clearly have </em>a <em>different case if this were a suit brought by the injured person, if Alterman were judgment proof, if a bond were not on file with the ICC, and if Citizens denied liability to the injured party on the ground that it never issued the insurance policy referred to in the certificate. </em>In this hypothetical situation, the injured person could argue with considerable force that the public relied on the existence of insurance attested to by Citizens and that Citizens was estopped to deny liability since Alterman would never have made the trip resulting in a collision if the certificate had not been filed. But in the case actually before us Allstate is asserting that Citizens is es-topped to deny the existence of insurance covering Consolidated. Whereas the Florida citizen injured in a collision with an Alterman vehicle would have little difficulty arguing as against Citizens that the public relied on the representation that Alterman had insurance, reliance by Allstate on other insurance for Consolidated is not so easily perceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">411 F.2d at 161 (emphasis added). <em>See also Allstate Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>3 Cir., 1966, 368 F.2d 121, 125 (where construction of policy is not required to protect the public, ICC considerations are not deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>minative). <em>Cf. Wellman v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>8 Cir., 1974, 496 F.2d 131, 139 (ICC regulations may not be read into policy to impose liability upon insurer in contravention of precise terms of policy); <em>Vance Trucking Co. v. Canal Ins. Co., </em>D.S.C., 1966, 249 F.Supp. 33, 39, <em>aff\u2019d, 4 </em>Cir., 1968, 395 F.2d 391, <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 845, 89 S.Ct. 129, 21 L.Ed.2d 116 (Interstate Commerce Act and regulations are not designed to excuse a party from liability which he might otherwise have).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Therefore, assuming without deciding that the Underwriters policy contains an ICC endorsement,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we hold that the endorsement does not make Underwriters the primary insurer as a matter of law. Williamson was a paid employee of JRJ at the time of the accident, and the leasing agreement granted Williamson permissive use of JRJ\u2019s equipment. Carolina insured the risk that a JRJ permissive user might incur liability. Carolina cannot disavow its primary insurer status on the theory that public policy demands that this be pushed off onto Underwriters. ICC policy factors are frequently determinative where protection of a member of the public<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or a shipper is at stake, but those factors cannot be invoked by another insurance company which has contracted to insure a specific risk and which needs no equivalent protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\n<em>Like A Circle In A Spiral</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AF3\">Underwriters takes the same stance here as it did below with one exception: it has apparently abandoned \u2014 and with good cause \u2014 the contention that ITS was an additional insured under the Carolina policy.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Otherwise, it maintains that under <em>Simmons v. King, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 478 F.2d 857, ITS\u2019 liability for Williamson\u2019s acts is vicarious only and that under principles of indemnity and subrogation, it would be entitled to proceed against Williamson and ultimately his insurer Carolina. Thus, in order to avoid circuity of action, we are urged to follow <em>Carolina v. Transport, supra, </em>488 F.2d 790, and hold Carolina primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">The fallacy in Underwriters\u2019 position of course is that Williamson was an additional insured under ITS\u2019 policy. We believe that the District Court\u2019s analysis of this issue was absolutely correct<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and that it properly applied Simmons.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Underwriters contends that by reason of the terms of the lease imposing substantial obligations on the lessor (see notes 2-5, supra) Carolina\u2019s coverage should be primary. It is well settled that disputes of this sort hinge principally on the express terms of the policy and an insurer\u2019s contractual obligations cannot ordinarily be altered by collateral agreements between its insured and third persons. <em>E. g., Trans</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>port Indemnity Co. v. Home Indemnity Co., </em>3 Cir., 1976, 535 F.2d 232, 235; <em>Carolina </em>v. <em>Transport, supra. </em>However, it is equally well settled that a Court can look to outside sources \u2014 such as lease agreements and ICC regulations \u2014 to define the status of persons who are covered by the insurance contract. <em>E. g., Wellman, supra, </em>496 F.2d at 137; <em>Carolina v. Transport, supra, </em>488 F.2d at 794; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Alterman Transport Lines, Inc., </em>5 Cir., 1972, 465 F.2d 710, 714-15; <em>Transport v. Home, supra, </em>535 F.2d at 237; <em>Pacific National Ins. Co. v. Transport Ins. Co., </em>8 Cir., 1965, 341 F.2d 514, 518. <em>Cf. Transamerican Freight Lines, Inc. v. Brada Miller Freight Systems, Inc., </em>1975, 423 U.S. 28, 40, 96 S.Ct. 229, 235, 46 L.Ed.2d 169, 179 (recognizing that Interstate Commerce Act and regulations can impose liability as a matter of law). And probably more significant, when one insurer lashes out against another insurer with whom there is not the slightest shadow of a suggestion of a contractual relationship on the equitable concept of subrogation, the relationship between the insureds may have decisive consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Underwriters insists that provision [5], which excludes an owner of a hired or non-owned automobile or any agent or employee of such owner, operates to exclude Williamson from the omnibus definition [4] as an insured. The District Court properly held that <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Farmers Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., </em>7 Cir., 1962, 309 F.2d 283, is dispositive on this score. The \u201cdefinition of insured\u201d and \u201cowner-agent\u201d exclusion clauses in <em>Trinity </em>were substantially identical to the equivalent provisions [4] and [5] in the Underwriters policy. Moreover, the Eighth Circuit in <em>Wellman, supra, </em>construed almost identical \u201cdefinition of insured\u201d and \u201cowner-agent\u201d exclusion clauses in the same fashion as <em>Trinity. </em>496 F.2d at 136.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Under <em>Trinity </em>and <em>Wellman </em>when provisions [4] and [5] are read together, it is clear that the exclusion applies only to agents or employees of the owner (JRJ) who are <em>not </em>employees of the named insured \u2014 ITS in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Coming around full circle, the lease which, pursuant to ICC regulations, mandated that Williamson be under the control of ITS, established that the driver was a permissive user within Underwriters provision [4]. Underwriters conceded at oral argument \u2014 without risking any possible reflection on professional competence \u2014 that an insurer cannot subrogate against its own insured and <em>Trinity </em>so held. As stated in <em>American Surety Co. v. Canal Ins. Co., </em>4 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 934, 937, there is no right of subrogation where an insurance company, in derogation of its contract, seeks to be subrogated in the right of its <em>named </em>assured against an <em>additional </em>insured under the omnibus clause, for the additional insured, except as limited in the contract, is entitled to the same protection as the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Finally, Underwriters argues that under Georgia law,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> where liability policies issued to the owner and driver of a vehicle each covers an injury, and one or both policies contain an excess insurance clause pertaining to nonownership coverage, the policy issued to the owner is held to be the primary policy, the insurer being liable up to the limits of the policy without apportionment. According to this theory, only after the primary policy has been exhausted is there recourse to the policy providing nonownership coverage. In support of this contention, Underwriters cites the well-rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>soned opinion of Judge Hall in <em>Chicago Ins. Co. v. American Southern Ins. Co., </em>1967,115 Ga.App. 799, 156 S.E.2d 143. However, the facts in that case differ vastly from those before us. In <em>Chicago, </em>the accident occurred while the owner was a passenger in his own car, the driver having operated the car with the owner\u2019s permission. The driver\u2019s and the owner\u2019s policies contained \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions. The Georgia Court held that the <em>owner </em>seeking damages for his injuries from the driver could look to his own insurer for primary coverage up to the limits of the policy. Once that policy was exhausted, the driver\u2019s insurer was liable up to the limits of its policy. <em>Chicago </em>is thus plainly inapposite as is clear from <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Holton, </em>1974, 131 Ga.App. 247, 205 S.E.2d 872, 874, which stated the Georgia rule which is applicable to the present facts: where both insurers attempt to limit their liability to excess coverage if there is other insurance, \"then the clauses are irreconcilable, cancel each other out, and the liability is to be divided equally between them\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The District Court correctly relied on <em>Bradshaw v.

The District Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>Simmons v. King, </em>478 F.2d 857 (5th Cir. 1973), held that an ICC certificated carrier, as is I.T.S., must assume liability for the actions and negligence of a driver operating a vehicle under its certificate of authority. That obligation is imposed by 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1057.4 which mandates the inclusion of certain provisions in the lease agreement and creates a statutory employment relationship between driver and carrier. The required lease provision which is contained in the lease agreement in question recites that for the duration of the lease the leased equipment is \u201cin the exclusive possession, control and use of the lessee . . . \u201d Consequently, Williamson\u2019s admittedly authorized use of the vehicle in question must, of necessity, have been with the permission of I.T.S. and the Underwriters policy, by its terms, covers Amos Williamson.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">Order of Court, at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b373-16\">. 7 Cir., 1962, 309 F.2d 283.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b373-17\">. The parties, by going to court before a merits determination was reached in the Smith action, have forced us to assume, or at least that we may assume that they assume that Williamson was negligent for all purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b373-18\">. Carolina has abandoned the position taken below (see note 10, <em>supra </em>and accompanying text) that Williamson was not an additional insured under the terms of the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b373-19\">. The District Court did not expressly address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">. Section 215 of the Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 315 provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u00a7 315. Security for protection of public</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">No certificate or permit shall be issued to a motor carrier or remain in force, unless such carrier complies with such reasonable rules and regulations as the Commission shall prescribe governing the filing and approval of surety bonds, policies of insurance, qualifications as a self-insurer or other securities or agreements, in such reasonable amount as the Commission may require, conditioned to pay, within the amount of such surety bonds, policies of insurance, qualifications as a self-insurer or other securities or agreements, any final judgment recovered against such motor carrier for bodily injuries to or the death of any person resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles under such certificate or permit, or for loss or damage to property of others. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1043.1(a) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no common or contract carrier subject to Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act shall engage in interstate or foreign commerce, and no certificate or permit shall be issued to such a carrier or remain in force unless and until there shall have been filed with and accepted by the Commission a surety bond, certificate of insurance, proof of qualifications as a self-insurer, or other securities or agreements, in the amounts prescribed in \u00a7 1043.2, conditioned to pay any final judgment recovered against such motor carrier for bodily injuries to or the death of any person resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance or use of motor vehicles in transportation subject to Part II, Interstate Commerce Act, or for loss of or damage to property of others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b374-15\">. That endorsement, ICC form BMC 90, reads in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">Within the limits of liability hereinafter provided it is further understood and agreed that no condition, provision, stipulation, or limitation contained in the policy, or any other endorsement thereon or violation thereof, or of this endorsement, by the insured, shall relieve the Company from liability hereunder or from the payment of any such final judgment, irrespective of the financial responsibility or lack thereof or insolvency or bankruptcy of the insured. However, all terms, conditions, and limitations in the policy to which this endorsement is attached are to remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the Company, and the insured agrees to reimburse the Company for any payment made by the Company on account of any accident, claim, or suit involving a breach of the terms of the policy, and for any payment that the Company would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy except for the agreement contained in this endorsement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b375-24\">. The holding that Ringsby-lessee (in the position of ITS here) was an additional insured under the Carolina-lessor policy does not control the present case because that Carolina policy did not contain the Long Haul Truckmen endorsement provision [2]. See note 22, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b377-6\">. Counsel for Carolina admitted at oral argument that both insurers \u2014 Carolina and Underwriters \u2014 filed certificates of insurance with the ICC on behalf of their respective insureds, JRJ and ITS. Thus, it is possible to assume that both policies contain the ICC endorsement. Because of the result we reach, it is unnecessary to consider what effect, if any, such an assumption would have on the outcome.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\">. For example, Mrs. Smith would be in a position to assert such policy grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\">. As noted earlier, the District Court held that ITS was not an additional insured under Carolina\u2019s policy because of the Long Haul Truck-men\u2019s endorsement [2]. The District Court cited no authority to support this holding, but it was unquestionably correct. <em>See, e. g., Wellman v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 8 </em>Cir., 1974, 496 F.2d 131, 137-39; <em>Pacific Intermountain Express Co. v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>7 Cir., 1966, 359 F.2d 735. <em>Cf. Transport Ins. Co. v. Manufacturers Casualty Ins. Co., </em>E.D.Ark., 1964, 226 F.Supp. 251, 256, <em>aff\u2019d </em>sub nom. <em>Pacific Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Transport Ins. Co., </em>8 Cir., 1965, 341 F.2d 514 (Truckmen\u2019s endorsement excluded others except employees of lessor).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b377-13\">. See note 12, <em>supra </em>for the District Court\u2019s precise holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b377-14\">. <em>Simmons </em>did not involve <em>insurance </em>issues at all. That case was concerned only with the liability of the lessee (operating under an ICC certificate) for the acts of the driver in the negligence action which the injured party had brought against the driver, the lessor, and the lessee. Thus, while the driver\u2019s statutory employee status in <em>Simmons </em>created vicarious liability, no issue was before the Court as to whether the driver was an additional insured under the lessee\u2019s policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b378-5\">. Underwriters looks to <em>Float-Away Door Co. v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>5 Cir., 1966, 372 F.2d 701, as authority for the proposition that we should give effect to the \u201cnonownership excess only\u201d provision [6] whereby even if Williamson was an additional insured under the ITS policy, such coverage would not be primary but excess only. But <em>Float-Away </em>provides no help to Underwriters. Apart from several other salient factual distinctions, <em>both </em>policies at issue in <em>Float-Away </em>contained the same \u201cnonownership excess only\u201d clause and the nonowner in that case was an additional insured under the owner\u2019s policy. Thus, the owner\u2019s policy was considered primary. Here ITS was not an additional insured under Carolina\u2019s policy. <em>See </em>note 22, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b378-10\">. Under the lease agreement, Georgia law was to apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">. At oral argument, counsel for <em>Carolina </em>sought to distinguish <em>Bradshaw </em>on the ground that it was a non-ICC situation. This effort was made in connection with the assertion that the Underwriters policy was primary as a matter of law. We have rejected this position. The fact that <em>Bradshaw </em>did not involve an ICC carrier is of no consequence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
