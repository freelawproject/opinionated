ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-21\">SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</p>\n<p id=\"b701-22\">We have examined assiduously the arguments advanced in the Commission\u2019s petition for rehearing and adhere fully to our decision in these cases. Because, however, of several facets of the Commission\u2019s position on rehearing, these additional comments are indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b701-24\">We would have thought it ever so clear that we did not hold, as the Commission insists, \u201cthat procedural due process issues may not be withdrawn from judicial review.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To dispel that misapprehension, we need but refer readers to the relevant portion of our <em>Ralpho </em>opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To reiterate, the narrow conclusion we actually reached was simply that the finality provision of the Micronesian Claims Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not, when measured by the standards articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson v. Robison,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>extend so far as to preclude review of claims drawing sustenance from the Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find in the petition for rehearing no cause to modify our view on that score.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-25\">Nor, unlike the Commission, do we think the canon of construction enunciated in <em>Johnson </em>comes into play only when an alleged constitutional violation impairs \u201cextremely significant\u201d personal interests\u2014 however they may be defined \u2014 and not when it visits less critical injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>cept underlying this interpretive rule is that Congress would not lightly place constitutional claims beyond the pale of judicial review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That predicate is hardly divested of force simply because the resulting harm is of little consequence in the eyes of some.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The Commission argues also that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Morris v. </em>Gressette<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and <em>Briscoe v. </em>Bell<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> radically alter preexisting law controlling adjudications as to whether an agency\u2019s patent departure from statutory mandates is subject to judicial review. We do not agree. <em>Morris </em>and <em>Briscoe </em>both involved the amenability to review of determinations entrusted to the Attorney General by the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In each case, the Court presumed that his actions were reviewablc absent \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that Congress contemplated otherwise.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Inquiring into that body\u2019s likely purposes,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Court concluded that any review of the Attorney General\u2019s determinations would seriously hamper implementation of the legislative scheme.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court stressed, moreover, that a ban on review <em>vel non </em>would not foreclose independent judicial scrutiny of legal questions to which the Attorney General had addressed himself, albeit the form of proceeding would change.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Faced with this calculus, the Court construed the statute as a preclusion of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-18\">In the cases <em>sub judice, </em>we have assessed the import of the finality provision of the Micronesian Claims Act by the very same standard applied by the Supreme Court in <em>Morris </em>and <em>Briscoe.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We have found that little legislative attention was directed to that provision<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that no legislative purpose would be impaired by limited judicial review.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Unlike <em>Morris </em>and <em>Briscoe </em>\u2014 but like <em>Leedom </em>v. Kyne,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>upon which we relied \u2014 the situation here is such that if review is not available to appellants now, their substantive rights will go forever unredressed. No more at this moment than earlier are we able to discern in this context \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that Congress intended that the Commission might disregard plain statutory norms without accountability someday in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The Commission also attributes \u201csevere, adverse consequences\u201d to our interpretation of the Micronesian Claims Act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The problem to which it adverts stems from exhaustion of the fund established for satisfaction of Micronesian claims,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and that in turn resulted directly from administrative indisposition to await judicial resolution of the substantial and complex issues emerging in these cases. From the inception of Ralpho\u2019s suit on September 20, 1974, it had been known that the Commission\u2019s ex parte resort to a value study in setting the amount of his award was under severe attack. The onset of Melong\u2019s action on April 1, 1975, gave notice of his contention that statutory mandates respecting the elements of an appropriate award had not been observed. The gravity of the charges in both cases could hardly have failed to generate an acute awareness that the awards to these claimants might have to be adjusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">By an order entered October 13, 1976, we called upon the parties to submit memoran-da addressing a series of questions, some of which inquired specifically as to the status of the fund. Until November 17, 1976, when the Commission filed a post-argument memorandum in <em>Ralpho, </em>$4,887,736 of the fund available for payment of claims under the Act remained unspent.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As late as February 7,1977, when we entered an order directing that <em>Melong </em>be submitted without oral argument, we had no information that the fund would not accommodate the contingencies posed by the two cases.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Only upon the filing of the petition for rehearing on April 27, following rendition of our decisions on March 29, did we learn that the Secretary of the Interior had at some undisclosed time disbursed the entire balance of the fund. We do not know what sort of liaison, if any, on the course of the litigation was maintained between the Commission and the Secretary. What we do know is that the responsibility for coordination was not ours.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-15\">The petition for rehearing is</p>\n<p id=\"b703-16\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-12\">.
