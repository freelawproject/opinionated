We are presented with issues concerning the capacity of various entities to recover on the construction contract, the liability of the contractor, and the measure and certainty of damages. Because the capacity issues center upon a byzantine series of transactions, it is necessary to set out the relevant facts in a fairly detailed manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-16\">I. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b153-17\">In October 1968, the property upon which the motel is located belonged to Somerset Properties Joint Venture (Joint Venture), whose principals were John H. Safer and Stephen A. Winkelman. On October 10, 1968, Joint Venture entered into a lease agreement with Chevy Chase Motel Associates (Chevy Chase), under which Joint Venture agreed to construct and lease a motel and related facilities<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Chevy Chase for twenty-one years with two consecutive renewal options of twenty-one years each.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-18\">By contract dated February 11, 1969, Winkelman and Safer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> agreed to sell the property to the Winthrop Lawrence Corporation (Winthrop) and Lammot DuPont Copeland, Jr. By deed dated April 11,1969, Winkelman and Safer granted the property to Winthrop. Winthrop gave back a deed of trust and a note<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> guaranteed by Cope<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>land. Winthrop granted the property to Copeland by deed dated the same day.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In April 1969, Donohoe Construction Co., Inc. (Donohoe) began construction of the motel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On May 6, 1969, before any of the deeds of April 11, 1969, had been recorded, Winthrop signed a standard form, stipulated sum AIA construction contract for the motel complex with Donohoe. Once again, Copeland acted as Winthrop\u2019s guarantor. The contract price was $3.4 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">On May 7, 1969, the deed from Winkel-man and Safer to Winthrop was recorded. On June 30, 1969, the deed from Winthrop to Copeland was recorded. On August 26, 1970, Copeland filed a declaration of trust indicating that the property was being held fifty percent for himself and fifty percent for Thomas Shaheen.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Copeland filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy arrangement on October 20, 1970, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Winthrop filed similarly on November 10, 1970, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Chevy Chase received occupancy of part of the motel in January 1971, and of the remainder no later than May 1971. On May 5, 1971, Donohoe filed a mechanic\u2019s lien against the property, the principal of which was $184,419.46.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the same day, pursuant to a private power of sale in the trust deed given to Winkelman and Safer dated April 11, 1969, the property was sold at foreclosure to Financial Underwriters, Ltd. (Financial).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The sale was ratified by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, on June 18, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-16\">On July 19,1971, Financial assigned all of its right, title, and interest in the property to the Somerset Properties Limited Partnership (Limited Partnership).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Five days later, on July 24,1971, Limited Partnership, the trustees, and Financial deeded fee simple title to the Peoples Life Insurance Company (Peoples). Peoples leased the land back to the Limited Partnership for fifty years on August 16, 1971, and gave the Limited Partnership a quitclaim deed to the improvements. Two days later, Limited Partnership paid the lien of Donohoe in the total amount of $205,079.58.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-17\">Certain damage claims developed in connection with the construction of the motel, most notably with respect to the wall coverings in the halls and rooms, the riser pipes, and water spots on various ceilings. Wink-elman and Safer, on behalf of Joint Venture and Limited Partnership, brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>suit<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> against Chevy Chase and Donohoe on November 30, 1972, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief with regard to a demand for arbitration by Chevy Chase against Joint Venture under an arbitration clause in the lease of October 10, 1968. In the alternative, the complaint asked that Dono-hoe be brought into the arbitration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The complaint was amended to seek damages from Donohoe for breach of the construction contract of May 6, 1969. Chevy Chase cross-claimed against Donohoe for breach of the construction contract, predicating its claim on a third-party beneficiary theory. Chevy Chase, Joint Venture, and Limited Partnership were aligned to oppose Donohoe. It was in this posture that the case proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Donohoe moved for summary judgment, and, in the alternative, for judgment on the pleadings against both plaintiffs and against cross-claimant Chevy Chase. The trial judge granted Donohoe\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Chevy Chase and Joint Venture. Memorandum and Order of Sept. 13, 1973, Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 85-89; Memorandum and Order of Oct. 30, 1973, J.A. at 90-95. Both Chevy Chase and Joint Venture appeal, each urging that it was a third-party beneficiary capable of maintaining suit on the construction contract. The trial judge denied Donohoe\u2019s motion with respect to Limited Partnership, ruling that Limited Partnership was the \u201csuccessor-in-interest\u201d of Winthrop. Memorandum and Order of Sept. 13, 1973, J.A. at 85-89; Memorandum and Order of Oct. 30, 1973, J.A. at 90-95. On appeal, Dono-hoe argues that Limited Partnership has no such status.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">On the eve of trial, Donohoe renewed its motion for summary judgment against Limited Partnership based upon \u201cnewly discovered\u201d facts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial judge denied Donohoe\u2019s renewed summary judgment motion. Memorandum and Order of Nov. 19, 1974, J.A. at 99-103. Donohoe appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">The case was tried without a jury. The district court awarded Limited Partnership a total of $68,000: $47,500 in connection with the vinyl wall coverings, $17,000 in connection with the water leak damage, and $3,500 in connection with a missing electrical thermostat and chiller interlock. Memorandum Opinion and Order of Nov. 27, 1974, J.A. at 104-14. Donohoe appeals these damage awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">Limited Partnership was denied an award based on the substitution of stainless steel for copper pipes in the risers, and it appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">11. JOINT VENTURE AND CHEVY CHASE AS THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT</p>\n<p id=\"b155-17\">Section 7.1.1<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the construction contract states that the contract is to be construed in accordance with the law of the place where the building is located,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and it is well-established under Maryland law that certain third-party beneficiaries may maintain suit on a contract and that strict privity of contract is not always a prerequisite to enforcing contractual rights. <em>Small v. Schaefer, </em>24 Md. 143, 158-59 (1866); <em>accord, Sterling v. Cushwa &amp; Sons, </em>170 Md. 226, 236, 183 A. 593, 597 (1936); <em>MacKenzie v. Schorr, </em>151 Md. 1, 8, 133 A. 821, 823-24 (1926); <em>Northern Central Railway Co. v. United Railways &amp; Electric Co., </em>105 Md. 345, 363-64, 66 A. 444, 449-50 (1907). Maryland has adopted the definitions of donee beneficiary, creditor beneficiary, and incidental beneficiary from Restatement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Contracts \u00a7 133 (1932).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Marlboro Shirt Co. v. American District Telegraph Co., </em>196 Md. 565, 569-70, 77 A.2d 776, 777-78 (1951); <em>accord, Spates v. Spates, </em>267 Md. 72, 77, 296 A.2d 581, 584 (1972). A non-incidental third-party beneficiary may recover from the promisor under appropriate circumstances, even where the third party is not specifically referred to in the contract. <em>Marlboro Shirt Co. v. American District Telegraph Co., </em>196 Md. at 571, 77 A.2d at 778. However, in order to recover as a third-party creditor beneficiary, a party must show that he was clearly intended to be the primary party in interest, to be the real promisee, to be privy to the promise. <em>MacKubin v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., </em>190 Md. 52, 57-58, 57 A.2d 318, 321 (1948); <em>accord, Hamilton &amp; Spiegel, Inc. v. Board of Education, </em>233 Md. 196, 199-200, 195 A.2d 710, 711-12 (1963); <em>Marlboro Shirt Co. v. American District Telegraph Co., </em>196 Md. at 569-71, 77 A.2d at 777-78. Where the third-party beneficiary is not named in the contract, the \u201cintent\u201d of the contract is to be garnered from the facts and circumstances surrounding its formation. <em>Marlboro Shirt Co. v. American District Telegraph Co., </em>196 Md. at 571, 77 A.2d at 778. In determining the \u201cintent\u201d of the contract, predominant consideration is given to the intent of the promisee. See <em>Shillman v. Hobstetter, </em>249 Md. 678, 689-90, 241 A.2d 570, 576 (1968) (quoting 4 Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 776 (2nd ed. 1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Applying these legal principles to the case at bar, we must affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing Joint Venture and Chevy Chase. The district court stated the applicable law succinctly and correctly: \u201cThe party asserting such status [third-party intended creditor beneficiary] must establish not only that the contract in question satisfied a duty owed to it by one of the contracting parties, but also that the satisfaction of that duty was the primary objective of the contract.\u201d Memorandum and Order of Oct. 30, 1973, J.A. at 93; <em>see German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Home </em>Water <em>Supply Co., </em>226 U.S. 220, 230, 33 S.Ct. 32, 57 L.Ed. 195 (1912); <em>Ogden Development Corp. v. Federal Insurance Corp., </em>508 F.2d 583, 587-88, 587 n.17 (2nd Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">We shall consider Joint Venture\u2019s assertions first, as they may be disposed of expeditiously. Joint Venture has two basic contentions. First, it maintains that, by virtue of the deed of trust of April 11,1969, it retained an equitable interest in the property and, by extension, in the development of the property. Brief for Appellees at 49. Second, it intimates that its direct dealings with Donohoe somehow confer the necessary third-party beneficiary status. Id. at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">In our view, both of these arguments miss the point. Nowhere in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>pleadings, subsequent submissions, or brief does Joint Venture sufficiently articulate a specific duty owed to it by Winthrop. The burden at this stage was upon Joint Venture to establish such a duty. Joint Venture failed to discharge this burden. Not only did Joint Venture fail to satisfy the <em>Mackubin </em>\u201cprincipal purpose\u201d test, but it failed to meet the threshold \u201cduty\u201d test of the Restatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The bald assertion that Joint Venture retained an equitable interest in the property and its development is not equivalent to an assertion of a real or supposed legal duty. Many individuals and organizations undoubtedly had an interest in the successful completion of the motel. These individuals and organizations, like Joint Venture, are beneficiaries of the construction contract. However, they are only incidental beneficiaries. Incidental beneficiaries acquire no right to recover for breach of a contract. <em>Bolick v. Board of Education, </em>256 Md. 180, 185, 260 A.2d 81, 33 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Similarly, the fact of extensive direct dealings with Donohoe is not legally sufficient to confer the necessary status on Joint Venture. The issue is not Donohoe\u2019s ongoing relations with Joint Venture, but Joint Venture\u2019s relation to the Winthrop-Donohoe contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Chevy Chase presents us with only a slightly more complicated problem. It urges that Winthrop, in entering the construction contract of May 6, 1969, was fulfilling a duty to construct the motel and related facilities, a duty found in the lease agreement of October 10, 1968. The district court summarized the arguments of Chevy Chase:</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">[TJhere can be no doubt that Donohoe knew that Winthrop planned to lease the motel complex to a Holiday Inn franchisee. In all likelihood, Donohoe also knew that such a lease was already in existence, that Chevy Chase was the designated lessee, that as such it had participated extensively in the preparation of the plans for the complex, and that any delay or deficiencies in construction would injure Chevy Chase Associates as well as the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">These factors, however, do not suffice to establish third-party beneficiary status.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Memorandum and Order of Sept. 13, 1973, J.A. at 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Once again, we are in complete agreement with the district court. As the trial judge suggested, the key is not Donohoe\u2019s knowledge, nor Chevy Chase\u2019s participation, but whether the clear intent of the prom-isee, Winthrop, as reflected by the surrounding facts and circumstances, was to make Chevy Chase the real promisee. From our examination of the record, we believe that Chevy Chase has not demonstrated the likelihood of its being able to prove such an intent. Even in its brief, Chevy Chase is able to do little more than proffer allegations relating to its past relations with Donohoe, its participation in the ongoing construction, its role in assisting Winthrop in its selection of Donohoe, and its arrangements with Joint Venture. Brief for Appellees at 46-49. Chevy Chase failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that Winthrop\u2019s primary objective in entering the contract with Donohoe was to satisfy its duty under the lease of October 10, 1968. There is no adequate demonstration that Chevy Chase was the real promisee. With regard to its third-party beneficiary claim, Chevy Chase has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact, and Donohoe is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P.. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">This result, in our view, comports with precedent and with logic. In <em>Marlboro Shirt, </em>the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that a tenant could not maintain suit on a contract between his landlord and a contractor. <em>Accord, </em>2 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 402 (3d ed. 1968). <em>See also Swift Lumber &amp; Fuel Co. v. Hock, </em>124 Neb. 30, 245 N.W. 3 (1932). <em>Greenlees v. Owens Ames Kimball Co., </em>340 Mich. 670, 66 N.W.2d 227, 46 A.L. R.2d 1205 (1954), is clearly distinguishable on the ground that the duty owed to the tenant was mentioned with specificity in the contract between the landlord and the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Further, in our case, the fact that Chevy Chase is not mentioned in the construction contract is itself probative in interpreting the facts. In view of Maryland precedent, especially <em>Marlboro Shirt, </em>and in view of the large amounts involved in this contract, it is highly probable that the parties would have given some indication in the contract itself if Chevy Chase had been intended to acquire the right to maintain an action on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">III. LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AS SUCCESSOR OF WINTHROP</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The district court found that Limited Partnership had the capacity to recover on the construction contract because Limited Partnership was the \u201csuccessor-in-interest\u201d of Winthrop. Although we agree with the result, we reach it by a route different than that chosen by the district court. The basic theory of the district court is that the right to enforce the construction contract is ancillary to the ownership of the property. Memorandum and Order of Nov. 19, 1974, J.A. at 101. As we comprehend the theory, the holder of the deed of trust is an alternative possessor of this right, but his right is inchoate until it matures at foreclosure. The foreclosure purchaser (here, Financial) will obtain the right and may transfer it. Presumably, the right attaches to the ownership of the improvements, and not to the title of the underlying land, since Limited Partnership was held to have capacity to recover on the construction contract even after the transaction between Limited Partnership and Peoples was disclosed to the district court. <em>See id., </em>J.A. at 99-103; Brief for Appellant at 18-19; Reply Brief of Appellant and Cross-Appellee at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We must confess that we have been unable to locate any Maryland precedent that squarely supports or contradicts the district court\u2019s assertions that the intangible right to enforce the contract belongs to the owner of the underlying property, or that such right is held inchoate by the holder of a deed of trust. The theory of the district court is not that Limited Partnership succeeds directly to the right of Winthrop to sue on the contract to which Winthrop is a party. Rather, the district court holds that Limited Partnership succeeds to the rights of Joint Venture, the rights having passed through Financial. Memorandum and Order of Nov. 19, 1974, J.A. at 101. The premise is that, under the circumstances of this case, the owner of the property has the right to enforce a construction contract for the building located on his premises, although he is not in privity of contract with the promisor/contractor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The basic Maryland rule is that privity of contract is a prerequisite for recovery on that contract. <em>Hand v. Evans Marble Co., </em>88 Md. 226, 40 A. 899 (1898); <em>accord, Levy v. Glens Falls Indemnity Co., </em>210 Md. 265, 123 A.2d 348 (1956); <em>Crane Ice Cream Co. v. Terminal Freezing &amp; Heating Co., </em>147 Md. 588, 128 A. 280, 39 A.L.R. 1184 (1925). Although there have been certain obvious relaxations in this rule (e. <em>g., </em>third-party beneficiaries), we are not able to find a relaxation or exception that adequately supports the theory of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">Joint Venture was not a party to the construction contract. The fact that Limited Partnership may have succeeded to its rights through Financial, does not, in our view, control this case. We do not deal with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Limited Partnership is the successor of Joint Venture, because we are not persuaded that Joint Venture had any right to which Limited Partnership could succeed. The question is not whether Limited Partnership succeeded Joint Venture, but whether Limited Partnership succeeded Winthrop.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Section 7.2.1 of the construction contract provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe owner and the contractor each binds himself, his partners, successors, assigns, and legal representatives to the other party hereto and to the partners, successors, assigns, and legal representatives of such other party in respect to all covenants, agreements and obligations contained in the Contract Documents. . . .\u201d Thus, Donohoe, as contractor, not only binds its own successors to Winthrop, <em>but binds itself to the successors </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>of Winthrop. </em>The threshold question is thus whether Limited Partnership is a successor to Winthrop within the meaning of the contract and under Maryland law. We answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The word \u201csuccessor\u201d is not defined in the contract itself, nor can we find it adequately defined in Maryland precedent. We therefore must look outside of these sources to gather its meaning under Maryland law and in the expectation of the parties. Initially, we note that it is a word with many legal applications and that it is therefore difficult to define precisely. Recognizing this difficulty, Mr. Justice Marshall once remarked, \u201cThere is, and can be, no single definition of \u2018successor\u2019 which is applicable in every legal context.\u201d <em>Howard Johnson Co. v. Hotel Employees, </em>417 U.S. 249, 263 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. 2236, 2243, 41 L.Ed.2d 46 (1974). <em>See also Dynamic Machine Co. v. NLRB, </em>552 F.2d 1195, 1204 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied-U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 103, 54 L.Ed.2d 85 (1977); <em>United States v. B. F. Sturtevant Co., </em>99 F.2d 72, 73-74 (1st Cir. 1938). To determine the meaning of \u201csuccessor\u201d in the area of labor law, Mr. Justice Marshall appears to endorse a case-by-case approach with emphasis on the facts of each case. 417 U.S. at 256, 262-63 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. 2236. The same fact-oriented approach has also been employed by courts in defining the limits of purely contractual successorship.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Van Deusen </em>v. <em>Ruth, </em>343 Mo. 1096, 1103, 125 S.W.2d 1, 4 (1938); <em>Thompson v. North Texas National Bank, </em>37 S.W.2d 735, 739 (Tex.Com.App.1931); <em>see Hand v. Evans Marble Co., </em>88 Md. at 229-31, 40 A. at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">In the non-labor contractual cases, \u201csuccessor\u201d has often been defined as \u201cone who takes the place that another has left, and sustains the like part or character.\u201d Wa-<em>wak Co. v. Kaiser, </em>90 F.2d 694, 697 (7th Cir. 1937); <em>Citizens Suburban Co. v. Rosemont Development Co., </em>244 Cal.App.2d 666, 676, 53 Cal.Rptr. 551, 557 (1966); <em>Van Deusen v. Ruth, </em>343 Mo. at 1103, 125 S.W.2d at 4; <em>Thompson v. North Texas National Bank, </em>37 S.W.2d at 739; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1600 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). The definition goes beyond the borders of contract assignment and is used so as to obviate the need for express assumption of burdens. <em>Citizens Suburban Co. v. Rosemont Development Co., </em>244 Cal.App.2d at 676, 53 Cal. Rptr. at 557. From an analysis of the facts of this case, it seems to us that with respect both to the construction contract itself and to the larger contractual framework, Limited Partnership \u201ctook the place\u201d that Winthrop \u201chad left\u201d and \u201csustained the like part or character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Focusing first on the construction contract itself, the basic obligation of Donohoe was to construct a motel. The basic obligation of Winthrop was to pay the contract sum of $3,400,000. Plaintiff\u2019s and Cross-claimant\u2019s Exhibit 3. When Winthrop could no longer meet its obligation on the contract and the deed of trust, the property was sold at foreclosure. Limited Partnership, as the assignee of the foreclosure purchaser, paid Donohoe\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien in full. Of the $205,079.58, $184,419.46 represented the unpaid balance due on the original contract price, exclusive of any interest or other miscellaneous charges. Under the construction contract, it was the \u201cpart\u201d of Winthrop to pay money. It was Limited Partnership who ultimately completed this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>obligation. Thus, with respect to the very obligations created by the construction contract itself, Limited Partnership occupied the place that Winthrop abdicated. Not only did Limited Partnership \u201csustain the like part\u201d as Winthrop, it sustained the very <em>same </em>part as Winthrop.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The facts of the larger milieu in which the actors were operating also militate in favor of Limited Partnership\u2019s \u201csuccessor-ship\u201d status. At the time of the construction contract, Winthrop was not the record owner of the property, nor was it the actual owner. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 16. It was an assignee of the lease of October 10, 1968. Memorandum and Order of Sept. 13, 1973, J.A. at 86; Reply Brief of Appellant and Cross-Appellee at 9. Thus, with regard to the underlying asset, the motel, Winthrop had a double obligation. On one hand, it assumed the lease agreement with Chevy Chase: on the other, it paid Donohoe on the construction contract. With regard to the underlying asset, we can see that Limited Partnership \u201csustained the like part or character\u201d and had a nearly identical interest. <em>See John Wiley &amp; Sons v. Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 551, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964). After foreclosure and the transaction with Peoples, Limited Partnership did not have a fee interest in the underlying land. Nevertheless, as Do-nohoe points out, Chevy Chase was a subtenant of Limited Partnership pursuant to the lease of October 10, 1968. Brief for Appellant at 19. As discussed above, Limited Partnership dealt with Donohoe in the same role as Winthrop with regard to the construction contract. Thus, there is a high degree of similarity in role and interest between Winthrop and Limited Partnership. Under the facts presented by this case, therefore, we hold that Limited Partnership was the successor of Winthrop.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Donohoe contends that the bankruptcy trustee, by operation of federal bankruptcy law, has acquired all rights of action belonging to Winthrop under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(a)(6) (1970). Brief for Appellant at 23. In the case at bar, however, Limited Partnership is not attempting to pursue a right of action belonging to Winthrop, but rather is attempting to pursue a right of action of its own under Maryland law and section 7.2.1 of the construction contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">It can be seen by an examination of the contract itself that, in the rather commonplace event of bankruptcy, the contract does not contemplate the bankruptcy trustee by use of the word \u201csuccessor\u201d in section 7.2.1. Section 7.6.1 states: \u201cThe duties and obligations imposed by the Contract Documents, and the rights and remedies available thereunder shall be in addition to and not a limitation of any duties, obligations, rights and remedies otherwise imposed or available by law.\u201d To the extent that the rights of the bankruptcy trustee are available, they are available by operation of federal law. Further, section 14.-2.1<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> allows the owner to terminate the employment of the contractor if the contractor is adjudged a bankrupt. If the bankruptcy trustee were intended to be the \u201csuccessor\u201d under the contract, section 7.2.1 would have no force when read with section 7.6.1, and would be clearly inconsistent with section 14.2.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Where, as here, a party has bound himself by contract to the \u201csuccessor\u201d of another, and a third person is clearly the \u201csuccessor\u201d of the other, common sense would seem to dictate that the \u201csuccessor\u201d could defeat the privity defense of the promisor merely by pointing to the very words of the contract. As we are attempting to follow Maryland law, however, we cannot blithely assume this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">A leading Maryland case in the area of contractual successorship is <em>Hand </em>v. <em>Evans Marble Co. </em>In that case, the court denied contractual recovery to the plaintiff, an as-signee of one party to a contract, against defendant, a successor to the other party to the same contract. In that case, the defendant\u2019s lack of privity defense prevailed. However, there are a number of important differences between <em>Hand </em>and the case at bar. First and foremost, no consideration moved from the plaintiff to the defendant in that case. This is, of course, completely unlike our own case where a substantial sum was paid by the plaintiff to the defendant. The court in <em>Hand </em>recognized that this was not only an important factor, but determinative:</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">So, also, where defendants, who had been in the habit of dealing with B., sent a written order for goods, directed to B.; the plaintiff, who on that day had bought B.\u2019s business, executed the order without notice to defendants. It was held that plaintiff could not maintain an action for the price of the goods against the defendant; Bramwell, B., saying: \u201cAs to the difficulty that the defendants need not pay anybody, I do not see why they should, unless they have made a contract, either express or implied.\u201d [Citation omitted] <em>If, in that case, defendants had accepted the goods with knowledge of the facts, doubtless they would have been held liable </em>upon an implied assumpsit.</p>\n<p id=\"Amo\">88 Md. at 230, 40 A. at 900 (emphasis added). So, it appears to us, that even eighty years ago, an acceptance of a successor\u2019s counterperformance with knowledge would be sufficient to bind a promisor. There can be no doubt that these two elements have been fulfilled in the facts of the instant case. Donohoe accepted the counterperfor-mance of Limited Partnership by accepting payment. Further, it cannot be doubted that Donohoe knew that it was accepting payment from someone other than Winthrop, the original party to the contract. Indeed, by filing the mechanic\u2019s lien, Dono-hoe was inviting the performance of someone other than the bankrupt Winthrop or its trustee. It seems to us that Donohoe was actually seeking a successor to assume the role of Winthrop under the construction contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">It is important to realize that, in the hypothetical situation contained in the passage from <em>Hand </em>set out above, the successor acquired his rights through a theory of rescission and subsequent implied contract. 88 Md. at 229, 40 A. at 900. This hypothetical situation substitutes a party purely by operation of law. We need not resort to operation of law: we need only give effect to the words of section 7.2.1 of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Finally, it is important to recall the posture in which the claim of \u201csuccessorship\u201d arises. As in the labor successorship cases noted previously, <em>Hand </em>involves an action against an alleged successor based upon an undertaking entered into by his predecessor. The law is, of course, reluctant to cast burdens upon a \u201csuccessor\u201d who may not have agreed to accept them. Nonetheless, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Roberts v. Gates, </em>24 Md.App. 374, 330 A.2d 705 (1975), has upheld such \u201cbootstrapping\u201d of a \u201csuccessor\u201d as an alternative theory of recovery, although the court questioned the essential wisdom of allowing it. We reiterate that our case does not involve \u201cbootstrapping\u201d a successor with contractual responsibility: our case involves the liability of an original party <em>to </em>a successor. If an original party can bind a successor, it seems to us that, <em>a fortiori, </em>a successor should be able to bind an original party. In the case at bar, we need not fear casting an unbar-gained and unexpected obligation on Limited Partnership because there is no allegation that Winthrop\u2019s obligation has not been <em>completely </em>discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The Maryland Court of Appeals has stated: \u201cIt is an ancient rule of the common law that a person who did not enter into a contract, or <em>succeed to the interest of those who did, </em>has no right of action for its breach, although he sustained damage thereby.\u201d <em>Levy v. Glens Falls Indemnity Co., </em>210 Md. at 270, 123 A.2d at 351 (emphasis added). We interpret this as an express affirmation of the principle that a proper successor may have a right of action against an original party. We therefore hold that Limited Partnership, as successor to Winthrop, has a right of action against Donohoe for breach of the construction contract of May 6, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">IV. DONOHOE\u2019S LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBSTITUTION OF STAINLESS STEEL FOR COPPER WATER PIPES</p>\n<p id=\"ai-dedup-0\">One of the major damage issues in this ease concerns the substitution of stainless steel for copper water risers. Donohoe admits that the contract calls for copper piping in the domestic water risers, that an unknown number of stainless steel risers were installed in place of the copper risers specified, that there were leaks in the stainless steel risers, and that Chevy Chase paid to have the leaks repaired. Reply Brief of Appellant and Cross-Appellee at 12. It is not contested that there was no written change order. Memorandum Opinion and Order of Nov. 27, 1974, J.A. at 107. The district court nevertheless found for Dono-hoe on this issue, holding that no written change order was necessary.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>J.A. at 107-10. We must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Article 12 of the construction contract governs changes in the work. There are two basic procedures contemplated. Sections 12.1.1<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and 12.1.2<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> govern major changes and contemplate written, formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Change Orders, generally to be signed by the owner. Section 12.3.1<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> governs minor changes and appears to us generally to contemplate written orders signed by the architect. Although there is some doubt as to which procedure governs this case, we need not reach this question. As the district court noted, if a written order were required by the contract, the contractual requirement was waived by the subsequent conduct of the parties. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">It is well-settled that Maryland law permits an implied waiver to a provision in a construction contract that requires written change orders. <em>Arc &amp; Gas Welder Associates v. Green Fuel Economizer Co., </em>285 F.2d 863, 868-69 (4th Cir. 1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>366 U.S. 919, 81 S.Ct. 1095, 6 L.Ed.2d 241 (1961); <em>Freeman v. Stanbern Construction Co., </em>205 Md. 71, 79, 106 A.2d 50, 55 (1954); <em>accord, Hoffman v. Glock, </em>20 Md.App. 284, 315 A.2d 551 (Ct.Spec.App. 1974). <em>See also United States v. Gilman, </em>360 F.Supp. 828 (D.Md.1973); <em>Sullivan v. Mosner, </em>266 Md. 479, 295 A.2d 482 (1972). An implied waiver will suffice to supplant a provision requiring written modification if it is made knowingly and proved by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Freeman v. Stanbern Construction Co., </em>205 Md. at 79, 106 A.2d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The district court found that Gordon, the architect, had given oral approval to the substitution and that Winthrop acquiesced in the substitution. From these facts, the district court inferred a waiver. Memorandum Opinion and Order of Nov. 27, 1974, J.A. at 109-10. Based upon our examination of the record, we believe that these findings are legally sufficient and factually correct. The diary entry of Marshall (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 7), the testimony, and Gordon\u2019s handwritten notation of approval on Marshall\u2019s letter dated March 6 (Plaintiff\u2019s and Crossclaimant\u2019s Exhibit 50) all provide evidence that Gordon had given his approval in March 1970. From these facts and from the testimony concerning the March 17 meeting, the district court could fairly imply a waiver from Winthrop.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Whether such a waiver took place is a question of fact. Of course, our review in questions of fact is necessarily limited: we are not to overturn a finding of fact unless it appears to us that it is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). With respect to this issue, we do not see \u201cerror,\u201d much less \u201cclear error.\u201d Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">V. THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">Donohoe, relying heavily on <em>Wentworth v. Air Line Pilots Association, </em>336 A.2d 542 (D.C.App.1975), urges that the proper measure of damages for injury to property which is sold is the diminution in value rather than the replacement cost. Brief for Appellant at 25; Reply Brief of Appellant and Cross-Appellee at 5-6. In our view, Donohoe\u2019s reliance is misplaced for two reasons. First, <em>Wentworth </em>involved damages for tortious injury. Clearly, damages for breach of a construction contract differ from damages in tort. Second, in <em>Went-worth, </em>the plaintiff had sold the land, and the court relied on the plaintiff\u2019s inability to make repairs in deciding upon the diminution in value measure for damages. 336 A.2d at 544. In our case, it is true that Limited Partnership sold the underlying property to Peoples. However, Limited Partnership, unlike the plaintiff in <em>Went-worth, </em>possesses a quitclaim deed to the improvements. It appears that Limited Partnership has not lost its ability to make repairs. Thus, the rationale behind <em>Went-worth </em>is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">The relevant Maryland rule appears to be that the plaintiff is entitled to replacement costs, unless it is impracticable or unreasonable to make the changes, in which case he is entitled to diminution in value. <em>Gilbert Construction Co. v. Gross, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>212 Md. 402, 411, 129 A.2d 518, 522 (1957); <em>accord, Sainato </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>222 Md. 263, 270, 159 A.2d 632, 636 (1960); 11 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 1363 (3d ed. 1968). <em>See generally </em>Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 346 (1932); <em>see also Baltimore Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association v. Gordon, </em>272 Md. 52, 58-60, 321 A.2d 157, 162 (1974); <em>Hooten v. Kenneth B. Mumaw Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., </em>271 Md. 565, 573-74, 318 A.2d 514, 518-19 (1974) ; <em>Correlli Roofing Co. v. National Instrument Co., </em>240 Md. 627, 632-33, 214 A.2d 919, 921-22 (1965); 5 Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 1089 (1964). With respect to the items of damage awarded, we cannot see a sufficient showing of impracticability to trigger the diminution in value measure. However, it appears that Donohoe relies principally on <em>Wentworth </em>and on the fact of the sale to Peoples to support its diminution in value argument. For the reasons stated above, we feel that <em>Wentworth </em>is inapposite to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">VI. THE DAMAGE FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"A01\">[12,13] This court has held that a damage award is a finding of fact governed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), and is not to be disturbed unless it is determined to be \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d. <em>Miles v. District of Columbia, </em>166 U.S.App.D.C. 235, 243, 510 F.2d 188, 196 (1975) . In order for us to make such a determination, it is necessary that findings concerning damages \u201cbe made with sufficient particularity so that they may be reviewed.\u201d <em>Hatahley v. United States, </em>351 U.S. 173, 183, [76 S.Ct. 745, 752, 100 L.Ed. 1065] (1956) (damages under Federal Tort Claims Act); <em>Alexander v. Nash-Kelvinator Corp., </em>261 F.2d 187, 190-91 (2nd Cir. 1958) (damages under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52). Where, as here, there is great controversy regarding the measure and computation of damages, <em>see </em>Transcript 742-814, it is important that the measure of damages and method of computation be exposed so as to inform the litigants and afford a possibility of intelligent review. <em>See Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. v. Richardson, </em>295 F.2d 583, 590, 96 A.L.R.2d 1085, 1095 (2nd Cir. 1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 989, 82 S.Ct. 606, 7 L.Ed.2d 526, 370 U.S. 937, 82 S.Ct. 1577, 8 L.Ed.2d 806 (1962); <em>Alexander v. Nash-Kelvinator Corp., </em>261 F.2d at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">With respect to the vinyl wall coverings, the district court awarded Limited Partnership $47,500 for \u201ccosmetic\u201d and other compensation. Memorandum Opinion and Order of Nov. 27, 1974, J.A. at 111. There is no definite indication what measure of damages was used or what figures went into the calculation. Counsel for Chevy Chase and Limited Partnership noted at oral argument that this figure might have been derived by adding the $41,000 that Donohoe paid for the wall coverings (Transcript at 376) to the $6,500 estimated cost of priming the walls (Transcript at 396; Plaintiffs and Crossclaimant\u2019s Exhibit 26). This could be the way the award was calculated, but, also, it could well be coincidence. We are capable of no more than pure speculation. Moreover, there is an indication that the district court may have experienced considerable difficulty regarding the measure of damages. Transcript at 791-92. Additionally, there was at least a partial failure of proof regarding the cost of replacement with similar wall coverings. Memorandum Opinion and Order of Nov. 27, 1974, J.A. at 110; Transcript at 749-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The same problem is present in the award of $3,500 for the missing master thermostat, Memorandum Opinion and Order of Nov. 27,1974, J.A. at 112, and the award of $17,000 for leak damages. <em>Id., </em>J.A. at 113. We feel that we are unable to make an adequate review of these damage awards, and we must remand for a further articulation of the way that they were calculated.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s determinations with regard to the capacity issues and with regard to liability, but we remand for a further illumination concerning the damage issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and Remanded in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-11\">. The related facilities are a parking garage and restaurants. Also included on the property, but not leased to Chevy Chase, are several retail stores.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\">. At about this time, a second group, the Somerset Properties Limited Partnership, began to emerge. A certificate for this limited partnership was not filed until August 16, 1971. There is a sometimes confusing similarity between Somerset Properties Joint Venture and Somerset Properties Limited Partnership. Safer and Stephen Winkelman were principals of both and apparently acted for both. The real estate sales contract of February 11, 1969, is signed, <em>inter alia, </em>by John Safer, Stephen Winkelman, and Jules A. Winkelman. In this contract, Safer and the two Winkelmans purport to be acting for Somerset Properties Limited Partner- . ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-20\">On the other hand, the lease agreement of October 10, 1968 is signed by Stephen Winkel-man and Safer, purporting to be acting in their individual capacities, and for the participants in the Somerset Properties Joint Venture. We can find no evidence in the record of any transfer of title from Somerset Properties Joint Venture to Somerset Properties Limited Partnership between October 10, 1968 and February II, 1969.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b153-22\">. The note is for $2,000,000 and is made to the order of Safer and Stephen A. Winkelman. It is guaranteed by Copeland. Securing the note is a deed of trust given by Winthrop, also bearing the date of April 11, 1969. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>there existed a first lien of record in the form of a deed of trust securing a debt to Madison National Bank of approximately $5,000,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\">. The district court noted that the fact that Winthrop transferred the property to Copeland combined with the fact that Winthrop purchased and sold by deeds dated the same day to suggest very strongly that the transaction with Winkelman and Safer preceded the transaction in which Winthrop purportedly granted the property to Copeland. Memorandum and Order of Nov. 19, 1974, J.A. at 102. Although we do not disagree with this assessment, our analysis of the capacity issues does not in any way depend on a similar resolution of the facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b154-10\">. Donohoe went ahead apparently on the basis of a letter from Stephen Winkelman to its president, Richard Donohoe, dated April 23, 1969. This was apparently done to protect a Special Zoning Exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b154-11\">. The total contract price was $3,400,000. During the construction, certain changes were apparently agreed to which added an additional $57,136.46. As of the filing of the lien, Dono-hoe recites that it had received $3,272,717. Thus, the unpaid balance was $184,419.46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b154-19\">. The property was sold subject to the first deed of trust the balance of which was $4,832,-502.67, including counsel fees and miscellaneous charges.

In addition, there were overdue taxes of $70,601.20, a lien for the architect in the amount of $22,889.89, and a lien for the structural engineer of $8,500. When Donohoe\u2019s lien is added in, the total is $5,149,013.23. There were also numerous, smaller, and less certain charges against the property.

We realize that labor successorship questions are interpreted against a backdrop of national labor policy, and therefore, the same principles and policies do not necessarily carry over into the case at bar. <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons v. Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 550, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964). <em>See also NLRB v.

The question in our case is not whether a successor will have his predecessor\u2019s obligations imputed to him, but, on the contrary, whether he may take advantage of his predecessors\u2019s contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"A1i\">. Section 14.2.1 provides in full:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">If the Contractor is adjudged a bankrupt, or if he makes a general assignment for the benefit of his creditors, or if a receiver is appointed on account of his insolvency, or if he persistently or repeatedly refuses or fails, except in cases for which extension of time is provided, to supply enough properly skilled workmen or proper materials, or if he fails to make prompt payment to subcontractors or for materials or labor, or persistently disregards laws, ordinances, rules, regulations or orders of any public authority having jurisdiction, or otherwise is guilty of a substantial violation of a provision of the Contract Documents, then the Owner, upon certification by the Architect that sufficient cause exists to justify such action, may, without prejudice to any right or remedy and after giving the Contractor and his surety, if any, seven days\u2019 written notice, terminate the employment of the Contractor and take possession of the site and of all materials, equipment, tools, construction equipment and machinery thereon owned by the Contractor and may finish the Work by whatever method he may deem expedient. In such case the Contractor shall not be entitled to receive any further payment until the Work is finished.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b162-5\">. Limited Partnership, Joint Venture, and Chevy Chase each attempt to advance express and implied warranty claims on appeal. Brief for Appellees at 60-69. We do not find merit in these claims. The extent to which Maryland has eliminated privity as a requirement to warranty claims is not fully clear, especially in cases not involving sales of goods. <em>Compare Blankenship v. Morrison Mach. Co., </em>255 Md. 241, 257 A.2d 430 (1969), <em>with Frericks </em>v. <em>Gen. Motors Corp., </em>278 Md. 304, 363 A.2d 460 (1976). To the extent privity is required, Joint Venture and Chevy Chase are not plaintiffs who may recover, as we discussed above. It is unclear whether Limited Partnership as \u201csuccessor\u201d could defeat Donohoe\u2019s privity defense with regard to warranty. <em>See Uppgren v. Executive Aviation Servs., Inc., </em>326 F.Supp. 709, 713-17 (D.Md.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Based on our review of the record, we must agree with Donohoe that this case was not tried on a warranty theory below. <em>See </em>Reply Brief for Appellant and Cross-Appellee at 13 n. 8. The plaintiff and crossclaimant have not carried their burden with respect to the defect in the pipe. <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Adams, </em>213 Md. 521, 132 A.2d 484 (1957); <em>accord, Hacker v. Shofer, </em>251 Md. 672, 248 A.2d 351 (1968). Further, we can find no sufficient legal basis for a finding of an implied warranty. <em>See Thomas v. Cryer, </em>251 Md. 725, 248 A.2d 795 (1969). <em>But see </em>Md. Real Property Code Ann. \u00a7 10-203 (1974) (implied warranties with respect to sales). Finally, the participation of Winthrop and Gordon in the substitution of stainless steel for copper pipes is most significant. <em>See Wisconsin Red Pressed Brick Co. v. Hood, </em>67 Minn. 329, 69 N.W. 1091 (1897); <em>Wood-Hopkins Contracting Co. v. Masonry Contractors Inc., </em>235 So.2d 548, 61 A.L. R.3d 786 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1970). <em>See also Mat-tos, Inc. v.
