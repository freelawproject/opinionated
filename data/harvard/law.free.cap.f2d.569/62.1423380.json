The sole issue presented is whether the District Court erred in denying a pretrial motion to suppress the bank statement and the envelope in which it was enclosed, which appellant claimed were the fruits of an unreasonable investigative \u201cseizure\u201d of his person. Although this is a relatively close case on its facts, as Judge Bryant\u2019s comments in the course of the suppression hearing indicated, we are satisfied that the ruling here challenged did not contravene appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and, accordingly, affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b127-18\">The only witness at the suppression hearing was Officer Franck, a veteran of six years with the Metropolitan Police Department, throughout which time he had engaged in routine patrols of local banks as part of his official duties. In the early afternoon of February 10, 1976, having been assigned to \u201cbank detail\u201d for the day, Officer Franck entered a branch of the National Bank of Washington located in the 1300 block of Connecticut Avenue, Northwest. Although he had been in that particular branch \u201cmany, many times,\u201d he was not himself a customer of the bank and did not know which of the counter slips were withdrawal slips and which were deposit slips.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>According to his testimony, Officer Franck first observed appellant from about 25 feet away, as the latter was standing in line at a teller\u2019s window, holding a blue piece of paper which, because of its size, appearance, and color, Franck assumed to be a check. The officer\u2019s attention was drawn to appellant because \u201chis pants were kind of shaggy\u201d; \u201c[h]e was dressed fairly modestly\u201d; and, more generally, \u201c[h]e didn\u2019t appear to be right inside the bank.\u201d Tr. 9-10. While Franck walked to the \u201cbank book,\u201d which officers on bank detail are required to sign, and after he had written in the book, the officer continued to watch appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">When appellant got to the teller\u2019s window, he waved the blue piece of paper in the air and then presented it to the teller. Officer Franck observed \u201c[t]he bank teller look[] down at the slip of paper, turn[] it around and look[] at it and read it and immediately, within a matter of a second or two, push[] it back toward\u201d appellant. A brief conversation between appellant and the teller ensued, but the officer was able to overhear only two words, \u201cbank official.\u201d Appellant picked up the piece of paper, turned, and saw Officer Franck looking at him. After three to five seconds of eye contact, appellant avoided looking further at Franck and walked up to a bank official. Instead of showing the piece of paper to the official, appellant placed it inside a brown envelope he had been carrying in his hand, and put the envelope in his pocket. He spoke for \u201cone or two seconds\u201d to the official, Tr. 23, then turned and \u201cstarted walking fast out of the bank, not [at] the same pace he had been moving,\u201d Tr. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">His interest aroused, Franck followed appellant out of the bank<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, having caught up with him on the sidewalk immediately outside, asked appellant, \u201cSir, may I talk to you a moment?\u201d Tr. 13. When appellant responded \u201cokay,\u201d the officer went to his scooter parked in front of the bank and took out a copy of police department form 76, used to record information about preliminary investigative inquiries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Franck began to fill out the form, and asked appellant for his name. Appellant told the officer that his name was \u201cWilliam Wither-spoon,\u201d and that he lived on Ontario Road, Northwest.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Officer Franck then asked appellant if he had any identification, but appellant responded that he did not. The officer testified that his suspicions were amplified by this development:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Right away it struck me funny. Why does a man go into a bank to cash a check without some sort of identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Tr. 14; <em>see id. </em>36. When Franck asked whether appellant was sure he did not have any identification, appellant replied that all he had was a withdrawal slip, which he had intended to use to take money out of his savings account. The officer requested to see the slip, and appellant took the brown envelope out of his pocket and removed the blue slip of paper which the officer had previously believed to be a check. The blue slip was in fact a withdrawal slip, with the name \u201cWilliam Witherspoon\u201d written on it, and accordingly the officer transcribed this name onto P.D. Form 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">Officer Franck asked appellant for his address and phone number, but appellant said that he did not have a phone number. Franck then asked appellant why he did not have any identification when he attempted to withdraw money from his savings account, and according to Franck\u2019s testimony appellant gave the following answer:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>He said he went into [the] bank and made a mistake. He tried to get some money from his savings account, and he had the checking account number [marked on the withdrawal slip].</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Tr. 14-15. The officer then \u201cstarted asking questions,\u201d \u201cbut everything was funny.\u201d Tr. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">At this point, Franck addressed the following question to appellant:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Mr. Witherspoon, would you mind coming back inside the bank with me, and we will talk to the manager, and if everything is okay, you can go.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Tr. 15. Appellant answered \u201cno,\u201d that he would not mind, which the officer apparently interpreted as consent to return to the bank. <em>See </em>Tr. 17.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Once inside the bank, Officer Franck and appellant approached the bank official whom appellant had addressed very briefly on the way out of the bank. Franck asked the official, a Mr. Stewart, what appellant had said as he walked out; and Stewart replied, according to Franck, that appellant had simply stated \u201cI will see you later.\u201d Tr. 17. Franck then requested Stewart to confirm that a Mr. William Witherspoon had an account with the bank. When a telephone call yielded the response that there was no account in that name, Stewart asked appellant if he had a middle initial. Rather than answering immediately, appellant started snapping his fingers and \u201crung [sic] his head,\u201d and \u201cbeads of perspiration came out all over his forehead.\u201d Tr. 18, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">After about 15 or 20 seconds, appellant said his middle initial was \u201cM,\u201d and Mr. Stewart verified the existence of both a checking and savings account in the name of William M. Witherspoon. However, the address listed on the accounts was different from the one given by appellant outside the bank, and that date of birth on the bank\u2019s records did not match the date given by appellant in response to a question from Officer Franck. When the officer asked appellant how long the accounts had been open, appellant again started snapping his fingers, and responded \u201cone year,\u201d but Mr. Stewart\u2019s information indicated that the accounts had in fact been open three-and-one-half years. Observing what appeared to be a wallet in appellant\u2019s inside coat pocket, Franck again asked appellant if he had any identification, but appellant stated that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">After consulting by telephone with a detective from the Check and Fraud Section of the Metropolitan Police Department, Officer Franck placed appellant under arrest for attempted false pretenses, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 103, 1301. Incident to that arrest, Franck seized the wallet and a brown envelope from appellant\u2019s coat pocket. Inside the wallet was a birth certificate in the name of Bobby Samuel Wylie; and inside the brown envelope was a bank statement in the name of William Witherspoon, listing the account number of a checking account, and showing a balance of $412. The blue withdrawal slip which appellant had given to Officer Franck was <em>a, </em>savings account withdrawal slip, made out for $400, and inscribed with the checking account number displayed on Witherspoon\u2019s bank statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">Later investigation revealed that the bank statement had been placed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>United States mail on February 9,1976, the day before it was found in appellant\u2019s possession, and that Witherspoon\u2019s mail box had been broken into on February 10. On March 10, 1976, appellant was indicted for possession of stolen mail, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708, and attempted false pretenses, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 103, 1301. Defense counsel\u2019s motion to suppress the bank statement and brown envelope was denied by Judge Bryant on August 4, 1976, following the evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress. A bench trial was held on September 9, 1976, and the bank statement and envelope were admitted into evidence over objection. Appellant was found guilty of both offenses charged, but the false pretenses count was subsequently dismissed with the consent of the Government. On October 27, 1976, the District Court sentenced appellant to six to thirty months imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Appellant concedes that probable cause for arrest existed following the investigation inside the bank, and that if the police conduct leading up to the formal arrest was proper, the bank statement and the brown envelope were validly seized incident to arrest. The controversy centers around the interrogation of appellant on the sidewalk outside the bank, and his return into the bank for further investigation. Appellant contends, first, that the encounter on the sidewalk was an investigative \u201cstop\u201d without the reasonable, articulable grounds required by <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); and, second, that the re-entry into the bank constituted an arrest without probable cause, or, alternatively, an unwarranted extension of the <em>Terry </em>stop after the original grounds for suspicion had vanished. At the other extreme, the Government argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that Officer Franck had reasonable, articu-lable grounds for suspicion of appellant from the time of the initial approach on the sidewalk, justifying a forced investigative stop, and that appellant consented to go back into the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Terry, supra </em>at 13, 88 S.Ct. at 1875, \u201c[sjtreet encounters between citizens and police officers are incredibly rich in diversity,\u201d and consequently each case must be evaluated in light of the particular array of facts presented, <em>see id. </em>at 13-16, 88 S.Ct. 1868. Our examination of the record in this case causes us to reject the extreme positions advanced by both appellant and the Government. It is our view that the police conduct at issue here involved a proper progression of escalating responses to circumstances which generated a mounting degree of suspicion that a crime had occurred. More particularly, we hold that (1) the initial approach on the sidewalk constituted a mere \u201ccontact,\u201d and not a compelled investigative stop, and therefore did not require reasonable, articulable grounds for suspecting that appellant had committed a crime; (2) the necessary basis for an investigative stop existed at least from the time Wylie produced the withdrawal slip, and nothing else, in response to Officer Franck\u2019s request for identification; and (3) the reentry into the bank for the purpose of further investigation was justified under the <em>Terry </em>stop doctrine, and did not amount to an arrest without probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">It is well-settled that the Fourth Amendment applies to \u201cseizures\u201d of the person which fall short of traditional arrests, and that such restraints on personal freedom may be justified on a showing of less than probable cause if, and only if, the police conduct is \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>See, e. g., United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 878-81, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975); <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 16-27, 88 S.Ct. 1868; <em>United States v. Coates, </em>161 U.S.App.D.C. 334, 337, 495 F.2d 160, 163 (1974). \u201cAs with other categories of police action subject to Fourth Amendment constraints, the reasonableness of such seizures depends on a balance between the public interest and the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers.\u201d <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>v. <em>Brignoni-Ponce, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 878, 95 S.Ct. at 2578-79, <em>citing, inter alia, Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 20-21, 88 S.Ct. 1868. A general rule which has emerged from this balance is that \u201cin justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra </em>at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1880, <em>see United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 881, 884, 95 S.Ct. 2574.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">But police-citizen communications which take place under circumstances in which the citizen\u2019s \u201cfreedom to walk away\u201d is not limited by anything other than his desire to cooperate do not amount to \u201cseizures\u201d of the person, and consequently may be initiated without a reasonable, articulable suspicion, much less probable cause. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 16, 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868; <em>Coates v. United States, </em>134 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 413 F.2d 371 (1969). As the Court in <em>Terry </em>noted, 392 U.S. at 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1879 n. 16:</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">Obviously, not all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves \u201cseizures\u201d of persons. Only when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a \u201cseizure\u201d has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ7\">And Justice White\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Terry </em>added:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">There is nothing in the Constitution which prevents a policeman from addressing questions to anyone on the streets. <em>Id. </em>at 34, 88 S.Ct. at 1886 (White, J., concurring). <em>See also id. </em>at 32-33, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (Harlan, J., concurring); <em>Davis v. Mississippi, </em>394 U.S. 721, 727 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1394, 22 L.Ed.2d 676 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">The Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s regulations governing investigative procedures recognize this distinction between mere \u201ccontacts,\u201d which are not subject to Fourth Amendment limitations, and investigative \u201cstops,\u201d which must be supported by a reasonable suspicion. Metropolitan Police Department General Order No. 304-10 (effective July 1, 1973); <em>see </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>A \u201ccontact\u201d is defined as \u201c[cjonduct by an officer which places him in face-to-face communication with an individual under circumstances in which the individual is free to leave if he wishes,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> whereas a \u201cstop\u201d is described as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">A \u201cstop\u201d is the temporary detention of a person for the purpose of determining whether probable cause exists to arrest that person. A stop occurs whenever an officer uses his authority to compel a person to halt, or to keep him in a certain place, or to require him to perform some act . . . . If a person is under a reasonable impression that he is not free to leave the officer\u2019s presence, a \u201cstop\u201d has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">As the police regulations concede, <em>see </em>note 4 <em>supra, </em>there can be no question that a \u201cstop\u201d has occurred where physical force has been used to detain a person against his will, or the individual has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>subjected to a \u201cfrisk\u201d for weapons. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, supra </em>392 U.S. at 16-17, 19, 88 S.Ct. 1868. The difficulty comes in distinguishing between \u201cnon-forcible stops,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>stops effectuated through a show of authority without the use of force, and mere \u201ccontacts.\u201d In such situations, the crucial consideration is the one set forth in the police definition quoted above: whether the person was \u201cunder a reasonable impression that he [was] not free to leave the officer\u2019s presence.\u201d We would only add that in determining whether such a reasonable impression existed, the test must be \u201c \u2018what a reasonable man, innocent of any crime, would have thought had he been in the defendant\u2019s shoes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coates </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>134 U.S.App.D.C. at 99, 413 F.2d at 373, <em>quoting United States v. McKethan, </em>247 F.Supp. 324 (D.D.C.1965), <em>aff\u2019d by order, </em>No. 20,059 (D.C.Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Applying these standards to the facts before us, we conclude that Officer Franck\u2019s initial approach to appellant on the sidewalk outside the bank constituted a \u201ccontact\u201d and not a \u201cstop\u201d. Clearly, no physical force or physical contact of any kind was used to restrain appellant\u2019s freedom of movement. And, although a refined judgment is required, we believe that an innocent person in appellant\u2019s position would not have felt compelled to respond affirmatively to the officer\u2019s request for information. The tone of Officer Franck\u2019s question \u2014 \u201cSir, may I talk to you a moment?\u201d \u2014 strongly suggests that appellant was free to leave if he so desired, and nothing in his response indicates the contrary. It was, at least, within a reasonable range of interpretation for Judge Bryant to conclude that this was the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">We need not decide whether there came a point in the sidewalk encounter, prior to the request to return to the bank, when the intensification of the questioning would have led a reasonable person to believe that he was no longer free to go. If such -a point occurred, we believe it was after Wylie had produced the withdrawal slip \u2014 and only the withdrawal slip \u2014 in response to the police officer\u2019s request for identification; and that circumstance, together with the events observed in the bank, provided sufficient grounds for an investigative stop within the contemplation of <em>Terry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">In determining whether the specific and articulable facts recited by the police officer added up, following the production of the withdrawal slip, to a reasonable suspicion justifying brief detention for questioning we are guided by the general principle that in judging the reasonableness of the actions of the officer the circumstances before him are not to be dissected and viewed singly; rather, they must be considered as a whole. So considered they are to be viewed through the eyes of a reasonable and cautious police officer on the scene, guided by his experience and training.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\"><em>United States v. Hall, </em>174 U.S.App.D.C. 13, 15, 525 F.2d 857, 859 (1976), <em>citing United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 400, 458 F.2d 819 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">Officer Franck was a veteran police officer with extensive experience in observing banks and banking activity. In this case, he observed the following inside the bank: 1) a purported bank customer attempted to negotiate what appeared to be a check, which was rejected on its face by the bank teller; 2) in the ensuing conversation, the man was apparently referred to a bank official but, after seeing the police officer, merely approached a bank official, uttered a few words and, instead of showing the slip of paper to the official, placed it in an envelope in his pocket; and 3) without expressing any anger or frustration at the rejection of his transaction, or pursuing a discussion with the bank official, walked very rapidly out of the bank.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Although these circumstances alone could not have formed the basis for a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity had occurred, that standard was satisfied when Wylie stated on the sidewalk that the only identification he had was a withdrawal slip which he had intended to use to withdraw money from his savings account, and removed the slip from an envelope in his pocket. At that point, the transaction in the bank took on an indisputably suspicious character warranting further investigation. According to his own admission, appellant had attempted to withdraw money from a savings account without any identification or evidence that the account was his, other than his own representation in the form of a withdrawal slip. Failure to carry identification is, of course, not itself a crime nor, in most circumstances, even a ground for suspecting criminal activity; and appellant\u2019s inability to produce identification here was not enough to show probable cause that he had committed a crime. But surely it is unusual for an individual to attempt to withdraw money from a personal savings account without being prepared to display some evidence that he owns or controls the account \u2014 a savings passbook or bank account identification card, if not additional identification as well \u2014 and, in light of what he had observed in the bank, Officer Franck could reasonably have suspected when the only identification appellant was able to produce was the disputed transaction slip itself, that he had attempted to withdraw money from someone else\u2019s account.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Whether or not appellant\u2019s freedom of movement became constrained somewhat earlier, we believe that a reasonable person in his position would no longer have felt free to leave when Officer Franck \u201cinvited\u201d him to return to the bank. Although framed as a question rather than a command \u2014 \u201cMr. Witherspoon, would you mind coming back inside the bank with me\u201d \u2014 the officer\u2019s remark continued with the observation that \u201cwe <em>will </em>talk to the manager, and <em>if </em>everything is okay, you can go.\u201d Tr. 15 (emphasis supplied). The clear implication, inasmuch as the request followed on the heels of direct questioning about appellant\u2019s business in the bank, was that appellant would be free to go if, but only if, further investigation inside the bank exonerated him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s assertion that any original grounds for suspicion had vanished by this time, it seems clear that Officer Franck\u2019s suspicions could only have continued to increase following appellant\u2019s production of the withdrawal slip. When the officer asked appellant why he did not have any identification when he attempted to withdraw money from his savings account, rather than providing an innocent explanation or even a responsive answer, appellant volunteered a highly implausible explanation for why his transaction had failed \u2014 he claimed that he had \u201cmistakenly\u201d written his checking account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>number on the savings account slip.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the other hand, the Government does not argue, nor do we believe it could, that probable cause for arrest existed on the basis of this response.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The question thus becomes whether compelled reentry into the bank for a brief inquiry could be justified as part of an investigative \u201cstop\u201d or instead constituted an \u201carrest\u201d without probable cause. Or, to put the question less metaphysically, whether returning appellant to the suspected scene of the crime, a few feet from where he and the officer were standing, for a brief investigation after which appellant would be free to go if his story checked out, could be justified on less than probable cause. We hold, on the basis of the general principles established in <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>that the return to the bank was a reasonable procedure for investigating the suspicious circumstances with which Officer Franck was confronted. <em>See Cooper v. United States, </em>368 A.2d 554, 556-57 (D.C.Ct.App. 1977) (reaching same conclusion on substantially similar facts). <em>See also Young v. United States, </em>140 U.S.App.D.C. 333, 337, 435 F.2d 405, 409 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972), <em>Terry </em>recognizes the propriety of an \u201cintermediate response\u201d\u2014 between the extremes of arrest and simply walking away- \u2014 in circumstances warranting reasonable suspicion of criminal activity:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In <em>Terry </em>this Court recognized that \u201ca police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d The Fourth Amendment does not require a policeman who lacks the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest to simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a criminal to escape. On the contrary, <em>Terry </em>recognizes that it may be the essence of good police work to adopt an intermediate response. A brief stop of a suspicious individual, in order to determine his identity or to maintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining more information, may be most reasonable in light of the facts known to the officer at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 145 \u2014 46, 92 S.Ct. at 1923 (citations omitted). The general constraint set forth in <em>Terry </em>is that an investigative seizure must be \u201creasonably related in scope to the justification for [its] initiation.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 29, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884; <em>accord, United States </em>v. <em>Brignoni-Ponce, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 881, 95 S.Ct. 2574.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And, in determining reasonableness, \u201cthe facts [must] be judged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the officer at the moment of seizure . \u2018warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 that the action taken was appropriate?\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 21-22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880, <em>quoting Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">Here, the police officer was faced with circumstances creating a reasonable suspicion that appellant had unlawfully attempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>ed to withdraw money from someone else\u2019s bank account. By returning with appellant to the suspected scene of the crime, a few feet away, and making a brief investigation, the officer could resolve whether a crime had in fact been committed. If so, appellant would be arrested on probable cause; if not, he would be free to go. In these circumstances, we think that it was open to the District Court to conclude that the action taken by the officer was entirely appropriate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><em>United States v. Jennings, </em>468 F.2d 111 (9th Cir. 1972), cited by appellant for the proposition that extension in time and space of an investigative stop may be unjustified, even though the police officer has legitimate grounds for a more limited stop, is distinguishable. In that case, a person suspected of owning marijuana which had been found in a nearby house, was stopped on the street and transported by car to the Sheriff\u2019s office, where he was subjected to \u201cprolonged\u201d detention, <em>id. </em>at 114, 115, lasting 20-25 minutes, during which he was interrogated, fingerprinted, photographed, and required to fill out an arrest form. This prolonged detention at the Sheriff\u2019s office, a distance away from the place at which the initial stop occurred, was both more intrusive and less likely to yield immediate results than the investigative procedure employed here.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Concluding, as we do, that Judge Bryant\u2019s disposition, after a full evidentiary hearing, of the pretrial suppression motion was a permissible relation of the facts adduced to established legal principles, we think the contested evidence was admissible at trial, and the judgment of the District Court is accordingly affirmed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">. The officer testified that he did not have time to talk with the teller of the bank official before appellant walked out of the bank.

Form 76 may be used to report the circumstances surrounding a \u201ccontact\u201d (defined as \u201c[c]onduct by an officer which places him in face-to-face communication with an individual under circumstances in which the individual is free to leave if he wishes\u201d); and must be used to record any non-forcible \u201cstop\u201d (defined as \u201ctemporary detention of a person for the purpose of determining whether probable cause exists to arrest that person\u201d). A different form, P.D. Form 253, must be filled out in the event of a stop effectuated through force.

In response to defense counsel\u2019s question as to whether appellant was free to go at this time, Franck stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">Sir, if he turned and walked away from me then, as long as I have been a policeman, I know I couldn\u2019t have stopped him. He could have kept right on going. And I would have had no choice but to let him walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">Tr. 15. Evidently, this statement reflected the officer\u2019s belief that probable cause was necessary in order to compel appellant to go back into the bank, since Franck had stated earlier: I would have had to let him go because I didn\u2019t feel that there was probable cause at that time. I merely had a suspicion, which was being amplified as each moment passed by.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-18\"><em>See </em>Tr. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-19\">At some point prior to re-entering the bank, Officer Franck radioed in the name \u201cWilliam Witherspoon\u201d to police headquarters, to check for outstanding arrest warrants. This apparently was a normal procedure when filling out Form 76 on an individual. Franck did not wait for an answer before escorting appellant into the bank. Tr. 19-20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">. The section of General Order No. 304-10 dealing with \u201ccontacts\u201d goes on to provide in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Contacts may be initiated by an officer when he reasonably believes that investigation of a situation is justified. The standard for police-citizen contact is not \u201cprobable cause,\u201d \u201creasonable suspicion,\u201d or any other specific indication of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">\n<em>1. Initiating a Contact.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">An officer may initiate a contact with a person in any place in which the officer has a right to be. It is difficult to define precisely such places. Generally, they may include: (1) areas of government-owned or possessed property normally open to members of the public; .</p>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">\n<em>2. Conduct of Contacts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b131-17\">Persons \u201ccontacted\u201d may not be detained against their will or frisked. They may not be required to answer the officer\u2019s questions or in any way respond to the officer if they choose not to do so. The officer may not use force or coercion to attempt to require citizens to stop or respond. If they refuse to cooperate, they <em>must </em>be permitted to go on their way; however, if it seems appropriate under the circumstances, they may be kept under surveillance. Since a contact is <em>not </em>a stop or an arrest and the person contacted may be innocent of wrongdoing of any kind, officers should take special care to act in as restrained and courteous manner as possible, (emphasis in original)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">. Under these circumstances we think a purely voluntary \u201ccontact\u201d approach by the police officer to appellant was unobjectionable, irrespective of the latter\u2019s physical appearance; and we attach no significance to Officer Franck\u2019s characterization of that appearance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>as we are confident the district judge did not either.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b133-6\">. Whether the police officer had grounds for reasonable suspicion as of the time of appellant\u2019s initial response \u2014 that he did not have any identification \u2014 is less clear. At that point, the officer still believed that appellant had tried to cash a check rather than withdraw money from a savings account, and it is perhaps less unusual to attempt to negotiate a check without additional identification, since possession of a check engraved with a particular account number is probably more reliable evidence of ownership of that account than a savings withdrawal slip with the account number written in by hand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b133-11\">. The police officer\u2019s statement that if appellant had simply walked away at this point, he would not have been stopped, is of course not dispositive of how a reasonable person in appellant\u2019s position would have viewed the situation. And, especially in light of the fact that appellant was promised his freedom if, and impliedly only if, he returned to the bank, we cannot say that his \u201cconsent\u201d to the return was \u201cfreely and.voluntarily given.\u201d <em>Schneckcloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 222, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854; <em>see id. </em>at 227, 93 S.Ct. 2041; <em>United States v. Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 424, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\">. Certainly it would be unusual for the true owner of a savings account to attempt to recall his account number from memory (rather than copying it from some written record), let alone to make a mistake and recall and transcribe his checking account number instead.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">. There is dictum in <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, supra </em>at 881-82, 95 S.Ct. at 2580, to the effect that in an investigative stop of a vehicle suspected of containing illegal aliens,</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The officer may question the driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status, and he may ask them to explain suspicious circumstances, but any further detention or search must be based on consent or probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">No suggestion was made in that case, however, that further detention might be reasonably related to the justification for the initial stop; and, indeed, in the context of border patrols searching for illegal aliens, it is hard to imagine a reasonable ground, absent evidence of some other form of criminal activity, for further detention without consent or probable cause. As we explain below, the circumstances of the instant case are distinguishable in that regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b135-5\">. It was not unreasonable for Officer Franck to take appellant bank into the bank without waiting for the results of the warrant check on \u201cWilliam Witherspoon,\u201d <em>see </em>note 3 <em>supra. </em>Since the suspected crime involved impersonation of Witherspoon, Witherspoon\u2019s arrest record would have been largely irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\">. The recent case of <em>United States v. McCaleb, </em>552 F.2d 717 (6th Cir. 1977), <em>reported in </em>45 U.S.L.W. 2520, in which three persons suspected of trafficking in narcotics were stopped by federal agents in a parking lot outside the Detroit Metropolitan Airport and taken into a small office in the airport pending further investigation, is also distinguishable. Although the Sixth Circuit held that an arrest without probable occurred when the individuals were taken to the private office and held there against their will, this investigative seizure evidently was not even supported by a reasonable suspicion. Moreover, in light of the fact that the individuals were threatened with indefinite detention pending acquisition of a warrant to search their luggage, which led to an invalid consent search in which drugs were discovered, the intrusion on their personal liberty was clearly greater than in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b135-13\">. The dissent, in steadily escalating hyperbole, has chosen finally to characterize the result we reach as initiating a repressive rule of law requiring every person to be always in possession of identification data producible on demand by any policeman at any time and for any or no reason. In the narrow context of the evidentia-ry record before us, revealing circumstances in which identification is normally expected to be available and where its absence had a relevance for law enforcement purposes peculiar to those special circumstances, we find the dissent\u2019s language in this regard surprising, as will also, we believe, the District Court before whom that record was made and whose decision we affirm.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b135-10\">SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ALvs\">dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">With much of Judge McGowan\u2019s able opinion for the court I am essentially in accord. Officer Franck\u2019s sidewalk encounter with appellant began as a non-coercive, non-trespassory investigative inquiry that appellant could indulge or ignore at will.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So long as the confrontation retained those attributes, the Fourth Amendment was not implicated in the least.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When, however, appellant was asked to accompany the officer back to the bank, a new element emerged, for appellant could hardly have felt free to do otherwise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That restraint summoned a test by the principles articulat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>ed in Terry;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with the admissibility of ensuing incriminations hanging in the balance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With all of these propositions I fully agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">I must part company with the court, however, when it concludes that <em>Terry </em>requirements were met in this case. In my view, the justification urged for the return trip to the bank \u2014 appellant\u2019s inability to produce identification<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 does not pass muster under the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If I am correct, the resulting encroachment upon appellant\u2019s liberty was illegal, and demanded suppression of the evidentiary discoveries it made possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">I. THE IMPOSITION OF THE DETENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">All agree that by the time appellant was arrested, Officer Franck had derived probable cause therefor from developments following their return to the bank. And, among the members of the court, it is common ground that probable cause for appellant\u2019s arrest did not accrue until after they had left the sidewalk.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But, as <em>Terry </em>made clear, the reach of the Fourth Amendment is not limited to constraints rising to the stature of formal arrests; even a relatively brief street-stop may fall within its compass,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and accordingly must be adequately justified.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The threshold questions here are whether there was a constitutionally cognizable detention on the sidewalk and, if so, at just what point it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-19\">A. <em>The Governing Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-20\">In <em>Terry </em>the Court observed, \u201c[sjtreet encounters between citizens and police officers are incredibly rich in diversity.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A factor often contributing to variegation\u2014 and one invariably separating the constitutionally permissible from what may be constitutionally forbidden \u2014 is the degree of impediment to the citizen\u2019s freedom of action. \u201cObviously,\u201d the Court declared, \u201cnot all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves \u2018seizures\u2019 of persons. Only when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a \u2018seizure\u2019 has occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> So long as the citizen is free to disregard or terminate the contact and go his way as he pleases, the Fourth Amendment interposes no obstacle to a policeman\u2019s mere effort at conversation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And as we ourselves have observed,</p>\n<p id=\"b136-21\">[ejncounters vary in the degree of intrusion; plainly there is a difference between an order to stop and give identification and a command to remain in a certain place for questioning for as long as twenty minutes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And although some degree of restraint and constraint may be present whenever police officers confront citizens to ask questions,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> such encounters differ in their potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>for intimidation and abrasion. Delineation of the Fourth Amendment limitations on police investigative activity must proceed with sensitivity to these differences.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Ofttimes the boundary between voluntary and involuntary on-street colloquy with police officers is elusive.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Many people at bottom will think twice before spurning an importuning policeman. This is not to suggest that that circumstance alone makes one inexorably a captive,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> for if it did no police-citizen investigative contact would ever withstand scrutiny. It is to say that the line of demarcation lies at the point of some different and larger restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In the quest for greater precision in this regard, we may profitably take a page from history. Bodily detention within the contemplation of the Fourth Amendment has traditionally been viewed as a consequence not simply of particular police conduct but also of its expectable impact upon the mind of the detainee.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> And as we have heretofore proclaimed, \u201c \u2018the test must not be what the [detainee] himself thought, but what a reasonable man, innocent of any crime, would have thought had he been in the [detainee\u2019s] shoes.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> That declaration was made in the context of a skirmish culminating in what was alleged to be an arrest, but logic dictates its applicability for purposes of determining whether a detention of potentially less magnitude has taken place. Indeed, that is the criterion by which the local police themselves abide.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>B. <em>The Imposition Here</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">With these considerations in mind, I approach the confrontation of appellant by Officer Franck on the sidewalk outside the bank. For a while, it lacked any significant indicium of duress other than whatever may be inherent in any face-to-face meeting between a citizen and a police officer. Certainly the officer\u2019s opening inquiry\u2014 \u201cSir, may I talk to you for a moment?\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u2014did not on its face suggest that appellant was compelled to do so. Nor did appellant\u2019s spontaneous response \u2014 \u201cOkay\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>\u2014indicate anything other than a willingness to cooperate. During most of the ensuing conversation, there was no exertion of official authority, no hint of force, and no frisk or other encroachment upon bodily integrity. So long as these circumstances endured, there was little or no likelihood that one innocent of crime would reasonably have felt unable to walk away whenever he chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">There did, however, come a time at which the prevailing conditions changed radically. That was when Officer Franck asked appellant to return to the bank. \u201c[WJould you mind coming back inside the bank with me?\u201d,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the officer put it; there \u201cwe will talk to the manager, and if everything is okay[] you can go.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Like my colleagues,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> I think it clear that, against the backdrop of the interrogation proceeding it, an innocent person in that situation would reasonably have taken the officer\u2019s utterance not as a mere supplication, but as a command.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> And the officer\u2019s proposition, as framed, unmistakably implied that appellant\u2019s liberty of movement was no longer unencumbered, but had become dependent upon such resolution of the officer\u2019s suspicions as might be made inside the bank.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> From that point onward appellant was under restraint,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and justification therefor became imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-17\">II. THE PRECONDITIONS TO NON-ARREST DETENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b138-18\">Only if appellant\u2019s involuntary sojourn at the bank was lawful could the incriminating evidence gleaned therefrom validly serve as a predicate for his conviction.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Fruit of an unconstitutional seizure cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>be utilized affirmatively to establish guilt on the part of its victim,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and this prohibition bars physical items uncovered,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> utterances made<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and conduct observed<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> during the course of the illegal intrusion. Since the discoveries prompting appellant\u2019s ultimate arrest \u2014 and, crucially, the incidental seizure of the bank statement \u2014 came solely in consequence of the in-bank internment and interrogation to which he was subjected,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the justification proffered therefor must be scrutinized in the light of governing Fourth Amendment principles.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">A. <em>Terry v. Ohio</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Every police detention unconsented to is subservient to that Amendment\u2019s strictures on seizure of the person.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> An arrest \u2014 a taking into custody incidental to a charge of crime \u2014 calls for probable cause,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u201cdefined in terms of facts and circumstances \u2018sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the [suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> A temporary restraint for investigative inquiry requires adequate justification, though somewhat weaker and different in character. It was in <em>Terry </em>that the Supreme Court set the standards by which hindrances of that nature are to be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-17\"><em>Terry </em>recognized that there are occasions upon which police need to inquire into ostensible criminal activity in the absence of probable cause supporting an arrest.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> \u201c[A] police officer,\u201d the Court said, \u201cmay in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> At the same time, <em>Terry </em>preserved the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment freedom from unreasonable governmental encroachment upon the privacy of his person,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and made clear its purpose to exclude evidence gained thereby in order to discourage lawless police con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>duct.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> These ends are assured by two requirements laid down by the Court. One is that, \u201cin justifying the particular intrusion, the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The other is that \u201cthe stop and inquiry must be \u2018reasonably related in scope to the justification for their initiation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> As we ourselves have put it, \u201c[sjtops as well as arrests must satisfy the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement of reasonable cause commensurate with the extent of the official intrusion.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Justification authorizing an investigative street-stop marks the point of accommodation for competing interests in personal privacy and crime detection,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> no less than probable cause does for an arrest.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> No wonder, then, that it is of a very special character: \u201cunusual conduct which leads [the officer] reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> And in evaluating the occasion for the stop, \u201cit is imperative that the facts be judged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure . \u2018warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 that the action taken was appropriate?\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> For \u201c[ajnything less would invite intrusions upon constitutionally guaranteed rights based on nothing more substantial than inarticulate hunches, a result [the Supreme] Court has consistently refused to sanction.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">B. <em>Applications of Terry</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">The distinction, then, is between reasonable grounds for a suspicion \u2014 objective facts in light of which the stop appears reasonable \u2014 that will support a stop, and intuition, hunch, or mere subjective suspicion that will not.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> This is well illustrated by one of two incidents before the Supreme Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>Sibron v. New York.</em><footnotemark><em>53</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A policeman kept Sibron under continuous surveillance for eight hours as he conversed successively with a number of known addicts. The officer did not overhear any of their conversations nor did he see anything pass between them. The Court refused to accept those circumstances as a basis for an investigative stop. \u201cSo far as [the officer] knew, they might . . . \u2018have been talking about the World Series.\u2019<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The inference that persons who talk to narcotics addicts are engaged in the criminal traffic in narcotics is simply not the sort of reasonable inference required to support an intrusion by the police upon an individual\u2019s personal security.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The constitutional necessity for objectively- and reasonably-founded suspicion for a stop is further illustrated by <em>Brignoni-Ponce,</em><footnotemark><em>56</em></footnotemark><em> </em>wherein the Court delineated the power of the Border Patrol to halt automobiles in areas near the Mexican border and inquire into the citizenship and immigration status of the occupants. As posed by the Court, \u201c[t]he only issue presented for decision [was] whether a roving patrol may stop a vehicle in an area near the border and question its occupants when the only ground for suspicion is that the occupants appear to be of Mexican ancestry,\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and that issue the Court resolved in the negative. Properly justified, such a procedure would be unobjectionable; \u201cbecause of the importance of the governmental interest at stake, the minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border,\u201d the Court held \u201cthat when an officer\u2019s observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country, he may stop the ear briefly and investigate the circumstances that provoke suspicion.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Since, however, \u201c[r]oads near the border carry not only aliens seeking to enter the country illegally, but a large volume of legitimate traffic as well,\u201d the Court recognized that \u201c[t]o approve roving-patrol stops of all vehicles in the border area, without any suspicion that a particular vehicle is carrying illegal immigrants, would subject the residents of these and other areas to potentially unlimited interference with their use of the highways, solely at the discretion of Boarder Patrol officers.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Consequently, the Court was</p>\n<p id=\"Abp\">not convinced that the legitimate needs of law enforcement require this degree of interference with lawful traffic. . [A] requirement of reasonable suspicion for stops allows the Government adequate means of guarding the public interest and also protects residents of the border area from indiscriminate official interference. Under the circumstances, and even though the intrusion incident to a stop is modest, we conclude that it is not \u201creasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment to make such stops on a random basis.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">Moreover, the <em>Brignoni-Ponce </em>Court continued, \u201c[f]or the same reasons that the Fourth Amendment forbids stopping vehicles at random to inquire if they are carrying aliens who are illegally in the country, it also forbids stopping or detaining persons for questioning about their citizenship on less than a reasonable suspicion that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>may be aliens.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> So, tracking <em>Terry, </em>the Court proclaimed that \u201c[e]xcept at the border and its functional equivalents, officers on roving patrol may stop vehicles only if they are aware of specific articulable facts, together with rational inferences from those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion that the vehicles contain aliens who may be illegally in the country\u201d;<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and that standard had not been met:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In this case the officers relied on a single factor to justify stopping respondent\u2019s car: the apparent Mexican ancestry of the occupants. We cannot conclude that this furnished reasonable grounds to believe that the three occupants were aliens. At best the officers had only a fleeting glimpse of the persons in the moving car, illuminated by headlights. Even if they saw enough to think that the occupants were of Mexican descent, this factor alone would justify neither a reasonable belief that they were aliens, nor a reasonable belief that the car concealed other aliens who were illegally in the country. Large numbers of native-born and naturalized citizens have the physical characteristics identified with Mexican ancestry, and even in the border area a relatively small proportion of them are aliens. The likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor, but standing alone it does not justify stopping all Mexican-Americans to ask if they are aliens.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Very similar to these decisions is our own in <em>Montgomery,</em><footnotemark><em>64</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Police officers saw Montgomery drive through a residential area twice, whereupon they followed him around the block and stopped him. Montgomery had observed all relevant traffic and speed laws, and the officers knew of nothing reflecting adversely upon him. Their suspicions were nonetheless aroused by \u201cthe manner in which he was encircling the area\u201d;<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> \u201cit seemed unusual that he would be encircling like that. There was really no business places around.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> One of the officers became more skeptical when he \u201cobserved [Montgomery] appeared [sic] to be watching us in the rear view mirror and looking around.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> We concluded that these events did not \u201cgiv[e] rise to a founded suspicion of wrongdoing.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> We said:</p>\n<p id=\"ALqS\">[G]ood faith, accompanied only by inarticulate hunch, is not enough for even the temporary \u201cseizure\u201d of a stop. And that is all that appears on this record. The officers saw [Montgomery] some four or five minutes after they originally noticed him, concluded that he had driven around the block, pulled their marked police car behind him and noted that [Montgomery] watched them in his rear view mirror and looked around. This may have been reason for an officer to become suspicious enough to keep an eye on [Montgomery]. But it can hardly be deemed to be an objective indicator of reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. There are perfectly legitimate reasons for circling a block, perhaps looking for an address in an unfamiliar neighborhood, or for a parking space close to the address sought, or waiting to meet a friend when parking at or near the location is unavailable.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">* * * <em>if. </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">The inarticulate hunch, the awareness of something unusual, is reason enough for officers to look sharp. Their knowledge and experience identify many inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>dents in the course of a day that an untrained eye might pass without any suspicion whatever. But awareness of the unusual, and a proper resolve to keep a sharp eye is not the same as an articulated suspicion of criminal conduct. [Montgomery\u2019s] acts, as reported, were too innocuous to warrant the intrusion of a temporary seizure for questioning.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Reverting to the case at bar, the question immediately becomes whether, in the totality of the circumstances of his encounter with Officer Franck, appellant\u2019s right to personal integrity was violated by what constitutionally amounted to an unreasonable seizure when he was required to go back to the bank for what eventuated as an extended interrogation. The reasonableness of this course of action turns on the facts, viewed objectively,<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> and the central inquiry is whether the officer was \u201cable to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warranted] that intrusion.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Applying <em>Terry </em>criteria to the facts here, I cannot accept the inferences purportedly underpinning the detention to which appellant was subjected.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">III. EVENTS LEADING TO THE DETENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">The chain of circumstances culminating in appellant\u2019s downfall is recounted in the record by Officer Franck himself. He was the only witness at the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence uncovered after he was brought back to the bank. The officer\u2019s testimony on the motion was admitted by stipulation at the ensuing nonjury trial, and the facts to which he testified, as distinguished from the impressions that he derived from those facts, have not been challenged. The events recited herein, then, are as related by the officer at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">A. <em>The Officer\u2019s Observations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">From the moment he first laid eyes on appellant, Officer Franck felt that something was odd. It all began one afternoon as the officer commenced a tour of duty inside the bank and spotted appellant 25 feet away<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> awaiting his turn at a teller\u2019s window. The officer\u2019s attention was drawn to appellant \u201cbecause he was the only person in the bank that didn\u2019t look right in the bank.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Appellant \u201chad a good looking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>jacket on\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> and \u201cwas dressed fairly modestly,\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> though \u201chis pants were kind of shaggy.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Still, to the officer \u201c[h]e didn\u2019t appear to be right inside the bank. \u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">As appellant stood in line, Officer Franck noticed that he held a piece of blue paper in his hand. The officer did not know what the paper really was but assumed that it was a check.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> So, when appellant handed the paper to the teller, and after examination the teller returned it to appellant with an unelucidated reference to a \u201cbank official,\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Officer Franck thought he was watching an effort to cash a check.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> \u201cWhat I saw in his hand looked like a check,\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> he said; \u201c[i]t was Tuesday afternoon. I thought it was an unusual time for somebody to be cashing their pay check.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> As we know, appellant received no money from the teller, a circumstance that the officer deemed not necessarily criminal, but \u201cunusual.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">As appellant left the window, he saw Officer Franck for the first time. \u201cWe had eye contact for three to five seconds. Maybe six seconds,\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> the officer related; \u201c[h]e turned away. From that time on, he avoided any kind of looking at me at all.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> After speaking briefly to a bank official,<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> and as Officer Franck \u201cstarted moving toward him, . . . [appellant] started walking fast out of the bank, not at the same pace he had been moving\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> \u2014 so fast, the officer declared, that \u201cwhen I went after the man, I had to trot to catch up with him on the sidewalk.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYX\">It was then that Officer Franck intercepted appellant on the sidewalk. \u201cI stopped him,\u201d the officer explained, \u201cbecause I thought he was trying to cash a check, and it didn\u2019t seem right to me that a man that was trying to cash a check would walk out of the bank without his check being cashed.\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Appellant unhesitatingly honored Officer Franck\u2019s request for a chat.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> He waited while the officer obtained a form from his scooter and entertained questions while the officer recorded his answers on the form.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> Asked his name, appellant said \u201cWilliam Witherspoon\u201d;<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> he also supplied an address<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> and a relative\u2019s telephone number,<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> and the officer had no objective basis for doubting any of that information.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-21\">Appellant told the officer that he had no identifying document other than a withdrawal slip that he had filled out in the bank in order to obtain money from his savings account.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> At the officer\u2019s suggestion, he handed over the slip, upon which was written the same name he had previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>given<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> and, as the officer was later to testify, he \u201crealized that it was a withdrawal slip, yes, sir.\u201d<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Appellant explained that he had mistakenly put his checking-account number instead of his savings-account number on the slip, and thus was unable to effect a withdrawal.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> Notwithstanding, the officer shortly thereafter subjected appellant to restraint with the proposal that they go back to the bank for further investigation.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">One may comb the officer\u2019s detailed narrative of the developments forerunning appellant\u2019s in-bank detention for \u201cspecific and articulable facts . . . reasonably war-rantpng] that intrusion\u201d<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> but the effort, I submit, is doomed to failure. To begin with, to stand in line for a bank teller\u2019s handling of what appears to be a check is certainly no oddity. The officer had never seen appellant prior to that day;<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> he did not know whether he was a customer of the bank;<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> indeed, he \u201c[djidn\u2019t know a thing about him.\u201d<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Nor was there anything exceptional about appellant\u2019s attire, as described by the officer,<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> to attract a bystander\u2019s special attention. Officer Franck\u2019s impression that appellant \u201cwas the only person in the bank that didn\u2019t look right in the bank\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> was no more or less than a subjective hunch of the first order.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-19\">Somewhat more palatable is the officer\u2019s mistaken belief that the blue slip in appellant\u2019s hand was a check.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> But the notion that it is \u201cunusual\u201d for a person to cash his pay check on a Tuesday afternoon<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> strikes me as absurd. People cash checks at banks all the time; a better place to do so is difficult to imagine. And the officer\u2019s extrapolation from a blue slip to a check thence to a pay check<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> hardly qualifies as a gem of deduction. I cannot indulge a higher rating to Officer Franck\u2019s impression that the fact that the check was not cashed was \u201cunusual.\u201d<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> A check-cashing effort may founder from any number of difficulties, and the teller\u2019s window is a likely place for discovering them. I find it difficult to believe that reasonable-minded people would perceive anything peculiarly criminal about \u201ca man that was trying to cash a check [who] walk[s] out of a bank without his check being cashed.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-20\">Much the same must be said for the \u201ceye contact,\u201d and the subsequent \u201cavoid[ance]\u201d of such contacts, to which Officer Franck attached importance.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> Many if not most of us would consider a glance of three to six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>seconds<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> at a uniformed policeman<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> some distance away<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> enough for any one afternoon. The officer\u2019s concern over this aspect of the encounter is akin to a recently-spurned assertion that a driver trailed by a marked police car \u201cappeared to be watching us in the rear view mirror and looking around.\u201d<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> We dismissed that impression with the admonition that \u201c[t]o consider mirror glance as enough for a seizure, however temporary, is to accept the adequacy of \u2018inarticulate hunches.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Pedestrains, no less than \u201c[d]rivers[,] simply do take notice that the police are nearby,\u201d<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> and then adore or ignore them as they please.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Moreover, the \u201ceye-contact\u201d episode bears the unmistakable earmark of a hopeless dilemma for appellant. By Officer Franck\u2019s own description, after the first sighting nothing transpired that objectively could have augured the likelihood that appellant would have gazed at the officer again. After the transaction at the cashier\u2019s window aborted, appellant walked toward the bank officer and then out through the door. Had he turned for one more look at Officer Franck, he would have left himself open to the ever-suspicious policeman\u2019s hunch \u2014 as did the driver in the case just mentioned \u2014 that appellant was giving him a \u201cfurtive\u201d glance.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">There was also appellant\u2019s brisk exit from the bank, with Officer Franck \u201ctrot[ting]\u201d after him.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> It may suffice merely to observe that when a patron\u2019s business with a bank is at least temporarily at end there is little or no occasion to tarry. To boot, one departing may not unnaturally walk through an exit faster than he previously did in point-to-point movement inside a bank. And it is hardly surprising that Officer Franck had to \u201ctrot\u201d in order to catch up with appellant on the sidewalk since the officer was some distance away when he started.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> But lest it be thought that appellant\u2019s exit had implications as a possible flight from the officer, a few additional remarks are in order. Flight may, of course, have significance in particular contexts,<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> but always there are \u201cdangers inherent in unperceptive reliance upon flight as an indicium of guilt,\u201d<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> and it is never a \u201creliable indicator of guilt without other circumstances to make its import less ambiguous.\u201d <footnotemark>126</footnotemark> The short journey from the bank\u2019s interior to the sidewalk outside could hardly be deemed flight in any event,<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> and surely any temptation to do so is removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>when it is recalled that appellant unhesitatingly honored the officer\u2019s request to halt and thereafter cooperated fully throughout the stop.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> These contemporaneous circumstances unmistakably negate any different import that otherwise might be thought to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">B. <em>The Lack of Documentary Identification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">This brings us to the episode on the sidewalk, and to Officer Franck\u2019s unfruitful call upon appellant for documented personal identification. My colleagues and I are as one in the view that prior to that call the officer did not have sufficient ground to impose any kind of restriction on appellant.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> What we disagree over is the significance, in the totality of the circumstances, of appellant\u2019s inability to produce the required documentation.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> What now follows is my assessment of that branch of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">When the subject of identification arose, Officer Franck was under the erroneous impression that appellant had attempted to cash a check in the bank. So, his admitted lack of identifying documents \u201c[r]ight away . struck [the officer as] funny\u201d;<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> \u201c[w]hy,\u201d he asked himself, \u201cdoes a man go to a bank to cash a check without some sort of identifieation[?]\u201d<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> But the officer\u2019s underlying supposition was promptly dispelled. Appellant explained that his purpose had been to withdraw funds from a savings account, and handed the blue withdrawal slip to the officer as proof.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> The officer examined the slip, recognized it as the one he had seen in the bank and realized just what it was.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> Thus the theory that until then had so firmly welded the officer\u2019s attention on appellant \u2014 a check-cashing mission in the bank \u2014 suddenly evaporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">Nonetheless, Officer Franck, in his own words, \u201cproceeded to ask [appellant] why he didn\u2019t have any identification when he was in the bank.\u201d<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> He then was told that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>appellant had mistakenly written his checking account number on the slip.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> Still, to the officer, \u201ceverything was funny\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">I know my checking account number, and I know my savings account number in my bank. I know they are not alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">I started asking questions. The questions were general questions, but everything was funny.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">I asked him \u2014 I said, \u201cMr. Witherspoon, would you mind coming back inside the bank with me, and we will talk to the manager, and if everything is okay, you can go.\u201d<footnotemark>137</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">This I read as a statement that the situation seemed \u201cfunny\u201d to Officer Franck because appellant apparently could not distinguish between checking and savings account numbers, an approach, I submit, that succumbs to <em>Terry\u2019s </em>requirement of objective unreasonableness.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> It simply defies experience as well as logic to argue that one is likely to be a criminal just because he cannot remember or differentiate between his bank account numbers. Officer Franck was, however, to voice another concern:</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">I never saw him present any I.D. at the teller\u2019s window. When I asked him for I.D. outside [the bank], he stated that he didn\u2019t have any. That was another thing that got me to wondering why a man would go into a bank without I.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">I have been in a bank, and they won\u2019t accept my badge and I.D. card. I have to have a driver\u2019s license, too.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ax-dedup-0\">And the court echoes much the same theme:</p>\n<p id=\"AOB\">[I]t is unusual for an individual to attempt to withdraw money from a personal savings account without being prepared to display some evidence that he owns or controls the account \u2014 a savings passbook or bank account identification card, if not additional identification as well\u2014 and, in light of what he had observed in the bank, Officer Franck could reasonably have suspected, when the only identification appellant was able to produce was the disputed transaction slip itself, that he had attempted to withdraw money from someone else\u2019s account.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">Both the officer and my colleagues, I think, presume entirely too much. By far the most reasonable deduction from Officer Franck\u2019s in-bank observations and appellant\u2019s lack of identification was that a bank customer had forgotten to bring along data, including identification, needed to consummate his mission; that he had tried to improvise by recalling his account number; and that, having been informed by the teller that his memory was faulty, he had given up and started home.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-14\">Everyday experience teaches that we often fall short in even the most elementary precautions for any number of commonplace events. We get caught in showers without umbrellas or raincoats; we get involved in vehicular collisions with seat belts unfastened; and we lock ourselves out of our homes. Of a piece with these mental slips are not infrequent aberrations in docu-mental preparations for the transactions we contemplate. We arrive at supermarkets without our wallets, at shopping centers without our credit cards, and at performances without our pre-purchased tickets; we even drive our cars blissfully unaware that we have neglected to bring along our operator\u2019s permits and registration cards. Who among us, including those who pride themselves for care and forethought, has not at some time or another undergone such a lapse? I daresay that appellant, for all Officer Franck knew, could have been but one of a countless number who, for any of many reasons, has arrived at a bank teller\u2019s window for a savings withdrawal without any kind of identification whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">So long as man remains as fallible as he is in almost every endeavor imaginable, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>cannot accept the episode in suit as the extraordinary event my colleagues believe it was. Much less can I conceive of it as an objective portent of crime in a Nation that does not \u2014 or, until today\u2019s decision, did not \u2014 require its citizens to carry identification.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> To an unbiased observer knowing no more than Officer Franck, the simple lack of a passbook, bank card or other documentation of personal identity or account-ownership is all too easily attributable to carelessness, absent-mindedness or sheer ignorance of the mechanics of withdrawal.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> Moreover, appellant\u2019s inability to produce evidence of that sort is too bland a circumstance to connote criminality objectively. If, as my colleagues gratuitously assume, savings withdrawals at the National Bank of Washington are conditioned upon presentation of a particular type of such document,<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> an inability to do so expectably would result merely in the bank\u2019s refusal to permit the sought-after withdrawal.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> That consequence hardly comports with the sophistication normally associated with criminals who prey on banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The <em>Terry </em>standards defining permissible stops based on ostensible criminality from observed facts bear repeating. Before a stop may be imposed, \u201cthe facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure,\u201d viewed objectively,<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> must be such as would \u201c \u2018warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief[ ]\u2019 that the action taken was appropriate[.]\u201d<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> Obviously, any inference of criminality becomes weaker as, in terms of ordinary experience, the possibility of innocent explanation looms larger. And even when the circumstances call for some amount of investigation, \u201cthe stop and inquiry must be \u2018reasonably related in scope to the justification for their initiation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> That one converses with a succession of addicts does not reasonably give rise to an inference that he is engaged in narcotics traffic.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> That one apparently of Mexican ancestry occupies an automobile near the Mexican border does not warrant an infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ence that he is an alien illegally in the country.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> That one circles a residential area with an eye for the presence of policemen does not logically generate an inference that he is a would-be burglar.<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> In none of these instances did the circumstances respectively appearing justify an investigative stop.<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> I say that the mere fact that one who applies for a savings withdrawal without the necessary credentials on his person is not so singular as to imply fairly and objectively an effort to defraud the bank, or to support a detention for further inquiry in that regard.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In my view, then, appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment \u201cright . . . to be secure in [his] person[] . . . against unreasonable . . . seizure[ ]\u201d<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> was infringed when Officer Franck escorted him back into the bank. In so concluding, and despite my difficulties with the officer\u2019s course of reasoning, I intend no impugnation of his sincerity. His testimonial performance symbolizes, for me at least, the dedicated policeman endeavoring conscientiously to do his job as best he can, but constitutionally speaking that is beside the point. \u201cIf subjective good faith alone were the test, protections of the Fourth Amendment would evaporate, and the people would be \u2018secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects\u2019 only in the discretion of the police.\u201d<footnotemark>154</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGX\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">Most assuredly, the court\u2019s holding in this case offers no haven for the absent-minded. At bottom, it means that one must always remember to carry personal identification when setting out for the bank. It means, too, that one must never forget to bring along his checkbook, his passbook or whatever else customarily facilitates the transaction in mind. Otherwise, given the court\u2019s broad authorization of intrusive and embarrassing investigation, a forgetful bank customer seeking only to conduct legitimate business could be halted and interrogated on the spot. I would not expect difficulties of that sort to be limited only to those who have occasion to frequent banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">To be sure, policemen must have leeway to investigate crime, incipient or ongoing. But the fundamental question is whether the Constitution indulges as much room as my colleagues yield, and I for one believe that it does not. <em>Terry </em>effected a careful balance between the needs of policework and personal privacy. The balance remains true only so long as each interest is maintained and protected in its own proper sphere. Today\u2019s decision upsets that balance by setting, albeit undesignedly, a trap for the absent-minded innocent. Those who view that with equanimity if not enthusiasm could benefit from what we ever so recently said,</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">[a]ny decision that holds a \u201cstop\u201d to be an unlawful intrusion on privacy invites hy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>perbolic opposition on the ground of unreasonable interference with police officers who were only acting reasonably in coping with criminals. Of course those who come into court are criminals. The other citizens who were stopped and delayed in their pursuits were not charged and so the cases do not erupt in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Doubtless more crimes would be solved if all persons were subject to unrestricted police authority to stop and identify. Why not, it might be argued, since the innocent will have nothing to hide? If one is not sensitive to the implications for an open society, no amount of comment can explicate.<footnotemark>155</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-14\">.

The restraint imposed upon appellant was exacerbated by the fact that he was compelled to forgo the sidewalk and accompany Officer Franck back into the bank for further investigation. While my colleagues treat this as an innocuous extension of the on-street stop, I am troubled by the limitation that the Supreme Court associated with permissible investigative activities of the Border Patrol in <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, supra </em>note 9. There the Court held that, on reasonably-based suspicion that a particular vehicle may contain illegal aliens, an officer may stop it briefly to inquire into the citizenship and immigration status of the occupants, and may call for explanation of suspicious circumstances, 422 U.S. at 881-882, 95 S.Ct. at 2580-2581, 45 L.Ed.2d at 616-617, but, since \u201cthe stop and inquiry must be \u2018reasonably related in scope to the justification for their initiation,\u2019 \u201d see text <em>supra </em>at note 45, \u201cany further detention . . . must be based on consent or probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 882, 95 S.Ct. at 2580, 45 L.Ed.2d at 617. Since, however, I conclude that Officer Franck lacked justification to restrain \u2014 as distinguished from approach \u2014 appellant for questioning \u2014 at any time, on the sidewalk or elsewhere \u2014 I do not reach the question whether appellant\u2019s rights were violated by his removal to the bank, or whether there was \u201can investigative \u2018seizure\u2019 upon less than probable cause for purposes of \u2018detention\u2019 and/or interrogation.\u201d <em>Terry v.

And because identification might be useful to almost anyone on almost any day, policemen will no doubt read the majority opinion as labeling \u201csuspicious\u201d in <em>Terry </em>terms everybody unable to produce identification on request. The decision is thus tantamount to a requirement that all citizens carry identification at all times, and present it to police officers when called upon to do so.

Since the record is silent on the methodology of savings withdrawals at the National Bank of Washington, we are completely in the dark as to whether its savings customers must present a passbook, an account card or any other documentation whatever. It is known, however, that banks generally have long relied heavily if not exclusively upon the customer\u2019s signature as proof of the genuineness of an order to pay funds from a particular account. Consequently, personal identification or other evidence of account-ownership may not be nearly as vital to a withdrawal transaction as my colleagues believe.

Davis, supra </em>note 109, 147 U.S.App.D.C. at 402, 458 F.2d at 821, and re-sultantly that appellant\u2019s lack of identifying documents must be indulged any significance that antecedent factors might afford. But I am unable to see how Officer Franck\u2019s nebulous forerunning impressions \u2014 appellant\u2019s attire, his disdain of repeated \u201ceye contacts\u201d and his lively exit from the bank, see Part 111(A) <em>supra </em>\u2014could succeed in imparting a cast of criminality to a circumstance so readily explainable and naturally acceptable as just another instance of human absent-mindedness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"153\">\n<p id=\"b150-16\">.
