Michael alleged that he had been deprived of procedural due process because he had been wrongfully terminated without the benefit of a pretermination hearing so that he could rebut bribery charges against him; and that he had been deprived of substantive due process in that he had been tried and acquitted of the bribery charges which were the cause for his dismissal. Although we find no error in the District Court\u2019s granting of summary judgment, Michael\u2019s contention that the applicable one year statute of limitations does not bar this action deserves some comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-19\">Michael\u2019s complaint, filed on July 2,1976, alleges an infringement of appellant\u2019s rights on January 21,1974. Each and every subsequent pleading alludes to January 21, 1974, as the date of the alleged injury giving rise to the cause of action. Finally, the evidence shows that any delay in the holding of a post termination hearing, which may have affected the time at which Michael filed his complaint, was attributable to the appellant himself. Consequently, the statute of limitations began to run on January 21, 1974, and was not subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>tolled. The District Court\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
