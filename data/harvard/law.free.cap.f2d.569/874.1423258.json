Stat.Ann. arts. 8306-8309 (Vernon 1967). A companion case, <em>United States v. Bender Welding &amp; Machine Co., </em>558 F.2d 761 (5th Cir. 1977), allowed a similar recovery against an employer under the federal Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-18\">Explicitly in <em>Bender, </em>and implicitly in this case, we relied on the employee\u2019s assignment to the Veterans Administration of his rights against the compensation carrier. <em>See </em>558 F.2d at 764-765. A Veterans Administration regulation, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.48(d) (1976), expressly authorizes the assignment. The Association argues that Texas Rev.Civ. Stat. art. 8306, \u00a7 3 (Vernon 1967) makes such an assignment void. <em>See Texas Employers\u2019 Insurance Association v. United States, </em>390 F.Supp. 142,149-150 (N.D.Texas 1975); <em>Lively v. Blue Cross Hospital Service, Inc., </em>488 S.W.2d 474 (Tex.Civ.App. 1972) (no writ).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-19\">State law, however, does not control this case. The Veterans Administration promulgated \u00a7 17.48(d) under its statutory rulemaking power, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 210(c), 621. The regulation has the force of federal law. Under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, Art. VI, cl. 2, a state may not condition a workmen\u2019s compensation scheme in a manner which frustrates the purpose of a national statute. <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Florida Industrial Commission, </em>389 U.S. 235, 88 S.Ct. 362, 19 L.Ed.2d 438 (1967) (denial of benefits for filing unfair labor practice charge conflicts with National Labor Relations Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-20\">Application of the federal regulation here is but a minor trespass on the state scheme. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Kirkland, </em>405 F.Supp. 1024, 1030 (E.D.Tenn.1975). The purpose of prohibiting assignments is to protect employees against the improvident distribution of benefits meant to sustain them during their period of disability and to protect them against old creditors\u2019 claims. This assignment does not apply to any compensation benefits except those based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>reasonable charges for health care incurred. It operates to the benefit of the injured worker because it allows the Veterans Administration to give treatment first and worry later about whether the worker was entitled to free care because of inability to defray the costs, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Also, the assignee here is the Government, not a private party. A recognized maxim of statutory construction is that \u201c[a] general statute imposing restrictions does not impose them upon the Government itself without a clear expression or implication to that effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Wit-tek, </em>337 U.S. 346, 358-359, 69 S.Ct. 1108, 1114, 93 L.Ed. 1406 (1949); <em>see Hancock v. Train, </em>426 U.S. 167, 96 S.Ct. 2006, 48 L.Ed.2d 555 (1976). In the federal context, this maxim explains why the anti-assignment provision in the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 916, does not bar application of \u00a7 17.48(d). Several state courts have reached a similar conclusion in construing state anti-assignment laws. <em>Annot., </em>31 A.L.R.3d 532, 544 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
