On appeal, Taylor contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions, and that the district judge erred by not disqualifying himself from presiding over the trial, by not dismissing the indictment on the ground that Taylor had not been timely arraigned, by denying Taylor\u2019s request that he be represented by unlicensed counsel, by permitting standby counsel to participate in the trial over Taylor\u2019s objection, by informing the jury that Taylor had asked to be represented by a disbarred attorney, and by not allowing Taylor to address the jury to refute allegedly prejudicial publicity printed in the course of the trial. We find none of Taylor\u2019s claims meritorious and affirm his convictions for the reasons noted below.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">With respect to Taylor\u2019s contention that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his convictions, extensive discussion is unwarranted. Suffice it to say that Taylor\u2019s argument is frivolous, and that the evidence of his guilt is not only sufficient, but overwhelming when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">Taylor\u2019s next contention \u2014 that the district judge should have disqualified him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>self for bias because he was named as a party defendant to an antitrust suit brought by Taylor against the American Bar Association and virtually every federal judge in the nation \u2014 is likewise without merit and deserves little comment. We hold that, for the reasons noted in <em>United States v. Corrigan, </em>401 F.Supp. 795, 797-98 (D.Wyo.1975), the district court correctly ruled that the conclusory allegations of bias contained in Taylor\u2019s affidavit of prejudice presented no legally sufficient basis for re-cusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Taylor\u2019s next argument \u2014 that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss his indictment on the ground that he had not been timely arraigned \u2014 merits only slightly more expansive treatment. Noting that he was arrested and taken before a United States Magistrate for admission to bail on July 29, 1976, but not arraigned until August 19, 1976, Taylor claims that the Government violated the ten-day time limit specified in the Speedy Trial Act for arraigning defendants charged by means of an information or indictment. According to Taylor, the mere fact that his arraignment occurred more than 10 days after his appearance before a United States Magistrate constituted a violation of the Act, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201cThe arraignment of a defendant charged in an information or indictment . shall be held within ten days from the filing date ... of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has been ordered held to answer and has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending whichever date last occurs.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3161(c) (Cum. Supp.1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">What Taylor\u2019s argument mistakenly assumes is that his appearance before the United States Magistrate at South Bend, Indiana for admission to bail triggered the running of the ten-day arraignment limit. Such was not the case for the indictment was pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, not in the Northern District which encompasses South Bend, the site of his arrest. As is clear from the face of the statute, the time limit for arraigning Taylor did not begin to run until he had been ordered held to answer \u201cand ha[d] appeared before a judicial officer of the court <em>in which [the] charge [was] pending.\u201d </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3161(c) (Cum.Supp.1977) (emphasis added). Taylor\u2019s actual arraignment before Judge Noland of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana was his first appearance before any judicial officer of that court. Accordingly, his arraignment was held within the time limit imposed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">We turn now to Taylor\u2019s principal claims on appeal, namely, alleged infringements of his constitutional rights under the Sixth Amendment. Taylor\u2019s first claim is that the Sixth Amendment entitled him to choose as his counsel one Jerome Daly, a person unlicensed to practice law. Taylor contends that the district court erred in holding that he was not entitled to unlicensed counsel and in denying Daly leave to represent him at trial. The second of Taylor\u2019s Sixth Amendment claims is an alleged violation of his right to self-representation as enunciated in <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). According to Taylor, once he had been denied Daly\u2019s assistance and had elected to defend himself at trial, it was error for the district court to permit a licensed attorney appointed as standby counsel to participate in the trial over Taylor\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">In support of his first contention that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the assistance of counsel includes the right to representation by persons not licensed to practice law, Taylor relies largely on some dictum from <em>Faretta </em>indicating that it was not an uncommon practice for colonial defendants to be represented at trial by personal friends who had received no formal training in the law. See 422 U.S. at 820 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>n.16, 95 S.Ct. 2525. Taylor draws from the history of lay representation and the deep-seated colonial distrust of lawyers noted in <em>Faretta </em>the conclusion that the Founding Fathers must have deliberately employed the generic term \u201ccounsel\u201d in the Sixth Amendment in order to encompass persons not licensed to practice law. In any event, says Taylor, Daly had received legal training and, notwithstanding the fact that he was disbarred from the practice of law in Minnesota,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was qualified to represent Taylor at trial. Accordingly, Taylor concludes that the district court erred in refusing him Daly\u2019s assistance on the ground that Daly was not licensed to practice law in any State, as required by Rule 1 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Although we are not unmoved by the sincerity of Taylor\u2019s plea for help of his friend, we cannot agree that, in guaranteeing criminal defendants the right to the assistance of \u201ccounsel\u201d for their defense, the Sixth Amendment creates a constitutional right to representation by persons unlicensed to practice law. As we have indicated in an earlier opinion, Taylor\u2019s reliance on <em>Faretta </em>is simply misplaced. That case \u201cdoes not hold that a defendant has the freedom of choice to select a nonlicensed person as his counsel\u201d but merely that a defendant has \u201ca constitutional right to represent himself and . . . proceed without counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>550 F.2d 379, 381-82 (7th Cir. 1977). Moreover, Taylor\u2019s historical and linguistic analysis has been repudiated by every court that has considered the issue of whether the right to the assistance of \u201ccounsel\u201d includes the right to representation by persons unlicensed to practice law. E. g., <em>United States v. Grismore, </em>546 F.2d 844, 847 (10th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Whitesel, </em>543 F.2d 1176, 1177-81 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>539 F.2d 1199, 1201-03 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>ABA, </em>407 F.Supp. 451, 477-78 (E.D.Tex.1975). Indeed, the question is so well settled by now that further discussion seems to us fruitless. We reiterate our prior holding in <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>508 F.2d 750, 753 (7th Cir. 1975), that Taylor was not constitutionally entitled to the assistance of unlicensed counsel and that the district court committed no error in refusing the request that Daly be allowed to represent Taylor at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">More extensive discussion is necessary for the second of Taylor\u2019s Sixth Amendment claims, namely, that the district court infringed Taylor\u2019s right of self-representation by permitting counsel appointed by the court to participate in the trial over Taylor\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">The facts underlying Taylor\u2019s claim are as follows: Following the court\u2019s pretrial ruling that Daly would not be allowed to represent Taylor at trial, the court inquired of Taylor whether he intended to retain duly licensed counsel or wished to have the court appoint an attorney to act on his behalf. Taylor responded that, although he felt unqualified to represent himself in the proceedings, he had no intention of securing licensed counsel and did not request that counsel be appointed for him. After determining that Taylor was validly waiving his right to the assistance of counsel and asserting his right to represent himself, the court then ruled that, in view of Taylor\u2019s statement that he believed himself unqualified to defend himself at trial, counsel would be appointed to serve as an adviser to the defendant and charged with the additional responsibility of seeing to it that all of the facts favorable to the defendant would be brought out at trial. Accordingly, standby counsel was appointed over the defendant\u2019s objection that the court had no right to force an attorney upon him in view of his right to represent himself under <em>Far-etta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">On the morning of the first day of trial, Taylor renewed his request that Daly be allowed to represent him and reiterated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>objection to the court\u2019s appointment of counsel. The court restated its position that the Sixth Amendment gave Taylor no right to representation by unlicensed counsel and then inquired whether Taylor intended to present an opening statement or cross-examine any of the Government\u2019s witnesses. Taylor replied that he was not qualified to do that but \u201cneither do I want [standby counsel] doing that.\u201d He declared that, because he had been denied Daly\u2019s assistance and felt unqualified to act on his own behalf, he intended to take no part in the trial proceedings and to object strenuously to appointed counsel\u2019s taking any action on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In view of Taylor\u2019s objection to standby counsel\u2019s participation in the trial, the district court initially barred appointed counsel from cross-examining witnesses and required that any objections raised by counsel be registered at a bench conference outside the hearing of the jury. Gradually, however, as it became clear that Taylor would in fact take no part in the proceedings, the district court lifted the restrictions imposed on appointed counsel\u2019s participation. By the end of the trial, counsel was allowed to cross-examine witnesses and register objections freely at counsel\u2019s table, and to make a closing statement to the jury regarding the evidence presented by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Taylor was not inhibited in any way from conducting his own defense as he saw fit. Indeed, whenever he was invited to participate in the trial, he would simply reiterate his position that he was being denied his constitutional right to counsel of his choice and that he objected to appointed counsel\u2019s efforts on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">On appeal, Taylor again relies on <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), in support of his claim that the district court infringed his right of self-representation by appointing standby counsel and allowing him to participate in the trial over Taylor\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">We recognize that <em>Faretta </em>holds that an accused has a constitutional right to dispense with the assistance of counsel and to conduct his defense personally. It does not inevitably follow, however, that this right of self-representation comprehends any correlative right to preclude the trial court from appointing counsel and authorizing him to participate in the trial over the accused\u2019s objection in order to protect the public interest in the fairness and integrity of the proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, insofar as Taylor suggests that the mere appointment of standby counsel over his objection infringed his right of self-representation, his argument is frivolous in view of the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Faretta </em>that</p>\n<p id=\"AZA\">\u201ca State may \u2014 even over objection by the accused \u2014 appoint a \u2018standby counsel\u2019 to aid the accused if and when the accused requests help, and to be available to represent the accused in the event that termination of the defendant\u2019s self-representation is necessary.\u201d 422 U.S. at 835 n.46, 95 S.Ct. at 2541, citing <em>United States v. Dougherty, </em>154 U.S.App.D.C. 76, 87-89, 473 F.2d 1113, 1124-26 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">To be sure, it may be argued that, by expressly approving only the limited \u201cstandby\u201d role noted above, the Court was implying that any action taken by appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ed counsel over the objection that counsel was interfering with the defense presented by the accused might well constitute an infringement of the accused\u2019s right of self-representation. However, even if we read the Court\u2019s statement as containing such a negative implication<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and assume <em>arguendo </em>that the right of self-representation includes the right to preclude appointed counsel from interfering with the accused\u2019s presentation of his own defense, we would still conclude that Taylor\u2019s right of self-representation was not infringed in the circumstances of this case. The fact of the matter is that Taylor was allowed to present his own defense as he saw fit, and that appointed counsel\u2019s participation in the trial did not in any manner impinge upon or undercut the defense (if it may be called such) presented by Taylor. As the district court observed in its memorandum opinion denying Taylor\u2019s post-trial motions, his refusal to take part in the proceedings and objection to appointed counsel\u2019s participation was simply a protest over the court\u2019s refusal to allow Jerome Daly to represent him. We think the district court\u2019s observation is fully supported by the record, which makes clear that Taylor\u2019s objections to appointed counsel\u2019s efforts were not based on any substantive or tactical considerations but solely on the ground that counsel was not the man of Taylor\u2019s choice. Under the circumstances, it cannot be said that appointed counsel\u2019s participation in the trial interfered with Taylor\u2019s right to present his own defense personally, which the essence of the right to self-representation enunciated in <em>Faretta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Accordingly, we hold that, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, where the accused was not inhibited in any manner from presenting his own defense, openly acknowledged his inability to defend himself, and chose to take no part in the proceedings in protest over the district court\u2019s refusal to allow an unlicensed friend to represent him, the court did not infringe his right to self-representation by appointing standby counsel and authorizing counsel over the accused\u2019s objections to participate in the trial in a manner that did not interfere with the accused\u2019s presentation of his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Taylor next argues that the district court committed reversible error by informing the jury that Taylor had asked to be represented by a \u201cdisbarred attorney.\u201d According to Taylor, the district court\u2019s comment was a blatant effort to cast the defendant in a bad light before the jury and thus to prejudice their deliberations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Viewed in its context, the court\u2019s reference to the fact that Taylor had asked to be represented \u201cby one Jerome Daly, who is not licensed to practice law and may in fact be a disbarred lawyer,\u201d was a timely and proper response to one of Taylor\u2019s periodic outbursts in which he complained that he was unfairly being denied the assistance of his friends in conducting his defense. In response, the court had every right to explain to the jury that Taylor had asked to be represented by unlicensed counsel, and that the rules of court did not allow for such representation. Under the circumstances, we do not believe that the court erred in referring to the possibility that Daly had been disbarred from the practice of law in the course of explaining to the jury the reasons why Daly had not been allowed to appear on behalf of Taylor. The record makes clear that no prejudice was intended, and we cannot conceive how any resulted from the court\u2019s remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Taylor finally argues that the court erred in refusing him permission to address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>jury to refute allegedly prejudicial statements contained in a local newspaper story printed in the course of the trial. The story, which recited various security measures taken for the Taylor trial, also included statements that Taylor \u201creportedly was arrested with some weapons in his possession\u201d and \u201callegedly destroyed his patient records when he was indicted.\u201d Out of the presence of the jury, Taylor asked the court\u2019s permission to make a statement to the jury concerning the article. The court denied Taylor\u2019s request, as well as standby counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial and request that the court determine if any of the jurors had read the article. Taylor, who had objected to standby counsel\u2019s motions, assigns as error on appeal only the district court\u2019s refusal to allow him to address the jury for the purpose of refuting the offensive statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">We think the district court properly refused Taylor permission to address the jury for the purpose of refuting the prejudicial accusations contained in the newspaper story. Taylor\u2019s request was self-defeating, for any effort to refute the charges would necessarily have entailed revealing their substance to the jury. As it was, there was no reason to suppose that any of the jurors had read the article, for the court had on a number of occasions specifically instructed the jury not to read or listen to any references to the case that found their way into the media. Under the circumstances, to adopt Taylor\u2019s proposed \u201ccure\u201d would have been to guarantee infection with the very disease from which Taylor sought to deliver the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We find more troubling, however, the court\u2019s refusal to grant standby counsel\u2019s request that the court voir dire the jury to determine whether any of the jurors had in fact read or been exposed to the prejudicial article. We recognize that Taylor himself objected to counsel\u2019s request, and that the Government was about to put in evidence of Taylor\u2019s destruction of patient records. Nevertheless, the article\u2019s statement that Taylor was reportedly armed at the time of arrest, even if true, had no relevance to the issues at trial and had the potential for casting the defendant in a bad light before the jury. Accordingly, we think it would have been advisable to ask the jurors collectively whether any of them had seen any references to the trial in the paper, so that the court could satisfy itself that the jurors had not in fact been exposed to the story. See <em>Margoles v. United States, </em>407 F.2d 727, 732-35 (7th Cir. 1969). Notwithstanding the above, we do not believe the court committed plain error affecting the substantial rights of the defendant by not inquiring whether any of the jurors had read the offensive article. The trial court, after all, had firmly and repeatedly admonished the jury during the course of the trial not to read or listen to any news coverage of the case, and the publicity involved here, although potentially damaging, did not make reference to any evidence strongly probative of the defendant\u2019s guilt that had been previously suppressed by the court as was the case in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>463 F.2d 1061, 1063 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons noted above, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\">.

No circumstance that comes to mind allows an accused to interfere with the absolute right of a trial judge to have such \u2018standby counsel\u2019 to protect the rights of accused persons \u2018foolishly trying to defend themselves,\u2019 as Mr. Justice Douglas so aptly described it. In every trial there is more at stake than just the interests of the accused; the integrity of the process warrants a trial judge\u2019s exercising his discretion to have counsel participate in the defense even when rejected. A criminal trial is not a private matter; the public interest is so great that the presence and participation of counsel, even when opposed by the accused, is warranted in order to vindicate the process itself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b517-6\">.

In <em>Dougherty, </em>after all, the District of Columbia Circuit had expressly approved of appointed counsel\u2019s serving both as a \u201cstandby\u201d adviser to a pro se defendant and as a friend of the court authorized to act independently of the accused in order to protect his rights in the interests of justice.
