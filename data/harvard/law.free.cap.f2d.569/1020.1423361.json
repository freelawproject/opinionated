Elders with violating the federal tax laws and the Hobbs Act. Subsequently, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment, changing the dates of the periods in the two extortion counts. Before trial the Government dismissed the first two counts and the indictment was renumbered accordingly. The charges on which the defendant went to trial can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">Counts One, Three, Five, and Seven: violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1) by filing a false income tax return for 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973 respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">Counts Two, Four, and Six: violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201 by evasion of income tax for 1970, 1971, and 1972 respectively-</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-12\">Count Eight: violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 by obtaining $11,830 from William Hall during the period from October 1969 to March 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-13\">Count Nine: violation of the Hobbs Act by obtaining $16,408 from Russell Fierge and Richard Blake during the period from May 1970 to July 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-14\">Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of filing a false income tax return (Count Seven) and of extortion (Count Nine). After the jury failed to reach a verdict on the remaining counts and the trial court declared a mistrial as to those charges, the Government dismissed Counts One through Six and Count Eight. On Count Nine, Elders was sentenced to the custody of the Attorney General for a period of eighteen months. Sentence was suspended on Count Seven, and the defendant was given three years probation to start following his prison sentence. The defendant has appealed his conviction under Count Nine, challenging the jurisdictional basis for the Hobbs Act charge. He also alleges that two trial errors require a reversal on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-16\">In 1967 defendant Elders became Street Department Foreman for the Village of Maywood, a Chicago suburb. In August 1970 he was appointed acting Public Works Director for the village, and on October 1, was made Director. Elders held that position through June 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-17\">In July 1970 Russell Fierge and Richard Blake merged their separate tree service enterprises into the Illinois Shade Tree Company (1ST) to provide tree service in the western suburbs of Chicago. Blake ran the company\u2019s office while Fierge handled the public relations and supervised the work. 1ST began receiving contracts through Elders for tree removal work in Maywood. Fierge, having previously worked for the village, told Blake that because the village was \u201cwired,\u201d kickbacks of ten percent of the gross billings would have to be paid to one or more of its officials. After submitting billings and receiving payments therefor, Blake gave money to Fierge who in turn delivered the cash to Elders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-18\">In 1970 Fierge made three or four payments to Elders, the largest being $400 and the smallest $100. During part of 1971, Fierge continued to pay Elders ten percent of the payments received from Maywood; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>after that Blake made the payments. This arrangement continued throughout 1972 and part of 1973. In 1973 Blake gave cash to Elders on three occasions: first, in mid-May 1ST received a $503.50 check from Maywood for work previously done, and Blake gave Elders a ten percent kickback; second, on June 6 Blake submitted one bill for $650 and another for $2000 for clearing a vacant lot in Maywood, and upon payment gave Elders and the president of the Maywood Park District $1000 in cash; and third, on June 15 Blake paid Elders $500 for the sale to Maywood of a stump removing machine which 1ST owned. After admitting evidence of the June 6, 1973 transaction, the trial court ruled that the jury should not consider the evidence as substantive proof inasmuch as Elders received the money in his capacity as an official of the Maywood Park District rather than as Public Works Director; therefore the transaction fell outside the scope of Count Nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">The defendant\u2019s major contention for reversal is that the Government failed to show IST\u2019s involvement with interstate commerce at the critical times charged in Count Nine. After noting that Count Nine charged a continuing extortion of Blake and Pierge from May 1970 through June 1973, the defendant argues that because 1ST did not purchase any equipment through interstate commerce after mid-1971, extortion of 1ST subsequent to that time could not fall within the perimeters of the Hobbs Act. The defendant further argues that the trial court should have excluded evidence of any extortionate payment made subsequent to Blake and Pierge\u2019s early 1973 decision to terminate their business. The record shows that Pierge left 1ST in February 1973 and thereafter Blake ran the company alone until its dissolution. The two had agreed that Blake would sell all unmortgaged company property and the proceeds would be divided. In early June Blake sold a quantity of equipment at auction, and the company was substantially liquidated by August 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">In response, the Government contends that the Elders extortions during the 1970 through 1973 period charged in Count Nine had at least a <em>de minimis </em>effect on commerce and were sufficient to meet the jurisdictional requirement of the Hobbs Act. The Government makes three arguments: (1) that the use of equipment purchased or manufactured out-of-state was sufficient to establish jurisdiction; (2) that 1ST engaged in out-of-state work during the period in question; and (3) that either the extortionate payments depleted the assets of 1ST and/or the inflated prices paid by Maywood depleted its treasury, thereby impairing the ability of either or both to do business interstate. The Government also contends that the planned termination of 1ST did not alter the fact that commerce was affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">The Hobbs Act, enacted to cope with the problem of racketeering, \u201cthe levy of blackmail upon industry,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was intended to eliminate interference with the flow of interstate commerce. The broad language of the Act manifests \u201ca purpose to use all the constitutional power Congress has to punish interference with interstate commerce by extortion, robbery or physical violence. . [and] outlaws such interference \u2018in any way or degree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 215, 80 S.Ct. 270, 272, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-11\">Courts have consistently held that the Act should be given an expansive interpretation to cover a wide range of extortionate activity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In each case, however, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>nexus has been required between the extortionate conduct and interstate commerce in order to establish federal jurisdiction. That nexus may be <em>de minimis, United States </em>v. <em>DeMet, </em>486 F.2d 816, 822 (7th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 969, 94 S.Ct. 1991, 40 L.Ed.2d 558 (1974), but it must nonetheless exist. Additionally, the connection with or effect on interstate commerce must have been at least a \u201crealistic probability\u201d at the time of the extortionate act. <em>United States v. Staszcuk, </em>517 F.2d 53, 59-60 (7th Cir.) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 837, 96 S.Ct. 65, 46 L.Ed.2d 56 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">A. <em>Out-of-State Purchases of Equipment </em>To establish a nexus with interstate commerce, the Government focuses on IST\u2019s use of equipment which was either manufactured or purchased outside of Illinois. In June 1970 Dixie Tree (IST\u2019s predecessor) purchased a Chevy Hi-Ranger manufactured in Indiana. In October 1970 1ST bought two trailers manufactured in Michigan. 1ST purchased a Bobcat and a trailer in Missouri, a truck chassis in Wisconsin, and an aerial tower in Michigan. A stump remover was manufactured in Iowa. The record shows that 1ST made its final interstate purchase of equipment in mid-1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">The Government argues that the ex-tortions demanded by Elders were necessary for 1ST to obtain business in Maywood.</p>\n<p id=\"anx-dedup-0\">\u201cThus, Elders\u2019 demands, if not met, would have tended to prevent the equipment from being used after it had \u2018come to rest\u2019 in Illinois, thereby damming up the stream of commerce. . . . \u201d We fail to see the logic of the Government\u2019s argument, particularly in light of the fact that 1ST was being dissolved at the time of the 1973 extortions. There was not even a \u201crealistic probability\u201d that any equipment would be replaced or any additional equipment purchased. IST\u2019s cessation of interstate purchases of equipment in mid-1971, combined with the decision in early 1973 to terminate its business, distinguish this case from those cited by the Government to support its position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">B. <em>IST\u2019s Out-of-State Work</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-10\">The Government next contends that the commerce requirement is satisfied by IST\u2019s work outside of Illinois. Testimony at trial showed that 1ST performed work in Floris-sant, Missouri in 1971 or 1972, in the St. Louis, Missouri area in early 1973, and in Gary, Indiana during 1972. The Government contends that this out-of-state work required use of 1ST equipment in other states, and that there was a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that 1ST would have performed other out-of-state jobs. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>The testimony relating to IST\u2019s out-of-state jobs was far from conclusive and, at any rate, failed to establish any plans for such employment after the decision to terminate the business. When that decision is considered along with the fact that 1ST out-of-state employment was sporadic and incidental to its work in Illinois, it becomes clear that in arguing that the out-of-state work provides an independent basis for jurisdiction, the Government is grasping at straws. Except for a depletion of assets theory, which we will later address, the Government\u2019s contention makes no sense. Without some evidence of at least a realistic probability that Elders\u2019 extortions might have prevented 1ST from obtaining additional out-of-state work, there can be no logical connection between IST\u2019s out-of-state employment and the Maywood extortions. The case was not tried on that theory-</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\">C. <em>Depletion of 1ST Assets</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">The defendant notes that \u201c[t]he indictment did not charge, the government did not attempt to prove, and the jury was not instructed on a depletion of assets theory,\u201d and contends that under <em>Stirone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960), such a variance cannot stand. The Government takes an opposite stance and, in fact, relies heavily on the depletion of assets theory. It argues that despite the absence of an explicit indictment charge or jury instruction, the jury could have found that the extortionate payments depleted the company\u2019s assets and thereby affected commerce. We need not reach this argument because we find that the depletion of assets theory is not applicable to the 1973 extortions, and for that reason there must be a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">Under the depletion of assets theory, commerce is affected when an enterprise, which either is actively engaged in interstate commerce or customarily purchases items in interstate commerce, has its assets depleted through extortion, thereby curtailing the victim\u2019s potential as a purchaser of such goods. <em>United States v. DeMet, </em>486 F.2d 816, 822 (7th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 969, 94 S.Ct. 1991, 40 L.Ed.2d 558 (1974); <em>United States v. Mazzei, </em>521 F.2d 639, 642 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1014, 96 S.Ct. 446, 46 L.Ed.2d 385 (1975). Here 1ST neither actively engaged in nor customarily purchased items through interstate commerce. 1ST was engaged in servicing trees in the Chicago area. The last interstate purchase of equipment by 1ST occurred in mid-1971, and certainly there was no \u201crealistic probability\u201d of any interstate purchases once Blake and Fierge had decided to go out of business. In sum, under a depletion of assets theory, the 1973 extortions did not and could not have had the requisite effect on commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">D. <em>Inflated Prices Paid by Maywood</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">As an alternative theory, to show an interstate commerce connection, the Government contends that artificially inflated prices paid by Maywood to 1ST depleted the village treasury and thereby constituted an effect on commerce. The Government argues that any inflated payment meant that the village had to use funds that would otherwise have been available for municipal projects requiring the use of goods shipped in interstate commerce, or the performance of services by contractors involved in interstate commerce. This weak argument is indicative of the frailty of the Government\u2019s position that Hobbs Act jurisdiction exists in this case. Although the Act requires only a <em>de minimis </em>effect on commerce, the effect still must be more than a speculative, attenuated \u201cone step removed\u201d kind of effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-10\">The inflated price issue was never raised in the trial court. No proof was introduced at trial as to the amount of either the inflated prices paid by Maywood or the depletion of Maywood\u2019s assets, or, in fact, whether Maywood even purchased goods in interstate commerce or used the services of interstate businesses. The burden was on the Government to establish Hobbs Act jurisdiction through evidence of some nexus between interstate commerce and the extortionate conduct alleged and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>proved under Count Nine. The Government failed to carry its entire burden. Under these circumstances, the question arises as to the extent of the relief to which the defendant is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">The defendant argues that because the jury failed to reach a verdict on the tax counts for the years 1970, 1971, and 1972 (Counts One through Six), we must conclude that the jury did not find him guilty of extortion for those years as charged in Count Nine. Upon that premise, he maintains that the jury could only have found him guilty on Count Nine for the 1973 extortions which he says, and we have agreed, do not come within Hobbs Act jurisdiction. We do not agree, however, that a dismissal on Count Nine is therefore required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">We cannot, as a matter of law, recognize any inconsistency, even though arguable, between the jury\u2019s inability to reach a verdict on the tax counts for 1970-72 and its verdict of guilty on Count Nine charging the defendant with extortion from May 1970 to July 1973. It is settled that a jury may convict on some counts and not on others even though they are closely related. <em>Dunn v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 390, 394, 52 S.Ct. 189, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932); <em>Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 101, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974). The defendant invites us to speculate on why the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the tax counts for 1970-72 and yet rendered a verdict on the 1973 tax count and on Count Nine. Such speculation cannot overturn a verdict, <em>Dunn, </em>284 U.S. at 394, 52 S.Ct. 189. Since we reject defendant\u2019s contention, the only relief to which he is entitled is a new trial on Count Nine. It was error on the part of the trial court not to sustain defendant\u2019s objection to the admission of the extortion payments in 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">Because Elders\u2019 conviction under Count Nine is vacated for jurisdictional reasons, we need not address two other issues raised on appeal which are directed to that count.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, since the final issue is directed to Count Seven as well as to Count Nine, that issue warrants discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-10\">The defendant contends that the trial judge abused his discretion by limiting the cross-examination of Blake. Specifically, the defendant argues that by not permitting adequate cross-examination about Blake\u2019s financial affairs after the period covered by the indictment, the court did not give the defense an adequate opportunity to explore the facts which would support its defense theory, namely, that the cash generated by the inflated billings was kept by Blake rather than given to Elders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-11\">Because a trial judge has broad discretion in determining the scope and extent of cross-examination,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> his rulings will not be reversed absent a showing of abuse of discretion. As the defendant acknowledges, the judge was quite aware of the defense theory and, therefore, did permit extensive cross-examination of Blake. It was within the judge\u2019s discretion to limit the cross-examination, as he did, with respect to Blake\u2019s cash expenditures after late-1973. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-12\">The defendant\u2019s conviction under Count Seven is affirmed; his conviction under Count Nine is vacated and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">. <em>United States v.

The opinion, if I read it correctly, reverses the conviction on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>Count IX because part of the evidence as to extortion payments could not, says the majority, have even a minimal effect on interstate commerce. Even if that were true, the evidence of extortion affecting interstate commerce on the other payments prior to the decision of the \u201cvictim\u201d company to dissolve was overwhelming. Much of the equipment used by the company was manufactured out-of-state, and the company performed jobs out-of-state throughout the period charged, including 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">The majority opinion says that \u201cthe testimony relating to IST\u2019s out-of-state jobs was far from conclusive,\u201d but this ignores the testimony which discusses various jobs outside of Illinois that were still in progress in 1973. Moreover, the testimony described eight separate purchases of out-of-state equipment used in Maywood \u2014 all substantial purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">The 1973 payments to Elders were extortion payments for regular tree and landscape work done in Maywood that year and for the sale to Maywood by 1ST of a \u201ctree stumper.\u201d The majority opinion finds that, since 1ST had decided to phase itself out of business in early 1973, payments made after that decision could not have even a minimal effect on interstate commerce. This ignores the fact that goods in interstate commerce were used on the regular tree work in 1973, and indeed, the very tree stumper purchased from 1ST by Maywood \u2014 for which Elders received a kick-back \u2014 was manufactured in Iowa. Since Maywood had determined that it needed a stumper, why is it not logical that the Village would have purchased such a piece of equipment from another out-of-state manufacturer? Why does not the sale of the out-of-state equipment of itself satisfy the \u201caffecting interstate commerce\u201d requirement? In my view, the effect on interstate commerce that is the jurisdictional requirement was adequately met to uphold the 1973 transactions regardless of whether the decision to \u201cphase out\u201d had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">This Court has held, as the majority agrees, that the Act should receive an expansive interpretation to cope with \u201cthe levy of blackmail upon industry.\u201d Further, we have upheld convictions where the extortion payment was demanded and paid <em>after </em>the event which had any possibility of affecting commerce had occurred. <em>United States v. Kuta, </em>518 F.2d 947 (7th Cir. 1975). We also affirmed a conviction where <em>no </em>effect on interstate commerce <em>ever </em>occurred \u2014 only a proposal, later abandoned, to build a building which <em>probably </em>would have required purchases out of state. <em>United States v.
