Friday\u2019s, Inc. (Friday\u2019s) was named as defendant in a suit brought by appellees International Restaurant Group, Inc. (International), F. R. Trainor and Benny E. Pittman in the Northern District of Mississippi which sought a declaratory judgment with supporting injunctive relief that appellees\u2019 opening of a restaurant in Baton Rouge did not violate the terms of a franchise agreement between appellant and Tiffany English Pub, Inc. (Tiffany), a corporation wholly owned by Trainor and Pittman. Thereafter the Mississippi defendant Friday\u2019s assumed a plaintiff\u2019s role and instituted suit in the Middle District of Louisiana seeking an injunction against the further operation of International\u2019s Baton Rouge restaurant and money damages for breach of contract, service mark infringement and unfair competition. The Mississippi case was transferred to the Middle District of Louisiana and consolidated with the case there. The district judge entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in the Mississippi case awarding the declaratory and injunctive relief sought, and in favor of the defendants in the Louisiana ease rejecting appellant Friday\u2019s\u2019 claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-16\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b961-17\">The parties do not dispute the basic facts involved in this case. Friday\u2019s is a New York corporation formed in 1969 for the purpose of organizing and promoting restaurant franchises outside of New York City where the original TGI Friday\u2019s restaurant is located. The name \u201cT.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u201d was registered as a service mark with the United States patent office. Under licensing agreements with Friday\u2019s, various third parties have opened Friday\u2019s restaurants in Shreveport, Houston, Dallas, Memphis, Nashville, Atlanta, Little Rock, Jackson, Indianapolis, and Columbus. The motif of the restaurants is \u201cturn of the century\u201d, an effect created through the placement of various period pieces such as Tiffany lamps, back-lit stained glass, bead-board paneling, tin ceilings, wooden floors, old pictures and outdoor awnings. Place-mats, napkins, menus and matches displaying the names of all the days of the week are an additional decorative peculiarity characterizing Friday\u2019s restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-18\">On December 15, 1971 Friday\u2019s entered into a restaurant licensing agreement with Tiffany granting Tiffany an exclusive license to operate a Friday\u2019s restaurant in Jackson, Mississippi. The agreement was negotiated and signed on behalf of the corporation by appellees Pittman and Trainor, the sole shareholders and chief operating officers of Tiffany. The contract contained the following provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>\u201c14. OTHER TRADENAMES AND MARKS</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">A. Licensee acknowledges (1) that Li-censor has a vital interest in the names and marks, \u2018Tuesday\u2019s\u2019, \u2018Wednesday\u2019s\u2019, \u2018Thursday\u2019s\u2019, and \u2018Sunday\u2019s\u2019 (the \u2018other marks\u2019) and expects to develop interest in businesses operated under the other marks; (2) that Licensor\u2019s present use of the other marks has materially assisted in the creation of the national image and goodwill associated with \u2018T.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u2019 and (3) that no rights to the use of the marks is granted hereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">B. Licensee covenants and warrants that during the term of this agreement and subsequent to its termination Licensee, its successors or assigns, shall not utilize the names of the days of the week singly or in combination with other words in connection with the operation of a business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">In connection with the opening of the Tiffany\u2019s Friday\u2019s restaurant in Jackson, Friday\u2019s furnished general assistance to Tiffany by providing an \u201copening team\u201d, recipes, an \u201coperations Manual\u201d, and suppliers of items needed to furnish the restaurant in order to ensure that the restaurant conformed to the specifications of the licensing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">In December of 1972 Pittman and Trai-nor discussed with Friday\u2019s the possibility of purchasing an additional franchise for the Baton Rouge area, but their request was turned down. Pittman and Trainor then formed International in February 1973 and in December of that year opened a restaurant in Baton Rouge which they called \u201cEver Lovin\u2019 Saturday\u2019s\u201d. Both International and Tiffany initially operated out of the same office space and had some of the same personnel. In fact, certain expenses incurred by International were mistakenly billed to Tiffany\u2019s Friday\u2019s in Jackson by restaurant suppliers who were furnishing items to International. However, the financial structures and assets of the two corporations have been kept scrupulously separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">\u201cEver Lovin\u2019 Saturday\u2019s\u201d in Baton Rouge is strikingly similar to a Friday\u2019s restaurant from its turn of the century motif to its menus. It is this similarity which is at the heart of the dispute presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">II. Breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">Appellant contends that appellees\u2019 use of the word \u201cSaturday\u2019s\u201d in the name of the Baton Rouge restaurant breached an express contractual duty contained in the franchise agreement between appellant and Tiffany, and that the trial court erred in concluding first that the contract did not prohibit the use of the word \u201cSaturday\u2019s\u201d, second that the terms of the contract in any case did not bind the appellees, and third that appellant was not entitled to injunc-tive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">We agree with the trial court that the terms of paragraph 14B when read in the context of the integrated document are ambiguous. More particularly, the words \u201cthe names of the days of the week\u201d as used in 14B are uncertain of meaning and susceptible of a dual interpretation. On the one hand, if the paragraph is read in isolation the phrase means the names of the seven days of the week. However, the placement of paragraph 14B and reference to the immediately preceding paragraph, 14A, indicates that the phrase refers only to the four days of the week specified in 14A. New York law, the applicability of which is stipulated in the licensing agreement, provides that a contract must be read in its entirety in order to ascertain the intent of the parties and any ambiguity must be construed against the party who drafted the contract, in this case Friday\u2019s. <em>67 Wall Street Co. v. Franklin National Bank, </em>1975, 37 N.Y.2d 245, 371 N.Y.S.2d 915, 333 N.E.2d 184; <em>Mars Associates, Inc. v. Health and Mental Hygiene Facilities Improvement Corp., </em>1975, 47 A.D.2d 5, 364 N.Y.S.2d 67; <em>Rottkamp v. Eger, </em>1973, 74 Misc.2d 858, 346 N.Y.S.2d 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">Since we conclude that 14B is ambiguous and, when construed against the drafter, does not prohibit the use of the word \u201cSaturday\u2019s\u201d by anyone who is bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>by the agreement, it is unnecessary to decide whether Pittman, Trainor, and International were involved with Tiffany, the actual licensee under the agreement, to such an extent that they also were subject to the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">III. Trademark infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">As an independent and alternative cause of action Friday\u2019s alleged that the use of the name \u201cE.L. Saturday\u2019s\u201d on a Baton Rouge restaurant markedly similar to the Friday\u2019s restaurant constitutes trademark infringement. The trial court held that the mark \u201cT.G.I. Friday\u2019s\u201d and the designations \u201cE.L. Saturday\u2019s\u201d or \u201cEver Lovin\u2019 Saturday\u2019s\u201d were dissimilar visually and phonetically, and further that the physical similarities between the restaurants were irrelevant to the issue of infringement since the Friday\u2019s chain had no reputation in the Baton Rouge area.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">The proper legal test of infringement is whether the use of the allegedly infringing mark is likely to confuse consumers as to the source of the product. <em>Penn Fishing Tackle Mfg. Co. v. Pence, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 505 F.2d 657. Likelihood of confusion is a question of fact in this Circuit, and the trial court\u2019s findings will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Out in America, </em>5 Cir. 1973, 481 F.2d 445, 447; Rule 52(a) Fed.R.Civ.P. We believe that the trial court in considering visual and phonetic differences between the marks as well as the absence of Friday\u2019s restaurants in the Baton Rouge area took the proper factors into account in reaching the determination of no infringement. <em>Penn Fishing Tackle Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Pence, supra. </em>That finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">IV. Unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">Finally appellant contends that the trial court erred in rejecting appellant\u2019s claim of unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">The district judge correctly concluded that the unfair competition claim was to be evaluated under Louisiana law since Louisiana was the forum of the allegedly tortious conduct. The gravamen of unfair competition is passing off one\u2019s own goods or services as those of another amounting to fraud. <em>Straus Frank Co. v. Brown, </em>1964, 246 La. 999, 169 So.2d 77. The court below found as a fact that Friday\u2019s was not known in the Baton Rouge area and that, while the decor of E.L. Saturday\u2019s was an obvious copy of the trade dress of Friday\u2019s, that \u201cturn of the century\u201d theme was not exclusive to Friday\u2019s and in fact is used in hundreds of different restaurants throughout the United States. Based on these findings which we see no reason to disturb the conclusion that consumers in Baton Rouge would not identify the restaurant there with the Friday\u2019s organization is inevitable. The law of unfair competition extends only to practices which induce confusion and deception of the public and does not apply when the possibility of deception and confusion is absent. <em>Huth v. Rosenzweig, </em>La.App.1946, 27 So.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">Likewise we agree with the trial court that the appellees did not appropriate any confidential information when they made use of \u201cknow how\u201d gained during their experience with Friday\u2019s and therefore committed no fraud in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b963-14\">In sum, we find that the record contains a sufficient evidentiary basis for the findings of fact of the district judge and that he properly applied the law to those facts. Accordingly his decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b963-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b963-16\">HILL, Circuit Judge, specially</author>\n<p id=\"ABg\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-17\">I concur in the result reached by Judge Sear, but I do so for a somewhat different reason than that stated in the opinion. The contract draftsman carefully divided \u00a7 14 of the contract into subsections 14A and 14B, specifically listing \u201cTuesday\u2019s,\u201d \u201cWednesday\u2019s,\u201d \u201cThursday\u2019s,\u201d and \u201cSunday\u2019s\u201d in 14A and referring to \u201cthe days of the week\u201d in 14B. I believe that the reference in 14B is sufficiently differentiated from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>that in 14A that it is not made ambiguous by proximity.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">I concur in the result in this case, however, because the parties seeking enforcement of the contract drafted the contract and determined which parties to bind to the covenant not to compete. T.G.I. Friday\u2019s, Inc. was fully aware that the Jackson, Mississippi franchisee was a corporation wholly owned by Pittman and Trainor. Yet it bound only the corporation. Neither the individual owners of the franchisor corporation nor the individuals who owned the franchisee were made parties to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Although restraints on competition are often viewed with disfavor, they may serve a useful purpose. <em>See Hazel Bishop, Inc. v. Perfemme, Inc., </em>314 F.2d 399 (2d Cir. 1963); <em>De Long Corp. v. Lucas, </em>176 F.Supp. 104 (S.D.N.Y.1959), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>278 F.2d 804 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 U.S. 833, 81 S.Ct. 71, 5 L.Ed.2d 58 (1960); Williston on Contracts \u00a7 1641 (3d ed. 1972). Nevertheless, they traditionally are, and ought to be, strictly construed. <em>Frederick Chusid &amp; Co. v. Marshall Leeman &amp; Co., </em>279 F.Supp. 913 (S.D. N.Y.1968); 21 C.J.S. Covenants \u00a7 20. If Friday\u2019s had felt it necessary to commit Pittman and Trainor to the covenants of the franchise agreement, it could easily have so provided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would leave the party who drew the contract with the restraint that it demanded \u2014 against only the corporate franchisee \u2014 and would not revise it for the franchisor to include Pittman and Trainor. <em>Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>429 F.2d 1197 (2d Cir. 1970); Williston on Contracts \u00a7 621 (3d ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">However viewed, the result is correct and I concur in it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-8\">. Indeed, the franchisor might have exacted an undertaking by Tiffany\u2019s, Inc. to require all key employees to give a reasonable covenant against competition had this been seen as necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
