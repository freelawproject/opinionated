ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">In the District Court in 1972, appellant instituted this litigation charging appellees with wrongful appropriation and publication of portions of an article he had submitted to them in 1970. Settlement negotiations commenced, and although some understandings were achieved, the parties dispute whether they ascended to the level of any sort of enforceable agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 23, 1975, while efforts in that direction still continued, the court convened a status call and during the course thereof directed appellant\u2019s counsel to report within 30 days on progress toward full settlement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No such report was made, and on March 14 counsel for appellees wrote to alert the court to the omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-19\">Almost three months came and went before the District Court, on June 5, sua <em>sponte </em>ordered the action dismissed with prejudice, effective June 25.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The order recited that \u201c[appellant] was instructed through his attorney to advise the Court within thirty (30) days concerning the effectuating of settlement agreement reached between the parties,\u201d and that \u201c[appellant\u2019s] counsel has failed to obey the instructions of this Court.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nearly a year later, on June 1, 1976, appellant\u2019s counsel, claiming inadvertence, moved for reinstatement of the suit pursuant to Federal Civil Rule 60(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court denied the motion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the view that \u201csuch relief is not warranted by the record <em>currently before the Court </em>.,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and this appeal was initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">At first blush, the question before us might seem to be whether the District Court had authority to impose a dismissal with prejudice,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> predicated as it was upon but a single violation by counsel of a pretrial directive. Were that truly the pertinent inquiry, we would be confronted at the outset by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Link v. Wabash Railroad </em>Company.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To be stir\u00e9, the Court there held that in the exercise of a sound discretion a federal judge contemplating dismissal may visit the sins of the lawyer upon the client who has freely selected him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But Link<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the cases interpreting it<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> have thus far generally approved dismissal of the client\u2019s action due to counsel\u2019s conduct only when the attorney has taken a course of protracted neglect. Here the District Court did not explicitly rely upon or even advert to such a history in either of its two orders.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>We need not, however, consider whether the court exceeded the bounds of legitimate discretion in treating the situation as one appropriate for dismissal, for it has become clear that the court did not have before it two items of highly relevant information.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> From the showing now made by appellant,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> it appears that his lawyer might not only have been grossly rather than just mildly negligent toward his client,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but that he might also have misled the client by reassuring him that the litigation was continuing smoothly when in fact it was suffering severely from lack of attention. These reassurances may even have continued long after the litigation, to the lawyer\u2019s knowledge, had already been aborted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And it seems that appellant may not have known the extent of such dilatory and deceptive conduct until after the case arrived in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">We in this circuit have held that so serious a dereliction by an attorney, when unaccompanied by a similar default by the client,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> may furnish a basis for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That is the more so where, as apparently here, little if any prejudice has befallen the other party to the litigation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because the District Court could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>have been aware of these all-important circumstances when it acted, we think it proper to vacate the dismissal order and remand the case to afford appellant an opportunity to make his presentation for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">We are constrained to conclude this appeal on a note of caution. Trial-court dismissal of a lawsuit never heard on its merits is a drastic step, normally to be taken only after unfruitful resort to lesser sanctions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> And while appellate review is limited by the binding authority of <em>Link </em>to whether judicial discretion has been abused,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> a sound discretion hardly comprehends a pointless exaction of retribution. Dismissals for misconduct attributable to lawyers and in no wise to their clients invariably penalize the innocent and may let the guilty off scot-free. That curious treatment strikes us as both anomalous and self-defeating.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> When the client has not personally misbehaved and his opponent in the litigation has not been harmed, the interests of justice are better served by an exercise of discretion in favor of appropriate action against the lawyer as the medium for vindication of the judicial process and protection of the citizenry from future imposition.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Public confidence in the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>system is not enhanced when one component punishes blameless litigants for the misdoings of another component of the system; to laymen unfamiliar with the fundamentals of agency law, that can only convey the erroneous impression that lawyers protect other lawyers at the expense of everyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-13\">.

The result we reach here eliminates the need to determine whether a dismissal prompted by an isolated episode of neglect is so contrary to what the vast majority of courts expectably would do in such instances that to avoid problems of fairness \u2014 and perhaps of due process \u2014 it should be excised from the area traditionally left to trial-court discretion. See <em>Noonan v. Cunard S.S. Co., </em>375 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir. 1967), quoting B. Cardozo, The Nature of the- Judicial Process 33 (1921) (\u201c[i]t will not do to decide the same question one way between one set of litigants and the opposite way between another\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b185-15\">. See text <em>supra </em>at notes 4-6. The District Court did postpone the effective date of its dismissal order for 20 days, presumably to give appellant\u2019s counsel an opportunity to avoid dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>missal by timely coming forward with an explanation for his disobedience of the direction to report. We need not decide whether the failure to accept this invitation supplies any additional history of dilatoriness prerequisite to dismissal. Appellant\u2019s counsel did send to the court a letter requesting that the dismissal be vacated, but, when told that the proper procedure was a motion to vacate, he failed to file the necessary papers. Only much later, when confronted by his perplexed client, did the attorney finally, and with less than complete candor, seek reinstatement. See note 16 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b186-5\">.

Appellant alleges that he repeatedly asked his attorney whether the case was in good order and invariably was told that it was. He also asserts that, although the case was dismissed in June, 1975, he did not learn about it until told by his counsel in early June, 1976. (He says that the lawyer registered surprise, stated he himself did not learn of the dismissal until receiving a letter from appellee\u2019s counsel in May, and further stated that he had filed a motion to vacate, which he had.) See text <em>supra </em>at note 5. The motion was accompanied by the latter\u2019s affidavit averring that \u201c[s]ince it appeared obvious that the parties were conducting themselves in order to carry out the settlement involved, there appeared to be no need to burden the Court with a Rule 60(b) application to vacate the Order involved.\u201d App. 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\">. Appellees argue that appellant was dilatory in not submitting for 17 months a draft of an article which as part of the alleged settlement they had agreed to publish if it was of high quality. Appellant counters, with apparent support in the parties\u2019 correspondence, that appellees knew the reason for the holdup and approved of it, and that they contributed to the slowdown by failing to review the article expeditiously and to inform appellant specifically of editorial changes to be made. The District Court will be free to delve into this on the remand that we will order, but nothing we now know indicates that appellant was less than diligent in honoring agreed aspects of the settlement.

Moore, <em>supra, </em>fl 60.-27[2], at 368 n.44. When a client does not knowingly and freely acquiesce in his attorney\u2019s neglectful conduct, but instead is misled into believing that the attorney is industrious, dismissal is not only a harsh step but one for which the circumstances provide little support for an agency theory as a rationale. <em>Cf.

Buehl, supra </em>note 11, 450 F.2d at 951 (counsel should bear costs of aborted pretrial conference and of appeal of dismissal order); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 (1970). The court\u2019s disciplinary authority is available, and its contempt powers may also be. <em>Dyotherm Corp. v. Turbo Machine Co., </em>392 F.2d 146, 149 (3d Cir. 1968); Comment, <em>supra </em>note 21, 72 Yale L.J. at 830 (court may reprimand lawyer, hold in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>tempt, or prohibit from practicing before the court for a limited time). Communication of the lawyer\u2019s action to the client or the bar association is another alternative. See <em>King v. Mordowanec, </em>46 F.R.D. 474, 478 n.5 (D.R.I. 1969). See generally Note, <em>supra </em>note 11, 51 Geo.L.J. at 332 &amp; n.94 (discussing various sanctions less rugged than dismissal and aimed directly at party responsible for inconvenience).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
