(King), a retail store in Jackson, Mississippi. McGowan made a down payment of $3.52 and executed a retail installment contract and security agreement with a detachable disclosure statement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> King had obtained the form for this contract and disclosure statement from Tower Loan Brokers of Mississippi, Inc., who regularly financed King\u2019s installment sales; Tower in turn had requested a law firm to prepare the form in accordance with the truth in lending laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">McGowan filed this suit in May 1974 pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1640(e)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging general violations of the Act and Regulation Z. In response to King\u2019s interrogatories, McGowan asserted that the disclosure statement violated Regulation Z for the fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>lowing reasons: (1) it failed to itemize \u201cother charges\u201d as required by 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226-8(c)(4); (2) it failed to disclose and use the term \u201cunpaid balance\u201d as required by 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(c)(5); and (3) it used a confusing \u201cRebate for Payment in Full\u201d paragraph. Later, in a supplemental answer to King\u2019s interrogatories, McGowan contended that the failure to disclose and use the term \u201cdeferred payment price\u201d violated 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(c)(8)(ii). Following trial, the district court dismissed McGowan\u2019s complaint with prejudice on the basis that King had made the disclosures required by the Act. The court concluded that the terminology prescribed by Regulation Z is illustrative rather than mandatory, and the court suggested that in any event King\u2019s reliance on skilled and competent attorneys to prepare the forms would constitute a good faith defense under 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1640(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">In this appeal McGowan contends that the district court erred in not finding that the failure to disclose the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d and \u201cdeferred payment price\u201d and the failure to itemize \u201cother charges\u201d violated the Act and Regulation Z.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree that the failure to disclose the \u201cdeferred payment price\u201d is a violation of Regulation Z to which no statutory defense available to King would apply, and therefore we reverse. Since this single violation is sufficient to impose the \u00a7 1640(a) liability, <em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 356, 376 n. 41, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 1664, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973); <em>see Walker v. College Toyota, Inc., </em>519 F.2d 447 (4th Cir. 1975), we need not and do not consider the remaining contentions..</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.6(a) mandates that \u201cThe disclosures required to be given by this part shall be made ... in the terminology prescribed in applicable sections.\u201d In this credit sale transaction, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(c)(8)(ii) requires disclosure of the sum of the cash price, other charges, and finance charge, using the term \u201cdeferred payment price.\u201d The disclosure statement used by King nowhere contains an entry for the \u201cdeferred payment price.\u201d See note 1 <em>supra. </em>Because of this omission, King violated Regulation Z.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">King argues that the installment sale contract itself makes the required disclosure since it has an entry showing the \u201ctotal deferred payment price\u201d as $417.36. This argument must fail for two reasons. First, disclosures cannot be made piecemeal throughout the document. In Regulation Z the Federal Reserve Board has required that they must be made \u201cclearly, conspicuously, [and] in meaningful sequence,\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.6(a), and that all the disclosures must be made together. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(a). Second, the Regulation Z \u201cdeferred payment price\u201d for this transaction, assuming the outstanding old balance is properly included in this computation, would be $420.88 rather than $417.36. Under 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(c)(8)(ii) the entire cash price rather than the cash price minus the down payment is to be included in the computation.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">We also reject King\u2019s contention that the consumer must be misled before he is entitled to enforce the liability provided by \u00a7 1640(a). The scheme of the statute is to create a system of private attorneys general to aid its enforcement, and its language should be construed liberally in light of its remedial purpose. <em>Thomas v. Myers-Dickson </em>Furniture Co., 479 F.2d 740, 748 (5th Cir. 1973), <em>citing Ratner v. Chemical </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number><em>Bank New York Trust Co., </em>329 F.Supp. 270 (S.D.N.Y.1971). The basis of \u00a7 1640(a) liability is the failure to disclose information required to be disclosed; there is no requirement that the plaintiff himself be deceived in order to sue in the public interest. 329 F.Supp. at 280; <em>see White </em>v. <em>Arlen Realty &amp; Development Corp., </em>540 F.2d 645 (4th Cir. 1975). Unless some defense to King\u2019s violation of Regulation Z is applicable, the court must award McGowan the statutory penalty. <em>Grant v. Imperial Motors, </em>539 F.2d 506, 510-11 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">King attempts to avoid liability on the basis that the Federal Reserve Board exceeded its statutory authority in enacting 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(c)(8)(ii). King argues that the Act itself does not require the disclosure of the \u201cdeferred payment price\u201d concept,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> nor does it authorize the Board to mandate the use of technical terms not set forth in the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The statutory authority for Regulation Z is found at 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1604:</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The Board shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subchap-ter. These regulations may contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions, as in the judgment of the Board are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">One of the \u201cpurposes of this subchapter\u201d is \u201cto assure meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1601(a). This court has recognized that standardization of terms is a requisite if consumers are to be able to make meaningful comparisons of available credit alternatives. <em>Pennino v. Morris Kirschman &amp; Co., </em>526 F.2d 367, 370 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">The provisions of Regulation Z mandating the use of specific terminology are within the scope of the Board\u2019s broad authority to enhance informed credit usage. That Congress did not specify the \u201cdeferred payment price\u201d concept in 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1638(a) does not invalidate the regulation requiring its disclosure. This disclosure requirement is not inconsistent with the statutory scheme, and to limit the Board\u2019s authority to require only those disclosures which Congress has expressed \u201cwould undermine the flexibility sought in vesting broad rule-making authority in an administrative agency.\u201d <em>See Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 356, 372, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 1662, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973) (upholding the \u201cFour Installment Rule\u201d portion of Regulation Z against an attack that the Board had exceeded its authority). Disclosure of the \u201cdeferred payment price\u201d is reasonably related to the goal of the Act, and the Board was within its statutory authority in mandating such disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">King next argues that even if it did violate Regulation Z, its good faith attempt to comply with the law by relying on counsel in drafting its contract and disclosure forms brings it within the unintentional, bona fide error defense of 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1640(c). See note 3 <em>supra. </em>King misconceives the nature of this defense. Section 1640(c) does not excuse unintentional violations that result from mistaken legal conclusions concerning the requirements of the Act and Regulation Z; rather, the defense is only available for clerical errors which occur despite a system for correcting them. <em>Ives v. W. T. Grant Co., </em>522 F.2d 749 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>Haynes v. Logan Furniture Mart, Inc., </em>503 F.2d 1161 (7th Cir. 1974); <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>502 F.2d 860 (9th Cir. 1974); see <em>Turner v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rub</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number><em>ber Co., </em>537 F.2d 1296 (5th Cir. 1976) (referring to \u00a7 1640(c) as the \u201cclerical error defense\u201d). We expressly refuse to follow <em>Welmaker v. W. T. Grant Co., </em>365 F.Supp. 531 (N.D.Ga.1972), which held to the contrary. The omission of the \u201cdeferred payment price\u201d from King\u2019s standard disclosure form was not the result of a clerical error, so \u00a7 1640(c) is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Nor can King benefit from the 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1640(f) defense with respect to its failure to disclose the \u201cdeferred payment price.\u201d Section 1640(f) gives a defense for good faith compliance with any rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof by the Federal Reserve Board. The attorneys who prepared the form that King used relied extensively on the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s 1969 pamphlet entitled \u201cWhat You Ought to Know About Federal Reserve Regulation Z.\u201d The model form in that pamphlet contained an entry \u201cdeferred payment price,\u201d however, so the drafting attorneys could not have relied on that pamphlet in omitting such an entry in the form used by King.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Since 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(c)(8)(ii) is within the scope of the Board\u2019s statutory authority and since King has no valid defense to its failure to comply with the regulation, McGowan is entitled to recover the \u00a7 1640(a)(2) civil penalty of twice the amount of the finance charge, or $218.02. In addition, McGowan is entitled to the costs of the action and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as determined by the district court. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1640(a)(3). The amount of the fee should be determined in accordance with the principles set forth in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974), and the fee should also include a reasonable amount for services rendered on appeal. <em>Thomas v. Myers-Dickson Furniture Co., </em>479 F.2d 740, 748 (5th Cir. 1973). Finally, that we have chosen to address only one of McGowan\u2019s contentions in reversing should play no role in the determination of the fee to which he is entitled.. The congressional policy of encouraging private litigants to aid in the enforcement of the Act dictates that McGowan be awarded the full amount of a reasonable fee for his attorney\u2019s services in connection with this case. <em>See McGowan v. Credit Center of North Jackson, Inc., </em>546 F.2d 73, 77 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">.
