Bell,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> decided today, we found some limited scope for review of activities of the Commission,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and since this case, unlike Ralpho\u2019s, presents no question beyond our authority to resolve,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we have exercised our function fully. We find that the Commission\u2019s measure of recovery contravenes the statute of which it is a creature. We accordingly remand the case to the end that the challenged awards will be vacated by the District Court and redetermined by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"AsoY\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">Melong Laitak died as a result of the conflict in Micronesia between the United States and Japan during World War II. When, over 25 years later, the Commission was established to deal with claims of loss arising from those hostilities,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> his survivors, appellants here,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> filed a claim form, praying for recompense of $11,000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the basis of their filing, the Commission issued its first opinion allowing the claim but incorporating a strikingly different assessment of the appropriate award.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This initial decision acknowledged the Commission\u2019s statutory duty to resolve claims \u201cin accordance with the laws of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and international law,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> yet it eschewed reliance on either territorial or international wrongful-death recovery rules \u2014which, like regulations applied in war-claims programs elsewhere in the Pacific theatre,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> had as their goal compensation of survivors for \u201cpecuniary damages sustained <em>by </em>them\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as a result of their loss. Those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>compensatory standards, operable as they were on an evidentiary showing, were perceived as inconvenient because \u201cmemories have dimmed and documents are much more difficult, and sometimes impossible, to obtain.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Instead, the Commission devised a chart setting, for all cases, the quantum of recovery entirely by the decedent\u2019s age at death.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Using this chart and Melong\u2019s age of 27 at death, the Commission awarded his survivors $4,400.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Melong\u2019s survivors then availed themselves of the mechanism for administrative reconsideration,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> following which the Commission promulgated a final decision<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> cleaving to the measure of recovery it had previously elected but drastically revamping its reasoning. The keystone of its new rationale was the <em>ex gratia </em>denomination of payments under the Micronesian Claims Act,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> for it read the congressional invocation of Trust Territory and international law<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> as directing it only to those laws pertaining to <em>ex gratia </em>war claims.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Territorial and international wrongful-death principles were dismissed as \u201cclearly inapplicable\u201d because rooted in culpability rather than charity.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Generalizing that \u201cunder international law, when no liability to compensate the survivors exists ... an arbitrary payment may be made,\u201d the Commission related several instances in which <em>ex gratia </em>payments of flat sums had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>made,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and suggested that recourse to an arbitrary rule in the instant case was \u201cequitable and reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Examination of the claimants\u2019 evidence relating to damages was in its view \u201cunnecessary\u201d; all the Commission needed' was the decedent\u2019s age at the last.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The Commission asks us to believe that Congress purported to bind it to the imperatives of international and local law in order merely to demonstrate the degree to which the Commission was unfettered by any legal norm, and so might act with impunity. Were anyone ever inclined to impute such queer behavior to a legislature, it could not be done here, for a ringing refutation of that view resounds from the legislature\u2019s very command.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-16\">The Act recites, to be sure, that its mission is <em>ex gratia </em>settlement of Micronesian war <em>claims</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 ex <em>gratia </em>because both the United States and Japan have historically denied any responsibility to satisfy them.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Just as assuredly, Congress intended the Commission to disregard questions of culpability under international law in deciding whether claims were to be allowed, and to debar no one simply because a nation\u2019s culpable involvement in a death could not be shown.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Yet the statute implicitly, and its legislative history positively require consideration and adjudication of claims to be otherwise \u201cin accordance with\u201d international law standards.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> And international law, though it imposes liability for death caused by unlawful activities during hostilities,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>and prescribes therefor recovery equal to the pecuniary loss consequentially suffered by survivors,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> assesses no liability whatever for death resulting from war lawfully conducted, and provides, of course, no \u201crule\u201d at all for determining awards therefor. The Commission\u2019s <em>ex gratia </em>interpretation, with its built-in premise that neither the United States nor Japan contributed culpably to any Micronesian death, would permit blithe disregard of every measure of damages discoverable in international law, and charge it only to heed a nonexistent rule. Clearly no such outcome was contemplated by Congress, and its illogic is further manifested by its relegation to the whimsy of the Commission of even those whose claims might have satisfied the international law standard establishing liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">If this were not bad enough, the Commission\u2019s reading would wreak the same evisceration of the congressional invocation of territorial law as a constraint on the Commission. Trust Territory law gives compensatory damages for wrongful death<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> but, not surprisingly, embodies no principles regarding war- claims, much less guidelines for <em>ex gratia </em>awards deriving from deaths inflicted in derogation of no legal norm. Thus the Commission, by narrowing its perspective to encompass only <em>ex gratia </em>programs for Micronesians, would ignore territorial law as it is, and hypothesize rules of law that do not and never did exist in the Trust Territory. Such a construction, leading as it does to patent absurdity, is obviously to be avoided.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">The Commission\u2019s argument cannot be supported on the ground of statutory ambiguity inherent in Congress\u2019 twin commands to pass over the normal international law inquiry into culpability but to act in all other respects in accordance with international and territorial law. Taken together, they unmistakably mean that \u201cunlawful\u201d deaths, like every other category of claims adjudicated by the Commission, are to be treated consonantly with those bodies of law, and if they are they will, as the Commission concedes,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> spark recovery of such pecuniary damages as survivors are shown to have sustained. The direction to treat \u201clawful\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d deaths identically <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> plainly commands consideration of both types of claims at the same rate and' \u2014 com-pliably with international and Trust Territory law respecting \u201clawful\u201d death \u2014 both on a compensatory basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">Similarly, every indication in the legislative history points to determination of appropriate compensation for claimants\u2019 losses as they variously appear from case-by-case consideration. The Department of the Interior, under whose aegis the prototype bill was drafted, asserted that \u201ceven though it represents a most difficult task, the [death] claims will need to be <em>adjudicated </em>in terms of the values of the early 1940\u2019s.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>man who negotiated the treaty<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> that the Act sought to effectuate used Trust Territory <em>wrongful death </em>awards as indices of recoveries realizable under the Act,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and agreed with the Department that the Commission would need to compute recoveries in terms of wartime conditions in Micronesia.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Some controversy centered around the figures he adduced,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> but no one suggested that the compensatory principles couched in Trust Territory wrongful-death awards were to be disregarded. And there was general and explicit agreement that the Micronesian awards were to be guided by war-claims awards in Guam,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> which again were founded on compensatory principles.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Against this backdrop, the Commission\u2019s effort to render meaningless the directional signals provided by Congress strikes us as an abdication of its appointed role as the trier of fact in these claims proceedings as well as a clear violation of statute. One notes, moreover, that cases involving death claims by Micronesians against the United States between the end of hostilities and the return to civil government<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> \u2014 which are adjudicated by the Commission under the same Act<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> \u2014 are valued by the Commission on the basis of \u201cevidence of pecuniary loss . . ., the age of the decedent and any history of earning capacity.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In light of that determination, and the Commission\u2019s acceptance of the necessity of adducing testimony and determining compensatory value in other sorts of cases,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> its failure to do so in death cases all the more clearly represents a departure from statute as well as from practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-18\">The scope of judicial review of Commission action is, as we caution in Ralpho;<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> very limited. Yet, as we hold in <em>Ralpho, </em>it extends to correction of violations of clear, statutory mandates.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> In the instant case, we find the unmistakable directive of the statute to be that the Commission utilize the indices of damages available in international and Trust Territory law. Congress obviously intended that the Commission get guidance where guidance was to be gotten, and this the Commission plainly has not done. Instead, it has asserted license completely to disregard every measure of death-damages enshrined in either of these vital sources of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-19\">This we cannot sustain.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> We accordingly remand the case to the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>with instruction to vacate the awards in question and direct the Commission to redetermine them in a manner not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-6\">. This case was styled by appellants as a class action, but since the District Court dismissed without certifying a class, we must treat it as involving only the named plaintiffs.
