SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b731-21\">In this antitrust action appellants, two Chrysler dealers, appeal from a District Court order granting summary judgment to appellees, Chrysler Corporation and several of its subsidiaries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint filed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the District Court alleges that various programs instituted by Chrysler in the early 1960\u2019s to increase Chrysler\u2019s sales of automobiles to \u201cfleet purchasers\u201d (customers who purchase more than ten vehicles within a 12-month period) violate Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 (1970), and Section 2(a), (d), and (e) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a), (d), (e) (1970). Appellants seek treble damages and injunctive relief under Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15, 26 (1970). The District Court granted summary judgment for appellees on each count of the complaint and then concluded its opinion by finding that appellants had not shown sufficient injury to sustain a private action under the Clayton Act. <em>Merit Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., </em>417 F.Supp. 263 (D.D.C. 1976). Since we agree that summary judgment was proper on the ground of lack of injury<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as to all claims alleged in the complaint, we find it unnecessary to reach the other issues covered in the District Court\u2019s opinion or raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">I. THE STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Under Rule 56(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a defending party \u201cmay, at any time, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in his favor as to all or any part\u201d of a claim against him. Rule 56(c) provides that \u201c[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The burden of proving that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact is on the moving party, but once the moving party has submitted a properly supported motion for summary judgment, Rule 56(e) requires the opposing party to produce at least some credible evidence beyond the pleadings in response.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AkG\">Although the Supreme Court has cautioned against granting summary judgments too quickly in complex antitrust litigation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Court has also explicitly refused to \u201cread [Rule 56(e)] out of antitrust cases and permit plaintiffs to get to a jury on the basis of the allegations in their complaints, coupled with the hope that something can be developed at trial in the way of evidence to support these allegations * * <em>First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., </em>391 U.S. 253, 289-290, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>88 S.Ct. 1575, 1593, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968). In <em>First National Bank </em>the Court affirmed a summary judgment for the defendants in an antitrust suit on the ground that a jury could not reasonably infer a conspiracy from the facts on which the plaintiff relied in light of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary introduced by the defendants. In justifying its decision the Court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">While we recognize the importance of preserving litigants\u2019 rights to a trial on their claims, we are not prepared to extend those rights to the point of requiring that anyone who files an antitrust complaint setting forth a valid cause of action be entitled to a full-dress trial notwithstanding the absence of any significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">391 U.S. at 290, 88 S.Ct. at 1593.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">In considering whether to grant summary judgment in this case the District Court relied not only on <em>First National Bank, </em>but also on the length of time (nearly six years) and the \u201cample opportunities\u201d for discovery that appellants had \u201cto unearth evidence to support their allegations.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We also find these factors relevant to our determination of the propriety of affirming summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">II. THE SALES PROGRAMS ON WHICH THIS CASE IS BASED</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">During the entire period relevant to this suit the fleet market for automobiles, like the automobile market as a whole, has been dominated by General Motors and Ford.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Around 1962 Chrysler took steps to increase its sales by improving its image and its product and by introducing special programs designed to attract more business from fleet purchasers. These special fleet programs are the primary target of appellants\u2019 complaint. There is no dispute as to the general outline of the practices appellants attack; they may be briefly summarized as follows:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-16\">A. <em>Subsidies to Fleet Purchasers</em></p>\n<p id=\"AaoZ\">After the fleet purchasers buy their cars from Chrysler dealers, Chrysler grants subsidies (also called allowances or rebates) directly to the fleet purchasers. These subsidies have taken various forms, from a set rebate that is sent when the car is purchased (front end allowance) to a guarantee that the difference between the cost of a new Chrysler and its resale value will not be more than the comparable difference for Ford or General Motors cars (rear end allowance). Chrysler submitted uncontra-dicted evidence to the effect that these subsidy programs were established because the wholesale prices of new Chryslers were higher than the wholesale prices of comparable Ford and GM cars and the trade-in values of used Chryslers were lower than the trade-in values of Ford and GM cars.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-18\">B. <em>Direct Leasing of Cars to Fleets</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-19\">Chrysler has established a subsidiary corporation, Chrysler Leasing Corporation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>which buys cars from Chrysler at the same prices charged to the dealers and then leases these cars to major fleets \u2014 most notably Avis and Hertz \u2014 for terms of four to eight months. When the leases end, the cars are reconditioned and auctioned (first to Chrysler dealers) in a way that disperses them around the country for resale.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">C. <em>Special \u201cBenefits\u201d Given to Large Fleet Purchasers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Chrysler has assigned special account executives to the largest fleet purchasers and has installed special equipment and procedures to facilitate their ordering of Chrysler cars. Chrysler has also entered into special promotional and advertising agreements with Avis in connection with Avis\u2019 leasing of Chrysler cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">D. <em>Characteristics of Chrysler Distribution System</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Appellants allege that several aspects of Chrysler\u2019s dealings with its dealers put illegal pressures on the dealers to sell at lower prices to fleets. These aspects include:</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">1. <em>Minimum Sales Responsibility (MSR). </em>Chrysler dealers have an obligation in their franchise to make a certain minimum number of sales per year. A dealer may count sales to fleet purchasers toward meeting his MSR.</p>\n<p id=\"aea-dedup-0\">2. <em>Regional Representatives. </em>Chrysler maintains representatives \u201cin the field\u201d who, among their other duties, encourage the dealers to make sales to fleet purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-15\">3. <em>Factory Dealerships. </em>Chrysler itself owns or controls some dealerships and thus has influence over the prices charged to fleets by these dealerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-16\">At least in part as a result of these programs,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Chrysler was able to increase its share of the total fleet market from 10.8% in 1962 \u2014 compared to 41.1% for Chevrolet, 27.2% for Ford, and 20.9% for others (including other General Motors and Ford products but no other Chrysler products)\u2014 to 21.2% in 1974 \u2014 compared to 25.1% for Chevrolet, 23.9% for Ford, and 29.8% for others.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Chrysler\u2019s share of the domestic retail (non-fleet) automobile market also increased during these years, from 9.8% in 1962 to between 16 and 18% in the years 1965-1972.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-17\">III. THE INJURY ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b734-18\">In order to make out a private cause of action under the Clayton Act, a plaintiff must prove that he has been or will be injured by some violation of the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Applying the standard defined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number><em>First National Bank </em>to the record in this case, we agree with the District Court that appellants\u2019 response to appellees\u2019 well-supported motion for summary judgment fails to raise any genuine issue of material fact on the question of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Appellants\u2019 allegations that they are harmed by Chrysler\u2019s practices rest on two theories. First appellants allege that Chrysler uses certain aspects of its distribution system \u2014 the minimum sales responsibility, the regional agents, and the factory dealerships \u2014 to pressure dealers to sell to fleet purchasers at prices lower than the dealers could otherwise negotiate. In six years of discovery, however, appellants failed to produce credible evidence of any kind from any dealer (including appellants themselves)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> supporting the inference that Chrysler has used these programs to coerce dealers to charge lower prices to fleet purchasers. In support of its motion for summary judgment Chrysler submitted uncontradicted affidavits and depositions indicating that its dealers retain complete discretion in pricing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> More importantly, the record contains unanswered evidence that the real \u201cpressure\u201d on the dealers to charge lower prices to fleet purchasers results, not from Chrysler\u2019s programs, but from the sophistication and buying power of the fleet purchasers and the competition of General Motors and Ford.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Recognizing the lack of support in the record for their first theory of injury, appellants rely almost exclusively<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> on their second theory: the \u201cinherent\u201d economic effects of the subsidies and other special programs as set forth in the report of appellants\u2019 expert, Professor Richard Staelin.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Staelin\u2019s report asserts that, according to \u201cstandard economic theory,\u201d these programs inevitably harm the Chrysler dealers in three ways. First, Staelin asserts that the lower prices to the fleet purchasers mean that more new cars will be sold to the fleets, and many of these cars end up soon on the used car market. The presence of more late model used Chryslers on the market allegedly depresses the retail prices for both new and used Chryslers. Second, Staelin claims that if Chrysler could not give the subsidies it would have to lower its wholesale prices to its dealers to maximize its profits. In Staelin\u2019s view the subsidy programs thus have the effect of \u201csqueezing\u201d dealers between higher wholesale prices and lower retail prices. Third, Stae-lin notes that many fleet purchasers are long-term leasing companies and claims that these companies are in direct competition with Chrysler dealers selling new cars. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>He then asserts that the dealers are injured in their competition against these leasing companies because the dealers do not receive the subsidies and other benefits granted to the leasing companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">In its motion for summary judgment Chrysler attacked Staelin\u2019s theories on several fronts. Using its lengthy deposition of Staelin, Chrysler argued forcefully in the District Court that his theories were abstract speculation and that by his own admission he was unfamiliar with the record in this case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Furthermore, Chrysler asserted that the evidence in the record contradicted rather than supported all of Stae-lin\u2019s predictions of \u201cinevitable effects.\u201d Appellants\u2019 depositions of Chrysler executives revealed that an essential aspect of the fleet programs was to disperse the used cars returned to the market by the fleets so that they would have no significant impact .on prices in any particular area.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The president of Chrysler stated that, given Chrysler\u2019s costs of production, eliminating the subsidy programs would result in increased, rather than decreased, wholesale prices to dealers.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Staelin himself admitted that, for all he knew, eliminating the subsidy programs might force Chrysler to \u201cclose its doors.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In response to Staelin\u2019s claim that Chrysler dealers are injured because discriminatory discounts and benefits are available to fleet purchasers in the long-term leasing business, Chrysler produced uncontradicted evidence that the same subsidies are available to any Chrysler dealer who chooses to enter the leasing business and that Chrysler offers special promotional advantages to encourage its dealers to enter the leasing market.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Finally, Chrysler pointed out that near the end of his deposition Professor Staelin had conceded that he believed Chrysler dealers \u201care better off now profit-wise than they were in \u201961 or \u201962, * * * that they are earning more on the average as a return on investment.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">After considering Chrysler\u2019s motion for summary judgment and appellants\u2019 response, the District Court dismissed Stae-lin\u2019s theory \u201csince his opinion is based solely on speculations and hypotheses and is unsubstantiated by any evidence in the record * * 417 F.Supp. at 272. Consequently, the court held that appellants had \u201cfailed to submit any credible evidence that they suffered individual injury as a proximate result of the introduction of the fleet allowance programs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">On appeal appellants attempt to salvage their expert\u2019s opinion by relying on cases applying Rule 703 of the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Rules of Evidence, adopted in 1975.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This rule was intended to broaden the acceptable bases of expert opinion, but it was not intended, as appellants seem to argue<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> to make summary judgment impossible whenever a party has produced an expert to support its position. Even Rule 703 requires that the grounds relied on by an expert must be \u201ca type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject.\u201d \u201cWhile appellants claim that Stae-lin has merely applied \u201cstandard economic theory\u201d to \u201ca factual basis which is uncon-troverted,\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> it is obvious that Staelin makes unsupported assumptions about the elasticities of demand in various markets<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and that he virtually ignores the impact of the dominant forces in the automobile market: General Motors and Ford.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> To hold that Rule 703 prevents a court from granting summary judgment against a party who relies solely on an expert\u2019s opinion that has no more basis in or out of the record than Staelin\u2019s theoretical speculations would seriously undermine the policies of Rule 56. We are unwilling to impose the fruitless expenses of litigation that would result from such a limitation on the power of a court to grant summary judgment. <em>Cf. Logsdon v. Baker, </em>170 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 517 F.2d 174 (1975) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">The cases cited by appellants accepted \u201creliable statistical model[s]\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> prepared by experts \u201cthrough the intelligent application of statistical and computer techniques\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> as mechanisms to estimate the impact of illegal actions on individual plaintiffs. While appellants in this case claim that their expert has \u201cconstructed a reliable statistical marketing model to explain and demonstrate the impact of Appellees\u2019 subsidy program on the market in which Appellants and other Chrysler dealers operate,\u201d reply brief for appellants at 7, this model has never been produced,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and we are not willing to send this case to trial on the mere promise that a more substantial showing will be made there. Appellants had nearly six years for discovery and for development and presentation of their expert\u2019s theories before the hearing on the summary judgment motion. The District Court allowed wide discovery, including depositions of several top executives of Chrysler Corporation and production of confidential information on profitability and market strategy. Under these circumstances, we agree with the District Court and with the Supreme Court in <em>First National Bank </em>that appellants should not be permitted \u201cto get to a jury on the basis of the allegations in their complaint[], coupled with the hope that something can be developed at trial in the way of evidence to support those allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>* * 391 U.S. at 289-290, 88 S.Ct. at 1593.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Accordingly, the order of the District Court granting summary judgment for ap-pellees is</p>\n<p id=\"AxR\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-11\">. This suit was originally brought as a class action against Chrysler Corporation, Chrysler Motor Corporation, Chrysler Leasing Corporation, and Chrysler Financial Corporation. <em>See </em>Antitrust Complaint for Treble Damages and Injunctive Relief, JA 28A. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>denied certification to the class on August 15, 1975, leaving only the two named Chrysler dealers, Merit Motors, Inc. and Loren Kirkpatrick, d/b/a Kirkpatrick Motor Co., as plaintiffs. During the pendency of this suit Chrysler Motor Corporation has ceased to exist, and its functions have been by and large assumed by Chrysler Corporation. <em>See </em>brief for appellees at ii.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b732-7\">. The District Court and the parties have concentrated on the requirement for proof of injury under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act. <em>See Merit Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., </em>417 F.Supp. 263, 271-272 (D.D.C. 1976); brief for appellants at 38-39; brief for appellees at 55-60. Since the complaint prayed for injunctive relief under \u00a7 16 as well as treble damages under \u00a7 4, <em>see </em>JA 28A, 37A, we find it necessary to consider the issue of injury under \u00a7 16 as well as under \u00a7 4. Although the standard for proof of injury is less demanding under \u00a7 16 than under \u00a7 4, the record in this case is such that the same result is required under either standard. <em>See </em>note 14 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\">.

The passages in appellants\u2019 own depositions often repeat the allegations in the complaint and are remarkable for their lack of specificity. <em>See, e. g., </em>Deposition of Raphael Cohen, November 9, 1970, at 102-111; Deposition of Loren Kirkpatrick, August 5, 1970, at 101-107, 141-145, 148-150. When asked in interrogatories to give more specific support for their claims of injury, appellants were evasive and cited to the abstract report of their expert, Richard Staelin. <em>See </em>Defendants\u2019 Cross Motion for Summary Judgment, <em>supra </em>note 12, JA 269A-270A &amp; n.*.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b735-12\">.

Deposition of Professor Richard Staelin, November 10, 1975, JA 717A. Professor Staelin qualified this statement, noting that he \u201cwould not want to say that that is because of the subsidy program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He would rather attribute it to programs such as a special warranty and product improvement. Yet his attempt to attribute all the dealers\u2019 success to these other programs and to claim that the subsidy programs not only failed to encourage this success but actually hampered it is totally without support. In his report and his deposition Staelin systematically ignored the uncontradicted evidence of the beneficial effects of the fleet programs on Chrysler dealers, including the profits made by dealers selling more cars to fleet purchasers and the profits made on used car sales. <em>See, e. g., </em>Affidavit of James Kay, Jr., <em>supra </em>note 17, '! 4, JA 769A; Affidavit of Richard J.
