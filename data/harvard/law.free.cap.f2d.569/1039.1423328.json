Joyce, husband and wife, filed claims for old-age and hospital insurance benefits under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq. </em>After a hearing the administrative law judge allowed their claims. However, the Appeals Council of the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, Social Security Administration, on its own motion, reviewed and reversed that determination. It found that when the claimants applied for the benefits, records indicated that each had more than the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>quired number of quarters of coverage<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to qualify. However, in some of those qualifying quarters the only income reported for them was from Priorview Properties, Inc. The Council determined that the claimants lacked a bona fide employment relationship with that corporation and it disqualified those quarters, thereby lowering both claimants\u2019 quarters of coverage below that required to receive the requested benefits. The decision of the Appeals Council became the final decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, reviewable by the district court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">The claimants filed timely actions for review in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The Secretary filed a certified copy of the transcript of the record and moved for summary judgment. Finding substantial evidence to support the decision to disallow the claims, the magistrate filed a report recommending that the Secretary\u2019s motion be granted. On December 6, 1976, the district court accepted and adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Claimants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">On appeal the claimants contend that their relationship with Priorview Properties, Inc., was a bona fide employment relationship and that the payments to them from the corporation were wages paid for substantial services rendered by them to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">In determining whether the quarters during which each claimant received $50 from the corporation may be counted towards quarters of coverage so that the claimants qualify for the benefits they seek, it is necessary to review several sections of the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">As relevant here, the Act defines wages as remuneration for employment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 409. Employment is any service performed by an employee for the person employing him. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 410. An employee is any corporation officer or \u201cany individual who, under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship has the status of employee; * * *.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\">With regard to self-employment income the Act provides: \u201cThere shall be excluded rentals from real estate and from personal property leased with the real estate * * unless such rentals are received in the course of a trade or business as a real estate dealer; * * 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-12\">The facts are undisputed. Priorview Properties, Inc., is a closely held corporation organized under the laws of Minnesota in 1968. The claimants are the sole stockholders. They are also the officers and directors. The Articles of Incorporation indicate that the corporate purposes, generally, are to \u201cbuy, sell, lease, own, possess, mortgage, operate, and manage real and personal property * * *.\u201d The claimants deeded two parcels of rental property<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from Mary L. Joyce and George J. Joyce to Prior-view Properties, Inc., on September 9, 1968, for \u201c[o]ne dollar and other valuable consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-13\">The corporation held annual stockholders\u2019 and directors\u2019 meetings where George Joyce, as president, presided, and Mary Joyce, as secretary, kept minutes. Rents were deposited in the corporate checking account and, except for possibly four instances, that account was used solely for corporate purposes. The claimants each received $50 per quarter<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>tion, allegedly for their services as officers and in doing janitorial and maintenance work for the rental property, renting and cleaning vacant apartments, collecting rents, and handling tenant complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">In evaluating the evidence the Appeals Council found that the primary reason for forming the corporation was a desire for social security coverage. Although it admitted that Priorview Properties, Inc., was properly incorporated under the laws of Minnesota, and conceded that \u201cthere is nothing improper about a person arranging his business affairs in such a manner as to qualify for social security benefits,\u201d it stated that the Social Security Administration has a right and a duty to scrutinize the actuality of the resulting relationships to determine if they are genuine and if the source of income is only a change of form rather than one of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">The Appeals Council was of the opinion that neither claimant demonstrated that the corporation had any bona fide purpose; that neither performed any meaningful services for the corporation; that their activities were directed essentially towards their personal holdings and interest; that the corporation was formed essentially as a conduit to transform income from investments and personal savings into wages; and that the income they received from Priorview Properties, Inc., was \u201crentals from real estate\u201d as defined in \u00a7 411(a) and not \u201cwages\u201d as defined by \u00a7 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">Claimants contend that this conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence based on the record as a whole and must be reversed. They point to evidence indicating specific and legitimate business reasons for organizing the corporation, including the facilitation of the transfer of the properties to their four children<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the limitation of their personal liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition they contend that the record clearly indicates that they not only were corporate officers, but they also performed substantial services<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for the corporation, and they therefore were \u201cemployees\u201d as that term is defined by \u00a7 410(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-12\">We cannot agree. The purpose of benefits involved here is to protect workers and their dependents from the risk of lost income due to old age, death or disability. See <em>Social Security Board v. Nierotko, </em>327 U.S. 358, 364, 66 S.Ct. 637, 90 L.Ed. 718 (1946). Because income from investments is not interrupted by death, disability, or old age, it is excluded from coverage under the Act. <em>See Delno </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>347 F.2d 159, 161 (9th Cir. 1965). It is clear that these claimants formed the corporation, transferred their real property investments to it, and received quarterly payments from it in order to qualify for social security benefits. Although that motive alone would not be sufficient to disqualify them, we do not believe that the services they performed were more than those necessary \u201cto maintain the space in condition for occupancy.\u201d <em>Delno v. Celebrezze, supra, </em>347 F.2d at 163. <em>Compare Foss </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>363 F.2d 25 (8th Cir. 1966) and <em>Gancher v. Hobby, </em>145 F.Supp. 461 (D.Conn.1955) <em>with Delno v. Celebrezze, supra, </em>347 F.2d 159, <em>Conklin v. Celebrezze, </em>319 F.2d 569 (7th Cir. 1963), and <em>Flemming v. Lindgren, </em>275 F.2d 596 (9th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-13\">We therefore agree with the Secretary and the district court that the money received by these claimants from Priorview Properties, Inc., cannot be classified as wages under the Social Security Act. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">. For the purposes of Subchapter II of the Social Security Act the term \u201cquarter of coverage\u201d means \u201ca period of three calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31\u201d in which an \u201cindividual has been paid $50 or more in wages * * * or for which he has been credited * * * with $100 or more of self-employment income, * * 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 413(a)(1) and (2) (exceptions not applicable here).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1104-14\">. The two parcels of property transferred to the corporation included a duplex purchased by the claimants in 1945 and a five-plex purchased in 1956. The claimants also owned a third parcel of property \u2014 their home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1104-15\">. The exhibits indicate that claimants received exactly $50 each quarter. The corporation paid both the employer\u2019s and employees\u2019 shares of the F1CA taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">. Although the claimants advance the facilitation of the properties to their children as a legitimate reason for organizing the corporation, the record indicates that the corporation sold the five-plex in 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1105-9\">. George Joyce stated in a sworn affidavit that tenants in both buildings had been injured on the premises and had asserted claims against him and his wife. In fact one such claim was made during the year immediately prior to incorporation and was paid by the claimants\u2019 insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1105-17\">. There is some evidence that prior to forming the corporation the claimants hired a janitor to perform these services.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
