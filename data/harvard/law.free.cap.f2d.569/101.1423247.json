ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b166-21\">Appellant herein, the Association of American Medical Colleges, prosecuted in the District Court a challenge to regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>tions promulgated by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare fixing limits on reimbursement under the Medicare Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of costs incurred by providers of Medicare services. Reaching the merits of the case, the court sustained the regulations as reasonable and consistent with congressional objectives.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find that appellant\u2019s failure to pursue the Act\u2019s remedial administrative procedures that culminate in judicial review left the District Court without subject-matter jurisdiction over the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The Medicare program undertakes cost-reimbursement to those who provide certain services to the program\u2019s beneficiaries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The amount of reimbursement is based either on the provider\u2019s customary rates for the services rendered or on the \u201creasonable costs\u201d of those services, whichever is less.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Reimbursement is usually effected through a fiscal intermediary, such as the Blue Cross Association, to which authority is delegated to administer the Act and supervise payments to healthcare providers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-18\">In 1972, when Congress amended the Medicare statutes,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it defined \u201creasonable costs\u201d as \u201cthe cost actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additionally, Congress empowered the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to promulgate regulations<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> establishing the \u201cmethod or methods\u201d for ascertaining what costs are unnecessary, and hence unreasonable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Congress indicated that the regulations should give \u201cwide, but not unlimited recognition ... to the variations in [provider] costs accepted as reasonable\u201d when those variations flowed from \u201cdifferences in size, in the nature and scope of services provided, the type of patient treated, the location of the institution and various other factors,\u201d but that inefficiency and extravagance were not to be subsidized.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-19\">In 1974, the Secretary exercised his rule-making authority, publishing in the Federal Register a notice of a proposed schedule of limits on hospital costs for routine services <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 \u201cthe regular room, dietary, and nursing services, minor medical and surgical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>supplies, and the use of equipment and facilities for which a separate charge is not customarily made.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As issued in final form after the requisite comment procedures,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the schedule divided the Nation into groupings in which states were arrayed according to per capita income.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Hospitals in each group were divided according to location within standard metropolitan statistical areas and location at nonurban points outside those areas,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and were further categorized by the number of patient beds maintained.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Dollar figures specifying the upper limit of \u201creasonableness\u201d for routine charges were assigned to these categories.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">In 1975, the Secretary published a notice proposing a revised schedule of limits on hospital in-patient general routine service costs for cost-reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1975.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The notice indicated that location within standard metropolitan statistical areas had replaced state location as the principal geographical classification factor for urban areas although state location remained key for nonurban hospital.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The schedule grouped statistical areas and states according to per capita income, and continued to subclassify hospitals by number of beds.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It was published in final form in May 1975, unchanged in essential detail.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-16\">Appellant is an association of nearly 400 medical schools and their affiliated hospitals,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> all providers of Medicare services.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In the District Court appellant complained that routine costs of a grossly disproportionate number of its members would automatically become presumptively unreasonable under the schedule as finally formulated. This result was attributed to the Secretary\u2019s asserted failure to accord appropriate weight to inter-hospital variations in patient mix and scope of provided services, and to the Secretary\u2019s reliance instead on bed-count as an index of reasonable cost. Appellant characterized this alleged omission as contrary to statute, arbitrary and capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Appellant sought a judgment declaratory of the schedule\u2019s invalidity, an injunction against recourse to it, and mandamus to require promulgation of substitute regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-17\">The District Court assumed subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> On the merits, the court concluded that, in promulgating the schedule at issue, the Secretary did consider all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>relevant factors<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and that the Secretary\u2019s reliance on an administrative exceptions-process for treatment of atypical educational costs incurred by teaching hospitals was permissible.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">While the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court held in <em>Califano v. Sanders</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act is not an independent source of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Appellant asserts, however, that the District Court had federal-question jurisdiction under Section 1331(a).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Because of the ban imposed upon such jurisdiction by Section 205(h) of the Social Security Act,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> which now is incorporated in the Medicare Act,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> we reject appellant\u2019s invocation of federal-question jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Section 205(h) is directly applicable to claims arising under Title II of the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It provides that the Secretary\u2019s findings and decisions \u201cafter a hearing\u201d on such a claim shall be binding upon the parties to the hearing.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It specifies further that \u201c[n]o findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any . . . tribunal . . . except as herein provided,\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and nowhere in the Social Security Act<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> is there any provision relieving Section 1331(a) from this prohibition. Section 205(h) also ordains that \u201c[n]o action against the United States, the Secretary, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 41 of Title 28 to recover on any claim arising under [Title II] \u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> since Section 1331(a)\u2019s jurisdictional grant was derived wholly from a longstanding predecessor \u2014 the Section 41 spoken of<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u2014 it would follow that Section 205(h), if a jurisdictional barrier rather than an exhaustion-of-remedies requirement,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> denies federal-question jurisdiction of Title II Social Security claims.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> This is important because by a provision in the Medicare legislation,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> codified as Section 1395\u00dc,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Section 205(h) was incorporated into the Medicare Act \u201cto the same extent . applicable with respect to [Title II].\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-19\">Because, however, Section 205(h) refers to \u201cfindings and decisions of the Secretary after a hearing,\u201d to \u201cfindings of fact or decisions of the Secretary\u201d and to \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>claim arising under this subchapter,\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> appellant maintains that the section applies only to formal adjudications of claims for statutory benefits and does not inhibit federal-question jurisdiction over a broad attack on an administrative regulation. Appellant insists that the issues becoming relevant when a regulation is challenged can no better be resolved at an administrative hearing than in a judicial proceeding, and asserts that in the present case resort to the administrative process would in any event have been futile because the administrative tribunal, the Provider Reimbursement Review Board,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> was powerless to invalidate a Medicare regulation. If appellant\u2019s theory were correct, jurisdiction would lie pursuant to Section 1331(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">We believe, however, that appellant\u2019s argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Weinberger v. Salfi.</em><footnotemark><em>46</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There the Court held that Section 205(h) precluded federal-question jurisdiction under Section 1331(a) of a challenge to the duration-of-relationship requirements of the Social Security Act excluding from eligibility for Social Security insurance benefits surviving wives and step-children whose respective relationships to a deceased wage earner have endured for less than nine months prior to his death.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> A district court had ruled in favor of Section 1331(a) jurisdiction, concluding that Section 205(h) was merely a codification of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The Supreme Court disagreed:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">That the third sentence of \u00a7 [2]05(h)<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> is more than a codified requirement of administrative exhaustion is plain from its own language, which is sweeping and direct and which states that <em>no </em>action shall be brought under \u00a7 1331, not merely that only those actions shall be brought in which administrative remedies have been exhausted.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-16\">Moreover, the <em>Salfi </em>Court held that the reach of Section 205(h) \u201cextends to any \u2018action\u2019 seeking \u2018to recover on any [Title II Social Security] claim<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> \u2014 irrespective of whether resort to judicial processes is necessitated by discretionary decisions of the Secretary or by his <em>nondiseretionary application of allegedly unconstitutional statutory restrictions.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>52</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Restriction of district court examination of constitutional challenges to that authorized by the Social Security Act\u2019s review provision<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> was deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201cmanifestly reasonable\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> because it assured the Secretary the opportunity to ascertain prior to constitutional litigation whether the claims involved were invalid for other reasons or perhaps cognizable under other provisions of the Act.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">So, under <em>Salfi, </em>quite aside from exhaustion considerations, jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1331(a) is negated by Section 205(h) with respect to any action envisioning recovery on any claim emanating from Title II of the Social Security Act. To precisely \u201cthe same extent,\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> the \u201csweeping and direct\u201d language of Section 205(h)<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> precludes Section 1331(a) jurisdiction of suits seeking eventual realization of provider-cost reimbursement under the Medicare Act. It cannot be gainsaid that the case at bar arises under the Medicare Act, for it supplies \u201cboth the standing and the substantive basis for the presentation of [appellant\u2019s] . . . contentions.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Nor can it be doubted that Section 205(h) intercepts litigation confronted by the spec-tre of \u201cnondiscretionary application of allegedly unconstitutional restrictions\u201d imposed by an administrative regulation as well as by a statute.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> And no less than its counterpart in the Social Security Act is the review provision of the Medicare Act<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u201cmanifestly reasonable\u201d palliative.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\">Even assuming, then, that appellant or its members could not obtain relief from the Secretary\u2019s allegedly defective regulation through the Medicare Act\u2019s administrative processes<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> because of the Provider Reimbursement Review Board\u2019s inability to repudiate the governing regulation,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> jurisdiction still would not lie under Section 1331(a).<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The <em>Salfi </em>plaintiffs clearly could not have obtained from the Secretary a ruling of unconstitutionality of a statute that the Secretary was bound to enforce, yet their action was denied federal-question jurisdiction, and resort to the administrative process was required. Appellant\u2019s contention that the availability of federal-question jurisdiction of this lawsuit depends upon whether the issues in dispute can be dealt with better at an administrative hearing than in a judicial proceeding must accordingly fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">We further conclude that jurisdiction of this litigation cannot be founded upon Section 1395oo of the Medicare Act, which specifies the scheme for administrative and judicial treatment of provider-reimbursement claims.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> That section authorizes review of disputed claims by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and among the situations in which audience may be obtained before the Board is when a provider is dissatisfied with the total amount of reimbursement approved by the fiscal intermediary.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Jurisdiction is bestowed on the federal courts to review a \u201cfinal decision\u201d of the Board or a \u201creversal, affirmance, or modification\u201d of such a decision by the Secretary.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>In <em>Salfi, </em>the Supreme Court, after examining the language of the review provision applicable there \u2014 Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> \u2014 held that a central precondition to federal-court jurisdiction under that provision was that a suitor first obtain a \u201cfinal decision\u201d by the Secretary.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Although the Court recognized a limited role for traditional exhaustion principles in determining what constitutes a \u201cfinal\u201d decision by the Secretary \u201cmade after a hear-</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00a7 1395oo(f) (Supp. Ill 1973). The 1974 amendment of \u00a7 1395oo(f), effective for accounting periods ending on or after June 30, 1973, authorizes judicial review of final decisions of the Board and of any reversal, affirmance or modification of any Board decision by the Secretary. Act of Oct. 26, 1974, Pub.L.No. 93-484, \u00a7 3(a)-(b), 88 Stat. 1459. ing,\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> the Court emphasized that Section 205(g)\u2019s demand for <em>some </em>\u201cfinal decision\u201d was a jurisdictional prerequisite and not simply a codification of the exhaustion doctrine.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Thus the requirement \u201cmay not be dispensed with merely by a judicial conclu-si0n of futility.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5R\">Similarly, Section 1395oo of the Medicare Act exacts an administrative determination as a jurisdictional postulate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>More specifically, before a suitor may obtain judicial consideration of a claim arising under the Medicare Act, he must first present the claim to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board and obtain a \u201cfinal decision\u201d by it.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The nature of the claim may influence the type of proceeding needed,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> but some kind of proceeding before the Board is indispensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Although appellant disputes the amount of cost-reimbursement obtainable through its members\u2019 fiscal intermediaries, it does not deny that Section 1395oo in terms authorizes Board consideration of its members\u2019 claims.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The Board was indeed an available forum for members\u2019 claims for \u201cfull\u201d reimbursement,<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> and an administrative grant to the members of an exception from the challenged regulation \u2014 a disposition within the Board\u2019s power<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> \u2014 may well have made further litigation unnecessary. If, as appellant alleges, the exception process is unduly burdensome, it nonetheless could have presented the reimbursement claims without pursuing an exception; and, in either event, if the claims were turned down, judicial review of the Board\u2019s final decision would have been available. The Secretary would thereby have been assured the opportunity to determine whether the claims were invalid for other reasons or cognizable under other theories,<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> and a reviewing court would have been assisted in its scrutiny of the challenged regulation by its application to particular facts. Having failed to resort to the administrative process delineated in Section 1395oo, appellant may not now predicate jurisdiction on that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Although appellant has not asserted on appeal additional grounds for jurisdiction, it did invoke the federal mandamus provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361,<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> in its com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>plaint.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> And in any event, we are sensitive to an obligation to explore any promising avenue to the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction, whether or not suggested by the parties.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> So it is that we have come to focus on Section 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">There is a substantial question whether Section 205(h) of the Social Security Act shuts off all bases of judicial review of Title II claims other than those supplied by the Act itself. Although <em>Salfi </em>did not expressly resolve the issue,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> we believe that such a bar derives naturally from <em>Salfi, </em>at least when the Act\u2019s review procedures do allow judicial consideration of the particular action. Section 205(h)\u2019s restraints are imposed upon Medicare claims,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> and because Section 1395oo of the Medicare Act plainly authorized review of the action here,<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> we hold that appellant may not rely upon the mandamus statute as a predicate for federal-court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Both the language of Section 205(h) and the reasoning in <em>Salfi </em>make clear that section\u2019s function to channel actions through available statutory review procedures. To the extent presently relevant, Section 205(h) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">No findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided. No action against the United States, the Secretary, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 41 of Title 28<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">In light of these prohibitions, the <em>Salfi </em>Court held that Section 205(h) required that the constitutional challenges there ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>vanced \u201cbe brought under jurisdictional grants contained in the Act,\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> and that \u201c[o]ther sources of jurisdiction [were] foreclosed by \u00a7 [2]05(h).\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> The Court dismissed the claims of unnamed members of the plaintiff class who had not exhausted administrative remedies,<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> without consideration of possible alternative jurisdictional bases, even though Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act and Section 1361 were also asserted as grounds for jurisdiction in that case.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Surely if constitutional litigation in the general Social Security area must proceed, not in the federal courts pursuant to Section 1331, but according to the course of review authorized by the Social Security Act, actions alleging no more than a violation of a <em>statutory </em>obligation \u2014 and hence normally amenable to mandamus review<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> \u2014may not fairly be excused from the administrative process prescribed. Congress could not have intended that an agency be given the opportunity to hear claims ultimately presenting constitutional contentions beyond its power to resolve, but not challenges to its own regulations and practices no less susceptible to some amount of administrative investigation and resolution, and perhaps even satisfiable in the course of internal review.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">To be sure, Section 205(h) in terms identifies only \u201csection 41 of Title 48[28]\u201d as a forbidden source of jurisdiction,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> and the mandamus provision was never part of Section 41.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> But, at the time Section 205(h) was enacted into law, Section 41 encompassed all possible sources of federal-court jurisdiction over issues of the type presented herein.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> We remain convinced, therefore, that Section 205(h) is a ban on jurisdiction by way of federal mandamus in a case, such as this, in which statutory procedures authorize review of the particular action.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">We find support for our decision in the reasoning of several other courts of appeals. Despite Section 205(h) and the broad language in <em>Salfi,</em><footnotemark><em>96</em></footnotemark><em> </em>jurisdiction on grounds other than Section 1331 has been recognized, albeit cautiously, when <em>no </em>provision for review of the particular claims was made in the Act<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> The courts generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>agree, however, that when review procedures applicable to the claim at issue are provided in the Social Security Act, substitute bases for jurisdiction are not to be allowed.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> Indeed, to hold that the review provisions of Title II of the Social Security Act and those of the Medicare Act are not exclusive when applicable to the claims in dispute would be to ignore the clear implications of Section 205(h) as construed by the Supreme Court in <em>Salfi.</em><footnotemark><em>99</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">We realize that mandamus may become available in limited circumstances not involved here. Had appellant alleged undue delay or plain departure from statutory procedures, perhaps mandamus could have been employed to compel the Secretary to adhere to the requirements of Section 1395 oo. Such a result would not interfere with the Board\u2019s decision on the merits of a claim; it would simply ensure that consideration of the claim would be properly and indeed, expeditiously afforded.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Appellant very nearly brings its case within this area by alleging inherent unfairness of the exception procedures, but its attack remains essentially a challenge to the Secretary\u2019s Medicare regulation. Appellant has not suggested that it was denied reasonably prompt treatment of an exception claim,<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> nor that there is any deficiency in Board procedures that Section 1395oo expressly authorizes. Even assuming that the exception procedures are inadequate, appellant has not shown that it may not obtain a \u201cfinal decision\u201d by the Board, without pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>suing the exception process on its claim for full reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">We conclude, then, that appellant has failed to demonstrate federal-court jurisdiction under any of the avenues considered. Resultantly, the District Court was without power to entertain appellant\u2019s action. The judgment appealed from is accordingly vacated, and the case is remanded for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">.

The Court held that the Secretary had full authority under the Act to specify exhaustion requirements serving his interest in effective administration of the Act. In a case such as <em>Salfi, </em>the Secretary might properly conclude that because the only issue was the constitutionality of a statutory demand, and the claim was neither invalid nor cognizable under a different section of the Act, exhaustion beyond the presentation of claims for benefits to the plaintiffs\u2019 district Social Security office and then to the regional office for reconsideration \u2014 which some of the plaintiffs had done in that case \u2014 would have been futile and inefficient.

The Court concluded that a denial of benefits based on the plain wording of the statute alleged to be constitutionally defective was a \u201cdecision\u201d of the Secretary for purposes of \u00a7 205(g), even though the Secretary was powerless to deviate from the statutory mandate. <em>Id. </em>at 764, 95 S.Ct. at 2466, 45 L.Ed.2d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\"><em>Mathews v.

The Court, following <em>Salfi, </em>held that \u00a7 205(h) precluded federal-question jurisdiction, and then explained the nature of the \u00a7 205(g) exhaustion requirement as interpreted in Salfi:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\"><em>Salfi </em>identified several conditions which must be satisfied in order to obtain judicial review under \u00a7 405(g).

Implicit in <em>Salfi, </em>however, is the principle that this condition consists of two elements, only one of which is purely \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in the sense that it cannot be \u201cwaived\u201d by the Secretary in a particular case. The waivable element is the requirement that the administrative remedies prescribed by the Secretary be exhausted. <em>The nonwaivable element is the requirement that a claim for benefits shall have been presented to the Secretary. Absent such a claim there can be no \u201cdecision\" of any type. And some decision by the Secretary is clearly required by the statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">424 U.S. at 328, 96 S.Ct. at 899, 47 L.Ed.2d at 29 (emphasis supplied) (footnote omitted). The Court held that Eldridge had fulfilled the crucial prerequisite of presentation of his claim for benefits to the Secretary. Eldridge had answered a state agency\u2019s questionnaire concerning his eligibility, and in a letter in response to a tentative ruling of noneligibility Eldridge had specifically advanced the claim that in light of his continuing disability his benefits should not be terminated. This claim was denied by the state agency, and that decision was accepted by the Social Security Administration. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 96 S.Ct. at 900, 47 L.Ed.2d at 30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"74\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\">.
