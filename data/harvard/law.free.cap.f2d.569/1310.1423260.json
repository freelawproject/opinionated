The district court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, finding that the uncontroverted facts appearing in the affidavits failed to constitute the \u201cacts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence indifference to serious medical needs\u201d required by the Supreme Court in <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 51 (1976). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-14\">On May 24,1975, plaintiff was incarcerated in the Orange County Jail, where he received no medical attention until November 5,1975, one day after making a written request for an examination. The medical examination revealed elevated blood pressure. The examining physician stated that plaintiff\u2019s high blood pressure presented \u201cno true danger\u201d or \u201cserious threat\u201d to his health, and prescribed medication. Plaintiff also complained of continuing shoulder pain from an accident in 1972. Plaintiff\u2019s shoulder was not treated, as the doctor found that plaintiff had \u201cessentially satisfactory and a full range of motion.\u201d Dickson admits that satisfactory medical care was administered to him from November 5, 1975 until December 17, 1975, but insists that for 33 days following December 17 he received no treatment because his medical records were not transferred to his new place of incarceration. Plaintiff asserts that he repeatedly requested medical care between May 25, 1975 and November 5, 1975, and for the 33 days following December 17, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-15\">In <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 51 (1976), the Supreme Court considered a section 1983 suit alleging inadequate medical treatment. The Court held that inadequate medical care did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment cognizable under section 1983 unless the mistreatment rose to the level of <em>\u201cdeliberate </em>indifference to <em>serious </em>medical needs\u201d (emphasis added). 429 U.S. 97,106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 51 (1976). The uncon-troverted facts of this case manifestly belie the existence of the requisite deliberation and gravity. <em>See Gamble v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 554 F.2d 653, 654 (on remand). <em>Cf. Procunier v. </em>Navarette,-U.S.-, 98 S.Ct. 855, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (finding prison officials immune from suit under section 1983 where there was no conscious disregard of constitutional rights). Defendants did not receive a written request for a medical examination until November 4, 1975, and plaintiff obtained an examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>the next day. Plaintiff admitted that he did not see a doctor or a nurse before November 5, and that his complaints of dizziness and headaches were made to his guards. Under the uncontroverted circumstances of this ease, we find that the district court was not in error in holding that plaintiff could not demonstrate that whatever mistreatment he received was deliberate in character. The seriousness of the medical needs was contradicted by the affidavit of the examining physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
