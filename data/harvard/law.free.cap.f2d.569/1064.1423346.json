He claimed to be the victim of discrimination in favor of Mexican-American and American-Indian applicants, and he sought relief pursuant to the Fifth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982, and 1983; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) and (j); and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16. He also sought mandatory relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-16\">The district judge dismissed the complaint insofar as it rested upon any basis other than 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16 because of the decision in <em>Brown v. General Services Administration, </em>425 U.S. 820, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976), which held that section 2000e-16 is the exclusive remedy for discriminatory federal employment practices. This ruling was unquestionably correct and we affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-17\">The district judge also dismissed the complaint under section 2000e-16 because he found that Scott had failed to present a charge of racial discrimination to the EEOC or to the Civil Service Commission in his appeal to that agency. Our review of the record confirms that this finding is correct. Although Scott complained to both the EEOC and the Civil Service Commission that he had been promised but never actually given supervisory level employment with the EEOC, we discover no indication in the record that the motive of racial discrimination was alleged anywhere prior to the commencement of this action. Thus, the \u201ccomplaint of discrimination\u201d required by section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>2000e-16(c) was never filed. Until that remedy is exhausted, Scott cannot seek relief in the federal courts. <em>Brown v. General Services Administration, supra, </em>425 U.S. at 832, 96 S.Ct. 1961; <em>Swain v. Hoffman, </em>547 F.2d 921, 923 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
