Specifically, the plaintiff charged that the policy provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>relative to the payment of pregnancy benefits was discriminatory because it required that the named insured also enroll all of his or her dependents in the plan in order to establish entitlement to such benefits. In a thorough and well reasoned opinion the district judge, noting that the dependency requirement applied with equal force to male as well as female employees, concluded that the alleged discrimination, if any, was based upon the marital status of the participant and did not give rise to a cause of action for sex discrimination under either Title VII or the Equal Pay Act. We agree with this conclusion and affirm for reasons sufficiently stated in the opinion of the district court. <em>Willett v. Emory and Henry College, 421 </em>F.Supp. 631 (W.D.Va.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
