He was sentenced to three years imprisonment and a three-year special parole term.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-25\">Eldridge\u2019s jury was selected on March 9, 1977, and directed to return for trial on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>March 23. Eldridge moved to quash the jury panel on various grounds, one of which was that possibly a juror might serve on other juries before his trial. The motion was overruled, the court advising counsel that he could develop a record on the issue at the time of trial. Trial was twice continued on motions by appellant and did not begin until June 6, 1977. When it did begin, Eldridge voiced no further objection to juror or panel and sought to make no record. The jury convicted, and now he seeks to raise the foregoing objection on appeal, grounding it in a letter signed by a deputy clerk and attached to his brief. This letter avers that four of Eldridge\u2019s jurors did interim service in a somewhat similar ease.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Defendant\u2019s failure to call the court\u2019s attention to this matter at trial when he had been given leave to do so and told that this would be the time to go into it,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to make any record, or object in any manner waived the point. <em>Cf. Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Since Eldridge\u2019s sole issue was not properly preserved for appeal, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\">. In which, it also asserts, there was an acquittal. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Mutchler, </em>559 F.2d 955 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>opinion amended, </em>566 F.2d 1044 (5th Cir. Sept. 21, 1977); <em>United States v. Jefferson, </em>569 F.2d 260 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\">. When the objection was made at voir dire, the judge stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">I will give you opportunity to prove your record at the time of trial. Right now I don\u2019t think there is any point in going into that because I probably wouldn\u2019t remember what you want me to do at that time, but when we get ready to go to trial, when we have got your jury in the box and the Government is going to call its first witness, then if you have any record that you want to make as far as your particular case is concerned, I will hear you. If I decide I am going to let you do it, we will do it. If I decide I am not going to let you do it, we won\u2019t do it, but I don\u2019t want to go into that now because that is something you all can raise at the time we actually call the case for trial and I don\u2019t think it is going to help any to raise that now.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
