Finding his contentions without merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">Testimony at trial established that the firearm, a .25 caliber pistol, was shipped from Miami, Florida, to a licensed dealer in Yazoo City, Mississippi. It then was sold to a Martha Jackson. On January 8, 1977, Allen Bigford had possession of the pistol when he and Thrasher were drinking. Early the following morning police officers found them drunk in Thrasher\u2019s car. The pistol was in appellant\u2019s coat pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Thrasher\u2019s first contention is that the evidence was insufficient to prove he had knowledge the firearm was shipped in interstate commerce. The law is well settled, however, that the government is not required to prove knowledge of the interstate nexus of the firearm. See <em>United States v. Manley, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 563 F.2d 779, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">Thrasher also argues that he was indicted under the wrong statute. He points out that 18 U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) contains a provision similar to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(h)(1) prohibiting receipt of firearms by a felon and carrying a lesser maximum penalty. These statutes were enacted simultaneously by different titles of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. See <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488. In absence of any language to the contrary, however, the government has the discretion to prosecute under either statute, regardless of whether one allows a harsher sentence. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>8 Cir., 1975, 522 F.2d 388; <em>Mauney v. United States, </em>6 Cir., 1972, 454 F.2d 273. <em>Cf. United States </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 441 F.2d 1285, 1287, <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 833, 92 S.Ct. 81, 30 L.Ed.2d 63 (government has discretion to prosecute for fraudulent misapplication of investment company funds, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 657, or for fraudulent receipt of such funds, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1006).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
