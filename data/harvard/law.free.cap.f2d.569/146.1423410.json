The facts are simple and undisputed. In 1971, Winter filed a grievance asserting that seniority should be awarded on a company-wide, rather than on a plant-wide, basis. Winter\u2019s assertion contradicted long-standing industry practice under the current and preceding collective bargaining contracts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After several meetings with management (one of which Winter attended) the union decided not to process the grievance further. Winter neither protested nor appealed. Three years later, Winter filed a similar grievance. The union arranged a meeting with management, which Winter failed to attend. Winter did not notify the union to explain his absence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In light of Winter\u2019s failure to appear, and in light of the fact that Winter\u2019s 1974 grievance was largely a restatement of his 1971 grievance, which had been disposed of on the merits, the union declined to process the 1974 grievance further.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">On 3 April 1974 Winter brought suit under \u00a7 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He alleged that Maloney had breached the collective bargaining contract by refusing to award him company-wide seniority, and that Local 639 had breached its duty of fair representation by refusing to process his grievance out of political hostility towards him. The district court granted summary judgment both to the union and to the employer, on the ground that Winter had failed to exhaust his internal union remedies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm both grants of summary judgment, although our reasoning departs somewhat from that of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">A. <em>Winter\u2019s Suit Against the Union</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">The Landrum-Griffin Act specifically permits unions to require their members to exhaust internal union remedies before suing the union.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although this language is discretionary, the circuit courts have unanimously upheld the exhaustion requirement and commended its utility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the union constitution and by-laws offer several remedies and expressly require that they be exhausted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The constitution provides that an aggrieved member may file charges with the local Executive Board; if he loses there, he may appeal to the General Executive Board, which may try the case <em>de novo </em>and must in any event render decision within 15 days.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The constitution also provides for direct appeal to the International president.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Winter concededly failed to avail himself of these remedies. He seeks to excuse his neglect by arguing that exhaustion of union remedies would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Exhaustion of intra-union remedies could be futile for two reasons. First, the union constitution might provide no adequate procedural route to the relief requested. In this case, the plaintiff seeks both money damages and an injunction directing Local 639 to process his grievances nondiscriminatorily in the future.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Winter probably could not have obtained money damages through union disciplinary channels. The union constitution provides, however, that decisions and penalties imposed in disciplinary proceedings \u201cmay consist of . commands to do or perform, or refrain from doing or performing, specified acts.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Winter could thus have obtained some of what he seeks, <em>viz., </em>an injunction, by a favorable outcome in the union proceedings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since the courts generally have insisted on a \u201cclear and positive showing of futility\u201d before excusing a failure to exhaust,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we conclude that Winter cannot be excused on the ground that the absence of available procedures would have made exhaustion futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">Exhaustion might be futile, secondly, because union officials are so hostile to a worker that he could not hope to get a fair hearing, regardless of the procedures available. The cases that have excused failure to exhaust on this ground, however, including the cases plaintiff cites,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> have involved quite extreme facts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Evidently, in order to prevail on this ground Winter must make a specific and convincing showing of union animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">This showing can be made in two ways. First, it might be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the grievance process. In this case, however, the facts create no inference of union hostility, arbitrariness, or bad faith. Plaintiff was proffering, for the second time, what seems to have been a frivolous interpretation of the contract, and inexcusably failed to attend a grievance meeting the union had arranged. Given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>this, the union\u2019s election not to process his grievance further gives rise to no suggestion of hostility!</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Second, a showing of hostility can be made by citing concrete evidence of personal animus. Winter does not do so. He presents some evidence that relevant union officials knew of his political activities in opposition to them.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He then makes conclusory allegations that the union was hostile to him on this account.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>. No evidence of actual hostility is shown. In fact, plaintiff\u2019s claim seems ultimately to be that he is excused from exhausting union remedies by the mere fact that he has made sworn allegations that the union\u2019s conduct was \u201cpolitically motivated, in bad faith, and discriminatory.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This argument is without merit. In any suit alleging unfair representation, the union member will make allegations (sworn or unsworn) that the union\u2019s conduct was politically motivated, in bad faith, and discriminatory. That, indeed, is the gravamen of his case in chief. If such allegations suffice to justify failure to exhaust union remedies, the exhaustion requirement is a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Such allegations, at any rate, do not satisfy Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). In order to survive a motion for summary judgment under that rule, a party \u201cmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Plaintiff here has set forth no specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue regarding union hostility towards him,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and hence regarding the futility of exhausting available union remedies. For this reason, the district judge properly awarded summary judgment in favor of Local 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">B. <em>Winter\u2019s Suit Against the Employer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">The district court held that the defense of failure to exhaust intra-union remedies was available, not only to the union, but also to the employer. We disagree, at least on the facts of this case. The few courts that have considered this question have held, almost unanimously, that the defense of failure to exhaust union remedies is <em>not </em>available to the employer.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The reason is that the union constitution, which provides for the internal remedies, is a \u201ccontract\u201d only between the union and its members, and the employer cannot avail himself of the union\u2019s contractual defense.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> No court of appeals has held that the defense is available to the employer; one circuit has said in dictum that it is not.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The only court of appeals to suggest otherwise was the Seventh Circuit in <em>Orphan v. Furn-co Construction </em>Corp.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which implied that the employer might raise the exhaustion defense if he could show a <em>\u201cformal appeal </em>or other procedure provided by the Union constitution or by-laws which so <em>certainly holds out the prospect of . . relief </em>that the plaintiffs could justifiably be ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>pected to have recourse to it before filing suit.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In <em>Orphan, </em>however, the constitution provided for no formal appeals procedure, but merely for \u201ccriminal-type prosecutions against Union members and officers charged with specified offenses.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The court held that the prospect of relief held out by such procedures was sufficiently uncertain to make the exhaustion defense unavailable to the employer. The procedures at issue here, significantly, are quite similar to those at issue in <em>Orphan </em>: the Teamsters\u2019 constitution likewise provides no procedures for appealing adverse grievance decisions, but only trial-type procedures for prosecuting offending union members. Even under the <em>Orphan </em>dictum, therefore, there is no circuit court authority for making the defense of failure to exhaust union remedies available to the employer on the facts of this case.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">This conclusion, however, does not end the matter. In the district court, the employer urged as its first ground for summary judgment that \u201c[tjhere was no breach of the collective bargaining contract by Maloney Concrete Company.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The employer repeats this argument here.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The trial court did not reach this question. However, this Court has held that \u201c[a]n appellate court has discretion to uphold a summary judgment under a legal theory different from that applied by the trial court, and rest the affirmance \u2018on any ground that finds support in the record\u2019 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The record in this case is replete with evidence that Maloney did not breach the collective bargaining contract by refusing to award Winter company-wide seniority.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Winter has presented no evidence to contradict Maloney\u2019s affidavits. For this reason, there is no genuine issue of fact for trial as to the interpretation of the contract and summary judgment should be awarded to the employer on the ground that there was no breach of the collective bargaining contract by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Because Winter failed to exhaust his available internal union remedies, the district judge properly granted Local 639\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Because there exists no genuine issue as to the employer\u2019s breach of the collective bargaining contract, the district judge properly granted Maloney Concrete\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The decision of the district court accordingly is</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\">.

This evidence, however, standing alone, creates no genuine issue for trial on the question of union <em>hostility: </em>assuming that union officials knew of Winter\u2019s opposition, their refusal to process his grievance on the facts of this case suggests no hostility, unless we adopt the reasoning, rejected by the scholastics, of <em>post hoc, ergo propter hoc. </em>In most unfair representation cases, union officials will be <em>aware </em>of plaintiff\u2019s political activities; it would be odd if they were not. If a mere showing of this <em>awareness </em>sufficed to get a plaintiff past summary judgment for failure to exhaust union remedies, summary judgment would effectively be unavailable to the union on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b214-14\">. <em>See, e. g., Orphan </em>v. <em>Fumco Constr.

Several district courts have concluded, to the contrary, that the exhaustion defense should generally be open to the employer. See <em>Bradley v. Ford Motor Co., </em>417 F.Supp. 23, 26 (N.D.Ill.1975); <em>Fleming v. Chrysler Corp., </em>416 F.Supp. 1258, 1266 (E.D.Mich.1975); <em>Brookins </em>v. <em>Chrysler Corp., </em>381 F.Supp. 563, 568-69 (E.D.Mich.1974); <em>Harrington v. Chrysler Corp., </em>303 F.Supp. 495 (E.D.Mich.1969). Several other district court opinions, whose holding is unclear, may go off on this ground. See <em>Brookins, </em>381 F.Supp. at 568 (citing cases). The most convincing rationale for the general availability of the exhaustion defense to the employer derives, collaterally, from <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967) and <em>Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., </em>424 U.S. 554, 96 S.Ct. 1048, 47 L.Ed.2d 231 (1976). In those cases, the Court held generally that the employer is entitled to rely on the outcome of a grievance arbitration, and is thus insulated from a breach of contract suit, unless the union breached its duty of fair representation during the grievance process. Accordingly, some district courts have reasoned that, once the union is dismissed from the suit owing to its member\u2019s failure to exhaust remedies, it would be inequitable to require the employer to defend the suit alone, since exhaustion of remedies might reveal the union\u2019s good faith and thus cause the contract action against the employer to evanesce. As the <em>Brookins </em>court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"AEGP\">By exhausting his internal remedies the employee may be able to eliminate the very wrong of which he complains, not merely obtain a remedy therefor in another forum. If the union\u2019s wrongful refusal to continue the grievance were reversed <em>without prejudice to his rights, </em>the employee would no longer have a cause of action for breach of the duty of fair representation, and consequently would have no right under <em>Vaca </em>to sue his employer for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajl\"><em>Id. </em>at 569 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">Although this argument is not without appeal, it should be noted that, of the four district court cases cited above three, including <em>Broo-kins, </em>come from the Eastern District of Michigan and all four involve the UAW. The UAW, significantly, has what is probably the most elaborate and comprehensive system of internal appeals of any American union, culminating in an appeal to a non-partisan panel composed of eminent persons with no connection to the Auto Workers. The UAW procedures, virtually unique among unions, may well enable a worker to get redress \u201cwithout prejudice to his rights.\u201d The Teamsters\u2019 \u201ccriminal-type\u201d procedures, although they may permit Winter to obtain some relief, see p. 5 <em>supra, </em>are far less likely to \u201cmake him whole.\u201d <em>See </em>381 F.Supp. at 569. For much the same reason that the <em>Orphan </em>dictum is inapplicable, therefore, we decline to embrace the <em>Brookins </em>rationale here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b215-12\">.

This is not to say, of course, that the contract was \u201cambiguous.\u201d <em>See </em>Diss. op. at 154. A collective bargaining contract is too slender a volume to answer all questions that conceivably could arise during the operation of a complex industrial enterprise. <em>See </em>Cox, <em>Reflections Upon Labor Arbitration, </em>72 Harv.L.Rev. 1482, 1498-99 (1959).

Increases or decreases of working forces shall also be on the same basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">(App. 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">Winter\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Maloney breached this provision by according him only \u201cplant wide\u201d rather than \u201ccompany wide\u201d seniority, and that the union breached its duty of fair representation in its handling of two grievances that he filed in 1971 and 1974 protesting the company\u2019s failure to comply in this respect with the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">On motion by the union for summary judgment, the district court dismissed the complaint as to the <em>union </em>on the ground that Winter had failed</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">to exhaust the internal remedies available to all union members under the constitution, such exhaustion being a prerequisite to commencement of any civil action, <em>Imel v. Zohn Manufacturing Co., </em>481 F.2d 181 (10th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 915, 94 S.Ct. 1411, 39 L.Ed.2d 469 (1974); <em>compare Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">The district court also granted <em>Maloney\u2019s </em>motion for summary judgment for the following stated reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">In view of the Court\u2019s holding that plaintiff has failed to exhaust his internal union remedies, the Court is now compelled to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s complaint as to Maloney for similar reasons. <em>Vaca v. Sipes, supra; Republic Steel v. Maddox, </em>379 U.S. 650, 85 S.Ct. 614, 13 L.Ed.2d 580 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>(1965); <em>Scott v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., </em>496 F.2d 276 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 868, 95 S.Ct. 126, 42 L.Ed.2d 107 (1974); <em>Hubicki v. ACF Industries, Inc., </em>484 F.2d 519 (3d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">(App. 90).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">I agree with the majority opinion, on the facts of this case, that the defense of failure to exhaust <em>union </em>remedies is not available to the employer, Maloney<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; but I disagree with its conclusion that it was proper for the district court to grant summary judgment on the alternative ground that \u201cthere was no breach of the collective bargaining contract by Maloney Concrete Company.\u201d In my opinion whether there was a breach of the collective bargaining agreement presents a genuine issue of material fact that must be resolved by testimony at trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>368 U.S. 464, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962); <em>Ecology Center of Louisiana, Inc. v. Coleman, </em>515 F.2d 860 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Underwater Storage, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Rubber Co., </em>125 U.S.App.D.C. 297, 371 F.2d 950 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 911, 87 S.Ct. 859, 17 L.Ed.2d 784 (1967), <em>on remand </em>314 F.Supp. 546 (D.D.C.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The affidavits filed by the appellees assert that it was a long-standing practice at Maloney and in the local industry in general to afford work opportunity to employees, under contracts such as the one involved here, on the basis of plant-wide rather than company-wide seniority (App. 25-42). Winter, however, while not disputing that plant-wide seniority may be the norm in the industry at large, insists that the specific terms of the collective bargaining agreement between Local 639 and Maloney are at variance with any such allegedly \u201cestablished practice\u201d and require company-wide seniority. The bargaining agreement does not explicitly refer to either \u201cplant-wide\u201d or \u201ccompany-wide\u201d seniority. The relevant provision, set forth above, is from the agreement made with the Maloney Company as a whole, not with its individual plants. In the absence of some specific provision or persuasive evidence to the contrary, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>agreement with a company looks to company-wide, not merely plant-wide, obligations. Maloney introduces a number of affidavits stating that the practice both at Maloney itself and in the industry at large was to have only plant-wide seniority. Not only, however, is evidence of general practice insufficient to override the express terms of a contract, but also, where a contract\u2019s meaning is unclear, summary judgment is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Although summary judgment is possible on questions of contractual interpretation, <em>see, e. g., Parish v. Howard, </em>459 F.2d 616 (8th Cir. 1972); <em>Green v. Valve Corp. of America, </em>428 F.2d 342 (7th Cir. 1970); <em>Universal Fiberglass Corp. v. United States, </em>400 F.2d 926 (8th Cir. 1968), where the contract is ambiguous, such disposition is prohibited, <em>see, e. g., Cram v. Sun Insurance Office, Ltd., </em>375 F.2d 670 (4th Cir. 1967); <em>Cinocca v. Baxter Laboratories, Inc., </em>400 F.Supp. 527 (E.D.Okl.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Moreover, the burden is on the party moving for summary judgment to prove that there are no material issues of fact (such as ambiguous contract terms), <em>see, e. g., Adickes v. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); <em>In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Antibiotic Antitrust Action, </em>538 F.2d 180 (8th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1040, 97 S.Ct. 738, 50 L.Ed.2d 751 (1977); <em>Evers v. Buxbaum, </em>102 U.S.App.D.C. 334, 253 F.2d 356 (1958); and disputed issues of fact may not be tried by affidavit, <em>Sartor v. Arkansas Malt Gas Corp., </em>321 U.S. 620, 64 S.Ct. 724, 88 L.Ed. 967 (1944); <em>Redman v. Warrener, </em>516 F.2d 766 (1st Cir. 1975); <em>Gutor International AG v. Raymond Packer Co., Inc., </em>493 F.2d 938 (1st Cir. 1974); <em>Hollander v. Pan Am World Airways, Inc., </em>382 F.Supp. 96 (D.Md.1973); 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 1 56.11[l.-2] (2d ed. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In this case, it cannot be successfully maintained that the terms of this collective bargaining agreement are clear on their face, <em>cf. Dworman v. Mayor and Board of Aldermen, Governing Body of Town of Morristown, </em>370 F.Supp. 1056 (D.N.J.1974); <em>La Salle Co. v. Kane, </em>8 F.R.D. 625 (E.D.N. Y.1949), and Maloney has not carried its burden of persuasion that they are in fact unambiguous. The court, then, is presented with a genuine issue of material fact that can be resolved only at trial, to wit, whether:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The alleged \u201cestablished practice in the concrete industry in the Washington metropolitan area that work opportunity is offered employees in the order of seniority on a plant . . . basis . . . \u201d as applied by defendants in this case, violates the seniority provisions of the agreement and discriminatorily violates plaintiff\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">(App. 52).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">The question of contract interpretation is sufficient to preclude summary judgment in favor of Maloney. In addition, the other issues of material fact presented by Winter\u2019s claim that the union breached its duty of fair representation by failing to process his grievances and persisting for political reasons in its refusal to enforce his seniority rights (App. 9-10, 49) would require a similar conclusion as regards Winter\u2019s case against Local 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">On the controverted issue as to whether the union discriminatorily refused to enforce his contractual seniority rights, Winter swears that his allegations of political motivation are made on \u201cpersonal knowledge of the facts\u201d (App. 11), while the Local contends that it processed plaintiff\u2019s grievances and disposed of them on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">We need not reach the question of which of the parties\u2019 version of the facts is more credible. Any such determination is clearly to be made by the fact-finder in an actual trial. This court cannot uphold the summary disposition of genuine issues of material fact. In a summary judgment proceeding a court cannot try issues of fact, but only determine whether there are such issues to be tried, <em>see, e. g., Heyman v. Commerce and Industry Insurance Co., </em>524 F.2d 1317, 1319-1320 (2d Cir. 1975); and genuine questions of fact must be resolved at trial, not merely by affidavits such as were before the district court in this case, <em>see, e. g., Judge v. City of Buffalo, </em>524 F.2d 1321 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Cir. 1975); <em>Redman v. Warrener, </em>516 F.2d 766 (1st Cir. 1975); <em>Aeronca, Inc. v. Style-Crafters, Inc., </em>499 F.2d 1367 (4th Cir. 1974), later appeal, 546 F.2d 1094 (1976); <em>Aulds v. Foster, </em>484 F.2d 945 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Jackson v. Griffith, </em>480 F.2d 261 (10th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The union contends that Winter \u201cmade no attempt to invoke his available internal union remedies\u201d (App. 13), and he in turn rejoins that any attempt to do so would have been futile (App. 9-10, 49). The issue is thus raised as to whether or not the political antagonism of the union to Winter was sufficiently intense that it would be unreasonable to suppose that his grievances would be fairly advanced by the union. One need not exhaust union remedies if they are shown likely to be futile. <em>Cf. Verville v. International Ass\u2019n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, </em>520 F.2d 615, 620 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>Semanick </em>v. <em>UMW District 5, </em>466 F.2d 144,151 (3d Cir. 1972); <em>Farowitz </em>v. <em>Associated Musicians of Greater New York, </em>330 F.2d 999 (2d Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The critical evidence on this point relates to whether the business agent, Marcey, who handled \u2014 or mishandled as the case may be \u2014 both of Winter\u2019s grievances knew when he did so of Winter\u2019s activities in support of Marcey\u2019s opponents within the union. Mar-cey claims that he had \u201cno knowledge other than the allegations in the complaint that Winter was engaged in any internal union political activity\u201d (App. 30). His position, however, is controverted by the affidavit of another member of Local 639 who states that he recollects \u201cMr. Marcey was present at most of [the] meetings, and in a few cases I believe he chaired the meetings in the absence of President DeBrouse\u201d when \u201cMr. Winter was critical of seniority practices and use of temporary employees in the construction industry, and had some argument on these or related matters with President DeBrouse during meetings\u201d (App. 56). When the affidavits reveal such a conflict over facts that substantially affect the position of a party on a material matter, summary judgment is not to be granted, <em>see, e. g., Jackson v. Griffith, supra, </em>480 F.2d at 267; <em>Machinery Center, Inc. v. Anchor National Life Insurance Co., </em>434 F.2d 1, 6 (10th Cir. 1970). The materiality of this evidence does not lie in a \u201cmere showing of . awareness\u201d of Winter\u2019s political activity but in Marcey predicating his denial of hostility to Winter on the claim that he never knew of his political activity within the union. This evidence is thus material on the issue of hostility.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The majority opinion gives far too short shrift to the importance of the fact that the union officials knew of appellant\u2019s agitation and activities against their leadership. Of course, this fact alone is not conclusive, but it certainly is probative. In my view, appellant has suggested sufficient other evidence of the union\u2019s hostility that, taken together with his expressed dissatisfaction with the union, he should have his day in court. Knowledge of a union member\u2019s protest activities may not prove union bias against him, but \u2014 human nature being what it is \u2014 it must lead the court closely to scrutinize such evidence for the possibility of such hostility. Applying such scrutiny here, summary judgment is unjustifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">At trial, the question of whether Marcey and the union did or did not process Winter\u2019s grievances in accordance with their statutory duty must be resolved. At present \u2014 despite the broad discretion traditionally accorded to unions in the exercise of their obligation of fair representation, <em>see Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, </em>345 U.S. 330, 338, 73 S.Ct. 681, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953); Blumrosen, <em>The Workers and Three Phases of Unionism: Administrative and Judicial Control of the Worker-Union Relationship, </em>61 Mich.L.Rev. 1435, 1469-1472 (1963)\u2014 genuine issues exist as to whether these complaints were processed at all. Assuming that they were, the issue remains as to whether they were fairly evaluated, whether Winter was adequately advised, etc. Similarly, the question of the construction of the seniority provision of the collective bargaining agreement must be resolved in order to decide the suits against Maloney. When such issues remain controverted and unresolved, the only acceptable procedure is to deny summary judgment, go beyond the affidavits, and hold a trial on the merits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>It is thus my conclusion that the summary judgments granted to Maloney and Local 639 should be vacated and the cases remanded for further proceedings. To this end, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\">. Although I agree with the majority\u2019s holding that Maloney cannot rely on Winter\u2019s failure to exhaust his internal remedies, I adopt a slightly different rationale for doing so, based in part on the analysis in <em>Brookins v. Chrysler Corporation, Dodge Main Division, </em>381 F.Supp. 563 (E.D.Mich.1974). In <em>Brookins, </em>the court gave a cogent summary of the dilemma that the ruling in Vaca v. <em>Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967) has provoked:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The answer [to whether an employer may rely on an employee\u2019s failure to exhaust his union remedies] seems to turn on whether the union\u2019s successful exhaustion defense goes to the merits of the claimed unfair representation or merely to the ripeness of the controversy or plaintiffs capacity to sue. If the <em>former </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>if a failure to exhaust internal remedies means that the duty of fair representation has not yet been breached\u2014 then plaintiff clearly cannot prove the contrary and the employer may properly rely on the employee\u2019s failure to exhaust contractual remedies, for he has through the judgment of dismissal as to the union lost his only legally valid excuse for failing to exhaust. In that sense the employer does indeed get a \u201cfree ride\u201d on the union\u2019s defense. However, if the union\u2019s dismissal for failure to exhaust internal remedies recognizes that a breach of the duty of fair representation may have occurred, and holds only that a judicial remedy for that breach is not presently available, then it seems that the plaintiff would be in a position to prove the existence of the breach despite the fact that he cannot at present maintain an action thereon. The wrong could still exist, and would be subject to proof; only the timing of the remedy would be affected by the union\u2019s dismissal from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">381 F.Supp. at 567-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">Thus, by the same token that an exhaustion of internal union remedies is not an absolute requirement for suit against the union itself, it cannot be an absolute prerequisite to suit against the employer. In the instant case, it is my opinion that there is enough suspicion of union-employee hostility that appellant should not be forced to exhaust his internal union remedies before suing the union for breach of its duty of fair representation. Accordingly, the exhaustion requirement is clearly not \u201csubstantive\u201d in the sense the <em>Brookins </em>opinion suggests, and thus the employer cannot rely upon it as a defense. Should Winter\u2019s claims of official hostility prove unsubstantiated, upon dismissal of his suit against the union his suit against Maloney must also be dismissed, <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>supra; but he should not as a matter of law be foreclosed from having a hearing on his grievances because he has not exhausted his union grievances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
