MacMahon, <em>Judge, </em>dismissing her complaint, which purports to invoke federal jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, <em>et seq,, </em>and Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701, <em>et seq,, </em>seeking an order directing the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) to pursue and complete an investigation requested of it by the United States Consul in Taiwan into the question of whether her permanent resident status should be rescinded pursuant to \u00a7 246(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) on the ground that it had been acquired through fraud. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1256(a). We affirm, but with clarification as to the INS\u2019s investigative duties in the matter, in view of the district court\u2019s opinion on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">Appellant, a native and citizen of Taiwan, was in 1966 admitted into the United States as a non-immigrant, leaving her husband and three children in Taiwan. In February, 1973, appellant invested $7,000 in the Hsin Hsin Chinese Restaurant in Brooklyn, becoming a shareholder of the corporation that owns the restaurant. On April 11, 1973, the United States Department of Labor issued a labor certification to the restaurant authorizing employment of appellant as a specialty chef on the basis of her sworn statement that from 1959 through 1966 she had been employed as a chef in the Kwok Kong Restaurant in Taipei City, Taiwan. Armed with this certificate, the Hsin Hsin Restaurant on April 30, 1973, petitioned the INS to qualify appellant as a sixth preference immigrant pursuant to \u00a7 203(a)(6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(6), which was approved on August 9,1973. On November 9, 1973, appellant\u2019s status was accordingly adjusted by the INS to that of permanent resident alien, see \u00a7 245 of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-12\">Having successfully gained permanent resident status for herself, appellant next sought to assist her children in Taiwan to enter the United States as immigrants by petitioning the INS on their behalf to grant them second preference status under \u00a7 203(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 9, 1975, the INS approved these preference petitions and on July 15, 1975, the children applied to the United States Consulate in Taiwan for immigrant visas. In reviewing their applications the Consul discovered that appellant\u2019s \u201chousehold register,\u201d an official record kept by the Taiwan government of her education, occupation and employment, did not reveal her claimed earlier employment at the Kwok Kong Restaurant in Taipei City, which had been the predicate for her United States labor certification, sixth preference classification, and adjustment of status, which in turn was the predicate for approval of her children\u2019s visa applications as second preference immigrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>Apparently suspecting that appellant\u2019s status may have been procured by fraud, the Consul held up issuance of the visas to her children and requested the INS to forward copies of her adjustment application and to investigate the basis of her adjustment of status and whether she had in fact, worked as a chef at the Kwok Kong Restaurant in Taipei City as represented. In the meantime appellant\u2019s son executed in Taiwan a sworn statement that his mother had not to his knowledge worked as a chef in Taiwan before going to the United States but had worked as a pedicab driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">On August 2, 1976, the INS conducted an interview of appellant in which it sought unsuccessfully to elicit information from her regarding her employment as a chef in Taiwan before coming to the United States in 1966. The interview proved a failure, principally because of differences over the accuracy of the interpretation (appellant does not speak English) and objections to the relevancy of questions. On the following day, appellant instituted the present action, claiming unreasonable delay by the INS in its investigation and seeking an order directing the Consul to issue the immigration visas to the children and directing the INS to complete its investigation and furnish its report immediately to the American Embassy in Taiwan concerning whether appellant had fraudulently obtained her status. In the alternative, appellant sought an order granting the visas to the children and a declaratory judgment that the children are eligible for adjustment of status and that the INS\u2019s failure to respond to the Consul and to appellant\u2019s petition is illegal. After an initial application for immediate relief was, after hearing, denied by Judge Wyatt, and appellant thereafter failed to comply with pretrial orders issued by the district court, Judge MacMahon, by memorandum opinion dated August 24, 1977, denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">Judge MacMahon held that the federal court lacked jurisdiction to review the Consul\u2019s decision and that, although the INS owed a duty to complete within a reasonable time its investigation into possible fraud on appellant\u2019s part in obtaining her status as a permanent alien resident (at least insofar as the issue was relevant to her petitions to the INS for preference status for her children as a basis for their immigration), the INS had not abused its discretion in failing to do so by the time this action was commenced, in view of all of the circumstances, including \u201cthe low priority given to such investigations and the other pri- or investigative responsibilities of INS.\u201d From this order Hsieh appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">The district court correctly held that no jurisdictional basis exits for review of the action of the American Consul in Taiwan suspending or denying the issuance of immigration visas to appellant\u2019s children there. It is settled that the judiciary will not interfere with the visa-issuing process. <em>Gomez v. Kissinger, </em>534 F.2d 518 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>Pena v. Kissinger, </em>409 F.Supp. 1182, 1185-88 (S.D.N.Y.1976). In <em>Kleindienst v. Mandel, </em>408 U.S. 753, 766, 92 S.Ct. 2576, 2583, 33 L.Ed.2d 683 (1972), the Supreme Court stated the basic principle:</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">\u201c \u2018The power of Congress to exclude aliens altogether from the United States, or to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which they may come to this country, and to have its declared policy in that regard enforced exclusively through executive officers, without judicial intervention, is settled by our previous adjudications.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-11\">The jurisdiction of federal courts to review the INS\u2019s action in conducting or completing an investigation requested by some other branch of the government, such as the State Department, would similarly depend on the existence of a statutory authorization or mandate from Congress. No such authorization is shown or appears to exist. The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, <em>et seq., </em>cited in appellant\u2019s complaint is remedial, not jurisdictional, <em>Schilling v. Rogers, </em>363 U.S. 666, 677, 80 S.Ct. 1288, 4 L.Ed.2d 1478 (1960); <em>Skelly Oil </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number><em>Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>339 U.S. 667, 671, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950), and the Administrative Procedure Act, also cited, does not provide subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 105, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>Small v. Kiley, </em>567 F.2d 163, 164 n. 1 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">Although not referred to as a jurisdictional basis in her complaint, appellant now contends that the district court is empowered to compel the INS to complete its investigation into her immigration status by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, which authorizes district courts to assume jurisdiction over \u201cany action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States . to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d Putting aside the question of whether appellant, in view of the INS\u2019s offer to continue its investigation if appellant will cooperate, is eligible to invoke such relief, appellant\u2019s contention must be rejected for the reason that the INS is under no duty to conduct an investigation for the purpose of determining whether visas should be issued to aliens in foreign countries by the State Department pursuant to \u00a7 104 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104. The sole duty of the INS in this context was to determine whether appellant\u2019s petition for preference status for her children in Taiwan, based on their relationship to her, should be granted under \u00a7 203(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(2), see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204, 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.40. This it has done, approving appellant\u2019s preference petition on April 9, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">The investigation which appellant seeks to compel the INS to complete in the present action is not directed toward the preference petitions for the children but the question of whether appellant fraudulently acquired her immigration status. Whether the INS pursues this latter inquiry further and, if so, whether it will institute proceedings to rescind her status are matters solely within the INS\u2019s discretion, see <em>United States v. Santelises, </em>476 F.2d 787, 790 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>United States ex rel. Masucci v. Follette, </em>272 F.Supp. 563, 565 (S.D.N.Y. 1967), and hence are not reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. Moreover, the INS has five years from the date when appellant acquired her permanent resident status within which to institute rescission proceedings. <em>Zaoutis v. Kiley, </em>558 F.2d 1096 (2d Cir. 1977). In short, neither the children\u2019s application for admission into the United States as immigrants nor the Consul\u2019s request to the INS create a duty on the part of the INS to appellant to investigate whether rescission proceedings should be instituted, much less to complete any such investigation within a shorter period than that provided by \u00a7 246(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1256(a). Aside from our powerlessness to intervene, the judicial creation of such a duty would have the potential for mischievous interference with the functioning of already overburdened administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">In stating in its opinion that the INS had a duty under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 205 and 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.43 to conduct and complete the investigation requested by the Consulate, the district court appears to have confused the INS\u2019s duty to act on <em>preference petitions, </em>which are concerned solely with the family relationship between the parties, with the question of whether the INS must investigate alleged fraud in obtaining a permanent resident status. These matters are entirely separate and distinct. Since there is no question as to the parent-child relationship between appellant and her children in Taiwan, the preference petitions were approved by the INS on April 9,1975. The INS\u2019s duty in the matter ended there. To the extent that the district court\u2019s opinion states that the INS is under a further duty to investigate a fraudulently-obtained preference status it is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1244-10\">. Appellant\u2019s application was denied to the extent that it sought to adjust the status of her children also to permanent resident aliens. This relief was not available to appellant\u2019s children under \u00a7 245 since they were not in the United States but in Taiwan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1244-13\">. The purpose of this procedure is merely to verify the relationship between the permanent resident in the United States and his or her relatives located outside of the United States in order to determine whether the latter qualify for preferential treatment under \u00a7 203 of the Act. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.1(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
