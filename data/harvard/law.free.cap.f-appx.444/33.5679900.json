The district court sentenced her within her advisory guidelines range to concurrent terms of 48 months of imprisonment and three years of nonre-porting supervised release for each count. Mosquera contends that her sentences are substantively unreasonable. She does not challenge her sentences for procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-23\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Mosquera contends that her punishment was too severe because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 effectively double counts the defendant\u2019s criminal record in establishing the guidelines range. She further contends that her sentences overstated the seriousness of her illegal reentry offense and failed to properly reflect her personal history and characteristics. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Mosquera\u2019s sentences are presumed reasonable because they fell within her guidelines range, <em>see United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Cir.2008), and she has not shown sufficient reason for this court to disturb that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b59-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
