Beltran, </em>367 Fed.Appx. 984 (11th Cir.2010), we affirmed Appellant Gurmercindo Beltran\u2019s enhanced sentence as a career offender pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4bl.l following his conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and crack cocaine under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C). The United States Supreme Court vacated our judgment, <em>Beltran v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 899, 178 L.Ed.2d 739 (2011), and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of its decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). Having considered the parties\u2019 briefs in the initial appeal and the record, we remand this case to the district court for further consideration of Beltran\u2019s sentence in light of <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-22\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether the defendant\u2019s prior Florida battery conviction was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, one with an element of \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d The <em>Johnson </em>Court determined that in order for a crime to be a violent felony, it must involve \u201cviolent force,\u201d further defined by the Court as \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury to another.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at -, 130 S.Ct. at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4bl.l, a defendant qualifies as a career offender if he has \u201cat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d A crime of violence is defined as it is in the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, the provision at issue in <em>Johnson. </em>Thus, in addition to certain enumerated offenses not relevant here, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1 is \u201cany other offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">To decide whether a prior conviction constitutes a crime of violence, the sentencing court ordinarily employs a \u201ccategorical approach.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Under this approach, the court may \u201clook only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. In a limited class of cases, however, where the definition of the underlying crime encompasses both violent and non-violent conduct, a sentencing court may look beyond the statutory definition. <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at -, 130 S.Ct. at 1273. In such cases, \u201cthe modified categorical approach ... permits a court to determine which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by consulting the trial record \u2014 including charging documents, plea agreements, [and] transcripts of plea colloquies\u00ae\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">In this case, the district court relied on Beltran\u2019s felony conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 as one of the predicate offenses for the career offender enhancement under \u00a7 461.1(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of Beltran\u2019s conviction, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 made it a felony offense to \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d resist, obstruct, or oppose \u201cany officer ... in the lawful execution of any legal duty, by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 (2002). The district court exclusively employed the categorical approach in reaching its conclusion and did not consider if Beltran\u2019s conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 qualified as a violent felony under the modified-categorical approach discussed in <em>Johnson.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, we vacate Beltran\u2019s enhanced sentence and remand this case for the district court to consider the enhancement anew in light of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\">. Beltran does not dispute that he has one qualifying prior felony conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b426-8\">. The government alluded to potentially useful information regarding the nature of Beltran\u2019s Florida offense, but the record on appeal is not complete enough for us to determine whether the modified-categorical approach may be applied to find Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 is a violent felony. <em>See </em>Sentencing Transcript, statements by government\u2019s counsel, R. 85 at 17 (\"The crimes, the acts that Mr. Beltran committed, were crimes of violence. We believe that, quite possibly, [defense counsel] may even be right categorically, but there is no dispute as to what Mr. Beltran did, and they were violent acts.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
