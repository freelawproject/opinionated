Pani-gua challenges those determinations based on the fact that Daniel Ortega, the leader of the Sandinista government at the time he was persecuted, was elected president of Nicaragua in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">We review an immigration court\u2019s rulings of law de novo and its findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007). Under substantial evidence review, we will not reverse a factual finding unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it. <em>Id. </em>If, as in the instant case, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision based in part on the IJ\u2019s reasoning and in part on its own findings, we will consider both decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 593-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">An alien\u2019s removal must be withheld if he shows a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d in his home country. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1138 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If, as in the instant case, an alien has suffered past persecution, <em>\u201c </em>\u2018it shall be presumed that [his] life or freedom would be threatened on that basis in the future.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zhu, </em>493 F.3d at 596 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i)). The Government may rebut that presumption if it proves by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would not be threatened. <em>Id. </em>at 596-97 (citing \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i), (ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">Contrary to Panigua\u2019s assertions, the BIA and IJ held the Government to its burden of rebutting the presumption of persecution in his case. After careful review of the record and the briefs, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the administrative determination that the Government met that burden. The 2007 State Department country report presented to the BIA indicates that the political landscape in Nicaragua has changed significantly following the end of that country\u2019s civil war. Ortega was freely elected in 2006 and in the year following his election there were no reports that the government was responsible for politically motivated killings, disappearances, or imprisonments. Accordingly, Panigua did not establish a clear probability that he would be persecuted if he returned to Nicaragua.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">Panigua complains that the BIA failed to take administrative notice of the most recent State Department country reports at the time it issued its decision. However, he did not exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to that issue and we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number><em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). Panigua also asks this court to take judicial notice of the most recent State Department country report for Nicaragua. Even if this court took notice of that document, it does not compel a conclusion that the Government failed to rebut the presumption of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">For the aforementioned reasons, Pani-gua\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b777-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-14\">. Panigua does not challenge the denial of his application for asylum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
