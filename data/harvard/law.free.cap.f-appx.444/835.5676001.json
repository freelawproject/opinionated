A certificate of appealability was granted on the issue whether the district court erred by denying a claim that counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to provide proper notice of an alibi witness, which resulted in this witness not being allowed to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-23\">We must defer to a state habeas court\u2019s determination of the merits of the prisoner\u2019s claims unless the state decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1) &amp; (2). To obtain relief under \u00a7 2254, a state prisoner \u201cmust show that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>bility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo. <em>Harrison v. Quarterman, </em>496 F.3d 419, 423 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Lewis has failed to provide any evidence from the witness herself showing that she was willing to testify and setting out the content of her expected testimony. In addition, the witness\u2019s testimony, as alleged by Lewis, would have been relevant only to two of the four charges, the testimony would have been cumulative of earlier testimony, and the witness\u2019s credibility could have been questioned based on her close family relationship with Lewis. Finally, several other witnesses identified Lewis as one of the perpetrators. Even if this court presumes that reasonable jurists could not disagree that counsel performed deficiently by failing to list this alibi witness, Lewis cannot show \u201cbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement\u201d that, if counsel had listed this witness and she had testified, the result of his trial would have been different. <em>See Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786-87; <em>Strickland v.
