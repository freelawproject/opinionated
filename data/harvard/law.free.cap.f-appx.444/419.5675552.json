Over petitioner\u2019s and the Government\u2019s objection, the district court dismissed petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion without prejudice. (We subsequently affirmed the district court\u2019s Rule 33 ruling, <em>United States v. Hilel, </em>352 Fed.Appx. 378 (11th Cir.2009).)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2255, a defendant has one year from, <em>inter alia, </em>the date that his conviction became final, to file a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). In this case (as in all court of appeals affirmances of convictions), the petitioner had 90 days following our affirmance of his conspiracy conviction to petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review our decision. He did not petition the Court for the writ, so his conviction became final after this 90-days period expired. <em>Kaufmann v. United States, </em>282 F.3d 1336, 1338 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Under Rule 33, upon a defendant\u2019s motion, \u201cthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a). Filing a Rule 33 motion for new trial is not considered an extension of the direct appeal, and does not toll the \u00a7 2255(f)(1) one-year limitations period for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Barnes v. United States, </em>437 F.3d 1074 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">As both parties agree, the dismissal without prejudice here had the effect of a dismissal with prejudice, because of the impact of the \u00a7 2255(f)(1) time-bar. Given this consequence, the court should have stayed proceedings on the \u00a7 2255 motion until the Rule 33 proceeding was resolved. We therefore Vacate the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal and REMAND the case for further consideration of petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
