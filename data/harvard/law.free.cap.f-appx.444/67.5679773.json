Mares argues that the district court erred in finding that he assisted in the escape, disregarded the advisory guidelines range, and provided insufficient justification for the unusually harsh sentence. Because Mares did not object to the reasonableness of the sentence in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Pettier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-14\">Mares has not shown that the upward variance was substantively unreasonable. The district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments, Mares\u2019s statement, the Presentence Report, and the advisory guidelines range, as well as the serious nature of Mares\u2019s crime<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the escapee\u2019s drug trafficking and money laundering crimes, the public\u2019s efforts in prosecuting these crimes, the high likelihood that Mares assisted in the escape, Mares\u2019s false statements to investigators and lack of remorse, and the fact that a lesser sentence would encourage others to help inmates escape. The district court\u2019s statements justified the upward variance and reflect that it considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of Mares, and the need to protect the public, to deter future criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>conduct, and to promote respect for the law. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707-10 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). Further, the extent of the variance was not excessive under the circumstances. The 18-month sentence was 12 months greater than the top of Mares\u2019s guidelines range and did not exceed the three-year statutory maximum sentence for his offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1072. We have affirmed similar and more substantial departures. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir.2008) (upholding an upward departure or variance to 180 months from the top of the advisory guidelines range of 51 months); <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806-07 (5th Cir.2008) (upholding upward variance to 72 months from 30-month guidelines maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b94-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that tins opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-12\">. Mares's plea agreement included an appeal waiver. However, because the Government has not sought to enforce the waiver, the waiver does not preclude Mares\u2019s appeal. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 231 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-16\">. The district court carefully considered the evidence that linked Mares to the original escape and invited comment and citation to evidence by counsel on this point. We find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s consideration of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
