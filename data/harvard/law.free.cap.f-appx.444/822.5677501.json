He maintains the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Relying on <em>United States v. Galvez-Barrios, </em>355 F.Supp.2d 958, 961-63 (E.D.Wis.2005), Nieto contends: the Guidelines range was too severe because Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 (providing, <em>inter alia, </em>a 16-level enhancement for illegal reentry following a drug trafficking offense) is <em>not </em>empirically based and double-counts a defendant\u2019s criminal record; the advisory Guideline sentencing range overstated the seriousness of his criminal history and nonviolent reentry offense; and that range failed to account for his motive for reentering \u2014 to be with his family and to be a father to his three young daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-21\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for reasonableness in the light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Our court first determines whether the district court committed any significant procedural error; and, if <em>not, </em>the sentence is reviewed for substantive unreasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines [sentencing] range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>The district court considered Nieto\u2019s reasons for a lower sentence but determined a 46-month within-Guidelines sentence was appropriate. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Nieto\u2019s contentions\u2014 \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s lack of an empirical basis, the double-counting of his prior conviction, the nonviolent nature of his offense, his motive for reentry, and his personal history and characteristics all justified a lower sentence \u2014 are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b848-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
