In his motion, Mitchell contended that his plea agreement was breached and that counsel was ineffective for failing to prosecute a direct appeal. Mitchell\u2019s district court motion was an attempt to collaterally attack his sentence by raising errors that occurred at sentencing or during the period for pursuing a direct appeal. As such, the motion should have been construed by the district court as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Rich, </em>141 F.3d 550, 551 (5th Cir.1998). Such a recharac-terization of Mitchell\u2019s motion has important consequences of which Mitchell should be apprised. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). Also, because Mitchell\u2019s motion was in the nature of a 2255 motion, we lack jurisdiction over his appeal absent ruling on a certificate of appealability in the district court. <em>See United States v. Youngblood, </em>116 F.3d 1113, 1114-15 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The judgment of the district court is VACATED and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
