United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, this court will \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Even if Argueta sufficiently preserved his objection to the district court\u2019s explanation for imposing the sentence at issue, we find that the district court, by citing Argueta\u2019s extensive criminal history and recidivist tendencies, adequately explained its bases for the variance. <em>See Id. </em>at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. Although Argueta argues that the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable because the district court over-emphasized his criminal history and failed to recognize his cultural ties to the United States, the district court explained that it had fully considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the need to promote respect for the law and to deter Argueta from future criminal conduct, and this court \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. That this court \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b800-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
