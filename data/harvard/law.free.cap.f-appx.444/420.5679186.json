Anderson argues that when the district court determined his sentence, it improperly relied on unestablished and disputed facts that originated from a confidential informant. Anderson also argues that the court\u2019s reliance on these facts rendered his sentence procedurally unreasonable. After thorough review of the record, we find Anderson\u2019s arguments lack merit. Consequently, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">We review legal questions concerning the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure <em>de novo. United States v. Spears, </em>443 F.3d 1358, 1361 (11th Cir.2006). The district court must make independent findings establishing the factual basis for its sentencing guideline calculations. <em>United States v. Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d 1316, 1338 (11th Cir.2006). Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B) further requires the district court either to rule on \u201cany disputed portion of the pre-sentence report or other controverted matter,\u201d or to \u201cdetermine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.\u201d When a court relies upon a disputed fact as the basis for sentencing, the government must establish the fact by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559, 1566 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">Anderson\u2019s argument on appeal rests on a single statement made by the district court at sentencing: \u201cI have not seen a more active actual seller of drugs in a long time; many conspiracies that involve a greater amount, but not active literal selling, passing, distributing the drugs.\u201d Pointing only to the sentence\u2019s inclusion of the words, \u201cmany conspiracies,\u201d while ignoring the sentence\u2019s plain meaning, Anderson claims the district court found him to have been part of \u201cextensive multiple conspiracies,\u201d even though the undisputed evidence supported a finding of only a single conspiracy. Based on this tortured interpretation of the court\u2019s statement, Anderson concludes that the court must have improperly relied on disputed facts originating from the confidential informant, in violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>We agree with the government that Anderson has \u201csubstantially misconstrue[d] the district court\u2019s explanation.\u201d It is clear that the district court\u2019s statement was contrasting the high level of distribution activity in this case with other conspiracies involving a greater amount of drugs than involved in Anderson\u2019s case but less active distribution. Thus, contrary to Anderson\u2019s assertion, the district court never based its sentencing decision on a finding of \u201cmany conspiracies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Furthermore, we emphasize that the district court explicitly stated that it would not consider the disputed facts contained in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the PSI in making a sentencing determination. Beyond this, the court noted Anderson\u2019s objections to the two paragraphs when it adopted the findings in the PSI; specifically refuted reliance upon the disputed facts when Anderson\u2019s counsel voiced concern that the court had done so; and substantiated its finding of Anderson\u2019s \u201cactive distribution\u201d by citing the undisputed facts regarding the number of pre-packaged baggies and other cocaine that were recovered from both Anderson\u2019s residence and vehicle. We therefore conclude that the district court did not improperly rely on disputed facts in determining Anderson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Finally, Anderson has failed to establish procedural error. In evaluating procedural reasonableness, we must ensure that the district court committed \u201cno significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3558(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Saac, </em>632 F.3d 1203, 1212 (11th Cir.2011). Beyond the discussion set out above, the district court expressly stated that it considered the Guidelines, the undisputed factual allegations in the PSI, and the \u00a7 3553 factors prior to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">For all of these reasons, we affirm Anderson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
