No. 105-100, \u00a7 202, 111 Stat. 2160, 2193 (1997); asylum under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 208(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a), withholding of removal under INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), and withholding of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-19\">We must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Gonzalez Blandon\u2019s application for adjustment of status under NACARA. Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n also raises four additional claims: (1) the BIA applied the wrong burdens of proof; (2) the BIA erroneously sustained the charge that Gonzalez Blan-d\u00f3n was subject to removal under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae; (3) Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n is statutorily eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) (\u201c \u00a7 212(h) waiver\u201d); and (4) the BIA erroneously denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-21\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A8h\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b347-22\">We first examine our jurisdiction over Gonzalez Blandon\u2019s claims. \u201cWe review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Frech v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>491 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir.2007). Although we lack jurisdiction to review a final decision on an application for an adjustment of status under NACARA, we retain jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>consider substantial constitutional claims related to such an application. <em>Id. </em>at 1280-81. \u201cA \u2018substantial\u2019 constitutional challenge is one that has merit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1280 n. 5. We also lack jurisdiction to review the denial of a \u00a7 212(h) waiver of inadmissibility. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. However, \u201cwe retain jurisdiction to determine whether the statutory conditions for limiting judicial review exist.\u201d <em>Vuksanovic v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>439 F.3d 1308, 1310 (11th Cir.2006). Additionally, we retain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims and questions of law\u201d relating to a denial of a \u00a7 212(h) waiver. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Whether the correct legal standards were applied is a question of law. <em>Freeh, </em>491 F.3d at 1281. Like review of a decision under NACARA, under INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we only retain jurisdiction to consider substantial constitutional claims in a petition for review of the denial of a \u00a7 212(h) waiver. <em>Alvarez Acosta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>524 F.3d 1191, 1197 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">A due process claim only has merit if the alien has been substantially prejudiced. <em>Ibrahim v. U.S. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1987). An alien cannot show substantial prejudice based on the denial of discretionary relief \u201cbecause no standards exist for a court to determine whether the executive would have granted the extraordinary relief anyway.\u201d <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1146, 1148 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that even if the appellant received ineffective assistance of counsel, there was no due process violation because there was no way to know whether the discretionary relief would have been granted but for the ineffective assistance).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">A court may not review a final order of removal unless \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d INA \u00a7 242, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). The petitioner must administratively exhaust his arguments by raising them before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). We lack jurisdiction to consider unexhausted procedural due process claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">First, we have jurisdiction to consider whether the BIA applied the correct burdens of proof because whether the correct legal standards were applied is a question of law. <em>See Freeh, </em>491 F.3d at 1281. Second, we have jurisdiction to consider whether the BIA erroneously sustained the government\u2019s charge that Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n was removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, because this issue does not concern his application for an adjustment of status, nor does it concern his application for discretionary relief. Third, we have jurisdiction to consider whether Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n is statutorily eligible for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver. <em>See Vuksanovic, </em>439 F.3d at 1310. Fourth, we do not have jurisdiction to consider Gonzalez Blandon\u2019s due process arguments because he did not exhaust these procedural due process claims and because they are meritless. Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n cannot show substantial prejudice because there are no standards for us to determine whether he would have been granted the discretionary relief. <em>See Mejia Rodriguez, </em>178 F.3d at 1148 (11th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we dismiss Gonzalez Blandon\u2019s petition for review as to his due process arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"Am3U\">B. Burden of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">On appeal, Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n argues that the BIA and IJ erred by not requiring the Government to prove by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that he was removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n denied that he was removable under this section before both the IJ and the BIA, and, he argues, the Government should have been required to prove that he was removable under this section even though he had already conceded that he was removable under another section of the INA, specifically INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n asserts that only after the Government proved that he was removable under INA \u00a7 287(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) should the burden of proof switch to him to show that he was eligible for the \u00a7 212(h) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We review questions of law <em>de novo. Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). The government bears the burden of proving that the alien is removable by clear and convincing evidence. INA \u00a7 240(c)(3)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A). However, once that burden is established, the alien bears the burden of establishing that: (1) he meets the eligibility requirements for the relief sought; and (2) if he seeks discretionary relief, he \u201cmerits a favorable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 240(c)(4)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(A). An alien may only receive an adjustment of status under NA-CARA if he is \u201cotherwise admissible to the United States.\u201d Pub.L. No. 105-100, \u00a7 202(a)(1)(B), 111 Stat. 2160, 2193 (1997). An alien seeking admission must establish that he \u201cis clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible under\u201d INA \u00a7 212, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 240(c)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The BIA applied the correct burdens of proof in this case. The BIA found that Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n was removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), because he conceded that he was removable under this section. Only then did the BIA place a burden of proof on Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n. Specifically, the BIA then required him to show that his conviction for the introduction of contraband into a penal institution did not render him inadmissible. This burden of proof is consistent with INA \u00a7 240, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a, which requires an alien seeking admissibility to prove \u201cclearly and beyond a doubt [that he] is not inadmissible under\u201d INA \u00a7 212, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182. INA \u00a7 240(c)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">C. Removal under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00a9</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">Next, Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n argues that the BIA and IJ erred in sustaining the charge of removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. The Government had relied upon Gonzalez Blandon\u2019s conviction report, but, he asserts, this report does not establish that the contraband at issue in that conviction was related to a controlled substance, other than marijuana for his personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">Gonzalez Blandon\u2019s argument that the BIA erroneously sustained the charge of removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00a9, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae is belied by the record, which shows that the BIA simply did not consider this charge because Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n conceded that he was subject to removal under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">D. Waiver of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n next asserts that the BIA and IJ erred when they failed to consider his application for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver of inadmissibility. He contends that he was statutorily eligible for the \u00a7 212(h) waiver because his convictions did not render him ineligible. He also asserts that he did not need to prove that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>eligible for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver because the Government did not prove that he was removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. If, however, this Court requires him to prove eligibility, he asserts that his testimony shows that he qualifies for this relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">An \u201calien convicted of, or who admits having committed, or who admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of\u2019 a violation of law relating to a controlled substance is inadmissible. INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). The Attorney General may exercise his discretion and grant such an alien a waiver of inadmissibility if the controlled substance violation related \u201cto a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). Under Florida law, it is illegal to introduce, \u201ctake or attempt to take or send or attempt to send therefrom,\u201d' a number of items, including controlled substances, into a state correctional institution. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.47(l)(a). It is also unlawful for inmates to possess controlled substances in a state correctional institution. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 944.47(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n did not establish that he was not inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182, because he has been convicted of introducing contraband, which he testified was marijuana, into a penal institution. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A). To be statutorily eligible for a waiver under \u00a7 212(h), Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n would have had to establish that this violation involved 30 grams or less of marijuana and that it was an offense of simple possession. INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). However, Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n testified that he did more than merely possess the marijuana, as prohibited by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.47(l)(c). Rather, he testified that he brought a package of marijuana inside his prison, as prohibited by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.47(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">E. Asylum, Withholding of Removal or CAT relief</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Finally, Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n contends that he is eligible for asylum because he has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his political opinion and membership in a social group. The BIA found that he had subjective fear of future persecution but determined that it was not objectively reasonable. Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n contends that court erred because his fear was objectively reasonable, based on his family being part of Somoza\u2019s regime, and when that regime fell, its members were at risk for being arrested, tortured, and killed. He also points to a pattern or practice of persecution, as shown by the fact that some of his family members were granted asylum and the fact that one of his brothers was arrested and threatened by the Sandinistas. He contends that he is eligible for withholding of removal and CAT relief for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">We lack jurisdiction to consider arguments that an alien failed to administratively exhaust before the BIA, even if the BIA considered those arguments <em>sua sponte. Amayar-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential\u201d substantial evidence test, and we will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We will only reverse \u201cwhen the record compels a reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). To be eligible for asylum, the applicant must prove that he is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the INA. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor; or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor, in this case political opinion or membership in a particular social group, will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R.. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). In establishing a well-founded fear of future persecution, the alien must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotations omitted). The alien must demonstrate that his fear \u201cis subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1289. An alien\u2019s fear is objectively reasonable if he \u201chas a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that if returned to his country, he would \u201cmore likely than not ... be persecuted or tortured\u201d based upon a statutorily listed factor. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (llth Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). \u201cThis is a more stringent standard than for asylum,\u201d and an alien who is unable to establish that he is eligible for asylum \u201cis generally precluded from qualifying\u201d for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n was not eligible for asylum. There was no evidence of past persecution, and there is \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence\u201d that Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n did not have an objectively reasonable, well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (quotation omitted). Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n testified that he was not aware of any person or group in Nicaragua that would seek to harm him if he returned to the country, and his mother testified that she had returned to Nicaragua twice in the four years prior to the hearing. Based on this testimony, the BIA reasonably found that Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n had not established that he had an objectively reasonable, well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Next, because Gonzalez Bland\u00f3n is unable to establish that he was eligible for asylum, he is unable to meet the \u201cmore stringent standard\u201d for withholding of removal that he would \u201cmore likely than not ... be persecuted or tortured\u201d if he returned to Nicaragua. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33. Finally, we do not have jurisdiction to consider Gonzalez Blandon\u2019s claim that he is eligible for CAT relief because he failed to exhaust this claim by not raising it before the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. It is of no moment that the BIA considered this claim <em>sua sponte. See id. </em>at 1250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Based on the above, we deny Gonzalez Blandon\u2019s petition for review as to his claims that: (1) the BIA applied the wrong burdens of proof; (2) the BIA erroneously sustained the charge of removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i); (3) he was statutorily eligible for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver; (4) the BIA erroneously found him ineligible for asylum; and (5) the BIA erroneously found him ineligible for withholding of removal. We dismiss Gonzalez Blandon\u2019s petition for review as to his due process claims and as to his claim that the BIA erroneously found him ineligible for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
