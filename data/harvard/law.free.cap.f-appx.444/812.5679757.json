Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Smith argues that the repeated rescheduling of a follow-up medical appointment and the failure to provide physical therapy as prescribed show that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. \u201cDeliberate indifference is an extremely high standard to meet.\u201d <em>Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). To prevail on such a claim, the plaintiff must establish that a defendant denied him treatment, purposefully gave him improper treatment, ignored his medical complaints, \u201cor engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations marks and footnote omitted). A delay in medical care violates the Eighth Amendment only if it is due to deliberate indifference and results in substantial harm. <em>Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993). As the district court found, Smith\u2019s allegations and the medical records do not show that any defendant was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Smith\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The IFP motion is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th CiR. R. 42.2. Smith\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel also is denied. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock County, Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Smith is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Ham-mom, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). He is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will be unable to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">IFP MOTION DENIED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b838-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
