On appeal, KDB argues that the decision of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) that she was neither medically disabled due to her asthma nor functionally disabled due to her asthma and learning disability was not supported by substantial evidence. In addition, KDB argues that the ALJ erred by not fully developing the record because he did not arrange for a medical expert to testify at the hearing and because he did not order updated intelligence testing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">\u201cOur review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to an inquiry into whether there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the Commissioner, and whether the correct legal standards were applied.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">After a review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s findings that KDB\u2019s condition did not meet or medically equal a listed impairment were made according to proper legal standards and were supported by substantial evidence. Each of KDB\u2019s specific claims of error on this point lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>First, the ALJ did not err in determining that KDB\u2019s asthma failed to meet the requirements for the asthma impairment listing in 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 103.03(B). To satisfy the requirements of this listed impairment, KDB must show her asthma caused \u201cattacks ... in spite of prescribed treatment and requiring physician intervention, occurring at least once every 2 months or at least six times a year.\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 103.03(B). An inpatient hospitalization for longer than 24 hours counts as two attacks under this standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">KDB identifies five specific episodes that she claims satisfy this standard; one of these involved a hospitalization of longer than 24 hours and would therefore count as two attacks. We note initially that there is considerable doubt as to whether the identified episodes meet the definition for a qualifying attack. Even assuming each of these episodes is a qualifying attack, however, we conclude that KDB failed to satisfy the requirements because the six alleged attacks did not occur once every two months or six \u2019 times a year; instead, they occurred over a period of 20 months, between March 27, 2007, and November 17, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Second, contrary to KDB\u2019s argument that the ALJ rejected the treating physician\u2019s opinion, the record demonstrates that the ALJ relied on this source and reached a conclusion consistent with it in determining KDB\u2019s impairment did not medically equal the asthma listing. \u201cThe testimony of a treating physician must ordinarily be given substantial or considerable weight unless good cause is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>MacGregor v. Bowen, </em>786 F.2d 1050, 1053 (11th Cir.1986). Here, the KDB\u2019s pediatrician stated KDB had \u201cmoderate persistent asthma,\u201d and when she was last seen in the clinic, KDB\u2019s asthma was \u201csomewhat well controlled.\u201d In addition, the ALJ appropriately considered the opinions of physicians who treated KDB at the hospital. Thus, the ALJ properly gave \u201csubstantial or considerable weight\u201d to the opinion of the treating source. <em>See MacGregor, </em>786 F.2d at 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Third, we conclude the ALJ addressed the school records in detail and did not reject them, and the records supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that KDB was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Fourth, the ALJ did not inappropriately rely on the opinions of non-treating physicians. \u201c[Ajdministrative law judges must consider findings and other opinions of State agency medical and psychological consultants and other program physicians, psychologists, and other medical specialists as opinion evidence\u201d of non-examining sources. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(f)(2)(i); <em>see also </em>SSR 96-6p (requiring ALJs to consider and address the weight given to state consultants\u2019 opinions, which are treated as expert opinion evidence of non-examining sources). The ALJ complied with the regulations regarding non-examining expert evidence and did not give inappropriate weight to these opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">As to KDB\u2019s challenges to the ALJ\u2019s assessment of her functional limitations and to the finding that her impairment or combination of impairments did not functionally equal the listings, we conclude KDB has waived these challenges because she did not raise these issues to the district court. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1161 (providing that we will not address an issue on appeal when a claimant has failed to raise it to the district court). <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1161 (providing that we will not address an issue on appeal when a claimant has failed to raise it to the district court). Even if this issue were properly before this Court on appeal, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ever, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s finding that KDB\u2019s condition did not functionally equal a listed impairment was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Finally, we conclude the ALJ did not err in failing to arrange for a medical expert to testify at the hearing or in failing to order updated intelligence testing. \u201cIt is well-established that the ALJ has a basic duty to develop a full and fair record. Nevertheless, the claimant bears the burden of proving that [s]he is disabled, and, consequently, [s]he is responsible for producing evidence in support of [her] claim.\u201d <em>Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003) (citations omitted). \u201cThe administrative law judge has a duty to develop the record where appropriate but is not required to order a consultative examination as long as the record contains sufficient evidence for the administrative law judge to make an informed decision.\u201d <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1269 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">A review of the record reveals the ALJ was not required to order another intelligence test, nor was the ALJ required to arrange for an expert to testify at the hearing because the evidence in the record was sufficient to support an informed decision that KDB was not disabled. Thus, the ALJ fulfilled his duty and developed a full and fair record.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
