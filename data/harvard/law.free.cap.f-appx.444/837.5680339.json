The district court sentenced him to 36 months of imprisonment, which was a downward departure from the advisory guidelines range of 46-57 months. On appeal, Saucedo-Via-ney argues that the application of a 16-level Sentencing Guidelines enhancement was unduly harsh and over-represented his criminal history and that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because his history and characteristics supported an even lower sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">We review sentences for \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 88, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This court ensures that the district court did not commit any significant procedural error and considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence \u201cunder an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The abuse-of-discretion standard applies to \u201csentences that include an upward or downward departure as provided for in the guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Hernandez, </em>581 F.3d 251, 254 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">The district court\u2019s written statement of reasons indicates that it departed downward based on Saucedo-Vianey\u2019s objection that his offense level substantially overstated the seriousness of his prior conviction. Although Saucedo-Vianey continues to argue on appeal that this enhancement was unduly harsh and over-represented his criminal history, he does not explain how, in light of this successful objection and the resulting downward departure, the district court committed any procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">Saucedo-Vianey also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. At sentencing, the district court stated that it had considered the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and it discussed the need to deter Saucedo-Vianey from returning to the United States illegally and to impress on him the seriousness of his conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B). The district court was in a superior position to find facts and assess their import under \u00a7 3553(a), and its determination of the appropriate sentence is entitled to deference. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Saucedo-Vianey\u2019s arguments do not establish that the district court abused its discretion in weighing the various sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b864-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
