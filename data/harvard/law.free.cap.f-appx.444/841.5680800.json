Roberson, Texas prisoner # 838289, moves this court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal following the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as malicious, frivolous, and for failure to state a claim under 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Roberson\u2019s motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Roberson argues that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the case against him under the doctrine of res judicata. The district court did not find that the complaint was frivolous based on res judicata, but rather, that the complaint was \u201cduplicative\u201d and, therefore, malicious. An action may be dismissed as malicious and frivolous if it duplicates claims raised by the same plaintiff in previous or pending litigation. <em>Pittman v. Moore, </em>980 F.2d 994, 994-95 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Wilson v. Lynaugh, </em>878 F.2d 846, 850 (5th Cir.1989). Roberson has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint as duplicative and malicious. <em>See Pittman, </em>980 F.2d at 994-95. Accordingly, we do not reach Roberson\u2019s arguments concerning the district court\u2019s alternative grounds for dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Roberson\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Roberson\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel also is denied. Roberson has accumulated three strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Accordingly, he may no longer proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. See \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b867-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
