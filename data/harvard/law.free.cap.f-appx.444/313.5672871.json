DeSousa contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). First, we ensure that the district court did not commit significant procedural error, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-20\">If we conclude that no procedural error occurred, \u201cthe second step is to review the sentence\u2019s \u2018substantive reasonableness\u2019 under the totality of the circumstances, including \u2018the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1237 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cAlthough we do not automatically presume a sentence within the [G]uidelines range is reasonable, we \u2018ordinarily ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005)) (alteration in original). \u201cThe party challenging the reasonableness of a sentence \u2018bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1270 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-21\">DeSousa does not contend that the district court committed procedural error. Rather, he argues that his 33-month sentence, which was within his Guidelines\u2019 range of 27 to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment, is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>poses of sentencing. However, DeSousa fails to offer any reason why the record does not support his sentence. Accordingly, DeSousa has not carried his burden of showing that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Flores, </em>572 F.3d at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
