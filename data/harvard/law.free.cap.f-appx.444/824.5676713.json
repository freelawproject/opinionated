Huang contended that he had been persecuted because of his actual and perceived political opinions. Because he has not challenged the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he was not entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture, any such claims are abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Huang complains that the IJ\u2019s determination that his testimony was partially incredible is unsupported by the record. Huang notes that the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. We do not address the credibility issue because, even accepting Huang\u2019s allegations as true, he has not met his burden of proof. <em>See Ozdemir v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 6, 8 (5th Cir.1994). In addition, he asserts that the IJ and BIA denied him due process by rejecting his unsworn statements from his father and others who witnessed events happening to him in the PRC. The agency did not reject the statements but instead granted them limited weight. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii), 1231(b)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">The BIA determined that Huang\u2019s request for asylum was untimely because it was not filed within one year of his arrival in the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Huang asserts that he has alleged a change in his circumstances excusing the untimely filing, based on his father\u2019s confrontation with PRC officials in May 2010 after Huang\u2019s attorney had sought confirmation of his client\u2019s claims from the PRC military and the local government. Section 1158(a)(3) provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination regarding exceptions to the timeliness of an asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">Notwithstanding any jurisdictional restrictions, we are not precluded from reviewing claims raising constitutional or purely legal questions. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007). The determination whether extraordinary circumstances or a change in circumstances justified the untimely filing of an asylum ordinarily is a question of fact. <em>See Zhu, </em>493 F.3d at 595-96 &amp; n. 31; <em>Nakimbugwe v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 281, 284 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2007). Huang attempts to raise a legal argument by asserting that the BIA misapplied the rules by failing to consider whether the May 2010 incident constituted a change in his personal circumstances under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(B). Because he failed to raise that claim before the BIA, however, it is unexhausted, so we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318-19 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-16\">In regard to withholding of removal, we generally review only the BIA\u2019s decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>although we will consider the IJ\u2019s underlying opinion to the extent it influenced the BIA. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We review the BIA\u2019s legal findings <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>Zh% </em>493 F.3d at 594. Under that standard, we will not reverse unless we decide \u201cnot only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">An applicant for withholding of removal must establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even if we consider Huang\u2019s testimony as fully credible and give full weight to his documentary evidence, that evidence does not <em>compel </em>a finding that he will more likely than not be persecuted based on his political opinion if he returns to the PRC. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134; <em>Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 138. Accordingly, the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of relief. <em>See Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b851-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
