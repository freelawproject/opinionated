We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-22\">Elkins pleaded guilty to assaulting two agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Psychologist Joanna Mulder diagnosed Elkins with delusional disorder and intermittent explosive disorder, and the district court imposed a sentence of probation with a special condition that Elkins \u201cparticipate as directed in a program of mental health treatment ... approved by [his] Probation Officer.\u201d Elkins\u2019s probation officer scheduled a meeting with El-kins after he requested information about whether the Administration was following him in an airplane. When Elkins failed to report to the meeting, his probation officer moved to revoke his probation. At a revocation hearing, Elkins admitted that he had violated a term of his probation. The district court reinstated Elkins\u2019s sentence of probation with the same special condition regarding mental health treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-23\">Elkins filed two motions challenging the special condition of his probation. Elkins moved for an injunction to \u201cprotect[ ] him against further demands and requests\u201d of his probation officer \u201cfor additional psychological evaluations.\u201d In an affidavit attached to the motion, Elkins alleged that additional mental examinations would vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>late his rights under the \u201c[F]irst, [F]ourth, and [Fjifth\u201d Amendments and he challenged Mulder\u2019s diagnosis. Elkins also moved the district court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3), to reconsider the special condition of probation. Elkins argued that the government had perpetrated a \u201cfraud upon the court\u201d because he had been maliciously prosecuted by the government and had been misdiagnosed by Mulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The district court correctly rejected El-kins\u2019s motions. Elkins failed to challenge the special condition by appealing either his sentence of probation or the reinstatement of his sentence following his revocation hearing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3562(b), 3742; Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). Elkins could not move the district court to reconsider his special condition of probation because \u201cRule 60(b) simply does not provide for relief from judgment in a criminal case,\u201d <em>United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1366 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">We AFFIRM the order that denied El-kins\u2019s postjudgment motions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
