Although Dong conceded removability, as an alien not in possession of a valid entry document at the time of her application for admission into the United States, she sought relief from removal on the grounds that she was physically abused by her father and was unable to leave the abusive familial relationship because she was unmarried and had no money.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-16\">Because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion, only the decision of the BIA is reviewed. <em>Mikhael v. INS, 115 </em>F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). The BIA\u2019s rulings of law are reviewed <em>de </em>novo; its findings of fact, for substantial evidence. <em>E.g., Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007). The substantial-evidence standard is applied in reviewing factual determinations for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s decision must \u201cbe based upon the evidence presented and be substantially reasonable\u201d. <em>Kane v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 231, 236 (5th Cir.2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[R]eversal is improper unless we decide not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence <em>compels </em>it\u201d. <em>Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-17\">Dong asserts she is entitled to asylum and withholding of removal because she has demonstrated past persecution and \u201ca well-founded fear of future persecution\u201d. She asserts she is entitled to relief under CAT because: she was abused by her father; domestic abuse is not criminalized by the Chinese government; and it is unwilling or unable to control her father\u2019s abusive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-18\">The United States Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security have the discretion to grant asylum to a refugee; that term includes a person outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>her country of nationality who is unable to return \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A), 1101(a)(42)(A). An applicant found to be a refugee based on past persecution is also \u201cpresumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). That presumption may be rebutted, however, if the Government establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201cthe applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of [her] country ... and under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so\u201d. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(B), (b)(l)(ii). Factors considered in determining whether internal relocation is reasonable include, <em>inter alia, </em>the country\u2019s economic infrastructure as well as \u201csocial and cultural constraints, such as age, gender, health, and social and family ties\u201d. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(b)(3). Such factors \u201care not necessarily determinative of whether it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">For withholding of removal, Dong must \u201cdemonstrate a clear probability of persecution if returned to [her] home country\u201d, based on one of the five categories for asylum. <em>Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWithholding of removal is a higher standard than asylum.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). Thus, if Dong does not meet the standard for asylum, she can not meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The BIA\u2019s affirming the denial of asylum and withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence, and Dong has failed to show that the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134. The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s finding that: the Government had successfully rebutted the presumption that Dong had a well-founded fear of persecution; and it was not unreasonable for Dong to relocate within China to avoid persecution by her father. Although life as single woman in China may be difficult given the social and cultural norms, the BIA found that Dong had demonstrated an ability to live alone as an independent adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">Regarding the CAT claim, although it is unclear whether Dong has failed to exhaust \u201call administrative remedies\u201d with respect to that claim, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), Dong has failed to demonstrate that she would be entitled to relief under CAT. To obtain such relief, Dong, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cmust show that it is more likely than not that [she] would be tortured if returned to [her] home country\u201d. <em>Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). In assessing the likelihood of torture, \u201call evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture shall be considered, including, but not limited to ... [evidence that the applicant could re-. locate to a part of the country of removal where he or she is not likely to be tortured\u201d. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(3). As discussed above, and as the BIA found, Dong has failed to show she is unable to relocate to another part of the country where her father could not harm her, and the record does not compel a conclusion that she is entitled to relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Finally, Dong has waived two issues by failing to brief them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). The BIA concluded that humanitarian asylum was not warranted because even if Dong had suffered past persecution \u2014 an issue which the BIA did not reach \u2014 that persecution was not so severe as to warrant relief. Dong does not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding nor does she contend that the abuse was so severe or atro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>cious that humanitarian asylum should have been granted. Dong also fails to address the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to remand, which the BIA construed as a motion to reopen, based on her involvement with Falun Gong.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b774-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
