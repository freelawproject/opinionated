The Board \u201cagree[d] with the [finding of the] immigration judge\u201d that Delgado was not credible. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-21\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>468 F.3d 1228, 1230-81 (11th Cir.2006). Adverse credibility findings will be reversed \u201c \u2018only if the evidence \u201ccompels\u201d a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231 (quoting <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005)). An adverse credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and falsehoods in the applicant\u2019s oral and written statements. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-22\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Delgado was not credible. Although there were several inconsistencies between Delgado\u2019s application for asylum, his credible fear interview, and his testimony, the Board and the immigration judge gave \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d related to Delgado\u2019s accounts of two incidents to support the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. During the first incident, members of the Boli-varian Circles allegedly assaulted Delgado during a demonstration, but Delgado provided two different dates on which the incident purportedly occurred. Delgado also gave inconsistent accounts about his injuries: in his application, Delgado stated that his assailants injured his chest and arm; during his credible fear interview, Delgado said that he was struck in his chest and elbow; and later, during his evidentiary hearing, Delgado testified that he sustained an injury to his wrist that required surgery and left a scar that he showed to the immigration judge. About three years after Delgado applied for asylum, he recalled purportedly a second incident in which he was shot by members of the Bolivarian Circles and received gunshot wounds in his upper body that left a pellet lodged in the right side of his head. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Despite Delgado\u2019s insistence that the shooting prompted him to leave Venezuela, Delgado failed to mention this incident in his application or his credible fear interview, and his two former neighbors failed to mention the incident in their letters about Delgado\u2019s persecution in Venezuela. <em>See Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287-88 (11th Cir.2005). Although Delgado blames his inconsistencies and omissions on his lack of education and legal training, that explanation is inconsistent with his ability to recollect and describe other alleged incidents of persecution and does not \u201ccompel a reasonable fact finder\u201d to reverse the adverse credibility finding. <em>Chen, </em>468 F.Sd at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We DENY Delgado\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
