Flores agreed in the written plea agreement to waive her right to appeal her conviction, her sentence, and the manner in which her sentence was determined, with no exceptions. The Government has expressed its intent to enforce the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-18\">Flores argues on appeal that her sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). However, this argument is barred by her appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 231 (5th Cir.2006). Although Flores asserts that if the Government enforces the waiver, she preserves for possible Supreme Court review \u201cher argument that appeal waivers made without knowledge of the rights being sacrificed are neither knowing nor voluntary,\u201d she has not adequately briefed the issue, and thus she has abandoned it. <em>See United States v. Trujillo, </em>502 F.3d 353, 360 &amp; n. 30 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 612-13 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Beasley v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b845-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
