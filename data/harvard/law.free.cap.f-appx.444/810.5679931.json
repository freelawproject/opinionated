Therefore, he has abandoned any issues related to that denial. <em>See, e.g., Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 n. 10 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Milon contends the affidavit submitted with his motion satisfied the requirements for reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC). Motions to reopen removal proceedings are disfavored, and the moving party bears a heavy burden. <em>Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir.2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, this court generally applies a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d and will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cso long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach\u201d. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303-04 (5th Cir.2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">IAC can warrant reopening removal proceedings if petitioner satisfies the requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). To support an IAC claim, an alien must: (1) provide an affidavit attesting the relevant facts, including the terms of the attorney-client agreement; (2) before he presents the claim to the BIA, inform counsel of the allegations and allow counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) file or explain why a grievance has not been filed against counsel. <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Lozada, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 639. \u201cWhere essential information is lacking, it is impossible to evaluate the substance of [an IAC] claim.\u201d <em>Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">Milon did not, at any point in this proceeding, provide the BIA proof of his letter to former counsel or a filed grievance. \u201c[T]he general application of the <em>Lozada </em>rules is not an abuse of discretion\u201d. <em>Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b836-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
