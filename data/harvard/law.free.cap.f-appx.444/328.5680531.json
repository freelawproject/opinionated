Appellee Certain Interested Underwriters etc. (\u201cUnderwriters\u201d) brought the suit against appellant Michael and Edith Hali-koytakis d/b/a/ Hall Plaza (\u201cHall Plaza\u201d), an Underwriters\u2019 insured, to obtain a declaration that the insurance policy it issued to Hall Plaza provided no coverage for the claims asserted against Hall Plaza in a personal injury lawsuit brought against it and Point Builders, Inc., by Camilla Bernhardt and Brian Bernhardt in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Florida. The Bernhardts\u2019 claims stem from injuries Camilla Bernhardt received when she fell on the sidewalk across the street from Hall Plaza\u2019s premises. The Bernhardts\u2019 complaint alleged that Point Builders caused the sidewalk to be damaged by trucks and equipment it was using in performing certain construction work for Hall Plaza on Hall Plaza property, i.e., the removal of a retention pond, the installation of a storm-water drainage system, and the construction of a parking area. Point Builders was performing the work under a contract with Hall Plaza and damaged the sidewalk (where Camilla Bernhardt fell) while storing Point Builders\u2019 heavy equipment on a vacant lot located across the street from Hall Plaza\u2019s property and adjacent to the sidewalk.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-16\">This appeal is from the summary judgment the district court granted in Underwriters\u2019 favor. The court held the insurance policy at issue, as modified by endorsements including 'the Designated Premises Endorsement, was effectively converted into a premises liability policy, a policy that did not afford Hall Plaza coverage for Camilla Bernhardt\u2019s off-premises injury. We agree with the district court\u2019s holding. We also agree with the district court\u2019s holding that Hall Plaza breached the Independent Contractors Special Condition by failing to be named as an additional insured on its contractor\u2019s liability policy. As this condition states, \u201c[f|ailure to comply will invalidate this insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-17\">We find no basis for setting aside the district court\u2019s judgment. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b355-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-14\">. After responding to the Bernhardts\u2019 complaint, Hall Plaza filed a cross-claim against Point Builders, seeking indemnification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
