California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no issues of arguable merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Jones\u2019s revised sentence is affirmed. Nevertheless, we vacate and remand for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to correct a clerical error by docketing Jones\u2019s notice of appeal, which designated both the amended criminal judgment in the present case and the final order in a parallel civil action filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (Case No. l:09-cv-20685-PAS), in the aforementioned civil case as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-21\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
