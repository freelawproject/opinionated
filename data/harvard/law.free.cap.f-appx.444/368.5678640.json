His sentence reflects a 27-month upward departure, imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a). On appeal, Bryant argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">We review sentences for reasonableness under a deferential abuse-of discretion-standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The burden of demonstrating unreasonableness lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We find a sentence substantively unreasonable if, after considering the totality of the facts and circumstances, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). That a sentence falls below a statutory maximum penalty is an indicator of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (noting that the defendant\u2019s sentence was well below the statutory maximum when upholding the sentence as substantively reasonable). Extraordinary circumstances are not required to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">Bryant\u2019s 78-month sentence is substantively reasonable. The district court considered his criminal history, which included thirty-one criminal convictions. His criminal-history category did not account for six occasions on which Bryant was convicted for serious offenses. Additionally, Bryant used marijuana while on pretrial release, and then attempted to hide that fact by providing fake urine for a drug test. In light of Bryant\u2019s history, the district court found that the public should be protected from Bryant\u2019s likelihood of future criminal conduct. The district court also considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors after hearing arguments from both parties. Finally, Bryant\u2019s sentence is below the statutory maximum of ten years. Under these facts and circumstances, Bryant has failed to demonstrate that the district court committed a clear error of judgment. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
