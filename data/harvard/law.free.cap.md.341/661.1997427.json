State, </em>103 Md.App. 465, 653 A.2d 1000 (1995).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals held \u201cthat \u2018sexual conduct,\u2019 as that term is used in [the Statute], requires physical contact indicating a willingness to engage in either vaginal intercourse or a sexual act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480-81, 653 A.2d at 1007-08 (footnotes omitted). As explained below, we shall hold that \u201csexual conduct\u201d is not so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">The Statute generally prohibits reputation and opinion evidence relating to a victim\u2019s chastity in prosecutions for rape or sexual offense in the first or second degree. \u201cEvidence of specific instances of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct\u201d is prohibited unless the evidence clears two hurdles for admissibility. First, the trial court must find at a mandatory, in camera hearing that the evidence is relevant and material and \u201cthat its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not outweigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>its probative value.\u201d \u00a7 461A. Second, the specific instance evidence must fall within at least one of four exceptions to the prohibition against evidence of specific instances of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct. \u00a7 461A(a). Relevant to the contentions before us are the exceptions for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">\u201c(1) Evidence of the victim\u2019s past sexual conduct with the defendant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">\u201c(2) Evidence of specific instances of sexual activity showing the source or origin of semen, pregnancy, disease, or trauma; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">\u201c(3) Evidence which supports a claim that the victim has an ulterior motive in accusing the defendant of the crime[.]\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2X\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The arguments concerning the construction of \u201csexual conduct\u201d are presented against the background of two decisions by this Court, <em>Johnson v. State, </em>332 Md. 456, 632 A.2d 152 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>(1993) and <em>White v. State, </em>324 Md. 626, 598 A.2d 187 (1991). Initially reviewing that background will assist the reader.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">In <em>White </em>the victim testified that she had been abducted and raped in the back of a van. <em>Id. </em>at 630-31, 598 A.2d at 189. Under the defendants\u2019 evidence, there was no sexual intercourse, either voluntary or involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 632, 598 A.2d at 190. Nor was there any sexual contact, other than provocative moves and a grab by the victim who offered sex for drugs. Under the defendants\u2019 evidence, that offer was declined. <em>Id. </em>The defendants acknowledged purchasing some drugs for the victim, but they testified that she wanted more drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 631-32, 598 A.2d at 190. The theory of the defense was that the victim was angry because of the defendants\u2019 failure or refusal to purchase a sufficient quantity of drugs to satisfy the victim and that this anger motivated the false accusation of rape. <em>Id. </em>at 637, 598 A.2d at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Prior to closing their case in <em>White, </em>the defendants called a witness and proffered that \u201c \u2018he\u2019s going to testify that he has previous occasions when he has known that [the victim] has asked people to provide cocaine in return for sex.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632, 598 A.2d at 190. After objection by the State and in colloquy with the court, the defendants expanded their proffer, stating: \u201c \u2018He\u2019s going to testify that he has had instances when she participated in sex with him for drugs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, 598 A.2d at 190. The trial court excluded the proffered evidence, and this Court affirmed the defendants\u2019 convictions for rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Inasmuch as the defense in <em>White </em>was that there was no intercourse at all, the proffered evidence of prior sexual conduct was basically irrelevant. Our analysis did not distinguish the proffer of oral solicitations of drugs in exchange for sex, absent a proffer that the sex was consummated, from the proffer of consummated exchanges of sex for drugs. Speaking through Judge Chasanow, we said in <em>White:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">\u201cEven adopting the Whites\u2019 contention, it was not their declining [the victim\u2019s] offer of sex that motivated the false charge; it was their declining her request for drugs. Any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>prior sexual acts or prior sexual solicitations by [the victim] could have little, if any, relevance to her alleged anger at the Whites. In addition, the fact that [the victim] may have successfully offered or traded sex for drugs in the past does not tend to show that she would become enraged with the Whites for failing to supply her with drugs and declining her alleged sexual solicitation. [The witness\u2019s] testimony would have dubious relevance to establishing that [the victim] had an ulterior motive to lie, whereas its prejudice to [the victim] and the State would be extreme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 637, 598 A.2d at 192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the evidence was uncontradicted that sexual intercourse had taken place. The defense was consent. Johnson testified that the victim had agreed with one William Jackson to have sex with Jackson, Johnson and a co-defendant, in exchange for drugs (to \u201cfreak for drugs\u201d). <em>Johnson, </em>332 Md. at 459, 632 A.2d at 153. Johnson further testified that the victim had not been paid after she had fully performed her part of the bargain. <em>Id. </em>The theory of Johnson\u2019s defense was that the victim\u2019s anger over the breach of contract motivated her false accusation of rape. <em>Id. </em>at 459, 462, 632 A.2d at 153,154-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">By a pretrial motion <em>in limine, </em>pursuant to \u00a7 461A(b), Johnson sought a ruling permitting him to show, through the victim\u2019s own testimony, that she had freaked for drugs on previous occasions. <em>Id. </em>at 459, 632 A.2d at 153. At that in camera hearing, Johnson \u201celicited testimony from the victim that she had been freaking for crack cocaine for approximately six months.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459-60, 632 A.2d at 153-54. \u201cShe had freaked for crack cocaine most recently, she said, one week prior to being raped. The victim explained that when she wanted to get high, she would engage in sex for crack cocaine at anytime of the day or night.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 632 A.2d at 154. The victim denied freaking for drugs on the occasion charged, and she denied any previous sexual relations with Johnson or his co-defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>The trial court ruled that the fact that the victim may have traded sex for drugs in the past did not \u201c \u2018go to the issue of consent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The victim\u2019s testimony was excluded because \u201c \u2018the prejudicial factor is greater than any probative factor.... \u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 632 A.2d at 154. This Court held that the evidence was improperly excluded, and we reversed Johnson\u2019s judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Speaking through Judge Bell, we reasoned that, because the controlling issue was whether the victim was raped or freaking for cocaine, evidence that the victim had \u201cfreaked for cocaine in the past and, particularly, the very recent past, has special relevance to that issue; such evidence transcends mere evidence of bad character or, in the context of this case, sexual promiscuity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471-72, 632 A.2d at 159 (footnote omitted). If the jury found that the victim had agreed to provide sex for cocaine and did not receive her drugs, the jury could infer that she had an \u201culterior motive\u201d for making a charge of rape. <em>Id. </em>at 472, 632 A.2d at 159-60. We noted that in order to introduce evidence to prove ulterior motive there must be a direct relationship between the prior sexual conduct evidence and the ulterior motive, but the connection need not \u201cexclude any other possible interpretation of the evidence, or even ... be the most reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 632 A.2d at 160.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">Thus, we determined that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">\u201c[wjhen the [defendant] cross-examined the victim concerning her previously having freaked for cocaine, his purpose was not to show that she was ... a sexually promiscuous person; rather, it was to show that she had the disposition, displayed at some earlier time, to engage in such conduct and from that conduct coupled with her not having been paid, that she falsely accused him of rape. Proof of that particular disposition is relevant and material to the threshold determination whether, on the occasion in question, the victim was, as ... alleged, freaking for cocaine. How relevant and material depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>strength of the disposition evidence, <em>e.g., </em>its closeness in point of time to the incident in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 472, 632 A.2d at 160 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiQ\">We now turn to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The victim, a forty-two year old female, testified that she was gang raped by five youths on the night of October 8-9, 1993 in the apartment that she shared with her brother. The petitioners, Leroy Anthony Shand (Shand), Floyd Jackson Bailey (Bailey), and Kevin Christopher Allen (Allen), were convicted of first degree rape of the victim. Shand was also convicted of a first degree sexual offense against the victim, and Shand and Bailey were convicted of assault against the victim\u2019s brother. At the time Shand and Bailey were fifteen years old; Allen was sixteen. A fourth youth, Lamiah Hall (Hall), was tried with the petitioners and acquitted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">As described by the victim in her testimony, Shand and four others came into her apartment on the night of the offense trying to collect a drug debt due to Shand from her brother. He was unable to pay. Shand\u2019s colleagues pushed the victim\u2019s brother out of the apartment, and they left. Shand, holding an open knife and threatening to \u201cbust up\u201d the victim, led her into her bedroom. He had oral and vaginal sex with her without her permission. Shand told the victim that he wanted to make her brother see that Shand \u201cwasn\u2019t playing.\u201d After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Shand had sex with her, the others came into the bedroom. While Shand continued to hold the open knife, he told the others what to do. Each of the others had sex with the victim without her permission. She told them to stop and told them they were hurting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The issue concerning the Statute evolved somewhat peculiarly. At a pretrial motions hearing that was not attended by counsel for Shand, counsel for Hall (who was later acquitted) sought a severance because the evidence would likely show that Shand \u201chad engaged in certain drug transactions with the residents of that apartment during periods prior to the alleged incident.\u201d Hall\u2019s counsel proffered that the victim and her brother \u201chad engaged in prior drug transactions with the defendant, Shand, [and] that there had been sexual activity involved in prior drug transactions.\u201d When the State raised the Statute in objection, Hall\u2019s counsel cited to <em>Johnson. </em>The severance was later denied, but the colloquy led the State to file a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking a ruling excluding evidence of the type alluded to by Hall in arguing the severance motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">After the jury had been selected, but prior to opening statements, the court heard the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>Counsel for Shand said that Shand \u201cwould testify that he first met this lady about two weeks prior to this occurring, and the nature of that meeting was that she offered to him, personally, sex for drugs. I think that\u2019s an exception ... under the [Statute].\u201d Hall\u2019s counsel \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d that \u201cthe evidence would show that that information was communicated to all of the defendants.\u201d The court determined to hold an in camera hearing and directed that the victim be called to the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The State asked her whether, two weeks prior to October 8, 1993, she had offered Shand sex in exchange for drugs. The victim said \u201cno.\u201d She said that Shand \u201ctried to get me to do it, but I would not do it.\u201d Cross-examination developed that the victim was in the company of a man named Rod on that occasion, which was the first time that Shand ever made such an offer to the victim. Rod had something he wanted to sell in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>order to obtain drugs, and the victim was seeking some drugs herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Shand did not testify at the in camera hearing. His counsel proffered that Shand would testify, presumably at trial, that the victim initiated the offer, and he argued that the resulting conflict would be for the jury to resolve. The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfS\">\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely prevented by the Rape Shield Statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u201cState\u2019s motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Is that in regard to opening arguments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Counsel for Bailey then requested \u201ca ruling on the issue of impeachment of the State\u2019s witness regarding ... [an u]lterior motive to falsify.\u201d He submitted that the court had ruled \u201c[o]nly as to the issue of the victim\u2019s pas[t] sexual conduct with Mr. Shand____\u201d The court responded: \u201cI\u2019ll rule during the course of trial like I rule in any other trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">When the court inquired whether there was anything else to be taken up, the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-12\">\u201c[THE STATE]: We\u2019d simply ask that since the Court will be ruling on that <em>[ie., </em>impeachment by ulterior motive] as the trial proceeds, that counsel be instructed not to make any reference to that in opening statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-13\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR SHAND]: We have admonishment from the State. We have got that down pat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-14\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR HALL]: I don\u2019t intend to mention that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-15\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR BAILEY]: Neither do I.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">The record does not reflect an express acquiescence by counsel for Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">The jury was then brought in, the State made its opening, and counsel for Allen made the initial defense opening. He advised the jury that there was no question that the purpose of the defendants\u2019 having been in the apartment was to collect a drug debt, and that the question would be whether the victim consented. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201cAnd I can sum this whole case up in one word, if I could, and that word is trade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">\u201cWe believe that the evidence will show that this case is based upon a trade, a trade between [the victim] and Mr. Shand, a trade which included\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">\u201c[THE STATE]: For reasons already stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Shand did not testify at trial. Allen did not testify at trial. Bailey was the only defendant who testified. He said that, upon returning to the apartment, he found Shand and the victim copulating, apparently with mutual volition. He then graphically described the victim\u2019s orchestrating of the order of succeeding sex partners. Bailey\u2019s testimony, if believed, would have resulted in a finding of consent. Bailey, however, gave no evidence that the victim agreed to have sex with any one or more of the defendants in exchange for the promise, or present delivery, of drugs by any one or more of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">The jury found the petitioners guilty. Shand was sentenced to thirty years confinement, Bailey to twenty years, and Allen to eighteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">The petitioners appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the ruling on the motion <em>in limine </em>and the sustaining of the State\u2019s objection to Allen\u2019s opening statement constituted error. In its brief to the Court of Special Appeals the State assumed, but did not concede, that Shand\u2019s proffer fit within the Statute\u2019s exception for \u201c[e]vidence of the victim\u2019s past sexual conduct with the defendant.\u201d Court of Special Appeals, Nos. 860 &amp; 861, September Term, 1994, Brief of Appellee at 4. The State submitted that the proffered evidence was, nevertheless, inadmissible because \u201cits prejudicial and inflammatory nature outweighed its probative value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u201c[t]he legislative intent and purpose of section 461A indicates that \u2018sexual conduct\u2019 must not only involve physical contact, but the physical contact must evidence the victim\u2019s willingness to engage in either vaginal intercourse or a sexual act.\u201d <em>Shand, 103 </em>Md. App. at 480, 653 A.2d at 1007. Under that construction of the Statute, Shand\u2019s proffered evidence was not excluded by the prohibition against \u201c[ejvidence of specific instances of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct.\u201d \u00a7 461A. The Court of Special Appeals then considered the Statute\u2019s prohibition against reputation or opinion evidence relating to the victim\u2019s chastity. Expanding on <em>Lucado v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 25, 389 A.2d 398 (1978), which had explored the meaning of \u201cchastity\u201d in the Statute, and noting that the Statute \u201cwas enacted to protect rape victims from embarrassing disclosure of intimate details about their private lives,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cevidence of specific instances not involving physical contact ... can be excluded under the [Statute] as evidence relating to a victim\u2019s chastity.\u201d 103 Md.App. at 482-83, 653 A.2d at 1008-09. Consequently, the circuit court had properly excluded the evidence proffered by Shand, and the convictions were affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 483, 492, 653 A.2d at 1009, 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The petitioners sought a writ of certiorari, which this Court issued. They argue that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 construction of \u201csexual conduct\u201d is incorrect, and that the proffer should have been allowed. They also argue that the trial court\u2019s sustaining of the objection to Allen\u2019s opening statement prevented the defense from introducing evidence that the alleged victim had agreed to a trade on the night of the offenses charged. In this Court the State argues that the Court of Special Appeals correctly interpreted \u201csexual conduct,\u201d and, alternatively, that the proffer was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">For the reasons to be stated in Part IV, <em>infra, </em>we agree with the petitioners that Shand\u2019s proffer described \u201csexual conduct.\u201d Nevertheless, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals because, on the facts of this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>the proffer was properly excluded under principles of relevancy, applicable pursuant to the general law of evidence and the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The short answer to petitioners\u2019 contention is that there is no evidence that the victim\u2019s consent to sex with five persons was purchased on the night in question by any defendant\u2019s furnishing, or promising to furnish, drugs. Absent any such evidence, there is no basis for a Johnson-type argument, that is, that breach of the contract by the defendants gave rise to an ulterior motive, under the Statute\u2019s third specific instance exception, for the false accusation of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Further, absent any evidence that the victim offered to trade sex for drags on the night in question, there is little or no relevance to evidence that the victim offered to trade sex for drags two weeks prior to the night in question. The proffered evidence, standing alone, is legally insufficient to support a finding that the victim had traded sex for drags on the night in question. Petitioners\u2019 argument is analogous to a hypothetical motor tort trial in which the plaintiff, who has no proof that the defendant motorist was driving while drank at the time of the accident, offers to prove that fact by evidence that the defendant was driving while drank two weeks prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">If Shand had taken the stand and testified to an offer by the victim of sex for drugs two weeks earlier, without also testifying that he had indeed furnished drags for sex on the night in question, or even agreed to furnish drags, the testimony would simply highlight the lack of consent so that the only purpose of the testimony would be to present the victim as a sexually promiscuous person. Viewing the proffer in that light manifests that the improper prejudice outweighs the probative value, if any, so that the proffer was properly rejected.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The petitioners next argue that they were prevented from introducing evidence that the victim had in fact traded sex for drugs on the night in question because the court sustained the State\u2019s objection to Allen\u2019s reference to a trade during Allen\u2019s opening statement. The argument is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">First, the objection was sustained shortly after the court had ruled that there should be no reference in opening statements to ah offer of trade two weeks before the night in question. The timing of the objection and its reference to reasons previously given strongly suggest that the State and the court thought that Allen was moving into the area precluded by the motion <em>in limine </em>ruling. If Allen had proof that was not governed by the motion <em>in limine </em>ruling, it was incumbent upon Allen to make that clear. The trial court had already narrowed the scope of the <em>in limine </em>ruling by advising counsel that the court would consider evidence directed to ulterior motive as that evidence came up in the course of trial. If Allen had evidence that there had been a trade of sex for drugs on the night in question, it would be direct proof of consent and clearly admissible under the Statute. It is inconceivable that counsel would not even make a proffer of that evidence at some point in the trial. Absent any such proffer, however, there is no error that is addressable on direct review.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In its opinion in <em>Shand, </em>the Court of Special Appeals construed \u201csexual conduct\u201d in the Statute to require physical contact indicating a willingness to engage in either vaginal intercourse, as defined in \u00a7 461(g),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or a sexual act, as defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>in \u00a7 461(e).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 103 Md.App. at 480-81, 653 A.2d at 1007-08. The court also construed the Statute\u2019s prohibition against reputation and opinion evidence as to chastity to include specific acts. <em>Id. </em>at 482-83, 653 A.2d at 1008-09. We do not agree with either aspect of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In the instant matter Shand did not proffer to prove the victim\u2019s reputation; he proffered to prove specific conduct. Accordingly, analysis consistent with the Statute addresses the successive hurdles of relevancy and of exceptions to exclusion, as described in Part I hereof. Further, for a number of reasons, we conclude that \u201csexual conduct\u201d is not limited to \u201cphysical contact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The word \u201cconduct\u201d is defined as \u201cbehavior in a particular situation or relation or on a specified occasion.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>474 (1976). \u201cConduct\u201d is: \u201c[pjersonal behavior; deportment; mode of action; any positive or negative act.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>268 (5th ed. 1979). The act of <em>making an offer </em>to another person is certainly conduct, whether it is by spoken or written words or by gestures. If the offer is to trade sex for something else, that conduct may reasonably be considered to be sexual in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">As a matter of the internal construction of \u00a7 461A, the General Assembly used the term \u201csexual activity\u201d in the second exception, dealing with specific instance evidence \u201cshowing the source or origin of semen, pregnancy, disease, or trauma,\u201d an enumeration that has strong physical connotations. By way of contrast, the more general concept, \u201csexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>conduct,\u201d does not suggest that it is limited to physical contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Further, had the General Assembly intended to limit \u201csexual conduct\u201d to forms of sexual physical contact, it had available for incorporation into the Statute the definitions of \u201csexual act,\u201d \u201csexual contact,\u201d and \u201cvaginal intercourse\u201d appearing in \u00a7 461(e), (f) and (g).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Statute and the other provisions codified under the heading, \u201cSexual Offenses,\u201d in Article 27 are products of the 1976 legislative session at which the Statute (then limited only to rape) was House Bill 715 and the sex offenses statute was Senate Bill 358. As introduced, H.B. 715 would have been codified as \u00a7 <em>551% </em>1976 Laws of Maryland 1541. House Bill 715 was amended in the House Judiciary Committee to codify the Statute as \u00a7 461A, under the heading, \u201cRape.\u201d I House Journal 1830-31 (1976); Md. Code (1957, 1976 RepLVol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 461. House Bill 715 passed the House on March 11. II H.J. 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Senate Bill 358, from introduction to enactment, contained definitions applicable throughout the proposed new heading, \u201cSexual Offenses.\u201d 1976 Laws of Maryland 1530-32. It was approved by the Judicial Proceedings Committee, passed by the Senate, and sent to the House. Ultimately, S.B. 358 was completely rewritten in the House Judiciary Committee, passed by the House as amended, and returned to the Senate on the House legislative day of April 11. 1976 Laws of Maryland 1530-39; II H.J. 3760-61. The Senate concurred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the House amendments on calendar April 12 and Senate legislative day April 10. II Senate Journal 3277, 3420-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Meanwhile, the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee had reported out H.B. 715 with amendments, which included codifying the Statute as \u00a7 464F. II S.J. 3074-75. That change would still have left the Statute-under the \u201cSexual Offenses\u201d heading throughout which all of the definitions in \u00a7 461 of S.B. 358 would apply. The Senate passed H.B. 715 with the Senate amendments. <em>Id. </em>at 3075. The next day the Senate reconsidered that action, withdrew the amendments, and passed the Statute in the House form on calendar day April 11. <em>Id. </em>at 3202. Thus, although the clinically precise definitions in the sex offenses statute apply throughout that heading if a defined term is used, the General Assembly nevertheless continued to use in \u00a7 461A the more general, and statutorily undefined term, \u201csexual conduct.\u201d At a minimum, we do no violence to the legislative intent, as manifested by the legislative history, when we construe \u201csexual conduct\u201d to embrace a wider range of activity than \u201cphysical contact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Cases from other jurisdictions support the view that proffered evidence of prior \u201csexual conduct\u201d may include oral or written verbal conduct. In <em>People v. Hauver, </em>129 A.D.2d 889, 514 N.Y.S.2d 814 (1987), the trial court allowed the defendant \u201cto testify that the parties allegedly engaged in two prior sexual acts, that they engaged in sexual <em>conversations </em>prior to the incident, and even that the victim <em>stated </em>that \u2018she was out to get laid that night.\u2019 \u201d 514 N.Y.S.2d at 815 (emphasis added). Those determinations were not questioned on appeal. The singular exclusion upheld was the lower court\u2019s decision not to allow the defendant to testify that the victim told him that on the night of the rape \u201cshe was out whoring around.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Under California law it is clear that \u201csexual conduct\u201d does not require physical contact. In <em>People v. Casas, </em>181 Cal. App.3d 889, 226 Cal.Rptr. 285, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1010, 107 S.Ct. 652, 93 L.Ed.2d 707 (1986), the court specifically refused to \u201cconstrue \u2018sexual conduct\u2019 as meaning only acts of sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>intercourse.\u201d 226 Cal.Rptr. at 289. The court held that a victim\u2019s \u201cstatement that she offered to have sexual intercourse with [a third party] for money ... reflects the speaker\u2019s willingness to engage in sexual intercourse\u201d and falls within the rape shield law. <em>Id. </em>The court in <em>People v. Franklin, </em>25 Cal.App.4th 328, 30 Cal.Rptr.2d 376 (1994), stated that the' <em>term </em>\u201csexual conduct, [as used in the rape shield statute], encompasses any behavior that reflects the actor\u2019s or speaker\u2019s willingness to engage in sexual activity. The term should not be narrowly construed.\u201d 30 Cal.Rptr.2d at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The Alaska rule permits evidence of \u201cprevious sexual conduct\u201d of the victim under limited circumstances. Alaska Stat. \u00a7 12.45.045 (1962, 1995). Consent was at issue in <em>Kvasnikoff v. State, </em>674 P.2d 302 (Alaska Ct.App.1983), where the defendant sought to admit testimony, <em>inter alia, </em>of a witness who \u201cwould testify that he overheard [the victim] offer sex in exchange for protection to an unnamed prison inmate less than twenty-four hours prior\u201d to the rape. <em>Id. </em>at 304. Another witness would have testified that the victim \u201cmade a verbal agreement with him to engage in sexual acts, several weeks prior\u201d to the rape. <em>Id. </em>Yet another witness would have testified that the victim \u201casked him to engage in sex with him, over a year prior\u201d to the rape. <em>Id. </em>The court upheld the lower court\u2019s exclusion of the evidence based on a balancing test, but the court referred to the proffer as \u201cevidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The Oregon statute provides that \u201c \u2018[p]ast sexual behavior\u2019 means sexual behavior other than the sexual behavior with respect to which rape, sodomy or sexual abuse or attempted rape, sodomy or sexual abuse is alleged.\u201d Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 40.210, Rule 412(4)(b) (1993). In <em>State v. Thompson, </em>131 Or.App. 230, 884 P.2d 574 (1994), the court viewed proffered evidence that the victim had previously offered to trade sex for drugs as specific instances of the victim\u2019s \u201cpast sexual behavior.\u201d 884 P.2d at 577. That court\u2019s ultimate determination that the evidence was not admissible turned on whether the evidence met one of the exceptions to exclusion of specific instances of the victim\u2019s prior sexual behavior, but there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>no question about the proffer\u2019s being evidence of sexual behavior. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Federal Rule of Evidence 412 was amended effective December 1, 1994. As amended, the federal rule allows specific instances of sexual behavior of the victim, including specific instances of sexual behavior with the defendant, subject to an in camera hearing. Fed.R.Evid. 412(b)(1)(B); 412(c)(2). Although the Statute is not derived from the federal rule, both resulted from identical concerns. <em>White, </em>324 Md. at 635-36, 598 A.2d at 191-92.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The federal and Maryland requirements similarly bar admission of reputation and opinion evidence and admit specific instances of prior sexual conduct or behavior only under limited, albeit sometimes different, circumstances.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> One commentary on the federal rule has concluded that \u201c[pjast sexual behavior connotes all activities that involve actual physical conduct, i.e. sexual intercourse and sexual contact, <em>or that imply sexual intercourse or sexual contact.\u201d 2 </em>J.B. Weinstein, M.A. Berger &amp; J.M. McLaughlin, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence: Special Alert\u2014Amendment to Federal Rule of Evidence 112, </em>at 5 (1995) (emphasis added). Indeed, the authors opine that, when offered to prove consent of the victim, evidence would be admissible describing \u201cprior instances of sexual activities between the alleged victim and the accused, as well as statements in which the alleged victim expressed an intent to engage in sexual intercourse with the accused, or voiced sexual fantasies involving the specific accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>There is no blanket prohibition in the Statute against admitting evidence of an oral, unconsummated offer, by the victim, to trade sex for drugs. The conduct is \u201csexual conduct,\u201d and the admissibility of evidence of a specific instance of such sexual conduct should be analyzed under the facts and circumstances of each case in accordance with the provisions of the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
