We hold that the judge\u2019s ruling did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">This appeal stems from an attorney malpractice action brought in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County in 1988 by Respondent Lottie Ankney (Ankney) against William A. Franch (Franch), Petitioner, alleging negligence in Franch\u2019s representation of Ankney in a workers\u2019 compensation claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The gist of Ankney\u2019s complaint is that Franch gave her bad advice regarding the prospects of successfully appealing an unfavorable ruling of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the Commission), and that as a result she failed to pursue an appeal that would have been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Ankney injured her back in January 1982 during the course of her employment at Maritel Enterprises (Maritel). She had been sent to purchase lunch for a meeting. Returning to the office, Ankney slipped and fell on an icy parking lot owned by a third party, Beerfoot Enterprises, Inc. Ankney filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim against her employer, Maritel, and in April of 1982 the Commission awarded her compensation for medical expenses associated with the injury plus $177 per week in disability benefits. All benefits were to be paid by her employer\u2019s insurance company, Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company (Aetna). Ankney\u2019s attorney in the original workers\u2019 compensation proceeding was Samuel H. Paavola.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">According to Ankney, Aetna was slow in paying her medical expenses, and that as a result she suffered financial hardship. After one of her doctors filed suit against her for non-payment of medical bills, Ankney complained about the situation to Paavola. In response, Paavola negotiated a $6,500 settlement with Beerfoot, the owner of the parking lot in which Ankney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>had been injured. The settlement was reached without the prior knowledge or approval of Aetna. Part of the settlement was retained by Paavola as attorney fees, and Ankney used the remainder of the money, $4,573.55, to pay part of her medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Upon learning from Paavola that Ankney had recovered $6,500 from the parking lot owner, Aetna advised Paavola that it would no longer pay Ankney workers\u2019 compensation benefits on the ground that its subrogation interests in the claim against Beerfoot had been prejudiced by the settlement. In fact, Aetna indicated that it was \u201cvery surprised\u201d to learn of the settlement with Beerfoot since it was \u201cinitially advised that the accident occurred\u201d on property owned by Maritel, Ankney\u2019s employer. At some point after the settlement with Beerfoot, Ankney discharged Paavola and retained Franch to represent her. In August of 1984, Franch requested an emergency hearing before the Commission on Ankney\u2019s case due to \u201cserious financial problems\u201d she was suffering. At the hearing, Aetna argued that it was no longer liable to pay Ankney any benefits because Ankney had entered into an unauthorized settlement with the third-party tortfeasor, Beer-foot. In an order dated January 29, 1985, the Commission agreed with Aetna and terminated Ankney\u2019s benefits from the date of the settlement with Beerfoot.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Shortly after the Commission\u2019s ruling, Ankney had discussions with Franch and his law partner, Ronald Jarashow, regarding the possibility of appealing the Commission\u2019s ruling. According to Ankney, Franch and Jarashow advised her that she could appeal the decision to circuit court, but that she would have to advance $2,500 to cover costs associated with the appeal and that she would have little chance of prevailing. This advice was apparently based on the view that the unauthorized settlement probably foreclosed Ankney\u2019s right to future benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on the advice of Franch and Jara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>show, Ankney opted not to pursue the appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a letter to Ankney dated February 28, 1985, Franch confirmed that he did \u201cnot believe that an appeal could be successful,\u201d and therefore \u201cit was mutually agreed that there would be no appeal taken.\u201d The time for appealing the commission\u2019s decision expired, and Ankney lost her opportunity to challenge the Commission\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In January of 1988, Ankney filed a malpractice action against Franch and his law firm, Frarich, Earnest &amp; Crowdrey, P.A., alleging that the defendants breached the generally accepted standards of care by failing to appeal the Commission\u2019s ruling. At trial on the malpractice action in August of 1993, Ankney produced, as expert witnesses, two attorneys who practice in the field of workers\u2019 compensation law, Herbert J. Arnold (Arnold) and Harold DuBois (DuBois). Both attorneys testified that, contrary to what Franch advised Ankney, an appeal of the Commission\u2019s ruling would have succeeded and would not have involved significant litigation expenses. Both attorneys testified that the Commission erred as a matter of law in terminating Ankney\u2019s benefits, and therefore she would have prevailed in the circuit court via a motion for summary judgment. The experts further opined that, in advising Ankney that a circuit court appeal had little chance of success, Franch had breached the duty of care he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>owed Ankney, his client, and that that breach had caused Ankney to lose workers\u2019 compensation benefits to which she was entitled. DuBois estimated the potential value of the lost benefits at $320,000 plus the value of Ankney\u2019s medical expenses related to the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">At the conclusion of Ankney\u2019s case, Judge Raymond G. Thieme, Jr. granted Franch\u2019s motion to strike the testimony of both experts on the ground that the opinions were based on an incorrect interpretation of Maryland law. The trial judge then granted a motion for judgment in favor of Franch on the ground that Ankney had failed to produce any admissible expert testimony establishing the relevant standard of care.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ankney appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court held that the judge\u2019s striking of the testimony constituted a \u201cclear abuse of discretion,\u201d and remanded the case for retrial. <em>Ankney v. Franch, </em>103 Md.App. 83, 115-16, 652 A.2d 1138, 1153-54 (1995). We granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Maryland Code (1991 Repl.Vol, 1995 Supp.), Labor and Employment Article (LE), \u00a7\u00a7 9-101 through 9-1201,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an employer is generally required to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an employee who suffers an accidental personal injury in the course of employment, regardless of whether the employer is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>at fault for the injury. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-501. Where, as here, the employee\u2019s injury resulted from the tortious conduct of a third-party, the statute grants the employer<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the right to sue the third-party to recover an amount equal to the benefits the employer has been required to pay the employee because of the injury. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-902(a) and (b); <em>Erie Insurance v. Curtis, </em>330 Md. 160, 164, 623 A.2d 184, 186 (1993). The employer has the exclusive right to pursue a cause of action against the third-party tortfeasor for two months. LE \u00a7 9-902(c); Eri<em>e, </em>330 Md. at 164, 623 A.2d at 186. Thereafter, the employee also has the right to bring an action against the third-party, but the employer retains subrogation rights in the employee\u2019s claim. <em>Erie, </em>330 Md. at 164, 623 A.2d at 186. The employer\u2019s subrogation interest in the third-party claim acts as a \u201cstatutory lien\u201d on any recovery the employee may obtain from the third-party. Richard P. Gilbert and Robert L. Humphreys, Jr., Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook \u00a7 16.1-5, at 325 (2d ed. 1993, 1995 Cum.Supp.). In other words, if the employee recovers compensation from the third-party tortfeasor, the employer is entitled to obtain reimbursement for its workers\u2019 compensation payments from the proceeds. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-902(e). Where recovery from the third party is less than the employee is entitled to receive in benefits, the employee retains the right to recover the difference between the amount received from the third party and the amount payable under the statute. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-902, 9-903; <em>see also Brocker Mfg. v. Mashburn, </em>17 Md.App. 327, 301 A.2d 501 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The employer\u2019s rights in the claim against the third party are only those derived through the employee. <em>See Johnson v. </em>Miles, 188 Md. 455, 459, 53 A.2d 30, 32 (1947). Pursuant to general principles of subrogation law, therefore, if an injured employee settles the claim and releases the third-party tortfeasor from liability, the employer\u2019s ability to pursue the claim against the tortfeasor is extinguished. <em>See Noma </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>Elec. Corp. v. Fidel. &amp; Dep. Co., </em>201 Md. 407, 410, 94 A.2d 277, 278 (1953); 6A John Alan Appleman and Jean Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4092, at 239 (1972); 16 Couch on Insurance 2d (Rev ed.) \u00a7 61:194, at 250-51 (1983). Thus, a <em>de minimis </em>settlement between the employee and the tortfeasor could prejudice the employer\u2019s interest by depriving the employer of its ability to obtain reimbursement equal to the full value of the third-party claim. <em>See </em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook \u00a7 16.1-5, at 325. For example, in the instant case, Aetna may have been prejudiced if Beerfoot was negligent in failing to keep its parking lot free of ice. If Beerfoot\u2019s negligence caused Ankney to slip and fall, then under general principles of tort law Beerfoot was liable for the full extent of Ankney\u2019s damages. In settling the claim against Beerfoot and releasing it from liability, however, Ankney destroyed Aetna\u2019s right to obtain any reimbursement from Beerfoot. Therefore, an employee should notify the employer or insurer when making a claim against a third party and when contemplating any settlement, especially when the settlement is substantially below the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid or payable by the employer/insurer. <em>See </em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook \u00a7 16.1-5, at 325; <em>see also Western Maryland Railway Co. v. Assurance Corp., </em>163 Md. 97, 103-04, 161 A. 5, 8 (1932) (noting that an insured who settles with a third-party tortfeasor without the acquiescence of the insurance company risks forfeiting all money previously recovered by the insured from the insurance company).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The question at the heart of this case is what was the effect of Ankney\u2019s unauthorized settlement on Aetna\u2019s duty to pay future workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Ankney? The Commission ruled that the settlement fully relieved Aetna of its responsibility to pay any benefits after the date of the settlement. The Court of Special Appeals, however, concluded that the Commission\u2019s decision to terminate Ankney\u2019s benefits was \u201cinconsistent with the legislative intent\u201d of the workers\u2019 compensation statute. <em>Ankney, </em>103 Md.App. at 108, 652 A.2d at 1150. The intermediate appellate court held that \u201can unautho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>rized third-party settlement does not, in itself, constitute grounds for the termination\u201d of benefits. <em>Ankney, </em>103 Md. App. at 109, 652 A.2d at 1150. Rather, the court held, the employer is entitled to reimbursement from the proceeds of the settlement as the statute provides. <em>Ankney, </em>103 Md.App. at 110, 652 A.2d at 1151. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-902(e). Additionally, the court held that if the employer can establish that it has been <em>prejudiced by </em>the settlement, i.e., because the reasonable dollar value of the third-party claim might have been significantly greater than the amount of the actual unauthorized settlement and the settlement was less than the workers\u2019 compensation benefits, then the employer is also entitled to a credit for the amount of the prejudice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Ankney, </em>103 Md.App. at 109-10, 652 A.2d at 1151. The court also noted that in cases where the total amount of the credits due the employer because of the unauthorized settlement exceeds the amount of future benefits that would be due the employee, the employee\u2019s benefits could be terminated. <em>Ankney, </em>103 Md.App. at 111, 652 A.2d at 1151. <em>See also </em>LE \u00a7 9-903.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the above described analysis by the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, the parties do not contend otherwise.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We turn to the ruling of the trial judge striking the testimony of Ankney\u2019s two expert witnesses, which the Court of Special Appeals held to be an abuse of discretion. As a general rule, expert witnesses may not give opinions on questions of law except for those concerning the law of another jurisdiction. 6 Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 702.1, at 219-20 (citing Maryland cases); 1 McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 12, at 50 (John W. Strong ed., 4th ed. 1992). Expert testimony of attorneys is admissible in attorney malpractice cases, however, for the purpose of establishing the standard of care for a reasonable, prudent lawyer in a particular situation. <em>See Cochrane v. Little, </em>71 Md. 823, 333, 18 A. 698, 701 (1889); <em>Hooper v. Gill, </em>79 Md.App. 437, 441, 557 A.2d 1349, 1351, <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. 510, 564 A.2d 1182 (1989), <em>and cert. denied, </em>496 U.S. 906, 110 S.Ct. 2588, 110 L.Ed.2d 269 (1990). Because an expert opinion on the standard of care in an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>negligence case is often based upon the expert\u2019s interpretation of the law, experts in such cases may state their opinion on the law as a foundation for their opinion on the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In the instant case, the testimony of Arnold and Dubois was offered for the purpose of establishing that a reasonable, prudent attorney in Franch\u2019s position would have advised Ankney of the probable success of an appeal of the Commission\u2019s ruling terminating her benefits. The basis for the testimony given by both experts was their view that, under Maryland law, the only effect of the unauthorized third-party settlement was to entitle Aetna to a credit for an amount equal to that received by Ankney in the third-party settlement. The witnesses testified that, in their opinions, the Commission had erred as a matter of law in terminating Ankney\u2019s benefits simply because of the unauthorized settlement. Therefore, the experts testified, Franch was negligent in not advising Ankney to pursue the appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">The first expert, Arnold, gave the following testimony:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeF\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Mr. Arnold, you said that you found [the Commission]\u2019s opinion [terminating Ankney\u2019s benefits] to have been totally erroneous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">[ARNOLD]: I think it was erroneous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: * * * Aetna had put on evidence that Mr. Paavola had settled the claim with Beerfoot, the third-party, without Aetna\u2019s knowledge ... and without Aetna\u2019s approval.... Are you saying that that evidence was irrelevant to the\u2014to the issues?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">[ARNOLD]: To the final issues in the case, yes. * * * I think that the end result in the case was that Aetna was entitled to a credit for the net amount received by Mrs. [Ankney] against any future [compensation award and nothing more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\"><em>* </em>*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: * * * [I]sn\u2019t it the law in Maryland that Aetna could argue, we have been prejudiced by this unapproved settlement and ... [w]e are entitled to more than a credit, we\u2019re entitled to the\u2014to a credit for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>extent of our prejudice, not for the extent of what was actually paid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">[ARNOLD]: No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The second expert, Dubois, gave a similar opinion as to the effect of the unauthorized settlement. He testified that whether Ankney had settled the case without Aetna\u2019s consent was irrelevant, since Aetna would be entitled only to a credit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In granting Franch\u2019s motion to strike the testimony, Judge Thieme ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">\u201cI considered <em>[Western Maryland Railway Co. v. Assurance Corp., </em>163 Md. 97, 161 A. 5 (1932) ] as the only authority, at least the guiding authority in\u2014on this case. And I am satisfied that one reading of that case would clearly be that the . .. Commission[ ] is right in cutting off the [benefits]. * * * [T]hat would be a logical extension of that case. I also have some problems as to whether that would be the current law. Now, to take the position that the only alternative would be for a credit, I think is just a complete misstatement of the law. I don\u2019t accept that. I believe that the insurance company certainly would have a right to show that the actions were ... prejudicial. * * * So, I believe that both Mr. Dubois and Mr. Arnold\u2019s opinions are incorrect and I will grant the [m]otion to strike them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">In essence, Judge Thieme ruled that the expert testimony of both Arnold and DuBois was predicated upon a faulty interpretation of Maryland law. Accordingly, he struck the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>It is well-settled that the decision to admit or exclude expert testimony is within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Hartless v. State, </em>327 Md. 558, 576, 611 A.2d 581, 590 (1992); <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 43, 542 A.2d 1258, 1263 (1988); <em>Franceschina v. Hope, </em>267 Md. 632, 636, 298 A.2d 400, 403 (1973). A trial judge\u2019s decision to admit or exclude expert testimony will be reversed only if it is founded on an error of law or some serious mistake, or if the judge has abused his discretion. <em>Hartless, </em>327 Md. at 576, 611 A.2d at 590. Further, if an expert\u2019s opinion testimony is based upon a premise which is shown to be unsound or faulty, the judge should strike the testimony. <em>See Evans v. State, </em>322 Md. 24, 34-35, 585 A.2d 204, 209 (1991) (\u201cThe expert\u2019s opinion is of no greater value than the soundness of the reasons given for it will warrant. If no adequate basis for the opinion is shown, the opinion should not be admitted or, if already admitted, should be stricken.\u201d) (quoting Maryland Evidence \u00a7 705.1, at 256-57). <em>See also State, Use of Stickley v. Critzer, </em>230 Md. 286, 290, 186 A.2d 586, 588 (1962) (\u201c[N]o matter how highly qualified the expert may be in his field, his opinion has no probative force unless a sufficient basis to support a rational conclusion is shown.\u201d) (footnote omitted). Applying these principles to Judge Thieme\u2019s ruling in the instant case, we find no basis for reversing his decision to strike the testimony. The foundation for the testimony of both experts was their belief that any prejudice Aetna may have suffered because of the unauthorized settlement was irrelevant to Aetna\u2019s liability to pay benefits. As the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals in this case demonstrated, this interpretation of Maryland law was incorrect. In actuality, Aetna would have been entitled to a credit of $6,500 as well as an amount equal to any prejudice that it could demonstrate it suffered as a result of the unauthorized settlement. <em>Ankney, </em>103 Md.App. at 110, 652 A.2d at 1151. Hence, the amount of prejudice caused by the settlement was relevant. Accordingly, the experts\u2019 opinions that Franch\u2019s advice was negligent were based upon an unsound premise. The trial judge could reasonably have concluded that this defective premise was material to the admissibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the experts\u2019 opinions. Therefore, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in striking the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The Court of Special Appeals, in finding that the judge abused his discretion, ruled that a judge may not strike expert testimony in a way that is \u201cunduly prejudicial\u201d to a litigant. <em>Ankney, </em>103 Md.App. at 115, 652 A.2d at 1153. The intermediate appellate court apparently found the striking of the testimony in this case \u201cunduly prejudicial\u201d because it left Ankney without any expert testimony, which was necessary to her case. We disagiee with this analysis. Trial judges are not barred from striking expert opinions that are based on an unsound or deficient premise simply because those opinions are vital to a party\u2019s case. Here, the opinions of both Arnold and DuBois were based on an incorrect interpretation of the law. The judge was therefore fully justified in striking the testimony. Moreover, Franch filed a pre-trial memorandum based on the depositions of both experts, arguing that their testimony should be excluded because their opinions were based on an incorrect interpretation of Maryland law. Accordingly, Ankney was on notice before trial that the basis for the experts\u2019 opinions would be challenged by Franch and might be stricken. Nonetheless, Ankney proceeded to offer the testimony, and both experts, consistent with their prior depositions, testified based on an incorrect interpretation of the law. Under these circumstances, we fail to see how Judge Thieme\u2019s ruling was \u201cunduly prejudicial.\u201d We find no abuse of discretion. Therefore, we reverse the holding of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Expert testimony as to the relevant standard of care is necessary in an attorney malpractice case, except in those cases where the common knowledge or experience of laymen is sufficient to allow the fact finder to infer negligence from the facts. <em>Hooper v.

Hence, under the holding of the Court of Special Appeals in the present case, Aetna would be entitled to a credit for the amount of the settlement ($6,500) minus attorney fees and costs. Further, if Aetna could demonstrate that the reasonable dollar value of the claim against Beerfoot was greater than $6,500, it would also be entitled to a credit for that amount against its liability to Ankney. <em>Ankney v.

In reaching its decision, the Court of Special Appeals also held that, had Ankney appealed the Commission's ruling to circuit court, Aetna would not have had the opportunity to litigate the question of the full value of the claim against Beerfoot in circuit court. <em>Ankney, </em>103 Md.App. at 112-13, 652 A.2d at 1152. Because of our holding in Section III of this opinion, <em>infra, </em>we find it unnecessary to reach this issue. We stress, however, that we in no way express approval for the Court of Special Appeals' holding with respect to the scope of review of a workers' compensation claim in the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b355-9\">. Franch, the Petitioner, raised in his Petition for Certiorari the propriety of the Court of Special Appeals' holding that the unauthorized settlement did not automatically terminate workers' compensation benefits. Franch did not, however, dispute this holding in his brief to this Court. Ankney did not file a Cross Petition for Certiorari challenging the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that the unauthorized settlement entitled the employer to a credit for the amount of the settlement plus any amount it was prejudiced by the settlement. Therefore, the intermediate appellate court's holding on that question is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\">. Unlike Arnold, DuBois was not as explicit that Aetna would be entitled only to a credit equal to the amount of the third-party settlement. DuBois did, however, testify that it was irrelevant whether Aetna knew about or consented to the settlement. This testimony carried essentially the same meaning as Arnold\u2019s testimony because, were it truly irrelevant whether Aetna consented to the settlement, Aetna would have been entitled to the same credit as if it had consented, i.e., an amount equal to the amount of the settlement. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-902(e). Hence, Dubois's testimony was based on the same legal interpretation as Arnold's testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b359-6\">BELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ad9\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">I agree with the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See Ankney v.
