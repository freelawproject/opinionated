The agreement, ending sixteen years of litigation between the County and the owner of a billboard company, granted to the owner the right to maintain its billboards within the County for a period of ten years, despite a County zoning regulation prohibiting all billboards. Montgomery County contends that the agreement was void from its inception because it impermissibly undermined legislative and executive discretion in the enactment and enforcement of the County\u2019s zoning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">In 1968, the Montgomery County Council, sitting as a district council, amended its zoning regulations concerning outdoor signs and billboards. The new regulatory language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>governed the placement, height and width of billboards within the County. The 1968 regulations provided that any existing billboards not conforming with the new standards were required to be removed.at the end of a period of two years from the effective date of the regulations or four years from the date the billboards were erected] whichever occurred later. After the expirations of the time periods provided for in the regulations, controversies arose between Montgomery County and Rollins Outdoor Advertising, Sine., over billboards owned by Rollins. Montgomery County contended that the billboards did not comply with the standards set forth in the 1968 regulations and that they should be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In 1974, Rollins filed an action against Montgomery County, the County Executive and the Council,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, challenging the validity of the 1968 billboard regulations and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The bill of complaint alleged that Rollins, which operated and maintained billboards in Montgomery County, had been denied permission to erect a new billboard and that the denial was \u201cbased upon the discriminatory setback provisions\u201d of the 1968 regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The bill of complaint also alleged that Rollins had been ordered, without an offer of just compensation, to remove numerous existing billboards which did not conform to the location specifications set forth in the 1968 regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Rollins asserted that Montgomery County\u2019s enactment and enforcement of the 1968 regulations violated Articles 17 and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, Rollins maintained that the billboard regulations constituted prohibited retrospective legislation, that they violated \u201csubstantive\u201d due process and equal protection principles, and that they deprived Rollins of property without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">In 1986, while the above-described litigation was still pending, the district council amended the zoning regulations to prohibit all billboards within the County.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Neither the 1986 amendment, nor the 1968 regulations, provided for compensation to the owners of billboards. Rollins amended its bill of complaint, adding contentions that the County\u2019s ban on billboards violated state statutes mandating just compensation when a governmental subdivision requires the removal of billboards, as well as Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rollins also maintained that Montgomery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>County\u2019s regulations violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by denying just compensation to Rollins and violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by restricting Rollins\u2019s ability to disseminate speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">In April 1990, sixteen years after the filing of the original bill of complaint, Rollins\u2019s successor-in-interest, Reagan Outdoor Advertising, Inc., entered into a written settlement agreement with Montgomery County. In addition to being signed by the county attorney and county and Reagan officials, the agreement was signed by the trial judge below the words, \u201cSO ORDERED.\u201d The circuit court\u2019s docket entry for April 11, 1990, reads as follows: \u201cStipulated Consent Agreement (McKenna, J.) Granted____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The settlement agreement permitted Reagan to continue \u201cmaintaining] within the County ... forty-seven [billboards]\u201d for a period of ten years. Reagan could replace and relocate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>billboards to a new location if either \u201c(i) a lease for the premises on which a sign is located is not to be continued, or (ii) an outdoor advertising structure has been destroyed or has deteriorated to the point that it is no longer in a safe condition.\u201d Relocation of billboards was limited to not \u201cmore than five signs within any calendar year,\u201d with Reagan having the sole discretion as to which signs were to be relocated. The agreement placed certain restrictions on where billboards could be relocated but stated that \u201cin no event shall the County utilize procedures or fees to impair Reagan from exercising its rights under this Agreement.\u201d In the contract, the parties expressly agreed upon the \u201cdismissal of any and all pending litigation between the County and Reagan.... \u201d Finally, the agreement stated that \u201c[i]n the event either party fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement the other party shall be entitled to seek an order of the Court to enforce the Agreement.. .. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">In March 1992, Revere National Corporation, the successor-in-interest to Reagan, sought the County\u2019s permission to construct a replacement billboard pursuant to the provisions of the settlement agreement. The request was denied in May 1992 because, according to the County, the settlement agreement entered into by the parties was \u201cvoid <em>ab initio,\u201d </em>and Revere was requesting \u201cto build a prohibited sign,\u201d whereas the county regulations banned all billboards.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Upon the County\u2019s denial of its request, Revere filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a \u201cMotion to Adjudicate Defendants In Contempt of Court and For An Order to Enforce Stipulated Consent Agreement.\u201d After setting forth the pertinent facts, Revere\u2019s Motion asserted that the defendants \u201chave violated the April 11, 1990 Order of this Court.\u201d Revere sought to have the defendants adjudicated in contempt, sought an order requiring the defendants to comply with the settlement agreement \u201cwhich was entered as an order of the [circuit] Court,\u201d and requested compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>In response, the County filed a \u201cMotion To Vacate The Stipulated Consent Agreement of April 11, 1990,\u201d as embodied in the court\u2019s order. The County asserted that the settlement agreement \u201cis void <em>ab initio </em>because it purports to permit what the Montgomery County Zoning Ordinance prohibits, namely the existence of 47 billboards in Montgomery County.\u201d The County went on to state that it \u201chas no authority to make such an agreement or to consent to a court order which violates the Zoning Ordinance\u2019s prohibition on billboards.... \u201d The County requested the court to find that the settlement agreement \u201cis void <em>ab initio </em>and order that it be vacated.\u201d The County filed a separate answer to Revere\u2019s motion, also asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the settlement agreement was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The circuit court, after a hearing, denied the County\u2019s motion to vacate the settlement agreement and, without ruling on Revere\u2019s motion, stated that the denial of the County\u2019s motion to vacate the settlement agreement, as embodied in the 1990 court order, was final and appealable. Montgomery County then noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In April 1993, the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, dismissed the appeal on the ground that the appeal was premature because the trial court had not yet ruled on the pending motions from Revere and thus a final judgment did not exist. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2-602(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">After receiving additional memoranda and holding another hearing, the circuit court on November 18, 1993, entered an order granting the County\u2019s motion to vacate the settlement agreement and denying Revere\u2019s motion to enforce the agreement and to hold the defendants in contempt. The circuit court expressed the view that the April 11,1990, order approving the settlement agreement was not a final judgment terminating the action brought by Revere\u2019s predecessor in 1974, and that, therefore, the April 1990 order remained subject to revision at anytime under Maryland Rule 2-602(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>circuit court further held that the settlement agreement and April 1990 order should be vacated because Montgomery County had no power to enter into an agreement contrary to its zoning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Revere appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s order in another unreported opinion. The Court of Special Appeals held that the settlement agreement, as embodied in the April 1990 circuit court order, constituted a final judgment terminating the action instituted by Revere\u2019s predecessor in 1974. The intermediate appellate court further held that Montgomery County had not shown any valid basis to set aside the 1990 judgment. The Court of Special Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201c[Montgomery County] maintains that it had no ability to agree to the terms contained in the agreement because the County Executive and executive branch officials who are obligated to enforce the Zoning Ordinance cannot implement an agreement that violates the Zoning Ordinance. We shall not address that contention, however; it is of no consequence in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201cWhen an agreement is incorporated into an enrolled decree, an attack may not be made upon the agreement without simultaneously challenging the validity of the decree .... Inasmuch as the Stipulated Consent Agreement was incorporated into the court\u2019s judgment, appellee\u2019s attack in the lower court was upon an enrolled decree. To set aside an enrolled decree, it is necessary to demonstrate fraud, mistake or irregularity. Maryland Rule 2-535.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">* *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u201cIn summary, since the order vacated was a final, enrolled judgment, the court erred in vacating it, absent fraud, mistake, or irregularity, on the grounds that the agreement incorporated therein was void <em>ab initio </em>because one of the parties had no authority to enter into it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Montgomery County filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted. <em>Montgomery County v. Revere National Corp., </em>336 Md. 705, 650 A.2d 295 (1994). Montgomery County argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the April 11, 1990, order constituted a final judgment. The County asserts that the April 1990 order did not dispose of all the underlying issues in the case, was therefore not final, and is subject to revision at any time pursuant to Rule 2-602(a)(3). Alternatively, Montgomery County contends that if the April 1990 order was a final judgment, the judgment can still be set aside because <em>ultra vires </em>acts of a county or municipality, even if embodied in a final court judgment, are \u201cvoid.\u201d Finally, the County argues that the settlement agreement, as incorporated in the April 1990 order, exceeds the authority of Montgomery County because it violates the County\u2019s zoning regulation that prohibits all billboards. Thus, according to the County, the circuit court did not err in vacating the 1990 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Revere, on the other hand, asserts that the Court of Special Appeals correctly held that the April 1990 order was a final judgment. Moreover, because the April 1990 order was a final judgment, Revere contends that the circuit court was prohibited from revising the judgment absent fraud, mistake, or irregularity, and that there was no fraud, mistake or irregularity in the present case. See Rule 2-535. Finally, Revere argues that the County did not exceed its authority in entering into the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">We shall first address the issue of whether the April 1990 order constituted a final judgment. If the April 1990 order was not a final judgment, it \u201cis subject to revision at any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>before the entry of a [final] judgment.... \u201d Rule 2\u2014602(a)(3). If the April 1990 order was a final judgment, however, it would ordinarily be subject to revision only during a thirty-day period after the entry of the order on April 11, 1990. Rule 2-535(a). After the thirty-day period, Rule 2-535(b) authorizes revision of a judgment only \u201cin case of fraud, mistake or irregularity.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The County maintains that the settlement agreement, as incorporated in the April 1990 court order, \u201cdid not resolve any of the constitutional or statutory issues raised in the Amended complaint\u201d and \u201cgranted none of the relief prayed for.\u201d (County\u2019s brief in this Court at 33-34). For this reason, according to the County, the April 1990 order was not final. A similar argument was recently rejected by this Court in <em>Horsey v. Horsey, </em>329 Md. 392, 401-402, 620 A.2d 305, 310 (1993), where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\u201cContrary to the view expressed by the defendant ... in this case, a trial court\u2019s order sometimes may constitute a final appealable judgment even though the order fails to settle the underlying dispute between the parties. Where a trial court\u2019s order has \u2018the effect of putting the parties out of court, [it] is a final appealable order.\u2019 <em>Houghton v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>County Comm\u2019rs. of Kent Co., </em>305 Md. 407, 412, 504 A.2d 1145, 1148 (1986), and eases there cited. <em>See, e.g., Wilde v. Swanson, </em>314 Md. 80, 85, 548 A.2d 837, 839 (1988) (\u2018An order of a circuit court ... [may be] a final judgment without any adjudication by the circuit court on the merits\u2019); <em>Doehring v. Wagner, </em>311 Md. 272, 275, 533 A.2d 1300, 1301-1302 (1987) (trial court\u2019s order \u2018terminating the litigation in that court\u2019 was a final judgment); <em>Walbert v. Walbert, </em>310 Md. 657, 661, 531 A.2d 291, 293 (1987) (circuit court\u2019s unqualified order was a final judgment because it \u2018put Denise Walbert out of court, denying her the means of further prosecuting the case at the trial level\u2019); <em>Houghton v. County Com\u2019rs of Kent Co., </em>307 Md. 216, 221, 513 A.2d 291, 293 (1986); <em>Concannon v. State Roads Comm., </em>230 Md. 118, 125, 186 A.2d 220, 224-225 (1962), and cases there cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><em>See also Moore v. Pomory, </em>329 Md. 428, 432, 620 A.2d 323, 325 (1993) (dismissal without prejudice, although not an \u201cadjudication on the merits,\u201d was a final and appealable judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Thus, an order entered on the docket pursuant to Rule 2-601, and having the effect of terminating the case in the circuit court, is a final judgment. Montgomery County\u2019s position, that all of the issues and claims in a case must be resolved on the merits in order that there be a final judgment, would undermine the effectiveness of settlement agreements as a mechanism for ending litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">It is clear that, upon the entry of the settlement agreement as an order of the court on April 11, 1990, the case begun by Revere\u2019s predecessor in 1974 was over. The settlement agreement, which comprises the substance of the April 1990 order, discloses that the parties intended to terminate over sixteen years of litigation. There was nothing further for the court to resolve after the agreement was executed and entered as an order. Section 4(a) of the agreement specifies that, \u201c[i]n consideration of the Agreement reached herein, Reagan and the County hereby release each other from any claims or obligations which arise from the complaint in the above-captioned matter.\u201d Section 5(a) of the agreement states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>agreement becomes effective \u201cupon execution ... and incorporation of th[e] Agreement into a final judgment....\u201d The parties agreed to the \u201cdismissal of any and all pending litigation between the County and Reagan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Moreover, in a real sense the agreement did dispose of the claims and issues raised by the parties. In lieu of the relief which it sought in the litigation, namely having the challenged zoning regulations invalidated under state statutes and/or on constitutional grounds and receiving compensation or damages, the billboard company received the right to maintain its 47 existing billboards for a ten-year period. Although the County did not receive a judicial ruling on the validity of the regulations, nevertheless the County did not have to pay compensation, was able to limit the billboard company to 47 billboards, and could fully implement the ban on the company\u2019s billboards after the ten-year period. The settlement agreement was a typical compromise with respect to the claims, issues, and positions of the parties. The billboard company gave up its claims for relief against Montgomery County in return for what it received under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Therefore, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the April 11, 1990, order was a final judgment. Moreover, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that there was no fraud, mistake or irregularity, within the meaning of Rule 2-535(b), so as to authorize revision of the judgment under that rule. <em>See, e.g., Tandra S. v. Tyrone W., </em>336 Md. 303, 315-318, 648 A.2d 439, 445-446 (1994); <em>Autobahn Motors v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>321 Md. 558, 583 A.2d 731 (1991); <em>Hamilos v. Hamilos, </em>297 Md. 99, 465 A.2d 445 (1983); <em>Weitz v. MacKenzie, </em>273 Md. 628, 331 A.2d 291 (1975); <em>Schwartz v. Merchants Mort. Co., </em>272 Md. 305, 322 A.2d 544 (1974); <em>Household Finance Corp. v. Taylor, 254 </em>Md. 349, 254 A.2d 687 (1969), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Montgomery County contends that, even if the April 11, 1990, order was a final judgment, the County exceeded its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>legal authority in entering into the settlement agreement and that this is a valid basis for vacating the judgment. The County argues that a final judgment is not binding or preclusive, and is subject to collateral challenge, when a county or municipality exceeds its legal authority in entering into a settlement agreement that is incorporated in a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The cases have recognized certain unusual and narrowly limited situations when final judgments based on consent of the parties, although not subject to revision under rules like Maryland Rule 2-535, have been deemed non-preclusive or subject to collateral attack. <em>See, e.g., Green v. Sollenberger, </em>338 Md. 118, 131, 656 A.2d 773, 779 (1995) (final adoption decree, not authorized by adoption statutes, is subject to collateral attack and voidable); <em>Varsity Amusement Company v. Butters, </em>155 Colo. 330, 339, 394 P.2d 603, 607 (1964) (\u201ca judgment entered by agreement or consent does not have a [res judicata] effect where to give that effect would render impotent another important public policy\u201d); <em>Blazek v. City of Omaha, </em>232 Neb. 562, 565, 441 N.W.2d 205, 207 (1989) (\u201cExcept where an important public policy would be violated, judgments entered by agreement or consent are generally given a conclusive effect and are res judicata.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The leading case in this area appears to be <em>Kelley v. Town of Milan, </em>127 U.S. 139, 8 S.Ct. 1101, 32 L.Ed. 77 (1888). There, earlier litigation between the Town and holders of the Town's bonds had been terminated when the Town\u2019s officials consented to a decree adjudging the bonds to be valid obligations of the Town. In a subsequent lawsuit between the Town and the bondholders, the Supreme Court concluded that the Town was not bound by the earlier judgment. The Court held that, because the Town lacked authority under the laws of Tennessee to issue the bonds, the Town officials had no right to bind the Town by a settlement agreement incorporated in a final judgment. The Supreme Court explained (127 U.S. at 159, 8 S.Ct. at 1111, 32 L.Ed. at 85):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">\u201cThe declaration of the validity of the bonds, contained in the decree, was made solely in pursuance of the consent to that effect contained in the agreement signed by the [par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ties]. The act of the Mayor in signing that agreement could give no validity to the bonds, if they had none at the time the agreement was made. The want of authority to issue them extended to a want of authority to declare them valid. The Mayor had no such authority. The decree of the court was based solely upon the declaration of the Mayor, in the agreement, that the bonds were valid....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">\u201cThe adjudication in the decree cannot, under the circumstances, be set up as a judicial determination of the validity of the bonds.... This was not the case of a submission to the court of a question for its decision on the merits, but it was a consent in advance to a particular decision ... [which] gave life to invalid bonds.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Consequently, under the <em>Kelley </em>principle, the act of placing a settlement agreement made by a local government in the form of a court judgment, in an effort to give it the force and effect of a final judgment, will not cure the lack of fundamental power in the governmental entity to make the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The cases, in considering whether local governments are bound by final consent judgments reflecting agreements which the governments had no authority to make, have generally reached the same conclusion as <em>Kelley v. Town of Milan, supra, </em>although the courts have used various approaches and reasons. Several cases rely on public policy. <em>See, e.g., Blazek v. City of Omaha, supra, </em>232 Neb. at 565, 441 N.W.2d at 207. One court has viewed a final judgment embodying a governmental settlement agreement as \u201cconstructive fraud\u201d when the officials entering into the agreement lack the authority to bind the municipality as to matters contained therein. <em>See, Connor v. Morse, </em>303 Mass. 42, 47-48, 20 N.E.2d 424, 426-427 (1939). Another court has theorized that, since governmental officials are trustees of the municipal entity, and thus represent the citizens of that entity, their lack of authority as to matters agreed upon in a settlement agreement cannot be binding on their trustors, even if incorporated in a final judgment. <em>See, Union Bank v. Commissioners of Oxford, </em>119 N.C. 214, 226, 25 S.E. 966, 969 (1896) (\u201cwhen parties act in a representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>capacity, such judgments do not bind the <em>cestuis que trustent </em>unless the trustees had authority to act ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">A number of cases have simply stated that a municipality\u2019s lack of authority regarding the matters stipulated in a settlement agreement incorporated in a final judgment is a sufficient basis for either vacating a judgment or not applying the doctrine of res judicata. <em>See, e.g., State v. Great Northern Ry. Co., </em>134 Minn. 249, 256, 158 N.W. 972, 975 (1916) (\u201cThe parties could not accomplish [pursuant to a consent judgment] what they had absolutely no power to accomplish in any manner ... \u201d); <em>Martin v. Territory, </em>5 Okla. 188, 48 P. 106 (1897); <em>Mellette County v. Arnold, </em>76 S.D. 210, 214, 75 N.W.2d 641, 643 (1956) (\u201ca consent judgment in which officials representing a county or other governmental agency assume obligations against it unauthorized by law is void\u201d); <em>Coolsaet v. City of Veblen, </em>55 S.D. 485, 490, 226 N.W. 726, 729 (1929) (\u201cconsent decree was not beyond the power of the city\u2019s officials and attorneys\u201d). As explained by the Supreme Court of Minnesota in <em>City of St. Paul v. Chicago, St. P., M. &amp; O. Ry. Co., </em>139 Minn. 322, 326, 166 N.W. 335, 336-337 (1918),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201c[a] judgment against a municipality, not rendered as the judicial act of a court, but entered pursuant to a stipulation of the officers of the municipality, is of force and effect only so far as such officers had authority to bind the municipality. The fact that by consent of the municipal officers an agreement or stipulation made by them has been put in the form of a judgment, in an attempt to give it the force and effect of a judgment does not cure a lack of power in the officers to make it, and if such power be lacking the judgment as well as the stipulation is void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Regardless of the various theories employed, underlying these decisions is the recognition that the fundamental public policy of a state may sometimes require that a final consent judgment be vacated or not given preclusive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">We need not in the present case, however, explore or decide the scope and limits, under Maryland law, of the principles discussed in <em>Kelley v. Town of Milan, supra, </em>and the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>above-cited cases. We shall assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that it would have been proper to vacate the settlement agreement and judgment of April 11, 1990, if the agreement were clearly <em>ultra vires </em>as contended by Montgomery County. Nevertheless, for the reasons set forth in Part IV below, we do not agree that the substance of the agreement was clearly <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Before addressing Montgomery County\u2019s argument that the April 1990 settlement agreement exceeded the County\u2019s authority, it would be useful to review certain general principles of Maryland law concerning zoning in Montgomery County and contracts of local governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Unlike most other home rule chartered counties in Maryland which receive their basic zoning authority from Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution, the Express Powers Act, Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.), Art. 25A, \u00a7 5(x), and their county charters, the exclusive source of Montgomery County\u2019s zoning authority is the Regional District Act, Code (1957, 1993 Repl. Vol., 1995 Supp.), Art. 28, \u00a7 8-101 <em>et seq. See, e.g., Mossburg v. Montgomery County, Md., </em>329 Md. 494, 502-503, 620 A.2d 886, 890 (1993); <em>Chevy Chase View v. Rothman, </em>323 Md. 674, 685, 594 A.2d 1131, 1136 (1991). <em>See also Northampton v. Pr. George\u2019s Co., </em>273 Md. 93, 327 A.2d 774 (1974); <em>Pr. George\u2019s Co. v. Md.-Nat'l Cap., </em>269 Md. 202, 306 A.2d 223, <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1068, 94 S.Ct. 577, 38 L.Ed.2d 473 (1973).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The Regional District Act specifies that the Montgomery County Council, sitting as a district council, \u201cmay by ordinance adopt and amend the text of the zoning ordinance .... \u201d Art. 28, \u00a7 8-101 (b)(2). The Regional District Act sometimes refers to the zoning enactments of a district council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>as \u201cordinances,\u201d sometimes refers to them as \u201cregulations,\u201d and sometimes uses the phrase \u201cordinance regulations\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>\u00a7 8\u2014101(c)). The zoning enactments of the district council in Montgomery County are no longer subject to the approval or veto of the County Executive, Ch. 643, \u00a7 1, of the Acts of 1992.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the district council\u2019s zoning enactments do not constitute legislation within the meaning of Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution and the Montgomery County Charter. <em>See Biggs v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. Comm\u2019n, </em>269 Md. 352, 354-355, 306 A.2d 220, 222 (1973) (zoning enactment of a district council \u201cwas not subject to the Charter provisions respecting referendum and emergency legislation\u201d). Instead, \u201cwhen it sits as the District Council in a zoning matter the County Council is an \u2018administrative agency\u2019.... \u201d <em>Co. Council v. Carl M. Freeman Assoc., </em>281 Md. 70, 74, 376 A.2d 860, 862 (1977). <em>See also Mont. Co. v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, 280 </em>Md. 686, 711, 376 A.2d 483, 497 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1067, 98 S.Ct 1245, 55 L.Ed.2d 769 (1978); <em>Mont. Co. v.

Montgomery County, </em>242 Md. 55, 67, 71-72, 217 A.2d 578, 585-586, 588 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Turning to government contracts generally, under Maryland law counties and municipalities are normally bound by their contracts to the same extent as private entities. <em>See, e.g., Fraternal Order of Police v. Baltimore County, </em>340 Md. 157, 665 A.2d 1029 (1995); <em>American Structures v. City of Balto., </em>278 Md. 356, 364 A.2d 55 (1976). Thus, Maryland law has never recognized the defense of governmental immunity in contract actions against counties and municipalities. <em>Board v. Town of Riverdale, </em>320 Md. 384, 389, 578 A.2d 207, 210 (1990); <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. Comm\u2019n v. Kranz, </em>308 Md. 618, 622, 521 A.2d 729, 731 (1987); <em>American Structures v. City of Balto., supra, </em>278 Md. at 359-360, 364 A.2d at 57. This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>has repeatedly held that, \u201cas long as the execution of the contract [is] within the power of the governmental unit,\u201d the local government is answerable in damages for breaching that contract. <em>American Structures, </em>278 Md. at 359-360, 364 A.2d at 57, and cases there cited. Under some circumstances, courts have ordered that local governments specifically perform their contracts. <em>See, e.g., Cohen v. Baltimore County, </em>229 Md. 519, 523-525, 185 A.2d 185, 187-188 (1962); <em>Bd. of Co. Comm. v. MacPhail, </em>214 Md. 192, 199-200, 133 A.2d 96, 101 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">There is a type of contract, particularly relevant to Montgomery County\u2019s argument in this case, which is ordinarily beyond the authority of local government entities. Local governments are generally prohibited from \u201ccontracting away the exercise of zoning power,\u201d <em>Attman v. Mayor, </em>314 Md. 675, 686, 552 A.2d 1277, 1283 (1989). \u201c[T]he zoning authority [cannot] obligate itself by advance contract to provide zoning,\u201d <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\"><em>Attman v. Mayor, supra, </em>involved a controversy between a developer and the City of Annapolis concerning a \u201cconditional use authorization\u201d for an office building to be constructed by the developer. Under the Annapolis City Code, a \u201cconditional use authorization\u201d could only be issued by the city council, composed of the mayor and aldermen. The developer was granted a conditional use by the city council and began construction of the office building. Later, the developer sought a modification of the conditional use authorization which would permit the basement of the building to be used for purposes other than the housing of mechanical equipment. The city council granted the requested modification on the condition that the developer provide certain additional parking spaces. The developer, claiming that these new parking requirements were \u201carbitrary, capricious, and impossible to fulfill,\u201d challenged the city council\u2019s action by filing a lawsuit in the circuit court. Shortly before a scheduled circuit court hearing, the parties reached an oral agreement. Neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>less, a dispute soon arose concerning the terms of that oral agreement. It was clear that both sides had agreed to seek a continuance of the court hearing and agreed that the developer should file a new application with the city council for a conditional use. The developer contended that the city council had agreed that it would grant the new application with certain specified less onerous parking requirements. The city council, however, maintained that it simply had agreed to consider these parking requirements, but that it did not purport to bind itself to grant the application with the less onerous parking requirements. Thereafter, the city council rejected the developer\u2019s new application for a conditional use authorization. The developer filed, in the pending circuit court proceeding, a motion to enforce the oral agreement. After some further procedural skirmishes, the circuit court denied relief to the developer, and this Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Attman v. Mayor, </em>314 Md. at 685-686, 552 A.2d at 1283, initially pointed out that the city council\u2019s grant of a conditional use authorization was similar to new zoning or rezoning for purposes of the principle that a government ordinarily cannot obligate itself by advance contract to provide a particular zoning. The <em>Attman </em>opinion, written by Judge McAuliffe for the Court, went on to review our prior cases involving this principle, including those invalidating agreements and those upholding agreements relating to zoning. The Court reasoned that it is only where \u201cthe zoning authority ... obligated] itself by advance contract to provide zoning\u201d that the principle is applicable. 314 Md. at 686, 552 A.2d at 1283. The Court explained that, if such contracts were upheld, they would \u201crender meaningless the prescribed zoning procedures\u201d and would violate the requirement that the zoning authority \u201cexercise its unconstrained independent judgment in deciding matters of reclassification ... [and] in deciding requests for special exceptions, conditional uses, or variances.\u201d 314 Md. at 686-687, 552 A.2d at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">We concluded in <em>Attman </em>that, if the developer\u2019s version of the oral agreement was correct, the agreement would be invalid as an attempt to bind the city council in advance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>render a particular zoning decision. On the other hand, the Court held that, if the terms of the oral agreement were as contended for by the city council, and if the agreement \u201cdid not surrender or impair the right and obligation of the city council to independently and impartially consider the application in accordance with procedures established by law,\u201d then the agreement would be valid. 314 Md. at 688-689, 552 A.2d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">In the case at bar, Montgomery County principally relies upon the <em>Attman </em>opinion. The County, citing <em>Attman, </em>argues that it has no \u201clegal authority to amend or repeal provisions of the Zoning Ordinance or to relinquish the District Council\u2019s authority under state law and County Charter over billboard zoning matters for 10 years in the future.\u201d (County\u2019s brief in this Court at 13). The County asserts that \u201c[t]he principles stated by this Court in <em>Attman ... </em>apply equally to this case.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>According to the County, the county government is powerless to \u201ccede legislative authority ... over zoning matters that is specifically granted by state law and County Charter.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Preliminarily, to the extent that the County relies upon legislative authority pursuant to the Montgomery County Charter, the reliance is misplaced. As previously discussed, the provisions of the Montgomery County Charter granting legislative authority have no application to zoning enactments of the district council.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The County\u2019s reliance upon the <em>Attman </em>opinion is also misplaced. The settlement agreement in this case did not obligate the district council to rezone or amend the zoning regulations. In fact, unlike either version of the oral contract involved in <em>Attman, </em>the written settlement agreement in the case at bar contemplated no action whatsoever by the district council. This was simply not a contract providing for any type of decision by the zoning authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Montgomery County also complains that the settlement agreement limited executive authority and discretion in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>enforcement of the County\u2019s laws. The County contends that it may not, by contract, \u201crelinquish the County Executive\u2019s legal obligation to enforce the ... laws and ordinances of the County.\u201d (County\u2019s brief in this Court at 13). The County asserts that no county contract \u201ccan cede ... executive enforcement authority over zoning matters....\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Of course, under certain circumstances and in some contexts, an attempt by a government to limit future executive discretion by contract would be invalid. <em>See, e.g., Fraternal Order of Police v. Baltimore County, supra, </em>340 Md. at 169-171, 665 A.2d at 1034-1036, and eases there cited. For example, a contract by a Governor purporting to limit the Governor\u2019s constitutional authority and discretion in the future appointment of judges would clearly be unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Nevertheless, as a general matter, executive discretion in the enforcement and execution of the laws can be limited by contract. <em>See, e.g., Fraternal Order of Police v. Baltimore County, </em>340 Md. at 168, 171, 665 A.2d at 1034-1036; <em>Funger v. Mayor of Somerset, </em>249 Md. 311, 328, 239 A.2d 748, 757 (1968); <em>Greenbelt v. Bresler, </em>248 Md. 210, 215-217, 236 A.2d 1, 4-5 (1967); <em>Cohen v. Baltimore County, supra, </em>229 Md. at 523-525, 185 A.2d at 187-188; <em>Bd. of Co. Comm. v. MacPhail, supra, </em>214 Md. at 199-200, 133 A.2d at 101. In fact many, if not most, government contracts limit to some extent executive discretion in carrying out the laws and functions of government. If future executive discretion could not lawfully be limited by contract, a great many government contracts would be unenforceable. As pointed out earlier, however, governments are generally bound by their contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Bd. of Co. Comm. v. MacPhail, supra, </em>214 Md. 192, 133 A.2d 96, specifically rejected an argument by a local government that a contract, entered into by that government, was unenforceable because it limited or interfered with executive discretion. The <em>MacPhail </em>case involved a contract between the County Commissioners of Har<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ford County<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and Larry MacPhail, the owner of a large farm in Harford County. Under the terms of the contract, the County Commissioners agreed to grade and pave a four-mile county public road which ran to and through the farm. In return, Mr. MacPhail agreed to forebear from filing a threatened lawsuit against the County, based on earlier alleged undertakings by the County Commissioners regarding the road. After entering the contract, the County Commissioners refused to perform, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the contract was beyond their authority and interfered with the future exercise of discretion by the county government. The circuit court rejected this argument and issued an injunction requiring the County Commissioners to perform the contract. This Court, in an opinion by Judge Hammond, affirmed, stating (214 Md. at 199-200, 133 A.2d at 101):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">\u201cThe chancellor, noting that generally a court will not interfere with the discretion of public officials and, so, ordinarily will not tell the County Commissioners what roads to select for improvement or how improvements should be made, held that in the case before him, \u2018 * * * the Commissioners exercised their discretion by agreeing to improve the road under consideration.\u2019 He added: \u2018The purpose of this proceeding, therefore, is not to interfere with the County Commissioners in the exercise of their discretion but to require them to perform and carry out any agreements which they made in the exercise of their discretion. The Court is of the opinion that an injunction will lie under such circumstances.\u2019 We concur. We think the evidence warranted the action the chancellor took since the agreement he required to be executed was sufficiently definite and certain properly to be the subject of what, in effect, was specific performance, and since the fixing of the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>of a judgment for breach of contract would be almost impossible and a judgment would not be a duplicate or substantial equivalent of the promised performance.... The decree merely directed the County Commissioners to construct the MacPhail road, as they had agreed to do.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Thus, as the <em>MacPhail </em>opinion explains, when the executive branch of the county government, in carrying out the laws and functions of government, enters into a contract, such action constitutes the exercise of executive discretion. A requirement that the government adhere to that exercise of discretion, and be held to its contract, ordinarily does not constitute an unlawful interference with future executive discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Finally, Montgomery County argues that implementation of the settlement agreement would clearly be in violation of law because the local zoning regulations flatly prohibit all billboards. Relying upon <em>Hanna v. Bd. of Ed. of Wicomico Co., </em>200 Md. 49, 53-58, 87 A.2d 846, 848-850 (1952), Montgomery County asserts that a \u201cpublic contract must comply with law or be declared null and void,\u201d (County\u2019s brief in this Court at 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In determining whether implementation of the settlement agreement would involve activity in violation of law, however, it is necessary to examine all of the applicable law and not simply the district council\u2019s zoning regulations. Although a particular activity might be prohibited under local zoning regulations viewed in isolation, when all of the applicable law is considered, including prevailing state or federal law, the local zoning prohibition may be invalid or superseded. <em>See, e.g., Harrison v. Schwartz, </em>319 Md. 360, 572 A.2d 528, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 851, 111 S.Ct. 143, 112 L.Ed.2d 110 (1990); <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Maryland Marine, </em>316 Md. 491, 560 A.2d 32 (1989). <em>See also Kirsch v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>331 Md. 89, 626 A.2d 372, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 600, 126 L.Ed.2d 565 (1993); <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. Comm\u2019n v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>Chadwick, </em>286 Md. 1, 405 A.2d 241 (1979). Local zoning ordinances, regulations or determinations frequently are unenforceable in light of enactments by the General Assembly. <em>See, e.g., Mossburg v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>329 Md. 494, 620 A.2d 886; <em>Chevy Chase View v. Rothman, supra, </em>323 Md. 674, 594 A.2d 1131; <em>West Mont. Ass\u2019n v. MNCP &amp; P Com\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 183, 196, 522 A.2d 1328, 1329 (1987) (\u201c[Montgomery] County enjoys no inherent power to zone or rezone, and may exercise that power only to the extent and in the manner directed by the Legislature\u201d); <em>Crozier v. Co. Comm. Pr. George\u2019s Co., </em>202 Md. 501, 506, 97 A.2d 296, 298 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">When all of the applicable law is considered, it is not at all clear that Revere\u2019s contractual right under the settlement agreement to maintain its 47 billboards for ten years was in violation of law. Rather, it is Montgomery County\u2019s position in this case which appears to be in violation of law. In arriving at this conclusion, we need not reach the federal and state constitutional provisions invoked by Revere. Montgomery County\u2019s argument entirely overlooks Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.), Art. 25, \u00a7 122E(b), enacted by the Maryland General Assembly in 1983. This statute unequivocally mandates that \u201c[a] county or municipality shall pay the fair market value of an outdoor advertising sign, removed or required to be removed by the county or municipality____\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Neither the district council\u2019s 1986 regulations prohibiting all billboards, nor any other enactments by Montgomery County which have been called to our attention, provide for compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>tion to the owner of pre-existing lawfully erected billboards. Insofar as the record in this case discloses, Montgomery County has never offered compensation to Revere or its predecessors. Instead, prior to the April 1990 settlement agreement, Montgomery County resisted the demands by Revere\u2019s predecessors for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The district council\u2019s regulations purporting to ban billboards must be considered in conjunction with Art. 25, \u00a7 122E. As pointed out by this Court in <em>Hanna v. Bd. of Ed. of Wicomico Co., supra, </em>200 Md. at 57, 87 A2d at 850, a case relied upon by Montgomery County, \u201cno [government agency] ... has the right to ignore or circumvent the mandate of the Legislature.\u201d Under \u00a7 122E, Montgomery County has no authority to ban pre-existing lawfully erected billboards without paying the fair market value of the billboards. In light of \u00a7 122E and the facts disclosed by the record in this case, the trial court erred in holding that Revere\u2019s right under the settlement agreement to maintain 47 billboards for ten years was clearly contrary to law. Considering all of the applicable law and the circumstances, the agreement allowing Revere to maintain its 47 pre-existing billboards for ten years appeared to be a reasonable, lawful compromise and resolution of the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">There are two provisions of the 1990 settlement agreement which, as Montgomery County correctly argues, are in violation of law. Both provisions, therefore, are unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The first of these provisions is a clause in the settlement agreement which recites that \u201c[t]his Agreement ... shall supersede conflicting law.\u201d Of course, neither government officials nor private parties may validly contract to \u201csupersede\u201d applicable law. A contractual provision which is contrary to law is invalid. <em>See, e.g., Larimore v. American Ins. Co., </em>314 Md. 617, 552 A.2d 889 (1989); <em>Lee v. Wheeler, </em>310 Md. 233, 528 A.2d 912 (1987); <em>Maryland Cl. Emp. Ass\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>281 Md. 496, 508, 380 A.2d 1032 (1977), <em>Hanna v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>Bd. of Ed. of Wicomico Co., supra, </em>200 Md. at 53-54, 87 A.2d at 848 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The second of these provisions grants to the sign owner a remedy before an administrative agency known as the \u201cSign Review Board.\u201d Montgomery County argues that this provision is both invalid and non-severable. Consequently, according to the County, the invalidity of this provision requires the invalidation of the entire settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In a 1968 regulation adopted by the district council, referred to as \u201cOrdinance No. 6-114,\u201d the district council created a \u201cSign Review Board\u201d with delineated jurisdiction and powers. One limitation on the Board\u2019s authority was that it could not permit any sign which was prohibited by the zoning regulations. A section of the 1968 sign regulations adopted by the district council (\u201cOrdinance No. 6-115\u201d), captioned \u201cRight of Appeal,\u201d provided for an appeal by the sign owner to the Sign Review Board when an application for a sign permit was denied by county officials but \u201cwhere a variance may be permitted\u201d under the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The 1990 settlement agreement specifically authorized Revere to apply to the Sign Review Board when Revere believed that a sign request should be granted under the terms of the settlement agreement. Montgomery County argues that, under the district council\u2019s zoning regulations, the Sign Review Board\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to the situation where a sign is permitted under a variance and that the Board has no jurisdiction to permit a prohibited billboard. Montgomery County states that \u201c[t]he Stipulated Consent Agreement purports to confer jurisdiction on the Sign Review Board to permit or approve billboards while the Zoning Ordinance prohibits such jurisdiction,\u201d (County\u2019s brief in this Court at 20). The County asserts that the jurisdiction of an administrative agency is delineated by law and \u201ccannot be enlarged ... by private agreements or by litigation settlements between parties.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 21).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">We agree with Montgomery County that the subject matter jurisdiction of an administrative agency ordinarily can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>not be enlarged by agreement. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Hyatt, </em>302 Md. 683, 690, 490 A.2d 1224, 1227 (1985). We further agree with Montgomery County that the 1990 settlement agreement improperly purports to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Sign Review Board.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We do not agree with Montgomery County, however, that this one provision renders invalid the entire settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The provisions in the sign regulations for an appeal by the sign owner to the Sign Review Board, and the invalid clause in the settlement agreement allowing Revere to seek a remedy from the Sign Review Board, constitute an additional procedural remedy for the benefit of the sign owner. Revere in the present case did not attempt to avail itself of the invalid procedural remedy. Revere \u201cwaived\u201d any contractual entitlement purportedly granted by the settlement agreement to appeal to the Sign Review Board. A party to a contract ordinarily may waive a contractual provision intended for its benefit. If the party does so, the other party cannot rely on the provision to escape liability under the contract. The provision is treated as severable under the circumstances. <em>Twining v. Nat\u2019l Mortgage Corp., </em>268 Md. 549, 302 A.2d 604, 607 (1973). <em>See also, e.g., University Nat\u2019l Bank v.
