Oral argument was scheduled and heard before this Court on December 1, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">It now appears that the terms of the members of the Baltimore City Council, including the terms of the members of the appellee Standing Committee, expired on December 7, 1995 by reason of the November, 1995 municipal elections in Baltimore City for members of the City Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">In view of these circumstances, and as conceded by the appellee, the case in its current posture is now moot. We shall therefore vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and remand the case to that court with directions to dismiss the case on grounds of mootness. <em>See Attorney Gen. v. A.A. County School Bus, </em>286 Md. 324, 407 A.2d 749 (1979), and Maryland Rule 8-602(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Costs in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and in this Court to be paid by appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
