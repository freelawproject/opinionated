We shall hold that in this case, the Department\u2019s decision to add a new charge did not violate the LEOBR.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In December, 1990, Captain Charles Blondell of the Baltimore City Police Department was accused of reporting a fabricated sexual harassment complaint against one of his subordinates. The Police Department\u2019s Internal Investigation Division (IID) conducted an investigation and concluded that Blondell knew the complaint lacked merit when he filed it. IID therefore sustained a charge of general misconduct against Blondell. Both IID and Blondell\u2019s commanding officer, Colonel Christian, recommended a severe letter of reprimand as punishment. On review, the Deputy Commissioner of the Administrative Bureau concluded that the offense warranted additional punishment, adding three days\u2019 loss of vacation leave to the penalty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>On October 15, 1990, the Deputy Commissioner informed Captain Blondell of the findings of the IID investigation and offered him punishment of a severe letter of reprimand and three days loss of vacation leave if Blondell agreed to forego a hearing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 734D.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Blondell declined the offer, exercising his statutory right to a hearing under the LEOBR. <em>See </em>\u00a7 730(a); <em>see also Baltimore City Police Department, General Order 48-77, </em>at C-2 (July 1, 1977) (Annex C) [hereinafter <em>Geni Order 48-77 </em>].<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In accord with police regulations, IID forwarded the case file to the Legal Affairs Division for review in preparation for the hearing. <em>See Geni Order 48-77, </em>at C-2 and H-l.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In conducting the review, Legal Affairs noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Blondell had made several false statements in the course of the conduct that led to the general misconduct charge and, therefore, requested that IID conduct further investigation. At the conclusion of the investigation, IID recommended adding a charge of false statements to the charge of general misconduct. The Deputy Commissioner approved addition of the false statements charge. Legal Affairs notified Captain Blondell of the two charges against him on February 19, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">On March 28,1991, before any hearing board was convened, Captain Blondell filed a complaint and petition to show cause in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City pursuant to LEOBR \u00a7 734.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Blondell requested ex parte, interlocutory, and permanent injunctive relief to prevent the Police Department from proceeding with the hearing. Blondell contended that the Police Department\u2019s addition of the false statements charge after he had been offered what he termed \u201csummary punishment\u201d for the general misconduct charge violated \u00a7\u00a7 727(d)(3) and 733 of the LEOBR. The Police Department moved for dismissal or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, but the Circuit Court denied the Department\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The Circuit Court held a hearing on April 20, 1994, and denied Blondell\u2019s request for an injunction. At the conclusion of Captain Blondell\u2019s case, the trial judge granted the Police Department\u2019s motion for judgment because she concluded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>punishment offered to Captain Blondell was not summary punishment and, therefore, the statutory limitations on summary punishment did not apply. In explaining her ruling, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\">I find based on the evidence in this case that the punishment that was offered was not summary punishment, for a number of reasons[.] [FJirst of all, it is arguably not a minor infraction for which Detective Captain Blondell was investigated.... The Commissioner has not delegated the authority to anyone else. He retains the authority in himself. The offense is and remains in dispute. And the punishment was greater than the limitation that is placed on it in the summary punishment definition in section F of subsection 727. And what makes it greater is not the issue of whether a three day loss of vacation is greater or less than a three day suspension. But it\u2019s the fact that a severe letter of reprimand was recommended. That certainly is much greater than just a three day suspension or fine of $150.00. So in this case, I find that summary punishment was not invoked, and therefore, ... the hearing board of the department is not limited to recommending sanctions offered in the memorandum of October 18th, 1990.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The trial judge also concluded that Captain Blondell had not proven that the Department added the second charge in retaliation for his request for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Blondell noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision, concluding that the punishment offered to Blondell was not summary punishment because his offense was not \u201cminor.\u201d <em>Blondell v. Baltimore City Police Dept., </em>104 Md.App. 69, 76, 655 A.2d 34, 38 (1995). The Court of Special Appeals also concluded that Captain Blondell had not met his burden of proving the Department\u2019s retaliatory motive under \u00a7 733. <em>Id. </em>at 79-80, 655 A.2d at 38-39; <em>see also DiGrazia v. County Executive, </em>288 Md. 437, 448, 418 A.2d 1191, 1197 (1980) (employee must \u201cshow that the questioned conduct was a substantial or motivating factor\u201d in the employer\u2019s decision). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>We subsequently granted Blondell\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Captain Blondell contends that when an officer rejects an offer of summary punishment, the Chief of Police must form a hearing board pursuant to \u00a7 727(d)(3) of the LEOBR.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 727(d)(3) limits the penalty that the hearing board may impose to the maximum penalty available for summary punishment, <em>i.e., </em>up to three days suspension without pay or a fine of $150. Blondell argues that the punishment offered to him by the Police Department was summary punishment. Therefore he concludes that a hearing board may not impose a penalty on him that exceeds the maximum penalty available for summary punishment. He asserts that by adding a false statement charge to the initial charge of general misconduct, the Police Department subjected him to punishment that could exceed the summary punishment limits, violating \u00a7 727(d)(3) of the LEOBR. Blondell also argues that the Department added the false statement charge in retaliation for his decision to request a hearing, violating \u00a7 733 of the LEOBR.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The Police Department contends that its initial offer of punishment to Captain Blondell did not constitute summary punishment. Therefore, the Department argues, the statutory limitation on penalties for summary punishment does not apply. In addition, the Department contends that even if the initial offer did constitute summary punishment, the penalty cap does not automatically apply in all cases where an officer rejects summary punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The central statutory interpretation dispute in this case is whether, in addition to the method prescribed in \u00a7 727(d)(3), the Police Chief may also choose to form a hearing board under \u00a7 727(d)(1) in cases of summary punishment. The Department contends that it may proceed to hearing under either \u00a7 727(d)(1)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or \u00a7 727(d)(3). The penalty limitations only apply when the Chief of Police elects to proceed via \u00a7 727(d)(3) rather than \u00a7 727(d)(1). Since no hearing has yet been held in this case, and no choice has been made between the two hearing board mechanisms, the Department contends that no violation has occurred. Finally, the Department argues that Captain Blondell offered no proof of retaliatory motive, as required to demonstrate a violation of LEOBR \u00a7 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In construing the LEOBR provisions at issue in this case, we apply the paradigm of statutory construction developed in numerous decisions of this Court. As we have often stated, \u201cthe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intention.\u201d <em>Fikar v. Montgomery County, </em>333 Md. 430, 434, 635 A.2d 977, 979 (1994) (quoting <em>Taxiera v. Malkus, </em>320 Md. 471, 480, 578 A.2d 761, 765 (1990) (citations omitted)); <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Md. 412, 418, 379 A.2d 1007, 1010 (1977). The primary indicator of the Legislature\u2019s intent is the language of the statute. <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347, 1350 (1995). We interpret statutes to give every word effect, avoiding constructions that render any portion of the language superfluous or redundant. <em>Warsame v. State, </em>338 Md. 513, 519, 659 A.2d 1271, 1273 (1995); <em>see also </em>2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 46.06, at 119-20 (5th ed. 1992 &amp; 1995 Cum.Supp.). In addition, we construe the statute as a whole, interpreting each provision of the statute in the context of the entire statutory scheme. <em>Warsame, </em>338 Md. at 519, 659 A.2d at 1273 (citing <em>GEICO v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 132, 630 A.2d 713, 717 (1993)); <em>see also </em>2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 46.05, at 103 (5th ed. 1992 &amp; 1995 Cum.Supp.). If the statutory language, read in its entirety, is clear and unambiguous, and comports with the Legislature\u2019s purpose, we need not inquire further to discern the statute\u2019s meaning. <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 73, 591 A.2d 481, 485 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Applying these principles to the statutory provisions at issue in this case, we first observe that the purpose of the LEOBR is \u201cto guarantee that certain procedural safeguards be offered to police officers during any investigation and subsequent hearing which could lead to disciplinary action, demotion, or dismissal.\u201d <em>Abbott v. Administrative Hearing Bd., </em>33 Md.App. 681, 682, 366 A.2d 756, 757 (1976) (Eldridge, J., specially assigned), <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 727 (1977); <em>see also Chief, Mont. Police v. Jacocks, </em>50 Md.App. 132, 135, 436 A.2d 930, 932 (1981); B. Warnken, <em>The Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Privilege Against Compelled Self-Incrimination, </em>16 U.Balt.L.Rev. 452 (1987).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To effectuate this purpose, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>LEOBR guarantees police officers the right to a hearing when a departmental investigation results in a recommendation of punitive action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The statute also states, however, that an officer may always waive the right to a hearing and accept punishment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u00a7 734D.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The LEOBR specifically provides for an expedited form of punishment known as \u201csummary punishment,\u201d which is conditioned on the officer\u2019s waiver of the right to a hearing. \u00a7\u00a7 727(f), 734A. Section 727(f) of the LEOBR defines \u201csummary punishment\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">punishment imposed by the highest ranking officer of a unit or member acting in that capacity, which may be imposed when the facts constituting the offense are not in dispute. Summary punishment may not exceed three days suspension without pay or a fine of $150.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Section 734A further provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">(1) Summary punishment may be imposed for minor violations of departmental rules and regulations when (i) the facts which constitute the minor violation are not in dispute; (ii) the officer waives the hearing provided by this subtitle; and (iii) the officer accepts the punishment imposed by the highest ranking officer of the unit to which the officer is attached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-8\"><em>See Gen\u2019l Order 48-77, </em>at C\u20141;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>see also Intern. Broth. Police v. Town of Portsmouth, </em>506 A.2d 540, 541 (R.I.1986) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>(defining \u201csummary punishment\u201d under Rhode Island\u2019s LEOBR as \u201ca two-day suspension without pay, imposed for minor violations of departmental rules and regulations involving an incident in which the facts are not in dispute.\u201d). If a police department offers summary punishment but the officer refuses it, however, the Department must hold a hearing. \u00a7\u00a7 730(a), 734A.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Once the right to a hearing is triggered, the LEOBR provides three alternative procedures for forming a hearing board. The procedures that may be used to form the hearing board vary based on whether or not summary punishment has been offered and refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In cases that do not involve summary punishment, the Chief of Police typically proceeds to form a hearing board under \u00a7 727(d)(1). <em>See supra </em>note 8. Section 727(d)(1) requires the Chief of Police to select a hearing board composed of at least three members, including one member of the same rank as the accused officer. The members of the hearing board must not have taken part in the investigation or interrogation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>accused officer. The statute also provides a second alternative procedure for forming a hearing board as negotiated by collective bargaining, which is not in issue here.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u00a7 727(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The procedures for forming a hearing board differ in cases where summary punishment has been offered and refused. For example, \u00a7 727(d)(3) of the statute provides a method of forming a hearing board that may only be used in cases of summary punishment. Section 727(d)(3) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">the chief <em>may convene </em>a one-member or more hearing board and the hearing board shall have only the authority to recommend the sanctions as provided in this subtitle for summary punishment. If a single member hearing board is convened, that member need not be of the same rank [as the accused officer]. However, all other provisions of this subtitle shall apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">(emphasis added). Furthermore, in summary punishment cases, unlike other cases, the police officer may not elect the alternate collective bargaining procedure for forming a hearing board. \u00a7 727(d)(2)(vii).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We now turn to the central statutory interpretation dispute in this case: whether, in addition to the \u201cone-member or more\u201d hearing board under \u00a7 727(d)(3), the Police Chief may also choose to form a three-member hearing board under \u00a7 727(d)(1) in summary punishment cases, and thereby to proceed with no \u201ccap\u201d on the permissible punishment. We shall conclude that the statute does permit the Police Chief to choose between these two methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>In construing the statute, we first consider its plain language. The language of \u00a7 727(d)(3) clearly indicates that in cases where an officer refuses summary punishment, the Chief of Police <em>may </em>convene a \u201cone-member or more\u201d panel. Because an officer who refuses summary punishment has an absolute right to a hearing under \u00a7 730(a), the use of the permissive word \u201cmay\u201d in \u00a7 727(d)(3) suggests that another mechanism of creating a hearing board must also be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">In addition, if the Legislature intended the method in \u00a7 727(d)(3) to be the exclusive method of forming a hearing board in summary punishment cases, and to thereby limit the penalty the hearing board can impose in all summary punishment cases, it would presumably have said so. For example, the Legislature could have revised \u00a7 727(d)(1), the provision which describes formation of three-member hearing boards, to indicate that the ordinary three-member board mechanism was no longer available in cases of summary punishment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Legislature did not limit \u00a7 727(d)(1) in this fashion, and we shall not interpret the statute to add a limitation the Legislature did not impose. <em>See Shah v. Howard County, </em>337 Md. 248, 254-55, 653 A.2d 425, 428 (1995). Therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>conclude that the Chief of Police may choose to convene a three-member board pursuant to \u00a7 727(d)(1) in summary punishment cases, and if the Police Chief does proceed under \u00a7 727(d)(1), there is no cap on the punishment the hearing board may impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">We shall also construe the statute as a whole to determine its meaning. <em>Parrison v. State, </em>335 Md. 554, 559-61, 644 A.2d 537, 539-40 (1994); 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 46.05, at 103 (5th ed. 1992 &amp; 1995 Cum.Supp.). In describing the general procedure for forming a hearing board, \u00a7 727(d)(1) states that all hearing boards must \u201cconsist[ ] of not less than three members, except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection.\u201d The structure of the statute thus indicates that the \u201cone-member or more\u201d board described in \u00a7 727(d)(3) serves only as an exception to the general requirement that a hearing board must include at least three members. We therefore determine that \u00a7 727(d)(3) was only intended to provide an additional hearing board mechanism in cases of summary punishment, not to displace \u00a7 727(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">We conclude that the Legislature intended to provide the Chief of Police with the administrative flexibility to permit increased punishment if additional violations came to light after an officer refused summary punishment. Because summary punishment offers are made based on preliminary investigation, prior to legal review and formal charging, additional violations may be discovered, as in this case, during follow-up investigation after summary punishment is rejected. <em>See Gen\u2019l Order k8-77, </em>at H-1, <em>supra </em>note 5. <em>Cf. Holcomb v. City of Los Angeles, </em>210 Cal.App.3d 1560, 259 Cal.Rptr. 1, 5 (App. 2 Dist.1989) (held permissible for hearing board to increase punishment from initial offer of five days\u2019 suspension to fifteen days\u2019 suspension based on new evidence presented at hearing that was not available during preliminary investigation). By permitting the Police Chief to choose between the three-person hearing board in \u00a7 727(d)(1) and the one-person or more hearing board in \u00a7 727(d)(3), the Legislature therefore allowed the Chief the discretion to determine whether or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the summary punishment cap should apply after refusal of summary punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Accordingly, we interpret the language of the statute to provide alternative methods of forming a hearing board depending on whether the department initially offered summary punishment. In cases where the department did not initially offer summary punishment, the police officer may choose between the ordinary mechanism for forming a three-member board under \u00a7 727(d)(1) and the collective bargaining method under \u00a7 727(d)(2). In summary punishment cases, the Chief of Police may choose between the three-member board under \u00a7 727(d)(1) and the \u201cone-member or more\u201d board under \u00a7 727(d)(3). We conclude that the statute expresses these alternatives in sufficiently plain terms that we need not seek extrinsic sources of information on the legislative intent. <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 73, 591 A.2d 481, 485 (1991); <em>Potter v. Bethesda Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>309 Md. 347, 353, 524 A.2d 61, 63-4 (1987) (quoting <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A.2d 275, 278 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 942, 96 S.Ct. 1680, 48 L.Ed.2d 185 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In addition to providing police officers with the right to a hearing in disciplinary actions, as outlined above, the LEOBR further protects police officers by prohibiting the police department from retaliating against officers for exercising their statutory or constitutional rights. Section 733 of the LEOBR states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">A law enforcement officer may not be discharged, disciplined, demoted, or denied promotion, transfer, or reassignment, or otherwise discriminated against in regard to his employment or be threatened with any such treatment, by reason of his exercise of or demand for the rights granted in this subtitle, or by reason of the lawful exercise of his constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">The employee bears the burden of proving retaliatory action in violation of \u00a7 733. <em>DiGrazia v. County Executive, </em>288 Md. 437, 448, 418 A.2d 1191, 1197 (1980). Specifically, the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>ee must \u201cshow that the questioned conduct was a substantial or motivating factor\u201d in the employer\u2019s decision. <em>Id., </em>418 A.2d at 1197. If the employee meets this requirement, the burden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the action or decision would have been the same absent the employee\u2019s exercise of or demand for his rights. <em>Id., </em>418 A.2d at 1197. Therefore, \u201c[t]he issue is to be resolved in favor of the employee only if the court finds that he would have been reemployed but for the protected conduct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>418 A.2d at 1197-98 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">\n<em>A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">We next consider whether the addition of the \u201cfalse statements\u201d charge after Captain Blondell refused the initial offer of punishment violated the LEOBR provisions analyzed above. We shall first consider whether the Department\u2019s initial offer of punishment to Blondell constituted \u201csummary punishment,\u201d applying the statutory definition of summary punishment described in Section III.B, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">First, we observe that if an officer\u2019s offense is not minor, the Department may not offer summary punishment. \u00a7 734A. In this case, the conduct at issue was fabrication of a sexual harassment charge against a subordinate. We agree with the conclusion of the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals that this type of conduct could not plausibly be termed a \u201cminor\u201d offense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See Blondell v. Baltimore City Police Dept., </em>104 Md.App. 69, 76, 655 A.2d 34, 38 (1995). Therefore, the Department could not offer summary punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>ment for this type of offense without violating both the LEOBR and its own regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In addition, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the punishment offered to Blondell exceeded the maximum penalty available for summary punishment. The Department offered Captain Blondell punishment of three days\u2019 loss of vacation leave plus a severe letter of reprimand. We need not determine whether three days\u2019 loss of vacation leave is equivalent to three days\u2019 suspension without pay, the maximum penalty available for summary punishment, because we conclude that the addition of a severe letter of reprimand increases the penalty beyond the summary punishment limitations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The Police Department does not issue a severe letter of reprimand for every violation. Moreover, the Department uses two types of reprimand letters: an ordinary reprimand letter, which simply informs the officer of a violation, and a severe letter of reprimand, which advises the recipient that any future violation may result in dismissal. We therefore conclude that the combined punishment of a severe letter of reprimand plus three days\u2019 loss of vacation exceeds the maximum allowable summary punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Based on both the nature of Captain Blondell\u2019s offense and the amount of punishment the Department initially offered him, we conclude that the Department\u2019s initial offer of punishment was not summary punishment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, the hearing board was not limited to the maximum penalty available for summary punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the initial punishment offered in this case was summary punishment, the officer\u2019s rejection of the offer would not necessarily limit the punishment a hearing board could impose to the maximum penalty available for summary punishment. When an officer rejects an offer of summary punishment, the LEOBR requires the Chief of Police to choose between two methods of proceeding to hearing. As discussed in Section III.B, <em>supra, </em>the Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Chief could proceed to form a hearing board under either the three-member hearing board mechanism described in \u00a7 727(d)(1) or the one-member or more mechanism in \u00a7 727(d)(3). If the Chief of Police elects to proceed under \u00a7 727(d)(3) rather than under \u00a7 727(d)(1), the hearing board may not impose punishment greater than the maximum allowable summary punishment, <em>ie., </em>three days\u2019 suspension without pay or a $150 fine. In comparison, if the Chief of Police elects to proceed under \u00a7 727(d)(1), the hearing board may impose any punishment up to and including termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Because the Chief of Police has discretion to proceed either under \u00a7 727(d)(1) or \u00a7 727(d)(3), hearing boards are not limited to the summary punishment penalties in all cases where an officer rejects an offer of summary punishment. The summary punishment cap does not apply unless the Chief of Police decides to proceed under \u00a7 727(d)(3). Since no hearing board mechanism had yet been selected when Captain Blondell instituted this action, the Police Department has not yet taken any action that would limit the penalty imposed by the hearing board to the maximum penalty available for summary punishment. Thus, the Police Department did not violate any provision of the LEOBR merely by deciding to add a false statements charge to Captain Blondell\u2019s offenses, which <em>might </em>have subjected him to punishment greater than summary punishment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Captain Blondell also contends that the Police Department decided to add a false statement charge against him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>after he refused summary punishment in order to retaliate against him for exercising his statutory right to a hearing, in violation of \u00a7 733. We find little support for this argument in the record. Captain Blondell argues that the timing of the Police Department\u2019s decision to add another charge indicates that the action \u201csmacks of retaliation.\u201d He also points to the testimony of Sergeant Puller, the IID detective who investigated his case, that the possibility of additional charges after refusal of summary punishment \u201ccould have [the] ... effect\u201d of coercing officers to forego their right to a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">We agree with the conclusion of the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals that Captain Blondell did not meet his burden of proving that his rejection of summary punishment was a \u201csubstantial or motivating factor\u201d in the Department\u2019s decision to add the second charge. <em>See Blondell v. Baltimore City Police Dept., </em>104 Md.App. 69, 79-80, 655 A.2d 34, 38-39 (1995); <em>see also DiGrazia, </em>288 Md. at 448, 418 A.2d at 1197. Captain Blondell\u2019s evidence merely suggests that the general practice of adding a new charge after an officer refuses summary punishment may, in theory, have coercive effects. He offered no evidence, however, that in his case, the Police Department\u2019s decision to add the false statement charge was motivated by his refusal of the Department\u2019s initial offer of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Police Department\u2019s disciplinary procedures in Captain Blondell\u2019s case did not violate the LEOBR.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

Instead, the commander may recommend punishment, but the Chief of Police retains ultimate authority to approve or reject the commander's recommendation. The regulation does not conflict with the LEOBR, however, because \u00a7 734A also states that \u201c[t]he provisions of this subtitle are not intended to prohibit summary punishment ... by <em>higher ranking law enforcement officers </em>as may be designated by the head of a law enforcement agency.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\">.

Under the 1975 amendments, if an officer refused an offer of summary punishment, the only available method of forming a hearing board was the three-member or more board now described in \u00a7 727(d)(1).

The Police Department also contends that its initial offer of punishment to Blondell did not constitute summary punishment because Blondell disputed the facts, declined to waive his right to a hearing, and refused to accept the punishment offered. The Department misreads the statute. While summary punishment, as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 727(f) and 734A of the LEOBR, requires that the facts must be undisputed, the officer must waive the right to a hearing, and the officer must accept punishment, these elements are not prerequisites to an <em>offer </em>of summary punishment, but rather, they are conditions that must be met before an offer of summary punishment may be executed. Section 734A provides that \"summary punishment may be <em>imposed \" </em>if these conditions are fulfilled, and we interpret \"imposed\u201d to mean \"executed,\u201d not merely \"offered.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\">. We acknowledge that the LEOBR provisions at issue here do not provide a police officer with notice, prior to the administrative hearing, of whether the Police Department\u2019s offer of punishment constitutes summary punishment. Furthermore, the Police Department\u2019s regulations also do not provide the officer with notice of what type of punishment he is being offered, because the same form may be used to offer the officer summary punishment or punishment greater than summary punishment. <em>See Gen\u2019l Order 48-77, </em>at C-l-1 and C-2-1 (Form 77/175 and Form 77/402).
