The precise issue is whether the lessor of a motor vehicle is relieved of financial responsibility for third party claims resulting from the negligent operation of its rental vehicle by a permittee<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when the vehicle\u2019s operation is in violation of the express terms of the rental agreement. We shall hold that the required security mandated by Maryland Code (1977, 1992 Repl.VoL., 1995 Supp.) \u00a7 18-102 of the Transportation Article<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> covers operators of leased vehicles driving these vehicles with the permission of the lessee even when the lessee violated the terms of the rental agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Title 17 of the Maryland statutory insurance scheme requires every owner of a registered motor vehicle to maintain liability coverage for personal injury of $20,000 for any one person, $40,000 for any accident, and \u00a7 10,000 for property damage. \u00a7 17-103(b); <em>National Grange Mut.

In this case, we must decide what effect, if any, \u00a7 18-106 has on the operation of \u00a7 18-102(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Appellee Allstate sought a declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County that, based on \u00a7 18-102, Enterprise is obligated to provide minimum security in the amount of $20,000 per person/$40,000 per occurrence for bodily injury arising out of an accident that occurred on August 11, 1991.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Allstate maintained that because the driver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>had the lessee\u2019s express permission to operate the rental vehicle, Enterprise had the primary responsibility for providing the required security to the extent of the statutory mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Allstate, declaring</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">Enterprise Leasing Company is governed by 18-102 and is required to provide coverage to Grace Suzanne Sonde and David Sonde in the case brought by Stephany Witt, C-93-1905, to the extent of $20,000.00 per person/$40,000. per occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The court entered final judgment in favor of Allstate. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2-602(b). Enterprise appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and we granted a writ of certiorari on our own motion. We shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Appellant Enterprise is a self-insured entity that is in the business of leasing automobiles to the public. Enterprise leased a Ford Taurus GL automobile to Grace Sonde on August 8, 1991. The rental agreement provided that it is a violation of the contract if the car is used or driven by any person under the age of 21 without the owner\u2019s written permission or by any person other than the renter without written consent of the owner. When Ms. Sonde signed the rental agreement, she specifically declined to request permission for a person other than herself to drive the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">On August 11, 1991, Ms. Sonde allowed her seventeen year-old son, David, to operate the Enterprise rental vehicle. David allegedly failed to maintain control of the vehicle and collided with a vehicle in which Stephany Witt was a passen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>ger. Stephany Witt filed suit against David Sonde and Grace Sonde in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County seeking compensation for injuries she suffered in the accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Appellee Allstate is an insurance carrier. On the day of the accident, Allstate had in effect an insurance policy that provided liability coverage for both Grace and David Sonde. The Sondes submitted Ms. Witt\u2019s claim to Allstate. Allstate submitted the claim to Enterprise, claiming that Enterprise was required to provide primary insurance coverage for the Witt lawsuit, up to the statutory minimum coverage required by Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Enterprise denied responsibility for primary coverage because, under the terms of the rental agreement and \u00a7 18-106, Grace Sonde was not authorized to permit David Sonde to drive the rental vehicle. Enterprise maintained that David Sonde was an unauthorized driver and, therefore, not a covered operator. Enterprise contended that \u00a7 18-106 defines permission as used in \u00a7 18-102 and that the security required by \u00a7 18-102 does not extend to persons operating the Enterprise vehicle with invalid and illegal permission in violation of \u00a7 18-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Allstate asserts that, under \u00a7 18-102(b), if the operator of a rental vehicle has permission to operate the vehicle, then the operator is covered for the damages to a third party under the lessor\u2019s required security. Allstate contends that, under the plain language of \u00a7 18-102(b), because David Sonde operated the rental vehicle with the express permission of the lessee, he had \u201cpermission\u201d to operate the rental vehicle, notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 18-106. Therefore, because he had permission tp operate the vehicle, he is covered under the Enterprise required security for the damages arising out of the Witt accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">In this appeal, Enterprise and Allstate disagree as to whether \u00a7 18-106 defines \u201cpermission\u201d as this term is used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u00a7 18-102(b). Enterprise contends that \u00a7 18-106 defines the term, while Allstate contends that \u00a7 18-106 does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to discern and carry out the intent of the legislature. <em>Dept. of Public Safety and Correctional Services v. Howard, </em>339 Md. 357, 369, 663 A.2d 74, 79 (1995). If the \u201cstatutory language is plain and unambiguous, and expresses a definite meaning consonant with the statute\u2019s purpose, courts must not insert or delete words to make a statute express an intention different from its clear meaning.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 159, 416 A.2d 734, 738 (1980). Where the Legislature has mandated insurance coverage, this Court will not create exclusions that are not specifically set out in the statute. <em>Larimore v. American Ins. Co., </em>314 Md. 617, 622, 552 A.2d 889, 891 (1989); <em>Jennings v. Government Employees Ins., </em>302 Md. 352, 358-59, 488 A.2d 166, 169 (1985). Employing these principles of statutory construction, we address the issue before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">We believe that the plain language of \u00a7 18-102(b) indicates that an unauthorized permittee cannot be excluded from coverage under the required security, even if the rental vehicle is operated without the lessor\u2019s consent and in violation of the rental agreement. We also believe that the Legislature did not intend for \u00a7 18-106 to have any effect on the coverage required by \u00a7 18-102(b). We base our conclusion on two phrases contained in \u00a7 18-102(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The first significant phrase is the initial phrase of \u00a7 18-102(b), which reads, \u201c[notwithstanding any provision of the rental agreement to the contrary.\u201d This plain language indicates that no term or condition of a private rental agreement may interfere with the coverage required by \u00a7 18-102(b). The import of the initial phrase of \u00a7 18-102(b) for this case becomes clear when it is considered in relation to \u00a7 18-106 and the rental agreement between Ms. Sonde and Enterprise. The plain language of \u00a7 18-106 indicates that its application depends on the terms of rental agreement. Section 18-106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>becomes operative only if a rental agreement contains a provision that either restricts the lessee from giving permission to others to operate the rental vehicle or prohibits a person other than the lessee from operating the rental vehicle without the lessor\u2019s permission. Section 18-106 does not define the term \u201cpermission\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In this case, the rental agreement states that it is a violation of the agreement for anyone other than Ms. Sonde or anyone who is under the age of 21 to operate the rental vehicle without Enterprise\u2019s written permission. Section 18-106 enforces this provision of the rental agreement, and, under \u00a7 27-101, a violation of \u00a7 18-106 is a misdemeanor. Nevertheless, for the purposes of applying \u00a7 18\u2014102(b), we read the rental agreement as if it did not include this provision. Therefore, neither the rental agreement nor \u00a7 18-106 has any effect on the lessor\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 18\u2014102(b) to provide the required security.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The second significant phrase in \u00a7 18\u2014102(b) is the final phrase, which reads, \u201cwith the permission of the owner or lessee.\u201d We believe that by using the disjunctive language \u201cowner or lessee,\u201d the Legislature intended to extend coverage under the required security to all permittees of both the lessee and the lessor. This includes unauthorized permittees.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Had the Legislature intended to exclude coverage for unauthorized permittees, we believe it would have used the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d rather than the disjunctive \u201cor.\u201d The use of \u201cand\u201d as the connector between the terms \u201cowner\u201d and \u201clessee\u201d would have indicated that the permission of both would be required for a permittee who operated the rental vehicle to be covered under the required security. But the use of \u201cor\u201d indicates that the permission of either the owner or lessee is sufficient to bring a permittee under the coverage of the required security.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">We hold that \u00a7 18-102(b) requires the lessor to cover damages to third parties under its required security where any permittee, authorized or unauthorized, drives or uses a rental vehicle. Section 18-106 provides no exclusion from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>coverage for unauthorized permittees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Enterprise could not \u201ccontract away its statutorily-imposed risk by inserting in its rental agreement restrictive clauses that narrow the statutory requirements.\u201d <em>Consol. Enters. Inc. v. Schwindt, </em>172 Ariz. 35, 833 P.2d 706, 710 (1992). This is made clear by the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Our conclusion is further supported by the fact that the Maryland compulsory insurance law does not include a specific exclusion from coverage under the required security for unauthorized permittees. We think that if the General Assembly had intended to exclude coverage for unauthorized permittees, it would have made such an exclusion an explicit part of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The purpose of Maryland\u2019s compulsory insurance law is to ensure that those who own and operate motor vehicles registered in the State are \u201cfinancially able to pay compensation for damages resulting from motor vehicle accidents.\u201d <em>Gartelman, </em>288 Md. at 154, 416 A.2d at 736; <em>see National Grange Mut. Ins. v. Pinkney, </em>284 Md. 694, 704, 399 A.2d 877, 882 (1979). The public policy behind the law is to give innocent third parties a source of private sector insurance funds from which to obtain compensation for their injuries. <em>See Van Horn v. Atlantic Mutual, </em>334 Md. 669, 680, 641 A.2d 195, 200 (1994); <em>Larimore, </em>314 Md. at 625, 552 A.2d at 892; <em>Jennings, </em>302 Md. at 357-58, 488 A.2d at 168-69; <em>see also American Tours, Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>315 N.C. 341, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>338 S.E.2d 92 (1986) (holding \u201cit is preferable to provide coverage for innocent motorists rather than to deny such coverage because of the violation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Section 18-102(b) effectuates this public policy. It mandates coverage under the required security for \u201cthe owner of the vehicle and each person driving or using the vehicle with the permission of the owner or lessee.\u201d Its purpose is, in part, to protect \u201cthe public generally and its members injured by the negligent operation of the insured [motor vehicle] on a public highway.\u201d <em>Couch Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, </em>\u00a7 45:293, at 617-18 (2d ed. 1981). By extending coverage under the required security to the permittees of the lessee, \u00a7 18-102(b) ensures that the injured innocent victims of accidents involving these permittees will have a source of private insurance funds from which to obtain compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In the past, we have invalidated insurance policy exclusion clauses that are inconsistent with the public policy of this State. <em>See Larimore, </em>314 Md. at 622, 626, 552 A.2d at 891, 893 (holding \u201cfellow employee\u201d exclusion invalid as inconsistent with public policy); <em>Jennings, </em>302 Md. at 356-60, 488 A.2d at 168-71 (holding \u201chousehold\u201d exclusion invalid because inconsistent with public policy); <em>Gartelman, </em>288 Md. at 156-57, 161, 416 A.2d at 737, 739 (holding that exclusion from personal injury protection (PIP) coverage for \u201can insured who is injured while occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by a named insured\u201d and exclusion from uninsured motorist (UM) coverage for \u201can insured who is injured while occupying an uninsured highway vehicle owned by an insured other than himself\u2019 were invalid because they conflicted with the compulsory insurance law). In <em>Larimore, we </em>considered the validity of a motor vehicle insurance policy exclusion for fellow employees. In reasoning equally applicable here, we observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">To uphold the fellow employee exclusion in motor vehicle insurance policies could result in a large class of claimants being without liability insurance coverage and in a large class of uninsured motorists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 625, 552 A.2d at 892. Similarly, we find that an exclusion for unauthorized permittees could result in a large class of injured claimants for whom insurance coverage would be unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">For example, it is foreseeable that unauthorized permittees will drive rental vehicles and that they will be involved in accidents. <em>See Motor Vehicle Accident Indem. Corp. v. Continental Nat\u2019l Am. Group Co., </em>35 N.Y.2d 260, 360 N.Y.S.2d 859, 319 N.E.2d 182, 184 (1974) (noting that the lessor, knew or should have known, that \u201cthe probabilities of the car coming into the hands of another person were exceedingly great\u201d). It is in the nature of rental vehicles that they are often rented by temporary visitors to Maryland, such as business persons and vacationers. The parking or garaging of these rental vehicles often requires the lessee to give a hotel, restaurant, or other valet permission to operate the vehicle. The Supreme Court of Florida, in <em>Roth v. Old Republic Ins. Co., </em>269 So.2d 3, 6 (Fla.1972), recognized the probability that persons other than the lessee would operate a rental vehicle. The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASZ\">[I]n the very nature of modern automobile use a lessee of a rental car often has to turn the car over to car park, garage, or filling station personnel and others for temporary operation and that it would be unreasonable to negate the rental car agency\u2019s liability and its insurance coverage in case of accident because of the existence of a collateral or side agreement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">If these unauthorized permittees are not motor vehicle owners they do not need to maintain liability insurance. <em>See </em>Title 16 of the Transportation Article. If they are not covered by the required security, accidents in which they are involved could result in injured claimants who would have no recourse to compensation from a private insurance fund. <em>See Larimore, </em>314 Md. at 625, 552 A.2d at 892; <em>Jennings, </em>302 Md. at 360, 488 A.2d at 170. Moreover, as we have indicated, the purpose of the compulsory insurance law \u201cwould be frustrated to a significant extent\u201d if we were to allow an exclusion from the required security that is not specifically provided by statute. <em>See Jennings, </em>302 Md. at 360, 488 A.2d at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Neither \u00a7 18-106 nor any other statutory provision authorizes a lessor to exclude an unauthorized permittee from the coverage required by \u00a7 18-102(b). It is the General Assembly\u2019s role to determine whether unauthorized permit-tees are to be excluded from coverage under \u00a7 18-102(b). We will not read an exclusion into the statute.

Further, he concluded that the 1970 removal of the provision that criminalized a lessee's giving permission to another to operate a rental vehicle in violation of a rental agreement from the precursor to \u00a7 18-102 indicated that the \"Legislature considered the requirement that the financial security extend to owners, lessees, and permissive users to be separate from the prohibition against allowing persons to use the rented vehicle without permission of the owner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
