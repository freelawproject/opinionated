The note bore this entry: \u201cIt is agreed and understood that this obligation will be reduced $1,500.00 every thirty days.\u201d At the same time the Fireman\u2019s Fund Indemnity Company, California (hereafter called surety), gave bank a surety bond which provided that Teich \u201cwill pay the Northeast National Bank of Philadelphia at maturity both the principal and interest of\u201d the foregoing note. In point of fact, Teich, at the maturity of the note, paid only $1,500 on the note, but bank then accepted his note for $18,500 and surrendered the original note, which was marked canceled. Thereafter, Teich continued to pay $1,500 monthly until November 17, 1933, when $4,500 remained unpaid, at which time he defaulted. Whereupon bank brought suit against surety. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">On trial, the case was submitted to the jury subject to a reservation by the court. Thereafter, the court entered judgment n. o. v. in favor of surety. Whereupon the bank took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">The facts being as above stated, Teich\u2019s failure to pay the original note of $15,000 at its maturity on April 14, 1933, was a default of which bank was obligated to give notice to surety. It is contended notice was waived for surety by'Brown, the agent of surety, who negotiated the policy. But there was no warranting proof of Brown\u2019s right to so waive, so the case stands on the basis of Teich\u2019s failing to pay the guaranteed note at maturity, of its surrender and cancellation, and of the subsequent action of bank in extending Teich\u2019s indebtedness from time to time until November 17, 1933, when he defaulted. Of all these acts surety had no knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">Without discussing other contentions made, all of which have received due consideration, we limit ourselves to stating the j udgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
