Thereupon, the bill prayed for a decree reforming the policy so as to include total and permanent disability benefits at $50 per month, for an accounting, and for specific performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>of the contractual obligation of appellee under the policy when so reformed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">The answer admits the application of July 18, 1924, but alleges that the issuing officers of appellee were unwilling to accept the risks in the policy applied for, but were willing to issue a policy in the endowment form aforesaid, with disability benefits, which is a rated policy in which the premium is considerably higher. It further alleges that on November 11, 1924, appellee issued the policy in the endowment form, with a disability provision, and transmitted the same to its agent for delivery to appellant, but that appellant refused to accept the policy and caused it to be returned for further modification by the elimination of said disability provision, and the change of the plan of premium payments from an annual to a semiannual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The matter was referred to a master for the taking of testimony and the report of his findings and conclusions. There was much conflicting evidence, but our conclusions render a consideration of the conflicting evidence unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The uncontradicted evidence shows that appellant\u2019s application was received at the home office of appellee in due course, but that action thereon was delayed until November 11, 1924, at which time a policy in the form of \u201cEndowment at age 85, with disability,\u201d was authorized and issued. This policy was transmitted to the district office of appellee for delivery to appellant. Appellant declined to accept the policy, and it was \u25a0 returned to the district office by the soliciting agent. It was then returned to the home office by the district agent with a letter attached in which the district agent informed appellee that appellant was unwilling to take the policy as issued, but would accept it on a semiannual basis and without disability. The premium for the first period on the policy as issued, but on a semiannual basis and without disability, was remitted with the returned policy, in the amount specified in appellee\u2019s rate book for such insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Being thus informed that appellant had agreed, to accept a policy without disability benefits at the reduced premium, and intending to issue such a policy, the home office of appellee caused a new policy to be issued without said disability provision and on a semiannual basis. The application was indorsed to show the change, but, by inadvertence, the copy attached to the policy issued November 11th was removed therefrom and inserted in the new policy without such notation being made thereon. This same inadvertence persisted when the policy was surrendered in 1925 for the issuance of a twenty-payment life.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">On the master\u2019s finding that appellant had never consented to the elimination of the disability provisions, and had believed that such protection was afforded by the policies, and that the elimination of these provisions was the result of a mutual mistake between appellant and the soliciting agent of appellee, he reported his conclusions to be that the provisions were eliminated by mutual mistake and that an equitable right to reformation accrued to appellant. The District Court, accepting the findings of the master on the testimony in so far as there was any conflict, rejected his conclusions and entered its decree denying recovery and dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">No fraud is alleged or shown, and it is conceded that the soliciting agent who tendered the policy first issued had no authority to bind appellee other than by delivery of the policy. Hence, no agreement he may have had with appellant would have been binding upon appellee unless ratified by it. The policies issued were the policies intended by the officers of the corporation. Whether they reflected the true intent of appellant or not, these officers never intended that appellee should be bound in any other way than as expressed in those documents. Thus the purpose of appellant is to have this cohrt write into the contract, reformation of which is sought, a provision that one of the parties did not agree to and did not consent to have incorporated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">In order to support reformation, the evidence must show that the instrument is not the true expression of the agreement. It must show that the deficiency or falsity of the instrument is the result of a mutual mistake, not merely the mistake of one of the parties. It must show what the true agreement was, and that the minds of the parties actually met thereon. Britton v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 165 N.C. 149, 80 S.E. 1072; By-Fi Building &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. New York Casualty Co., 116 N.J.Eq. 265, 173 A. 90; Algeo v. Employers\u2019 Indemnity Corp., 119 Kan. 186, 237 P. 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">The policy here involved is prima facie what both of the parties intended it to be. The burden of showing its lack of verity is on the appellant, and he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>wholly failed to meet this burden. Rosenthal v. First National Fire Insurance Co., 74 Fla. 371, 77 So. 92; Hearne v. New England Mutual Marine Insurance Co., 20 Wall. 488, 87 U.S. 488, 22 L.Ed. 395. Instead of showing that the parties did not intend the contract issued and accepted, but did intend another and different contract, it shows conclusively that one of the parties did intend this contract, and did not agree to or intend any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The District Court committed no error, and its decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
