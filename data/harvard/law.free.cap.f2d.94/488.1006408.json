H. Rothstein, one of the defendant co-partners,' and George N. Edwards, receiver for the Golden State Asparagus Company, for the purchase of a crop of asparagus, Edwards telegraphed Rothstein, who had gone from California to Seattle, Wash., as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-15\">\u201cWill confirm sale to H. Rothstein and Son all asparagus shipped from Golden State Asparagus Co. up to and including Apr 10 34 $2 per crate f. o. b. cars Isleton providing satisfactory bank guarantee is given immediately that all drafts against shipments will be paid wire answer 801 Jones Avenue Oakland</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-16\">\u201cGeo N. Edwards Receiver \u201cGolden State Asp. Co.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-17\">Rothstein replied by telegraph as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-18\">\u201cAnswering will arrange guarantee payments all bunch asparagus price mentioned expect return San Francisco last this week or first next week don\u2019t worry when we make deal with you will go through with same can draw up contract my arrival meantime figuring deal confirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-20\">\u201cM. H. Rothstein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-21\">Later Edwards and Rothstein met in the law offices of Edwards\u2019 attorney and discussed plans and terms of a guarantee and the attorney presented a draft of a proposed written contract. Wide differences developed and the meeting broke up without accomplishment. No guarantee was ever given and Edwards sold the crop of asparagus for less than the price mentioned in the telegram. He brought suit for the difference upon the theory that the two telegrams constitute a written contract, and was awarded the judgment mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-22\">The judgment cannot stand for the reason that the telegrams record no complete agreement between the parties. Roth-stein\u2019s answering telegram is inconsistent with the theory that it is an unconditional acceptance of an offer made by Edwards\u2019 telegram. It was an assurance that the price was satisfactory and that a guarantee would be arranged when they should later meet to \u201cdraw up\u201d a contract. It was a personal assurance that Rothstein was as good as his word and would go through with the deal in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-23\">There is nothing in this answering telegram to the effect that he would buy \u201call asparagus shipped\u201d as Edwards\u2019 telegram recited; instead Rothstein carefully specified \u201call bunch asparagus.\u201d Rothstein\u2019s telegram did not meet the very material proviso upon which Edwards\u2019 offer was based, that (quoting from the telegram) \u201c * * * providing satisfactory bank guarantee is [would be] given immediately that all drafts against shipments will be paid.\u201d He merely assured Edwards that the subject would be covered but he did not assent to a bank guarantee and he did not assent to the peremptory requirement indicated by the word \u201cimmediately\u201d nor to the indefinite requirement indicated by the word \u201csatisfactory.\u201d Unconditional acceptance is a condition precedent to the existence of a contract. Williston on Contracts (1936) \u00a7 666A.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-26\">The concluding expression in Rothstein\u2019s telegram \u201cmeanwhile figuring deal confirm; ed\u201d must be read in connection with all. of the rest of the message, and giving it the widest possible application and also giving the parol exception its broadest applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>tion, still we would search the transcript in vain for evidence that \u201csatisfactory bank guarantee\u201d has such a definite meaning that it could not be varied by individual opinion. Indeed the evidence would affirmatively show as wide a - difference between the parties upon that subject as could well be imagined. \u2022 .</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">There was evidence introduced at the trial to the effect that \u201cshipping\u201d asparagus is of the same quality that goes into \u201cbunch\u201d asparagus; but shipping asparagus may be either loose pack or tied in bunches. The parties concede that \u201cbunch\u201d asparagus is divided into several classes requiring selection for each class according to standard requirements. As one witness puts it</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u201cAccording to the custom and usage of the asparagus trade, the term \u2018bunch asparagus\u2019 has a definite meaning. It means the best asparagus, segregated from the field run of asparagus, with culls, hooks and crooks and broken tips discarded, and consists of so many spears to each bunch. There are five different grades of bunch asparagus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u201cEach grade of bunch asparagus has a different specification, different sizes of each stalk, color, length and so many stalks to the bunch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">All of this, of course, adds to cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The evidence did not go so far as to support the claim that the phrase \u201call asparagus shipped\u201d as used in the context of Edwards\u2019 telegram, was synonymous with the trade expression \u201cshipping asparagus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Of course, parol evidence may be resorted to to explain ambiguities but as it is put in Blue Valley Creamery Co. v. Consolidated Products Co. (C.C.A.8, 1936) 81 F.2d 182, 187, 188, \u201cparol evidence cannot be admitted to piece out an incomplete writing and make it a complete instrument.\u201d There would need be much \u201cpiecing out\u201d in this case in addition to explaining ambiguities to make a \u201ccomplete instrument\u201d out of these two telegrams.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">It is our conclusion that the telegrams do not constitute a contract. Robbins v. Pacific Eastern Corporation (Cal.Sup.1937) 65 P.2d 42, 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">The defendant made a motion in the trial court for a directed verdict which the court denied. It should have been granted. Wristen v. Bowles, 82 Cal. 84, 22 P. 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">Judgment reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b538-13\">On Petition for Rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b538-14\">DENMAN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">My concurrence in the conclusion reached in this case and in denying the petition for rehearing should be expressed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">The parties are agreed that the asparagus shipments, from the Golden State Company of the crop referred to in the telegram from appellee, include shipments of both asparagus tied in bunches and untied and loose in crates. Appellee\u2019s telegraphic offer to appellants reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-17\">\u201cWill confirm sale to H. Rothstein and Son all asparagus shipped from Golden State Asparagus Co.' up to and including Apr 10 34 $2 per crate f. o. b. cars Isleton providing satisfactory bank guarantee is given immediately that all drafts against shipments will be paid wire answer 801 Jones Avenue Oakland</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAm\">\u201cGeo N. Edwards Receiver</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-18\">\u201cGolden State Asp. Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-19\">The guaranty to be given by appellants is a guaranty that <em>\u201call </em>drafts against <em>shipments </em>will be paid.\u201d The guaranteed \u201cshipments\u201d obviously were to be \u201call asparagus shipped\u201d; that is, both bunched and loose. There is no ambiguity in the phrase \u201call asparagus.\u201d It would vary and not explain the proposal to prove the sender meant less than \u201call.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-20\">Appellants\u2019 purported telegraphic acceptance does not accept this offer. In effect, it makes a new proposal, namely, to guarantee only the shipments of <em>\u201cbunch\u201d </em>asparagus. It did not cover the loose asparagus of the appellee\u2019s offer. It is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-21\">\u201cAnswering will arrange guarantee payments .all bunch asparagus price mentioned expect return San Francisco last this week or first next week don\u2019t worry when we make deal with you will go through with same can draw up contract my arrival meantime figuring deal confirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-22\">\u201cM. H. Rothstein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-23\">Since the suit is based solely upon the claim that this exchange of telegrams constitute a contract, and since they do not constitute an offer and acceptance within the offer\u2019s terms, there was nothing to go to the jury. It should have been instructed to bring in a verdict for the appellants-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-24\">Petition for rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
