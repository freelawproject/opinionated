Unfortunately these banks failed. Thereupon the city demanded from the treasurer the sums due by the depository banks, under the clause in the surety bond which provided \u201cand at the expiration of said term * * * shall turn over all city records and property which may come into his hands,\u201d and this demand being refused, the city brought this suit against the surety, a corporate citizen of Connecticut. By stipulation, the jury was waived and the case was tried by the judge who entered judgment for the surety, thereupon the city took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-22\">As quoted above, the surety bond was to be released if the treasurer deposited the city money in city designated banks. This the treasurer did; consequently, the obligation of the surety was complied with. The authorities cited by the judge support his holding. So regarding, the judgment below is affirmed. The facts of this case are wholly different from those in Commonwealth v. Baily, 129 Pa. 480, 10 A. 764.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
