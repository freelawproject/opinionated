It appears as a part of the names of various mechanical contrivances, such as refrigerator, percolator, dehydrator, fumigator, aerator, circulator, evaporator, desiccator, and gyrator, as well as a part of other commonly used words, such as arbitrator, orator, mediator, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">If we may again indulge in a dissection of the marks, solely for the purpose of the discussion, we think it fair to say that the prefixes \u201cKelvin\u201d and \u201cAerol\u201d are quite dissimilar. When correctly pronounced, appellee\u2019s trade-mark is \u201cA'Srolator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">The goods of the parties are comparatively expensive, and, as stated in the case of International Silver Co. v. American Silver Co., 37 F.2d 622, 623, 17 C.C.P.A., Patents, 871, are purchased with a \u201cconsiderable degree of care and discrimination upon the part of the purchaser. * * They are not a matter of every day purchase upon the part of an individual, like food products or other products that require frequent replacement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Considering the marks in their entirety, the character of the goods of the parties and the degree of care and discrimination exercised by the purchasers of them, we are of opinion that their concurrent use by the parties on their respective goods would not be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public, and that appellee is entitled to the registration of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
