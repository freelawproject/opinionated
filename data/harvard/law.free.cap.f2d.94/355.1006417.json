His only point is that he was convicted and sentenced to prison, where he is now restrained of his liberties, upon a conspiracy charge, which is not of itself a crime since the scheme to violate a federal law was actually accomplished and petitioner was convicted and sentenced to prison upon the substantive offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-19\">We need but quote one sentence from Parmagini v. United States, 1930, 9 Cir., 42 F.2d 721, 725 : \u201cThe last count of conspiracy to violate these laws is a separate and distinct offense punishable as such. Ader v. U. S. (C.C.A.) 284 F. 13; Brady v. U. S. (C.C.A.) 24 F.2d 405, 59 A.L.R. 563.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The ruling of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
