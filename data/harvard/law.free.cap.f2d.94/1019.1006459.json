Schriber-Schroth Co., 92 F.2d 330), and since this court by reason of its conclusion as to the failure of a showing of irreparable injury finds it unnecessary to express any view as to the issue of res adjudicata controlling the decision below and does not express any view in that respect, and since the order of the District Court must under familiar rules be sustained if right for any reason, it is hereby ordered that the order of the District Court be, and it is, hereby affirmed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent\u2019 herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
