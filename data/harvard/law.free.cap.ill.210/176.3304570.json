To reverse that judgment of affirmance this appeal is prosecuted.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-10\" pgmap=\"176(57) 177(67)\">The bill was filed August 28, 1902, and sought to enjoin the defendants from using the trade name of the complainant by representing, pretending- and claiming-to be associated or connected with the complainant in any manner, and from circulating stationery, circulars, pamphlets and advertising matter upon which should be printed the title \u201cLandlords\u2019 Protective Department,\u201d or any similar combination of words in which the words \u201cLandlords\u2019 Protective\u201d appear. Upon the filing of the bill a temporary injunction was granted, and.on September 5 following, the defendants filed their answer, to which the complainant replied. The cause was heard on evidence produced in open court, and in November of the same year an order was entered dissolving the injunction and dismissing the bill.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-3\" pgmap=\"177(274) 178(171)\">The evidence showed the organization of the complainant on November 10,1886, the object, as stated in its articles of incorporation, being: \u201cThe object of said corporation shall be to collect and compile the names of persons who have proven unsatisfactory and troublesome tenants and to have been a cause of vexation and expense to their landlords, and for general reference, use and information as to the status, payment of rent, care of property, and whether a desirable, good, bad or pestiferous tenant, and to publish and maintain a list of such renters for the information and protection of landlords and its patrons, and to aid and assist such landlords to recover possession of their property.\u201d The location of its principal office is stated to be \u201cChicago, Illinois.\u201d It has conducted the business for which it was incorporated ever since its incorporation. Its offices in Chicago are at 232 West Division street, 332 Blue Island avenue, 100 Washington street and 371 Larrabee street, the last being its main office. Its method of doing business is to sell to a person a membership in the corporation for the sum of $10, which membership entitles the purchaser thereof to the services of the corporation in collecting rents, evicting bad tenants and general care of his interest as a landlord. It also did business for persons not members, who, on payment to it of $5 each, became entitled to its services in evicting tenants. It expended, originally, in establishing its business, about $10,000, and spent yearly in advertising its business from $1000 to $2000. Its business is worth between $4000 and $5000 yearly, and at the time of the hearing it had done business for about seven thousand persons. The defendants are not incorporated. They inaugurated the Landlords\u2019 Protective Department on February 1, 1901. On the back of a printed pamphlet issued by appellees about February 1, 1902, are, in large letters, the words \u201cLandlords\u2019 Protective Department,\u201d and underneath said words, in small letters, are the words \u201cCampe Commercial Agency.\u201d On page 5 of the pamphlet is the following: \u201cThe five objects of the Landlords\u2019 Protective Department: (1) To give landlords legal advice with reference to all disputes between themselves and their tenants; (2) to eject undesirable tenants for failure to pay rent, or for other reasons; (3) to advise.and render legal services with reference to all general taxes, special assessments, tax sales and tax redemptions; (4) to give advice g,nd render legal services with reference to city ordinances and violations; (5) to give advice and render legal services in merchanics\u2019 lien cases and disputes between landlords and tenants.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-4\" pgmap=\"178\">This and other evidence in the case shows that the business of the' defendants includes similar business to that of complainant. On page 6 of the pamphlet, and immediately following the matter above quoted, this appears: \u201cWe charge a membership fee of one ($1.00) dollar, which entitles the member to free legal advice on all matters growing out of the five objects aforementioned.\u201d On page 7 of the pamphlet it is stated: \u201cOn receipt at our office of the one dollar membership fee we send you a membership certificate which runs for one year, beginning one month after receipt by us of the membership fee.\u201d A receipt issued by defendants, offered in evidence, is as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-5\" pgmap=\"178\">\u201cChicago, Illinois, June 4,1902. .</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\" pgmap=\"178\">\u2018 \u2018Received of Mr. Charles Ruge one dollar, entitling him to one year membership in the Landlords\u2019 Protective Department of the Campe Commercial Agency, including all privileges and benefits of said department.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-7\" pgmap=\"178\">Landlords\u2019 Protective Department,</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-8\" pgmap=\"178\">Per W.

The defendants did not deny that they were transacting business under the name of \u201cLandlords\u2019 Protective Department,\u201d but denied that they did so with any fraudulent intent to injure the business of the complainant, and also denied that they had any knowledge, at the time they organized their Landlords\u2019 Protective Department, of the existence of the complainant corporation, and denied all the allegations of the bill to the effect that they, through their agents', had represented that they were a branch of the Chicago Landlords\u2019 Protective Bureau, or had any connection whatever with its offices or place of business. Several witnesses testified that numerous persons to whom the defendants had issued certificates of membership in the Landlords\u2019 Protective Department applied at the office of appellee for aid and assistance, under the impression that the business of the defendants was that of the complainant. Others testified that one W. E. Gray, solicitor for the defendants, informed them, upon different occasions, that the business they were conducting was a part of the business of the complainant. One witness testified: \u201cI asked him, \u2018Is that in connection with this concern on Division street?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 I says, \u2018Then I am on the safe side.\u2019 He says, \u2018That is merely a branch office of ours, and the main office is down town, in the Ashland Block.\u2019 I said, \u2018All right,\u2019 and I paid the dollar and got the receipt.\u201d</summary><attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-5\" pgmap=\"180\">Albert.B.

Cady v. Schultz, 19 R. I. 193.</p> <opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b182-6\" pgmap=\"182\">Mr. Justice Wilkin</author> <p id=\"A0p\" pgmap=\"182\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p> <p id=\"b182-7\" pgmap=\"182(122) 183(333)\">It is not denied that the allegations of the bill are sufficient to justify the interposition of a court of equity to restrain the defendants in the use of the generic or descriptive words, \u201cLandlords\u2019 Protective Department,\u201d and we are unable to see how it can be seriously contended that the evidence does not fairly support those allegations. The law undoubtedly is that the complainant, the Chicago Landlords\u2019 Protective Bureau, had no right to appropriate to itself the exclusive use of that name to the exclusion of the right of the defendants to use the descriptive words \u201cLandlords\u2019 Protective Department,\u201d so long as the use of those words was with a legitimate and honest purpose, but whenever defendants, intentionally or otherwise, took advantage of the similarity of the name adopted by them to the one under which the complainant was incorporated and had been carrying on its business, to mislead the public, or, without explanation, allowed their clients to be misled into the belief that the two business associations were one and the same, it violated the-lawful rights of the complainant and the plainest principles of equity. Fraud is the gist of actions of this kind. Courts of equity will never enjoin the use of generic or descriptive words in a trade-mark or business name except upon an allegation and proof of actual fraud or fraud resulting from the similarity of the names, tending to lead those dealing with the parties to believe that they are one and the same, even though they use ordinary care to discriminate between them. (Ball v. Siegel, 116 Ill. 137; Elgin Butter Co. v. Elgin Creamery Co. 155 id. 127.) In the case of Allegretti v. Allegretti Chocolate Cream Co. 177 Ill. 129, on page 133 we said: \u201cThe defendants had a right to open up their business under the firm name of Allegretti &amp; Co., provided they did so without any intent, act or artifice to mislead dealers in the market, or the public at large, as to the identity of the firm. If they established their new business and sought to conduct it with the fraudulent and wrongful intention of attracting to themselves the custom intended for appellees, this is clearly a fraud upon the rights of the latter. Whether the business was carried on with such wrongful intent to deceive is a question of fact which was found adversely to appellants upon a hearing, and is the one we must determine from an examination of the evidence.\u2019\u2019 The same' doctrine is announced in International Committee of Young Women's Christian Associations v. Young Women\u2019s Christian Association of Chicago, 194 Ill. 194.</p> <p id=\"b183-3\" pgmap=\"183\">We think the true ground upon which the jurisdiction of a court of equity to restrain the defendants, as prayed in this bill, rests, is that the name assumed by the de-</p> <p id=\"b184-2\" pgmap=\"184\">fendants is so similar to that of the complainant as to mislead and confuse the public mind in the city of Chicago as to the identity of the business in which the two parties were engaged. Investor Publishing Co. v. Dobinson, 72 Fed. Rep. 603; Guardian Fire Assurance Co. v. Guardian and General Ins. Co. L, R. 50 Ch. (N. S.) 253; Lee v. Halley, L. R. 5 Ch. App. Cas. 155; Knott v. Morgan, 2 Keene, 215; United States Mercantile Reporting Co. v. United States Mercantile Reporting and Collecting Ass. 21 Abb. N. C. 115; Matsell v. Flanagan, 2 Abb. Pr. 459.</p> <p id=\"b184-3\" pgmap=\"184\">Sanders v. Jacob, 20 Mo. App. 96, is a case in point illustrating the doctrine of the foregoing authorities. There the petitioner had been engaged in the practice of dentistry in the city of St. Louis, under the business name \u201cNew York Dental Rooms,\u201d for many years. Some two months prior to the bringing of the suit the defendant, who was also a dentist, opened an office near the plaintiff\u2019s, and displayed a sign bearing the words \u201cNewark Dental Rooms,\u201d the sign being similar in appearance to the plaintiff\u2019s sign. The court, after stating that an injunction may issue where the resemblance between the two trade names is sufficiently close to raise a probability of mistake on the part of the public or the evidence shows the design to mislead and deceive on the part of the defendant, said: \u201cIn the present case both of these elements concur. There was sufficient resemblance between the two signs to raise a probability of mistake on the part of the class of customers that frequented the plaintiff\u2019s place of business. The evidence further shows that such mistakes actually occurred. It further satisfies us that the defendant intended that they should occur.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b184-5\" pgmap=\"184(58) 185(83)\">In United States Mercantile Reporting Co. v. United States Mercantile Reporting and Collecting Ass. 21 Abb. N. C. 115, the ground upon which the injunction was granted and maintained was stated by the judge rendering the opinion: \u201cIt seems to me that the name under which the defendant was incorporated and is doing business is such a colorable imitation of that of plaintiff\u2019s that an injunction should be granted restraining its continuance. The cards and bill-heads in evidence show a disposition on the part of the defendant to make unduly prominent that portion of its corporate name which is most similar to the name of the plaintiff. Certain it is that the use by the defendant of its corporate name has led to confusion in the delivery of the mail matter addressed to the parties in question.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b185-3\" pgmap=\"185\">In the case of Lamb Knit Goods Co. v. Lamb Glove and Mitten Co. 120 Mich. 159, this language appears: \u201cIn the present case the testimony shows that dealers have been misled, and in view of the fact that the complainant\u2019s business is largely the manufacture of gloves and mittens and that the name \u2018Lamb\u2019 is prominent in the corporate name, we think it is likely to mislead. The decree will be reversed and a decree entered restraining the defendant from continuing the use of the corporate name \u2018Lamb Glove and Mitten Company,\u2019 or any name in which the word \u2018Lamb\u2019 appears in connection with other words indicating a business similiar to that of complainant.\u201d And so cases might be cited almost without number, to the same effect.</p> <p id=\"b185-4\" pgmap=\"185(135) 186(90)\">While it is true that the defendant Campe, who seems to have been the active member of the defendant firm in the Landlords\u2019 Protective Department, testified that he had no knowledge of the existence of the complainant corporation at the time of the organization of their department, he admits that he had knowledge of the fact that the similarity of the names was calculated to mislead the public to the injury of the complainant. He says: \u201cI did not know of the Chicag'o Landlords\u2019 Protective Bureau until about five or six months ago. I didn\u2019t know it was in existence at the time I established the Landlords\u2019 Protective Department. I had not seen their letter-heads. I didn\u2019t know Mr. Terwilliger or Mr. Cheney.\u201d But in answer to a question by his solicitor he stated that he had not instructed any of his agents to represent that they were connected with the complainant. \u201cI warned them against it after I became acquainted with the name of the Chicago Landlords\u2019 Protective Bureau.\u201d And again: \u201cI warned our agents against representing themselves as complainant as soon as I began to hear of the similarity of the name. * * * I cannot fix the date when I warned our agents not to represent themselves as complainant; -it was within the past six months.\u201d '</p> <p id=\"b186-4\" pgmap=\"186\">We have already seen that such confusion did result, as is abundantly shown by the evidence. \u201cLandlords\u2019 Protective Bureau\u201d and \u201cLandlords\u2019 Protective Department\u201d are manifestly so similar as to almost necessarily lead to complication and confusion in the business of the two parties, and it is of no importance, in this view of, the case, that the defendants had no knowledge of the existence of the complainant until after they had organized their rival business, or had no intention of injuring complainant. As was said in Newby v. Oregon Central Railroad Co. Deady\u2019s Rep. U. S. District of Oregon, 609: \u201cUnder the law the corporate name is a necessary element of the corporation\u2019s existence. Without it a corporation cannot exist.- Any act which produces confusion or uncertainty concerning this name is well calculated to injuriously affect the identity and business of a corporation; and, as a matter of fact, in some degree, at least, the natural and necessary consequence of the wrongful appropriation of a corporate name is to injure the, business and rights of the corporation by destroying or confusing its identity. The motives of the persons attempting the wrongful appropriation are not material. They neither aggravate nor extenuate the injury caused by such appropriatioji. The act is an illegal one, and must, if necessary, be presumed to have been done with an intent to cause the results which naturally flow from it.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b187-2\" pgmap=\"187\">It may be conceded that the evidence in this record as to the actual and intentional fraud is conflicting, and if the determination of the case depended upon that alone there would be force in the argument that the finding of the chancellor, who saw the witnesses and heard them testify, should not be disturbed, but we think the undisputed fact that the similarity of names resulted in embarrassment and injury to the complainant justified the conclusion of the Appellate Court, and its judgment will accordingly be affirmed. Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
