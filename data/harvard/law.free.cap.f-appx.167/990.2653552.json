Galan challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), (2) and, additionally, the district court\u2019s application of the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>Galan\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>528 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Galan contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Galan properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">Galan also contends that the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to the mandatory Guidelines regime held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 764-65, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government concedes that Galan has preserved his claim of error. The sentencing transcript is devoid of evidence that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory regime, and, therefore, the Government has not borne its burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court\u2019s error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, Galan\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 466.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1014-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
