After review, we conclude that the district court properly denied Beeks\u2019s motion and affirm Beeks\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">In May 2003, Beeks pled guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. The \u201cFactual Basis\u201d attached to and incorporated into the written plea agreement stated that, in approximately June 1999 and August 2000, Beeks conspired with another individual, Milton B. Miller, to assist people with bad credit to obtain fraudulent automobile loans from federally insured financial institutions. Specifically, for a fee, Miller would provide the car-buyers with falsified credit information indicating that the car-buyer earned more than he or she actually did, and then Beeks would send the car-buyers to financial institutions where he had paid employees to process car-buyers\u2019 fraudulent loan applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">The plea agreement also contained a provision in which the government agreed not to pursue other federal charges known to the U.S. Attorney and \u201crelated to conduct giving rise to the plea agreement,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">4. <em>No Further Charges</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-15\">If the court accepts this plea agreement, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida agrees not to charge the defendant with committing any other federal criminal offenses known to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office at the time of the execution of this agreement, related to the conduct giving rise to this plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-16\">The plea agreement also stated that it was the entire agreement between the government and Beeks, and that no other promises, agreements or representations existed or had been made to Beeks or his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-17\">In February 2004, the government obtained an indictment against Beeks charging him with identity theft of a man named David J. Bird, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7) and (b)(1), and credit card fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2) and (c)(1), between June 24, 2002 and October 24, 2002. Beeks moved to dismiss the indictment based on the \u201cNo Further Charges\u201d provision in his plea agreement for the bank fraud conspiracy offense. After holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Beeks\u2019s motion, finding that, because the identity theft and credit card fraud charges were not related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Beeks\u2019s conduct that gave rise to the bank fraud charge, the government did not breach the \u201cNo Further Charges\u201d clause of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Beeks pled guilty to the identity theft and credit card fraud charges, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">On appeal, Beeks argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment. According to Beeks, the \u201cNo Further Charges\u201d provision of his prior plea agreement barred the government from bringing the identity theft and credit card charges contained in the present indictment. We disagree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">When a guilty plea \u201crests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). \u201c[I]n determining whether the government has breached a plea agreement, we must first determine the scope of the government\u2019s promises.\u201d <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1105 (11th Cir.2004). To determine the meaning of any disputed terms in the agreement, we apply an objective standard, deciding whether the government\u2019s actions are consistent with what the defendant reasonably understood when entering his guilty plea. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">In determining the scope of the plea agreement, we must first decide whether the language in the plea agreement is ambiguous. \u201cIf it is, we will consider extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent in arriving at an interpretation of the agreement\u2019s language and will rely on [recognized] standards of interpretation; otherwise, we are limited to the unambiguous meaning of the language in the agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1106.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">Here, Beeks\u2019s claim that the government breached the plea agreement turns on the scope of the \u201cNo Further Charges\u201d provision. Specifically, we must decide whether Beeks\u2019s identity theft and credit card fraud charges are \u201crelated to the conduct giving rise to this plea agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-15\">First, we find no facial ambiguity to the phrase \u201crelated to the conduct giving rise to this plea agreement.\u201d The term \u201crelated to\u201d is used in its ordinary sense to mean connected to or associated with. Thus, the plain meaning of the \u201cNo Further Charges\u201d provision is that the government agrees not to bring any other charges in connection with Beeks\u2019s participation in the bank fraud scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">Second, no defendant could have reasonably understood the phrase \u201crelated to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>conduct giving rise to this plea agreement\u201d to include Beeks\u2019s stealing David J. Bird\u2019s identity and engaging in credit card fraud. Beeks\u2019s present offenses bear no relation to the bank fraud conduct. First, they are temporally distinct. The bank fraud occurred between 1999 and 2000. The identity theft and credit card fraud occurred between June and October, 2002, two years later. Second, the bank fraud involved qualitatively different misconduct. Beeks\u2019s role in the bank fraud scheme was to direct prospective car buyers referred by his co-conspirator to employees at financial institutions whom Beeks had already paid to process the fraudulent loan applications. This conduct did not involve either identity theft or credit card fraud. Third, the two sets of offenses involved different individuals. Specifically, Beeks\u2019s co-conspirator in the bank fraud, Miller, was not implicated in Beeks\u2019s identity theft and credit card fraud, and Beeks\u2019s victim in the identity theft and credit card fraud, Bird, was not implicated in the bank fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Indeed, the only thing these two sets of offenses have in common is Beeks. However, to be barred by the plea agreement, the charges must relate to Beeks\u2019s conduct in the bank fraud scheme, not just to Beeks himself. Likewise, the fact that the government may have begun investigating Beeks\u2019s identity theft and credit card fraud while he was under arrest for bank fraud does not mean that the identity theft and credit card fraud are \u201crelated to\u201d Beeks\u2019s conduct in the bank fraud scheme.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Because the government did not breach the bank fraud plea agreement by bringing the identity theft and credit card fraud charges, the district court properly denied Beeks\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. Therefore, we affirm Beeks\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>whether the government has breached a plea agreement when, as here, the defendant preserved that argument in district court. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1104 (11th Cir.2004). The district court's factual findings regarding the scope of the agreement, including the government\u2019s promises, will only be set aside if they are clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 1105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b803-11\">. The standards applied to the interpretation of ambiguous plea agreements include the following: (1) the court should avoid a \u201chyper-technical reading of the written agreement\u201d or employing \"a rigidly literal approach in the construction of language\u201d; (2) \u201cthe written agreement should be viewed against the background of the negotiations and should not be interpreted to directly contradic[t][an] oral understanding\u201d; and (3) ambiguous terms should be read against the government. <em>United States v. Jefferies, </em>908 F.2d 1520, 1523 (11th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b804-5\">. The district court concluded that the phrase \"related to the conduct giving rise to this plea agreement\u201d was ambiguous and considered extrinsic evidence to conclude that the instant charges did not fall within the scope of government\u2019s promise not to bring further charges. Specifically, the district court considered the following: (1) at the time Beeks was arrested on bank fraud charges in February 2003, evidence was collected during a search of his residence that might have supported identity theft and credit card fraud charges; (2) postal inspectors interviewed Beeks at that time regarding a complaint of credit card/identity theft relating to Bird; (3) Beeks\u2019s counsel was told by the prosecutor that the government believed Beeks may have participated in credit card fraud; (4) Beeks\u2019s counsel had asked for, but had been refused, a promise from the government to drop any credit card fraud charges; and (5) the government had threatened Beeks\u2019s counsel with the possibility of more serious bank fraud charges under a superseding indictment. Because we conclude that the phrase is not ambiguous, our ruling does not rely upon the extrinsic evidence considered by the district court. <em>See Copeland, </em>381 F.3d at 1106 (explaining that, where the plea agreement\u2019s language is unambiguous, the court is limited to that unambiguous meaning and does not consider extrinsic evidence). However, even if the language is ambiguous, the district court did not err in denying the motion because the above-listed extrinsic evidence supports the conclusion that the \"No Further Charges\u201d provision of the plea agreement did not bar the identity theft and credit card fraud charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
