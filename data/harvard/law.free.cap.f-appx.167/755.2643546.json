He entered the United States on November 16, 2001, without having been admitted or paroled. He appeared before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) on April 3, 2002, on a Notice to Appear, and admitted that he was subject to removal. He applied for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Following a full evidentiary hearing on April 29, 2003, the IJ found that Petitioner had failed to present credible evidence to support his claim for asylum and withholding of removal, denied his application, and ordered him removed to Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Petitioner appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). On June 17, 2005, the Board affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, and Petitioner, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed the instant petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Petitioner contends that, contrary to the IJ\u2019s finding, his testimony was credible and consistent with his asylum application and the country conditions in Haiti. The IJ should have found, he submits, that he was persecuted based on (1) threats made on his and his family\u2019s life and safety, (2) the destruction of his mother\u2019s \u201chome/business place,\u201d (3) the \u201csearch at his sister\u2019s houses followed by the shooting at his brother,\u201d and (4) his incarceration for 14 months as a political prisoner. In short, the IJ should have granted his application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision in this case, not the BIA\u2019s, because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, thereby making the IJ\u2019s decision the final agency determination. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(ii); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1. (11th Cir.2003). To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). We examine the IJ\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence test. <em>Id. </em>at 817-18. Under this highly deferential standard of review, we must defer to the IJ\u2019s findings if supported by substantial evidence, unless the evidence would \u201ccompel\u201d a reasonable factfinder to find otherwise. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Therefore, we will set aside a finding of fact \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal.... \u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-16\">Credibility determinations are findings of fact. We therefore review them, like other fact findings, under the substantial evidence test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818. We \u201cmay not substitute [our] judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>ment for that of the [IJ] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). In this context, it should be noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGJ\">[T]he IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. A credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1287 (citations and quotations omitted). The IJ\u2019s \u201cadverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application,\u201d so long as the IJ offers \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding\u201d and does not overlook other evidence produced by the asylum applicant. <em>Id. </em>As the Third Circuit has pointed out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">[a]n immigration judge alone is in a position to observe an alien\u2019s tone and demeanor, to explore inconsistencies in testimony, and to apply workable and consistent standards in the evaluation of testimonial evidence. He is, by virtue of his acquired skill, uniquely qualified to decide whether an alien\u2019s testimony has about it the ring of truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-6\"><em>Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 597 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Before addressing whether substantial evidence supports an adverse credibility determination, we first must determine whether the IJ even made an adverse credibility determination. <em>Yang v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). The IJ must make a \u201cclean determination[ ] of eredibility[,]\u201d or we will assume that such a determination was not dispositive. <em>Id. </em>An adverse credibility finding must go to the heart of the asylum claim and cannot be based on minor discrepancies, inconsistencies, or omissions. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002); <em>see also Pop v. INS, </em>270 F.3d 527, 531-32 (7th Cir.2001) (noting that the failure to fist in the asylum application every incident of persecution should not result in credibility challenges).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Any alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum, which the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant if the alien is a \u201crefugee\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A), as amended by the REAL ID Act, \u00a7 101(c); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. That statute defines a \u201crefugee\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-10\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or .unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant must carry the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status and thereby establishing asylum eligibility. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">\u201cTo establish asylum eligibility based on political opinion or any other protected ground, the alien must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of [his] political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u2019 that [his] political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b)). Absent corroborating evidence, the applicant\u2019s testimony, \u201cif credible, may be suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>cient to sustain the burden of proof.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the INA, the alien must show that it is more likely than not that, if he returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened because of one of the five covered grounds. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. To establish eligibility for withholding of removal under CAT, the alien seeking relief must show that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured in his home country by the government or through the acquiescence of the government. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004). Where an applicant fails to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, his other claims for withholding of removal under the INA or under CAT generally fail. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In this case, the IJ provided specific, cogent reasons for finding Petitioner not credible, listing several facets of his story that he found incredible. In addition, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence, for numerous omissions and inconsistencies regarding Petitioner\u2019s testimony were present in the record. These discrepancies went to the heart of Petitioner\u2019s claim that the Lavalas persecuted him based on his political opinion and tainted all of Petitioner\u2019s testimony. <em>See Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272. A reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to reach a finding different from the one the IJ reached. As noted above, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of asylum. We end this discussion by saying, once again, that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Petitioner\u2019s application for withholding of removal under the INA or for relief under the CAT fail because these forms of relief require impose on the alien a burden of proof that is more stringent than the burden of proof for asylum. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4. Because Petitioner failed to satisfy the burden of proof for asylum, he cannot do so for withholding of removal under the INA or relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-10\">. The REAL ID ACT OF 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 302 (2005), which addresses credibility determinations, is not implicated here because it applies to applications for asylum presented on or after May 11, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
