He was sentenced as a career offender to 276 months in prison. Velez now appeals his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Prior to committing the instant offense, Velez had been convicted of manslaughter and, in 1999, of three counts of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN). Velez was sentenced to three concurrent three-year terms for the 1999 convictions. His probation officer first determined that Velez had the requisite prior convictions to qualify him as a career offender, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (2008), and that Velez was entitled to a three-level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. Accordingly, the probation officer concluded that Velez\u2019s guideline range was 262-327 months in prison. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(e)(l), (c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Velez objected under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to his treatment as a career offender. The district court overruled his objection, adopted the Presentence Report, and imposed a 276-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">According to the sentencing guidelines, a defendant is a career offender if, inter alia, he has two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Velez concedes his convictions for manslaughter and ABHAN. He contends, however, that he should not have been sentenced as a career criminal because a conviction for ABHAN does not qualify as a crime of violence. Velez raised this claim below, and our review is de novo. <em>See United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">To determine whether a state-law offense falls within the sentencing guideline\u2019s definition of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we use the categorical approach, \u201cwhich takes into account only the definition of the offense and the fact of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>278 F.3d 282, 286 (4th Cir.2002). Under the sentencing guidelines, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is \u201cany offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that ... has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another....\u201d USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The sentencing guideline\u2019s application notes further explain that \u201c \u2018crime of violence\u2019 includes ... aggravated assault.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4B1.2 app.l. Under South Carolina law, \u201cABHAN is the unlawful act of violent injury to another accompanied by circumstances of aggravation\u201d and is \u201cpunishable by up to ten years in prison.\u201d <em>State v. Fennell, </em>340 S.C. 266, 531 S.E.2d 512, 516 (S.C.2000). Therefore, Velez\u2019s conviction for ABHAN meets the sentencing guideline\u2019s definition of a crime of violence because ABHAN is, by definition, aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">We accordingly affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
