We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-18\">O\u2019Briant contends her sentence was not reasonable. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and impose a sentence. If a court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). We review such a sentence for reasonableness. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-19\">Here, the district court\u2019s sentencing was appropriate under <em>Hughes. </em>Because O\u2019Briant\u2019s sentence was at the low end of the advisory guidelines range and below the statutory maximum <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> for the offense, we conclude her sentence was reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm O\u2019Briant\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-14\"> The statutory maximum for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 (2000) is thirty years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
