Rivera-Garda asserts that the sentencing provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in his case. This constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rivera-Garcia contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rivera-Garda candidly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, raising it here solely to preserve it for further review. We affirm Rivera-Garcia\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Rivera-Garda also insists that the district court committed reversible error when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory scheme United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) that was ultimately held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In sentencing Rivera-Garda under a mandatory guidelines regime, the district court committed error that we refer to as <em>Fanfan </em>error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). The government concedes that Rivera-Garda preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>claim for appellate review. To prevail, the government must prove that the <em>Fanfan </em>error in this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The government has not sustained this burden. <em>See id. </em>at 463-64. We are constrained to vacate Rivera-Garcia\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1013-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
