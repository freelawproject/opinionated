We have reviewed the record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find that reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s findings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A) (2000). Notably, the record reveals that Shivani admitted in a sworn statement that she applied for a U.S. passport by submitting a fraudulent Maryland birth certificate and that she worked as a seamstress for her local church at a rate of $5.00 per garment. We therefore uphold the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Shivani is removable on all charges and deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-18\"> Shivani does not challenge the immigration judge's finding that she is removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) (West Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>2005) as an alien who remained longer than permitted after admission as a nonimmigrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
