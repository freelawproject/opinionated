He argues on appeal that the evidence produced at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Williams properly preserved this issue for appeal. Viewing the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational trier of fact could have found that the Government proved all of the essential elements regarding this charge. <em>See United States v. Lankford, </em>196 F.3d 563, 575-76 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Williams also argues that the prosecutor made an improper remark during closing arguments. Because Williams did not object on this basis in district court, this argument is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Johnston, </em>127 F.3d 380, 392 (5th Cir.1997). Examination of the prosecutor\u2019s challenged argument does not indicate that it was improper. <em>See United States v. Binker, </em>795 F.2d 1218, 1223-24 (5th Cir.1986). Williams has therefore failed to show plain error regarding the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1012-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
