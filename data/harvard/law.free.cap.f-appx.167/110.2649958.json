(the \u201cCenter\u201d) under the supervision of Steve Howells. Armstrong testified in her deposition that Howells engaged in the following conduct: He subjected her to unwarranted criticism and was generally difficult to work with; he sometimes addressed her as \u201choney,\u201d \u201csweetheart\u201d and \u201cbaby\u201d; he occasionally touched her shoulders, caressed her back, gave her back rubs, hugged her, and asked her to smell his cologne; he told her sexually explicit and inappropriate stories on a business trip they took together; and he discussed his wife in a derogatory fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-19\">Despite her concerns, Armstrong did not tell Howells that his conduct made her uncomfortable, and she failed to mention his inappropriate touching, comments or stories in a written complaint, as required by the Center\u2019s harassment policy. At one point, she complained verbally to Gary Blumenthal, then Executive Director of the Center, that Howells was \u201cover the top\u201d and \u201ctoo touchy feely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-20\">Armstrong filed this action on February 17, 2004, alleging that the Center engaged in unlawful disability discrimination, gender discrimination and retaliation. On April 4, 2005, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal of all claims except Armstrong\u2019s claim that she was the victim of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-21\">The district court then granted summary judgment in favor of the Center on Armstrong\u2019s sexual harassment claim, holding: (1) Armstrong failed to properly plead a claim for sexual harassment; (2) even if she had properly pleaded a claim for sexual harassment, she failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding her sexual harassment claim; and (3) in any case, Armstrong failed to demonstrate that the Center was not entitled to the defense set forth in <em>Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998) and <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998). Armstrong appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-22\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>non-moving party. <em>Skrtich v. Thorton, </em>280 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">After a thorough review of the record, we affirm the grant of summary judgment for the reasons given in the district court\u2019s careful and well-reasoned opinion dated July 22, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
