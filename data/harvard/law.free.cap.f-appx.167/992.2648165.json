He raises three issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-28\">First, he argues that his prior burglary-of-a-habitation conviction is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d supporting the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). This argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>Second, Alvarez-Ontiveros argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Alvarez-Ontiveros\u2019 constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Alvarez-Ontiveros contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Alvarez-Ontiveros properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">Finally, Alvarez-Ontiveros argues that the district court reversibly erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines. The Government concedes that Alvarez-Ontiveros has preserved this issue for appeal. The Government has not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Alvarez-Ontiveros\u2019 sentence is vacated, and this case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1016-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
