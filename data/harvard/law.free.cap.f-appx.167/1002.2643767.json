California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Shackleford has filed a brief in response challenging the revocation decision, the effectiveness of his trial counsel, and the validity of his sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Shackleford also has filed a motion for the appointment of substitute counsel or, in the alternative, to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Our review of the brief filed by counsel, Shackleford\u2019s response, and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. We decline to address any claim of ineffecfive assistance of counsel, without prejudice to Shackleford\u2019s right to assert such claims in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987). Shackle-ford\u2019s motion for the appointment of substitute counsel, or in the alternative to proceed pro se, is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998). Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1027-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
