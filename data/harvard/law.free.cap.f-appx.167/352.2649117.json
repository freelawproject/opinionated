He contends on appeal that his sentence is unreasonable in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-22\">Bennett maintains that his sentence is unreasonable because his possession, while illegal, was harmless to the public. Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court \u201cmust consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court). The court should consider the sentencing range along with the other factors identified in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-23\">In sentencing Bennett, the district court considered the properly calculated guideline range and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Because the court sentenced Bennett with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>in the advisory guideline range and within the ten-year statutory maximum, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2), we conclude that Bennett\u2019s sentence is reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
