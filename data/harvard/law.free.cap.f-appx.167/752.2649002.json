We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">On September 30, 1995, Roos entered the United States on a 90-day non-immigrant visitor visa. On December 28, 1995, Roos married Evelyn McCrary in South Carolina. Roos was 23 years old; McCrary was 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">In February 1996, Roos filed an application to adjust his status to permanent resident on the basis of his marriage to McCrary, a U.S. citizen. McCrary submitted an affidavit of support and a petition for an alien relative. Shortly thereafter, Roos and McCrary began to experience marital discord. Roos and McCrary were separated in August 1996 and divorced in February 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Roos\u2019 adjustment of status to permanent resident was approved by INS on September 26, 1996. The grant of permanent resident status to an alien spouse is \u201con a conditional basis.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(a)(l). In order to remove the conditional basis, the alien and spouse must file a joint petition requesting removal and submit to an interview by immigration authorities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1186a(c)(l). The petition must be filed \u201cduring the 90-day period before the second anniversary of the alien\u2019s obtaining\u201d conditional permanent resident status. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1186a(d)(2)(A). Waiver of the joint petition requirement is permitted \u201cif the alien demonstrates that ... the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse, but the qualifying marriage has been terminated (other than through the death of the spouse) and the alien was not at fault in failing to meet the\u201d joint petition and interview requirements. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1186a(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Roos filed a petition to remove the conditions on his permanent resident status in March 1999. He indicated that he was unable to file a joint petition and requested a waiver from that requirement because he entered the marriage in good faith, but the marriage was terminated. INS ultimately denied Roos\u2019 petition, citing a lack of evidence produced by Roos to prove that his marriage to McCrary was legitimate, the disparity between his and McCrary\u2019s ages, and their never having shared a common address.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">In December 2000, INS issued Roos a Notice to Appear charging him with removability based on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(D)\u00ae. That provision states that \u201c[a]ny alien with permanent resident status on a conditional basis under section 1186a of this title ... who has had such status terminated under such respective section is deportable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At the initial removal hearing on February 5, 2003, Roos, appearing <em>pro se, </em>admitted the factual allegations of the Notice to Appear. The IJ found that he was removable because of the termination of his conditional permanent resident status. The IJ instructed Roos as follows: \u201cAt the hearing it will be your responsibility to present evidence to demonstrate that your failed marriage was nevertheless entered into in good faith and was not designed in substantial part to provide you a way of evading U.S. immigration law. In other words, it wasn\u2019t a sham marriage for immigration purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">After all of the testimony, the IJ found that Roos had failed to meet his burden, denied his application for a waiver, and ordered him removed. The BIA affirmed without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">As a threshold matter, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider Roos\u2019 appeal. <em>See Farquharson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number><em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2001). We review this Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">In his opening brief, Roos states the issue on appeal as follows: \u201cWhether the [BIA] erred in summarily affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of [his] ... Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence ... and terminating his status as a lawful permanent resident where [he] was erroneously made to carry the burden of proof in review of his petition before the Immigration Judge.... \u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 1. The Attorney General raised a jurisdictional challenge to Roos\u2019 appeal based on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) deprives this Court of jurisdiction to review a \u201cdecision or action of the Attorney General ... the authority for which is specified under [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151-1378] to be in the discretion of the Attorney General....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>see also Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>426 F.3d 1330, 1334 (11th Cir.2005). The decision to waive the joint petition requirement and remove the conditional basis of an alien\u2019s permanent resident status is vested in the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(c)(4) (\u201cThe Attorney General, <em>in the Attorney General\u2019s discretion, </em>may remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status for an alien who fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)____\u201d) (emphasis added). There is a circuit split as to whether the jurisdictional bar of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) also precludes review of the threshold determination that the marriage was \u201centered into in good faith by the alien spouse.\u201d <em>Compare Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004) <em>and Urena-Tavarez v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 154, 157-61 (3rd Cir.2004) <em>with Oropeza-Wong v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1135, 1141-43 (9th Cir.2005) <em>and Cho v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 96, 98-102 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">We need not reach that issue, however, because in response to the Attorney General\u2019s jurisdictional argument, Roos made clear that he \u201cis not seeking a review of a substantive issue (that the denial was based on the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding that Mr. Roos\u2019 marriage was not bona fide) that is within the discretion of the Attorney General but rather a legal issue (whether the burden of proof was incorrectly placed upon Mr. Roos).\u201d Reply Brief at 5. Section 1252(a)(2)(D) gives us jurisdiction to review that legal issue.' 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (\u201cNothing in [\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) or (C) ] ... shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review....\u201d) (as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 106(a)(l)(A)(iii), 119 Stat. 302, 310 (2005));<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>see also Balogun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1359-60 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">Because the BIA affirmed without opinion and adopted the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the IJ\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">Roos argues that the Attorney General should have been required to prove that his marriage to McCrary was a sham. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(b)(2) <em>{\u201cthe burden of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number><em>proof shall he on the Attorney General </em>to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence ... \u201d) (emphasis added). That argument is unavailing because the provisions of \u00a7 1186a(b) apply only where the Attorney General takes independent action to terminate an alien\u2019s status. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1186a(b)(l); <em>see, e.g., Smolniakova v. Gonzales, </em>422 F.3d 1037, 1043 (9th Cir.2005) (noting that \u201cINS revoked Smolniakova\u2019s conditional resident status pursuant to ... 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(b), based on a finding \u2014 the culmination of an investigation precipitated by an anonymous tip\u2014 that her marriage ... was a sham\u201d and reversing because the IJ placed the burden of proof on the alien). That did not happen in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Roos filed a petition to remove the conditional basis of his permanent resident status and thereby sought a waiver of the joint petition requirement. He again sought a waiver in the removal proceedings. The provisions of \u00a7 1186a(c) apply to that situation. Section 1186a(c)(4) clearly places the burden on the alien: \u201cThe Attorney General, in the Attorney General\u2019s discretion, may remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status for an alien who fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) <em>if the alien demonstrates ... </em>the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse----\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(c)(4)(B) (emphasis added). As indicated by the IJ\u2019s instruction to Roos at the removal hearing, quoted in full above, the IJ properly allocated the burdens of proof in accordance with \u00a7 1186a(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-8\">. The changes made by \u00a7 106 of the REAL ID Act are applicable to all orders of removal \"issued before, on, or after the date of enactment.\u201d Real ID Act \u00a7 106(b), 119 Stat. at 311.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
