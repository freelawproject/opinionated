He was sentenced following the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court sentenced Green to seventy-two months of imprisonment relying on <em>Booker, </em>and our decision in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). Green appeals, alleging he was improperly sentenced under <em>Booker. </em>For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">Green contends that his due process rights, as informed by ex post facto principles, were violated by the imposition of a sentence under the Supreme Court\u2019s remedial decision in <em>Booker </em>(referring to the Court\u2019s opinion expressed through Justice Breyer making the Federal Sentencing Guidelines advisory rather than mandatory) rather than under the mandatory Guidelines applicable at the time of his offense. We find that this claim is without merit. <em>See United States v. Dupas, </em>419 F.3d 916, 919-21 (9th Cir.2005) (rejecting ex post facto claim) <em>United States v. Jamison, </em>416 F.3d 538, 539-40 (7th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Lata, </em>415 F.3d 107, 110-11 (1st Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 575-77 (5th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1306-08 (11th Cir.) (same), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005). Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
