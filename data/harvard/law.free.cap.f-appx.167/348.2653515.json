We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2005); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Yanez-Popp v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1993). A denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor motions to reopen. <em>M.A v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-23\">Theodore raises several issues in his brief, none of which have merit. We note the Board did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen as untimely. Moreover, even assuming we have authority to reach Theodore\u2019s equitable tolling arguments and that they are not waived, he has not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances beyond his control. Thus, there is no reason for declining to enforce the ninety-day period to file motions to reopen. We are without authority to review the Board\u2019s decision not to sua sponte <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>reopen the case. <em>Belay-Gebru v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 998,1000-01 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
