He argues that the district court erred in imposing a sentence pursuant to the mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines, which were invalidated in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He argues that this error is structural and not subject to harmless-error analysis. We have rejected the argument that this error is structural. <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-27\">The Government concedes that Hernandez-Arredondo\u2019s objection pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number><em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2581, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), was sufficient to preserve this argument for appeal. Therefore, we review his sentence for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Under that standard, the sentence will be vacated and remanded unless the Government proves beyond a.reasonable doubt that the error was harmless \u2014 i.e., that it did not affect the sentence Hernandez-Arredondo received. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-65 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">The Government argues that the error was harmless because the district court considered the Guidelines, the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d). The Government also argues that the 57-month sentence was reasonable in light of the section 3553(a) factors and was well below the 20-year statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">The Government\u2019s contentions are insufficient to satisfy its burden of demonstrating that the district court, operating under an advisory Guidelines scheme, would have imposed the same sentence. The Government\u2019s assertions, without more, shed no light on how the district court would have acted had it known that the Guidelines were merely advisory. Accordingly, Hernandez-Arredondo\u2019s sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">Hernandez-Arredondo also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional. His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Hernandez-Arredondo contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Hernandez-Arredondo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, HernandezArredondo\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1022-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
