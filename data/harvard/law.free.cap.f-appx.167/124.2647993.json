Cardenas-Aguilar argues that the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider was contrary to law. He contends that the BIA\u2019s previous determination of removability relied on incorrect caselaw and ignored precedent. The government argues that this court does not have jurisdiction to hear Cardenas-Aguilar\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-15\">We review our subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Ortega v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>416 F.3d 1348, 1350 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">A petition for review must be filed within \u201c30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13,119 Stat. 231 (2005). A motion to reconsider does not toll this 30-day period. <em>See Stone v. INS., </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (holding that the statutory time limit for filing a direct petition for review in an immigration case is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d and not subject to tolling).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-17\">Cardenas-Aguilar\u2019s petition for review is timely only as to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider, and not the BIA\u2019s order dismissing his appeal and agreeing with the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) determination of removability. His arguments on appeal mirror his arguments in his original brief before the BIA. As such, his arguments attacking the IJ\u2019s original removal determination are not properly before us, and we dismiss his petition in this regard. Nevertheless, we have jurisdiction to consider whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Cardenas-Aguilar\u2019s motion to reconsider because the petition for review is timely as to that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-19\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Our review of the denial of discretionary relief in deportation proceedings is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation omitted). When the BIA has properly affirmed an IJ\u2019s order, denial of an alien\u2019s motion for reconsideration is also appropriate. <em>Assa\u2018ad, </em>332 F.3d at 1340-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u201cThe decision to grant or deny a motion to ... reconsider is within the discretion of the Board....\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Motions to reconsider are disfavored in removal proceedings. <em>See INS. v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323,112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (discussing motions to reopen and explaining that such motions are disfavored because \u201cas a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States\u201d). A motion to reconsider \u201cshall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(5)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(5)(C); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In this case, we conclude from the record that the BIA correctly found that Cardenas-Aguilar\u2019s motion to reconsider failed to specify any error of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s prior decision, and merely reiterated arguments of his direct appeal. In his motion for reconsideration, Cardenas-Aguilar explicitly asked the BIA to reconsider the arguments he made in his original brief. He never mentioned any specific error of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s previous order. While he argued that the cases the BIA cited were distinguishable from his case, he did not argue that the BIA applied the wrong law, but simply asserted that he did not agree with the BIA\u2019s application of the law. The BIA\u2019s order affirming the IJ\u2019s removal order is also not contrary to law because Cardenas-Aguilar was found removable for a firearm conviction, a finding which he did not challenge, and his simple assault conviction constituted a crime of violence, and thus an aggravated felony, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Since Cardenas-Aguilar did not comply with the reconsideration procedure, the BIA\u2019s exercise of discretion in denying Cardenas-Aguilar\u2019s motion to reconsider was not arbitrary or capricious or otherwise an abuse. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
