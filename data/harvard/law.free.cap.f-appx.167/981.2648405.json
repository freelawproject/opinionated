Gonzalez-Ribera argues that the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He argues that the district court\u2019s sentencing error was structural and so prejudice should be presumed. We have explicitly rejected the argument that such an error is a \u201cstructural\u201d one for which prejudice should be presumed. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Alternatively, Gonzalez-Ribera argues that the Government cannot show beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence if the Sentencing Guidelines had been advisory. Because Gonzalez-Ribera preserved his \u201cFanfan\u201d challenge in the district court by raising an objection based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), we review for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). The imposition of GonzalezRibera\u2019s sentence under the then-mandatory guideline sentencing regime constitutes error, and the Government thus bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced Gonzalez-Ribera differently under an advisory guideline sentencing regime. <em>See id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">The district court\u2019s comments at sentencing, read as a whole, do not establish the Government\u2019s burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced GonzalezRibera differently under an advisory guideline sentencing regime. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Gonzalez-Ribera\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case remanded to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">Gonzalez-Ribera also argues that the statutory maximum sentence in his case was two years because he pleaded guilty to simple illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and not the twenty-year maximum sentence contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-14\">The Supreme Court has not overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and this court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201c \u2018unless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). Thus, as Gonzalez-Rib-era concedes, his argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-15\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1006-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
