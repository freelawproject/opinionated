Reyes-Bautista argues that the sentencing provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. Reyes-Bautista\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Reyes-Bautista contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). ReyesBautista properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">Reyes-Bautista next argues that the district court erred by characterizing, for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), his state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d Reyes-Bautista\u2019s argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 694 (5th Cir.1997). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943), does not affect this precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-16\">Finally, Reyes-Bautista argues that the district court committed reversible error when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines scheme held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). By sentencing Reyes-Bautista under a mandatory guidelines regime, the district court committed what this court refers to as Fanfan error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). The Government concedes that Reyes-Bautista preserved his Fanfan claim for appellate review. The Government has not sustained its burden of demonstrating that the district court\u2019s Fanfan error was harmless. <em>See id. </em>at 463-64. We therefore we VACATE Reyes-Bautista\u2019s sentence and REMAND the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-17\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1021-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
