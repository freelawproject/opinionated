She claims her sentence should be vacated because the district court: (1) erroneously failed to consider the 12-18 month imprisonment range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines and failed to inquire why her probation officer requested a longer sentence; (2) erroneously failed to take into account other sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and (3) erroneously imposed a sentence based solely on her new offenses, in violation of a policy statement in Chapter Seven of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">BACKGROUND \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b806-16\">. In 2000, Knight pled guilty to conspiracy to commit access device fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1029(a)(5) and (b)(2). The district court sentenced her to three years probation and $37,500.00 restitution. The conditions of her probation included duties to pay the imposed restitution, to provide her probation officer complete access to her financial information, and not to commit another crime. Six months before Knight\u2019s probation was to end, she was charged with violating her probation by failing to satisfy her court-ordered restitution and by committing grand theft and by committing identity theft of two individuals, one of them an elderly disabled woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">After an evidentiary hearing, a magistrate judge found that Knight was guilty of all charges except that of grand theft. The district court ultimately agreed with the magistrate\u2019s findings and revoked Knight\u2019s probation. At sentencing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>district court noted that the probation officer \u201cas we all know, is recommending four years incarceration, and the Guidelines are much lower than that. The Guidelines are four to ten months.\u201d After considering arguments from both sides, the court sentenced Knight to the four years recommended by the probation officer, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">I have to say that I am not usually exposed to conduct which is this callous. As long as I have sat here as a judge, this kind of ... callous behavior is just not something that is a typical occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">You were on probation. Judge Ferguson gave you a break. But still probation has its punitive aspects to it. I don\u2019t quite understand why you wouldn\u2019t have gotten the message. He did order you to pay restitution. It was substantial restitution. That meant you had to get together with the probation officer, you had to work out some kind of payment arrangement. I mean, there were plenty of opportunities to get the message. I don\u2019t know what we have to do to you, Ms. Knight, to get the message through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">There were lots and lots of opportunities to get the message. So I\u2019m not too impressed with the argument that, well, he only put me on probation, so I didn\u2019t get the message.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">And then to make \u2014 and your behavior during probation ... was completely unacceptable. To not meet with the probation officer, to not keep your appointments, to not be responsive to their request for restitution ... all those things just indicate to me that you just thought you could get away with whatever you wanted to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">And then you get toward the end of your probation and you steal the identity of a half-blind elderly woman. I mean, that\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s amazing Ms. Knight. And, so, I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s really even much to talk about here....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-11\">[Y]ou have really offended society by what you have done. So, I am revoking your probation and I am sentencing you to 48 months....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-12\">[N]ow to pronounce sentence more formally.... The Court has carefully considered the statement of the parties and the information contained in the violation report. The Court finds the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of her probation and hereby revokes the period of probation. The Court has determined that a sentence within the Guideline range does not adequately address your total disregard for your probation and the serious nature of the new offense conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFK\">Knight\u2019s one objection to the court\u2019s judgment was that she \u201cwould like to preserve the record and object that it\u2019s above the Guideline sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">\n<em>Consideration of Guideline Recommendations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">We look first at Knight\u2019s claim that the district court failed to consider the Guidelines\u2019 recommendation for her recent offenses and failed to inquire as to the probation officer\u2019s reasons for recommending a harsher sentence. This claim, like the one to follow, ultimately derives from \u00a7 3553(a), which calls for courts that have found a probation violation to consider the imprisonment range corresponding to that violation. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). We consider it separately from Knight\u2019s other \u00a7 3553(a) claims, however, because her timely objection in the district court allows us to review for an abuse of discretion, rather than under the plain error standard by which we must evaluate her other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>claims. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cWhere a defendant fails to clearly state the grounds for an objection in the district court, [she] waives the objection on appeal and we are limited to reviewing for plain error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The applicable Guideline range in this case, where Knight committed a Grade B violation of her probation and had an original criminal history category of I, was four to ten months imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2), 7B1.4(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the ranges <em>recommended </em>by the Guidelines are only advisory, we have held that a district court fulfills its statutory obligation when it evinces \u201csome indication that [it] was aware of and considered them.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). The court\u2019s substantial explanation of its sentence, excerpted in large part above, shows that it was keenly aware of the Guidelines and of the need to address how the Guidelines related (or in this case, did not relate) to Knight\u2019s sentence. The court explicitly considered the Guideline range, referring to it twice, and explained at some length the reasons for an upward departure. The district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to consider the Guideline recommendations because, quite simply, it considered those recommendations thoroughly and appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">\n<em>Consideration of Other \u00a7 3553(a) Sentencing Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">When a defendant violates a term of probation, a district court may revoke the probation and impose a new sentence \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2). They are: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, (2) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment, and to deter criminal conduct, and (3) the sentencing range established in the applicable Guidelines or policy statements. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Knight claims these factors were ignored by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Athough we do not expect a district court to recite each of these factors in its sentencing decision, <em>see United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005), the court in Knight\u2019s case very nearly did so. We have already discussed the court\u2019s explanation of its sentence in relation to the Guidelines\u2019 recommendations. In enumerating Knight\u2019s unmet responsibilities toward her probation officer, as well as her \u201camazing\u201d and \u201ccallous\u201d theft of \u201ca half-blind elderly womanf\u2019s]\u201d identity, the court considered the nature and circumstances of Knight\u2019s violation of her probation and its conditions, the serious of the offense, and the court\u2019s own need to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment. The court did not commit plain error in failing to consider the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a) because it considered practically all of them and was under no obligation to explicitly consider each one.</p>\n<p id=\"ALZ\">\n<em>Consideration of Underlying Violation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">Knight argues that the district court based its sentence purely on the offenses that triggered revocation of her probation and, in so doing, disregarded the Federal Sentencing Commission\u2019s poli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>cy statement that courts \u201cshould sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of [probation], while taking into account, to a limited degree, the seriousness of the underlying violation.\u201d Introduction to Chapter 7, Part A 3(b). Although it is true that the district court was appalled by Knight\u2019s most recent crimes, it very clearly understood them as failures to comply with the spirit and terms of her probation. The court\u2019s consistent refrain about Knight\u2019s failure to \u201cget the message\u201d of her original probation, and the explicit relationship between its sentencing determination and that failure, demonstrates the court\u2019s intention to punish Knight for her failure to comply with her original sentence. For these reasons we discern no plain error in the relative weights the court gave to Knight\u2019s breach of probation and the offenses underlying that breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(c)(l)(A)(ii), the maximum term of imprisonment for Knight's conduct that constituted the violation of her probation (identity theft) was 15 years. As such, her probation violation resulted in a grade B violation, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.1 (a)(2) (classifying as grade B violations conduct constituting a violation of \"any other federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
