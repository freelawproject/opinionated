Thamsir, who states he is Christian and of Chinese ethnicity, alleges that he and his family were attacked and beaten at their home in Indonesia by Muslims for being Christian.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-23\">On appeal, Thamsir argues that the IJ\u2019s credibility findings were based on speculation and conjecture instead of a rational foundation, and that his testimony should be deemed credible. Thamsir argues that he testified specifically about the problems he encountered in Indonesia based on his religion and ethnicity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). We cannot engage in fact-finding, nor may we weigh evidence that was not previously considered below. <em>Id. </em>at 1278. Therefore, a finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal.... \u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The IJ makes credibility determinations for withholding of removal claims in the same manner as asylum claims. INA \u00a7 241(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(c). \u201cThe testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). Indications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishment as the applicant repeatedly recounts his story. <em>See In re B-, </em>21 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 66, 70 (BIA 1995). The weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence. <em>In re Y-B- </em>21 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 1136, 1139 (BIA 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Like other factual findings, credibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and the IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y General, </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-1287 (11th Cir.2005). Generally, minor inconsistencies and minor admissions that \u201creveal nothing about an asylum applicant\u2019s fear for his safety are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Vilorio-Lopez v. INS, </em>852 F.2d 1137, 1142 (9th Cir.1988). The discrepancies must involve the \u201cheart of the asylum claim.\u201d <em>Ceballos-Castillo v. INS, </em>904 F.2d 519, 520 (9th Cir.1990); <em>see also Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3rd Cir.2002) (holding that an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding must go to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claims and cannot be based upon minor inconsistencies, discrepancies, or omissions). Even a single inconsistency that goes to the heart of an applicant\u2019s asylum claim, however, such as the basis of his fear, may be sufficient to support an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>cant bears the burden of showing that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d or was not based on substantial evidence, and, like any fact finding, a credibility determination may not be overturned unless the record compels it. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotation omitted). \u201cIf the applicant produces no other evidence other than his testimony, an adverse credibility determination is alone sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if he can show that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y General, </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The alien bears the burden of demonstrating that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question. <em>Fahim, </em>278 F.3d at 1218. This is a more stringent burden than for asylum. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. If the alien establishes past persecution based on a protected ground, there is a rebuttable presumption that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to his country. <em>See Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i). An alien who has not shown past persecution, however, may still be entitled to withholding of removal if he can demonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Although the INA does not expressly define \u201cpersecution\u201d for purposes of qualifying as a \u201crefugee,\u201d <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), we have stated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted). Menacing telephone calls and threats do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Upon review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error with respect to the IJ\u2019s credibility findings or determination that Thamsir did not suffer past persecution or face a threat of future persecution if returned to Indonesia. Although the IJ did not find that Thamsir lacked credibility <em>per se, </em>the IJ assessed that several parts of his testimony, including the attack at his home in Indonesia, were not credible. This finding is supported by substantial evidence. Although the attack allegedly occurred shortly before Thamsir obtained his visa, Thamsir did not testify that he mentioned the attack or requested asylum or refugee status when applying for a visa or after he arrived in the United States. Thamsir did not mention the attack in his interview with immigration Agent Tracy Townsend either. Agent Townsend\u2019s report did reveal, however, that Thamsir stated that he only desired to remain in the United States for economic reasons and drove to Washington to file a political asylum application at the urging of his pastor Mesach Agung Wijoyo. While Thamsir disputed parts of Agent Townsend\u2019s report at the asylum hearing, he did not challenge the admissibility of the report then or on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">The record also reveals that Thamsir\u2019s mother visited him in the United States at least once and returned voluntarily to Indonesia. Agent\u2019s Townsend\u2019s report states that Thamsir\u2019s parents were alive and well in Indonesia. Because Thamsir did not claim that the Muslim attackers only targeted him, it was reasonable for the IJ assume that Thamsir could also live safely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>in Indonesia if his parents could. The record also indicated that Thamsir registered at the immigration office with over 30 other Indonesian males who were associated with pastor Wijoyo. The IJ noted throughout the proceedings that Thamsir\u2019s allegations were similar to those raised in the asylum petitions by those Indonesians, warned Thamsir about filing a frivolous application, and asked for documentary evidence to support his claims. Thamsir, however, could not rehabilitate his testimony by providing documentation of his hospital visit to prove the injuries he received from the alleged beating.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The totality of the evidence discussed above provides substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s finding that Thamsir\u2019s testimony regarding the 2000 attack \u2014 his primary evidence of past persecution \u2014 was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The only remaining evidence of past persecution was Thamsir\u2019s testimony that he was required to pay more for government documents because he was not a Muslim, and that it takes Christians longer to obtain permits to build churches. Thamsir admitted that he had no documentary evidence to support the former claim. Furthermore, neither of these incidents, even if true, would rise to the level of persecution. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Because neither of these incidents constitute persecution and the IJ discredited Thamsir\u2019s testimony regarding the 2000 attack, the finding that Thamsir did not suffer past persecution is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The IJ\u2019s finding that Thamsir did not establish that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted upon return to Indonesia is supported by substantial evidence. Although Thamsir testified that he and his parents were attacked at his home once in 2000, he admitted that his mother has visited him in the United States and voluntarily returned to Indonesia. Agent Townsend\u2019s report states that Thamsir\u2019s parents were \u201calive and well\u201d in Indonesia. If his family is Christian and Chinese, it is unclear why his parents would be safe in Indonesia but he would not. Thamsir did not t\u00e9stify that he or his family had received any threats or experienced any discrimination based on their race or religion since he came to the United States. Thus, the IJ\u2019s finding that Thamsir would not be persecuted based on his race or religion if returned to Indonesia is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-13\">. Thamsir concedes on appeal that the denial of his asylum claim as untimely was not subject to review, and states that he is \"only appealing the IJ's and Board's denial of his withholding of removal claim.\u201d Because Thamsir does not offer any argument challenging the determination that his asylum application was untimely, the issue is abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Even if the issue was not abandoned, we do not have jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s decision denying a request for asylum as untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). <em>Fahim v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"AL2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Thamsir also does not raise any argument on appeal addressing the denial of relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\"CAT relief\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). <em>(See </em>Blue Brief). Therefore, he has also abandoned that issue. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-10\">.
