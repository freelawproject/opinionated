After review, we vacate the defendant\u2019s sentences and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>remand for the limited purpose of complying with this Court\u2019s original mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">On October 18, 2004, this Court affirmed Alvarez\u2019s convictions, but vacated his concurrent 121-month sentences because the district court mistakenly assigned the defendant a base offense level of 32 instead of 30. <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>124 Fed.Appx. 640 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished). In so doing, this Court specifically rejected the defendant\u2019s assertion that the district court clearly erred in refusing to apply the safety valve provision in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>Id. </em>at *2 n. .1 (\u201cWe also conclude that the district court correctly determined that Alvarez\u2019s failure to provide a complete and truthful account of his role in the offenses of conviction precluded relief under \u00a7 5C1.2.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">However, this Court noted that \u201cAlvarez still faces a mandatory-minimum sentence of 120 months for each of his offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *2-3. Consequently, this Court \u201cvacate[d] Alvarez\u2019s concurrent 121-month sentences and remand[ed] this case to the district court so that it may sentence Alvarez to concurrent 120-month sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3. The mandate from this Court was clear in that the district court\u2019s sole responsibility upon remand was to impose concurrent 120-month sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">At resentencing, the district court noted that the case was remanded for it to impose concurrent 120-month sentences, and that this Court\u2019s remand was \u201cpretty specific as to its intent.\u201d Despite its recognition of this Court\u2019s specific remand, the district court revisited its earlier decision that Alvarez was not entitled to a safety-valve reduction under \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The district court then concluded that Alvarez was entitled to the safety-valve reduction and sentenced the defendant to concurrent 48-month sentences. The government appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, both district courts and appellate courts generally are bound by a prior appellate decision in the same case. <em>Alphamed, Inc. v. B. Braun Med., Inc., </em>367 F.3d 1280, 1285-86 (11th Cir.2004). The doctrine operates to preclude courts from revisiting issues that were decided explicitly or by necessary implication in a prior appeal. <em>Luckey v. Miller, </em>929 F.2d 618, 621 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">\u201cThe mandate rule is simply an application of the law of the case doctrine to a specific set of facts.\u201d <em>Litman v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>825 F.2d 1506, 1511 (11th Cir.1987) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted). \u201cIf the appeals court issues a specific mandate, the district court must obey: the mandate is not subject to interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Mesa, </em>247 F.3d 1165, 1170 (11th Cir.2001). That is, \u201c[a] trial court, upon receiving the mandate of an appellate court, may not alter, amend, or examine the mandate, or give any further relief or review, but must enter an order in strict compliance with the mandate.\u201d <em>Piambino v. Bailey, </em>757 F.2d 1112, 1119 (11th Cir.1985) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">As the district court initially recognized, this Court\u2019s remand was for the limited purpose of imposing concurrent 120-month sentences. The district court obviously violated that mandate when it revisited the defendant\u2019s eligibility for the safety-valve reduction despite this Court\u2019s explicit ruling on the matter. As such, we once again remand this case for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to impose concurrent 120-month sentences.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-18\">. The law-of-the-case doctrine bars reconsideration of an issue we have previously decided unless: (1) there exists new evidence that is substantially different; (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues; or (3) the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice. <em>United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1561 (11th Cir.1997). None of the exceptions to the law-of-the-case doctrine is applicable here. Although <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was decided after Alvarez\u2019s direct appeal, district courts are also still bound by statutory minimum sentences. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005). Because <em>Booker </em>did not alter the requirement to impose statutory minimum sentences, <em>Booker </em>did not affect our prior decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
