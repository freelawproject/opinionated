It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">An applicant has the burden of demonstrating his eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2005); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). Credibility findings, relevant to the subjective component, are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer specific, cogent reasons for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). We accord broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show a clear probability that, if he was removed to his native country, his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d on a protected ground. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (2000); <em>see Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 370 (4th Cir.2004). A \u201cclear probability\u201d means it is more likely than not the alien would be subject to persecution. <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). \u201cThe burden of proof is on the applicant for withholding of removal ... to establish that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal\u201d on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2005). A showing of past threat to life or freedom on such a ground creates a rebuttable presumption that the threat would recur upon removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(I); <em>Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 370. Withholding of removal is mandatory if the alien meets the standard of proof. <em>Stevie, </em>467 U.S. at 429-30,104 S.Ct. 2489.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). We will reverse the Board \u201conly if \u2018the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). We find the immigration judge\u2019s negative credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. We further find the evidence was not so compelling as to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b975-29\"> Ngalla does not challenge the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
