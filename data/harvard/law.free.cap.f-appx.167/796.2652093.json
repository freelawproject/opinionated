Because we accept both of the government\u2019s arguments, we do not address the substantive issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Federal courts have an \u201cobligation to look behind the label of a motion filed by a <em>pro se </em>inmate and determine whether the motion is, in effect, cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990). Doing so may allow a court to avoid an unnecessary dismissal or inappropriately stringent application of formal labeling requirements, or to create a better correspondence between the substance of the motion and its underlying legal basis. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 381-82, 124 S.Ct. 786, 791-92, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). When a district court recharacterizes a <em>pro se </em>motion as an initial \u00a7 2255 motion, it must notify the movant of the intended recharacterization, advise him of the consequences of such recharacterization, and provide an opportunity for the motion to be withdrawn or amended. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 124 S.Ct. at 792. If the district court fails to do so, the motion cannot be considered as an initial \u00a7 2255 motion for purposes of determining whether a subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion is second or successive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">A COA must be issued in order for an applicant to appeal a final order in a proceeding under \u00a7 2255. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1). \u201cIf an applicant files a notice of appeal, the district judge who rendered the judgment must either issue a certificate of appealability or state why a certificate should not issue.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1). We require district courts to treat a notice of appeal of a \u00a7 2255 motion as an application for a COA, and we also require the district court to rule upon an application for a COA before we will consider such a request. <em>Edwards v. United States, </em>114 F.3d 1083, 1084 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">Because the district court denied Walker\u2019s motion without explaining the source of its jurisdiction or the basis on which it made its decision, we do not know whether the district court construed Walker\u2019s motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion or whether it denied the motion on the basis of some other authority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings. On remand, the district court should either state that it is construing Walker\u2019s motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion, give Walker the <em>Castro </em>warnings, and construe any subsequent notice of appeal as an application for a COA, or, if it chooses not to proceed under \u00a7 2255, either (1) explain the basis for its jurisdiction, or (2) dismiss Walker\u2019s motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\">. The district court\u2019s order merely stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-9\">\u201cThe Motion to Correct Unlawful Sentence filed by the defendant, Samuel Walker on January 8, 2005 is DENIED. The court reiterates that it is of the opinion that the sentence is too harsh. However, the court has no authority to reduce it.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
