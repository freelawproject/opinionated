He asserts he is entitled to resentencing because the district court applied enhancements under the Sentencing Guidelines based upon facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>not found by the jury, charged in the indictment, or admitted by him, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He also asserts the district court erred under <em>Booker </em>by applying the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion. We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Because Kerns raised an objection pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), in the district court, we review his sentence de novo and reverse only if any error was harmful. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). We have explained there are two types of error under <em>Booker: </em>(1) Sixth Amendment error based upon imposing sentencing enhancements in a mandatory Guidelines system which were neither admitted by the defendant nor submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) statutory error based upon sentencing under a mandatory Guidelines system. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Sixth Amendment error under <em>Booker </em>is disregarded only if harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThis standard is only met where it is clear \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration and citation omitted). The government bears the burden of showing the sentence did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>Where we do not know what the district court would have done under an advisory Guidelines scheme, the government cannot meet its burden to show it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271-72 (11th Cir.2005). Preserved statutory error under <em>Booker </em>is subject to a \u201cless demanding\u201d standard than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard applicable to Sixth Amendment errors under <em>Booker. United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">Here, the Government concedes the district court committed error under <em>Booker, </em>and the error was not harmless. We agree. Because the district court used extra-verdict enhancements to increase Kerns\u2019 sentencing range in a mandatory Guidelines system, the district court committed Sixth Amendment error under <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329-30. Because the district court sentenced Kerns pursuant to a mandatory Guidelines scheme, statutory error has also been established. <em>See id. </em>at 1330-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">Though the district court stated \u201ca sentence at the low end of the [Gjuideline range will be sufficient to deter future criminal conduct and would provide sufficient punishment in this case,\u201d that statement is insufficient to show the Sixth Amendment error was harmless because it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the court would not have found another sentence to be more appropriate under an advisory scheme. Accordingly, the Government cannot meet its burden to show it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt the Sixth Amendment error complained of did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>not contribute to the sentence obtained. <em>See Davis, 407 </em>F.3d at 1271-72. Because there was Sixth Amendment error that was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we need not consider whether the statutory error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">We vacate Kerns\u2019 sentence and remand the case for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. </em>We note the district court correctly calculated Kerns\u2019 Guidelines range of 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005) (stating after <em>Booker, </em>district courts must consult the Guidelines and \u201c[t]his consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines\u201d). Thus, on remand the district court is required to sentence Kerns according to <em>Booker, </em>considering the Guidelines advisory range of 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, see [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp. 2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\">. In committing Sixth Amendment error in this case, the district court applied: (1) a 2-level increase for 10 or more victims under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(K); (2) a 2-level increase for sophisticated means under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A)(i); (3) a 4-level increase for substantially endangering the solvency of a publicly traded company, under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(12)(B)(ii)(I); and (4) a 2-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 30.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\">. We do not mean to suggest by our holding that the district court must impose any particular sentence on remand. Rather, we merely hold the Government did not meet its burden of showing the Sixth Amendment and statutory error under <em>Booker </em>was harmless. We also do not attempt to decide now whether a particular sentence might be reasonable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
