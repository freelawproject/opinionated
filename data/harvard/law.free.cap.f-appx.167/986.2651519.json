Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), the district court imposed a 16-level enhancement on the basis that Hernandez had been deported following a felony conviction for a crime of violence. Hernandez objected to the enhancement, asserting that it violated his Sixth Amendment rights in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court overruled the objection but granted a downward departure after concluding that Hernandez\u2019s criminal history category was over-represented. The district court sentenced Hernandez to 70 months in prison, below the pre-departure range of 77 to 96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Hernandez appeals, arguing that his sentence should be vacated in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which extended <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>Sixth Amendment rule to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. He also asserts that the enhanced penalty provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">With respect to Hernandez\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument, there was no Sixth Amendment violation because the only enhancement of his sentence was based on a prior conviction. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Nevertheless, the application of the Guidelines as mandatory was error, which we have termed \u201cFanfan\u201d error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005) (discussing the distinction between the two types of error addressed in <em>Booker). </em>This court reviews a preserved \u201cFanfan\u201d error for harmless error. <em>See id. </em>We reject Hernandez\u2019s argument that such error is structural and not amenable to harmless error analysis. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">Under the harmless error standard, \u201c[t]he government must bear the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmless by demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the federal constitutional error of which a defendant complains did not contribute to the sentence that he received.\u201d <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 463. This burden has been described as \u201carduous,\u201d requiring the Government to show \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 285, 287 (5th Cir.2005). We decline the Government\u2019s invitation to apply a different standard. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">In seeking to satisfy its burden, the Government first points to the district court\u2019s downward departure. However, although a court has \u201cvirtually complete\u201d discretion in deciding the extent of a departure, <em>see United States v. Alvarez, </em>51 F.3d 36, 41 (5th Cir.1995), the exercise of that discretion does not necessarily mean that the mandatory nature of the Guidelines had no effect on the sentencing decision. \u201c[Ejven a discretionary departure decision is informed by the Guidelines and thus sheds little light on what a sentencing judge would have done knowing that the guidelines were advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 171 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>See also United States v. Waskom, </em>179 F.3d 303, 312 (5th Cir.1999) (guidelines calculation error was not harmless even though district court departed below the corrected guidelines range, as the extent of the departure could have been affected by the error). Accordingly, the grant of a downward departure is insufficient, standing alone, to satisfy the Government\u2019s burden of demonstrating harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">We also reject the Government\u2019s argument that any error was harmless because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>the sentence was reasonable under <em>Booker. </em>Reasonableness is not the standard we apply in the context of \u201cFanfan\u201d error, and it tells us nothing about what the district court would have done had it been operating under an advisory sentencing regime. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464-65 (giving no weight to Government\u2019s contention that error was harmless because the sentence was reasonable). As for the Government\u2019s contention that the district court expressed no dissatisfaction with the Guidelines, the district court\u2019s silence regarding its views on the Guidelines is plainly insufficient to satisfy the Government\u2019s arduous burden of showing harmless error. <em>See Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">In sum, there is nothing in the record that demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence if the Guidelines had been advisory rather than mandatory. Accordingly, we must vacate Hernandez\u2019s sentence and remand this matter for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">Hernandez\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Hernandez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Hernandez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Hernandez\u2019s conviction. We VACATE his sentence and REMAND this matter to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1010-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
