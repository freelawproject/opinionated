At the time the squalor was discovered by police entering the apartment, the grandparent was not home; however, based upon the uncontradicted testimony of a child welfare worker, the trial court found that the grandmother shared custody or control of the granddaughter and was therefore criminally liable under the statute. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction of child endangerment under R.C. 2919.22(A), and that the conviction was not contrary to the weight of the evidence. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">On July 27, 1998, the police went to the apartment at 2194 Lincoln Avenue in Springfield Township to investigate an anonymous tip that the child on the premises may have been neglected. The child\u2019s twenty-one-year-old mother, Jamie Cat\u00f3n, opened the door. Also inside was Jamie\u2019s boyfriend, Benjamin Hein, the putative father of the child. After the police entered, they discovered conditions that were later compared to a \u201cpig sty.\u201d Testimony indicated that the house had an odor of urine and feces, that the carpet was covered in filth, that dishes were piled in the sink, that pots and pans sat on the stove covered with decaying food, and that insect-laden food sat both in the refrigerator and on the kitchen table.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>The child, Jessica, a two-year-old toddler, was found behind a baby gate in the upstairs bedroom, naked and alone. Dirty diapers were on the floor, according to the investigating officers, as well as a plastic bag. Fecal matter was found upon the carpet, walls, window, furniture, and Jessica herself. With respect to the latter, an officer at the scene testified that Jessica had what he thought to be fecal matter on her hands and face. At that point, police summoned representatives of the Hamilton County Department of Human Services. A child welfare worker familiar with the family, Colleen Turner, arrived on the scene and determined that the environment threatened Jessica with illness, and the child was removed from the home and taken to a hospital to be examined. The hospital examination determined that Jessica was healthy and not suffering from any contagious disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Jamie Cat\u00f3n and Benjamin Hein were arrested at the scene, taken into custody, and charged with child endangerment in violation of R.C. 2919.22(A). Debbie Cat\u00f3n, Jamie\u2019s mother, who police believed resided in the apartment, was later charged with the same offense. The three defendants were then tried jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Neither Jamie nor Debbie Cat\u00f3n testified at trial. The manager of the apartment testified that Jamie Cat\u00f3n was the named tenant on the lease. She stated that she was unaware of anyone other than Jamie and Jessica living in the apartment. She testified that Debbie Cat\u00f3n was present when Jamie made application for the apartment and that she had seen Debbie Cat\u00f3n at the apartment during the summer months, cleaning carpets \u201c[m]aybe three or four times.\u201d She testified that she was aware, also, that Debbie had the telephone and electric bills placed in her name \u201cbecause Jamie was physically not able to do that.\u201d However, she stated that Debbie Cat\u00f3n was not a resident of the apartment to her knowledge, and that it would have violated the Section 8 provisions of the lease for Jamie to have a co-tenant without first seeking permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Debbie Caton\u2019s ex-husband testified that, to his knowledge, both Debbie and Jamie lived at the Lincoln Avenue apartment. Asked how he knew this, he stated, \u201cBecause when they moved out from Galbraith Road, where their other apartment was, Debbie took me over I think a day or two later over to show me their new apartment, hers and Jamie\u2019s, where they were living at.\u201d According to her ex-husband, Debbie Cat\u00f3n \u201ctold me it was their new apartment where her and Jamie were living at.\u201d He stated that he was over at the apartment on three or four occasions and that Debbie Cat\u00f3n was normally there. He stated that when he called on the telephone, either Debbie or Jamie would usually answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The neighborhood letter carrier for the United States Postal Service testified that on July 27, 1998, both Debbie and Jamie Cat\u00f3n were having mail delivered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the Lincoln Avenue apartment. He admitted, though, that he had no personal knowledge of who was living in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Colleen Turner, the child welfare worker for the Department of Human Services, testified that she had been familiar with Debbie Cat\u00f3n and Jamie Cat\u00f3n since June 1996. She stated that the \u201cthe case\u201d had come to the attention of the department \u201cas a result of a finding of physical abuse of Jessica.\u201d She testified, without objection, that \u201c[f]or the majority of time since we received the case in Ongoing in June of \u201996, Debbie Cat\u00f3n resided in the home of Jamie Cat\u00f3n, assisting Jamie in providing care for Jessica Cat\u00f3n. There were periods when she was not living in the home, but Debbie Cat\u00f3n did reside in the home and participated in the care of Jessica Cat\u00f3n.\u201d Turner testified, again without objection, that she came to this conclusion through \u201cnumerous telephone conversations\u201d with Debbie Cat\u00f3n and three previous personal contacts with Debbie Cat\u00f3n at the home on Galbraith Road. She stated that Debbie Cat\u00f3n was residing with Jamie and Jessica because she felt that Jamie had \u201csome mental retardation issues,\u201d and that Debbie Cat\u00f3n had, \u25a0 therefore, \u201cessentially * * * assumed responsibility for the household and for her daughter and for assuring that her daughter provided for her granddaughter.\u201d Furthermore, Turner stated, Debbie Cat\u00f3n insisted that she be present whenever the department attempted to have contact with Jamie to report on Jessica.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Turner testified that, after taking Jessica to the hospital, she and the staff took responsibility for cleaning the child. She stated that matter removed from Jessica\u2019s feet and other parts of her body had \u201cthe color of feces, the odor of feces, the texture per se of feces.\u201d Turner further described Jessica\u2019s feet as orange \u201cfrom having walked around in what we determined was fecal matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Turner testified that the most \u201csignificant physical hazard\u201d witnessed by her when she removed Jessica from the home was \u201cthe fact that the child was unsupervised upstairs, gated in a room where there were no toys, no clothes, and there was feces, whether it be human or animal, smeared all over the furniture, carpet, wall and screen.\u201d She stated that she found evidence of neglect \u201cbased on conditions of the home, the hygenic condition of the child and * * * the supervision of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Both Jamie and Debbie Cat\u00f3n were found guilty of the offense, while the charge against Benjamin Hein was dismissed pursuant to a Crim.R. 29 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Debbie Cat\u00f3n raises six assignments of error, all of which challenge the weight and sufficiency of the evidence underlying her conviction for violating R.C. 2919.22(A). That subsection provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>\u201cNo person, who is the parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control, or person in loco parentis of a child under eighteen years of age * * * shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Both the state and Cat\u00f3n agree that the elements of the offense required the state to show that she (1) had custody or control of Jessica, (2) violated a duty of care toward Jessica, (3) created a substantial risk to Jessica\u2019s health, and (4) acted with the mental state of recklessness. <em>State v. McGee </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 193, 680 N.E.2d 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The trial court, in its written decision, found specifically that Cat\u00f3n lived with her daughter and granddaughter at 2194 Lincoln Avenue on the date in question. The trial court also found that it was \u201cuncontradicted\u201d that Cat\u00f3n \u201cplayed an ongoing and active role in the care of Jessica Cat\u00f3n.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">\u201cIn this regard, Colleen Turner, the child welfare worker from the Hamilton County Department of Human Services[,] testified without contradiction that she had worked with both Jamie and Debbie Cat\u00f3n concerning the care of Jessica virtually since June, 1996. She noted that for the majority of Jessica Caton\u2019s life, Debbie Cat\u00f3n had resided with her and provided care to her along with her mother, Jamie Cat\u00f3n. As Colleen Turner testified, Defendant Debbie Cat\u00f3n had assumed responsibility for the household and for her daughter and for assuring that her daughter provided for her granddaughter, Jessica Cat\u00f3n. Debbie Cat\u00f3n was in the home every time the caseworker visited there. She insisted that she be present whenever Jamie met with the social worker and Debbie Cat\u00f3n herself had several telephone conversations directly with Colleen Turner concerning Jessica\u2019s care. For all these reasons, the Court finds that Debbie Cat\u00f3n assumed such care of Jessica Cat\u00f3n and had such relationship with the child that she had the \u2018custody and control\u2019 of Jessica Cat\u00f3n which gives rise to a duty of care, protection, and support for breach of which criminal liability can be found.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">\n<em>1. Loco Parentis, Custody or Control</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">In her first and second assignments of error, Cat\u00f3n argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish either that she stood in loco parentis to her granddaughter or that she exerted custody or control over her. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">As Cat\u00f3n points out, the law does not impose obligations on a grandparent toward his or her grandchild simply by virtue of the relationship. As this court has previously held, the \u201cduty of care, protection, or support\u201d provided for in R.C. 2919.22(A) \u201crefers only to those duties toward -the child as are imposed by law.\u201d <em>State v. Erwin </em>(Feb. 24, 1993), Hamilton App. No. C-920293, unreported, 1993 WL 50944, citing <em>State v. Sammons </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 460, 12 O.O.3d 384, 391 N.E.2d 713, appeal dismissed (1980), 444 U.S. 1008, 100 S.Ct. 655, 62 L.Ed.2d 637. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Moral, humanitarian, or filial obligations, no matter how imperative, will not suffice in the absence of a legal duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">A grandparent in loco parentis, however, is responsible under the law to discharge the duties of a parent\u2019s care and protection. <em>Erwin, supra. </em>In <em>State v. Hayes </em>(1987), 31 Ohio App.3d 40, 31 OBR 56, 507 N.E.2d 1176, we defined \u201cin loco parentis\u201d to mean \u201cperson in place of a parent.\u201d Whether a person stands in loco parentis is a factual question. The term does not signify a formal investiture \u2014 in <em>Erwin, supra, </em>an admission by the stepfather that he cared for the child and brought her formula was deemed sufficient for the jury to infer that he intended to stand in loco parentis.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Furthermore, grandparents not in loco parentis to the child may, nevertheless, still owe a legal duty of care and protection to the child if the child is in their custody or control. For example, a grandfather who molested his grandchildren while they were living with their mother in his home was found to have sufficient \u201ccustody\u201d of the grandchildren for purposes of the statute. <em>State v. Smith </em>(Jan. 25, 1996), Cuyahoga App. No. 68745, unreported, 1996 WL 28583.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Although Cat\u00f3n challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that she lived at the Lincoln Avenue apartment, we hold that the testimony of her ex-husband, Turner, and the mailman was sufficient to support an inference that she resided on the premises. It is well settled that an appellate court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s finding of fact based upon insufficient evidence where the finding is supported by some competent, credible evidence. Further, the evidence and the inferences to be drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. The test of sufficiency does not assess whether the state\u2019s evidence is to believed, but only, if it is believed, whether the evidence would be sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 390, 678 N.E.2d 541, 549 (Cook, J., concurring). Here, if believed, the evidence was clearly sufficient to establish that Cat\u00f3n resided in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">With respect to whether Cat\u00f3n had custody or control of Jessica, we again hold that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that she did. Turner testified that, in her professional opinion, based upon personal visits and telephone conversations, Cat\u00f3n had assumed responsibility for assuring that her daughter took care of her granddaughter. Turner\u2019s testimony was presented without objection. More important, her testimony was not contradicted, since the defense did not put on any evidence. A reasonable trier of fact could, based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Turner\u2019s testimony and the fact that Cat\u00f3n resided in the apartment, infer that Cat\u00f3n shared custody or control of Jessica with Jamie.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">We hold, therefore, that there was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that Cat\u00f3n had custody or control of her granddaughter. We emphasize that this holding follows from Turner\u2019s uncontradicted testimony regarding the nature of the relationship between Cat\u00f3n and her daughter and granddaughter, and not simply upon the fact that Cat\u00f3n was Jessica\u2019s grandmother living on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Accordingly, we find no merit in Caton\u2019s first and second assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">\n<em>2. Substantial Risk</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">In her third and fourth assignments of error, Cat\u00f3n argues that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the conclusion that she created, either by action or omission, a substantial risk to the health of her granddaughter, Jessica. She points, in this regard, to the absence of evidence that Jessica suffered from any contagious disease. With respect to the risk that Jessica may have consumed fecal matter, she argues that \u201cthe State here failed to present any testimony to show that ingestion of fecal matter poses a substantial risk to a child\u2019s health and safety.\u201d Again we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">R.C. 2901.01(H) defines \u201csubstantial risk\u201d as \u201ca strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.\u201d As Cat\u00f3n correctly points out, this court has held that this section does not permit the trier of fact to make \u201cinference upon inference\u201d in order to transform a speculative risk into a substantial risk. <em>State v. Martin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">In its written opinion, the trial court made a finding that the Cat\u00f3n apartment \u201cwas, in fact, filthy.\u201d The trial court also expressly concluded that a substantial risk to Jessica\u2019s health was presented by a \u201cfeces-encrusted home, with moldy, rotten food, garbage and insects attracted to same, which has a pervasive stench and in which the child is placed in a gated room with no toys, and the window screen is partially detached * * Further, citing <em>State v. Caulley </em>(Oct. 23, 1998), Montgomery App. No. 17066, unreported, 1998 WL 735908, the trial court rejected the argument that \u201cexpert testimony is required to prove that a filthy, feces contaminated environment constitutes a substantial risk to the health or safety of a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">We agree that expert testimony is not required to find that feces are a potential source of disease. It is a simple rule of hygiene that germs and bacteria breed in filth and excrement. It is a matter of logic, therefore, that a child whose feet are orange from feces, and who has feces in the folds of her skin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>is being exposed to a known health risk. Additionally, insects are known to harbor and transmit disease. Plastic bags such as those found in Jessica\u2019s room have been known to cause suffocation. An unsecured window screen creates a risk that the child might somehow fall through.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The question is, ultimately, whether all these environmental factors combined to put Jessica\u2019s health at \u201csubstantial risk\u201d as -defined in R.C. 2901.01(H). We do not consider Jessica\u2019s absence of contagious disease to be dispositive, since it is the risk, not the actuality of injury, with which the statute is concerned. Furthermore, where the risk is presented by environmental factors such as filth and excrement, it must be recognized that while the risk may be less palpable, it is no less real than in situations where the child is overtly threatened by physical behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">While we eschew any bright-line rule in so-called \u201cfilthy-home\u201d cases, we are convinced that the environment in which Jessica was found created a substantial risk of contagious disease or accident. This is not a case such as <em>Martin, supra, </em>where the state is seeking to punish a parent for putting a child at speculative risk due to a single imprudent act. There is nothing speculative about the risk to a child whose feet are tinctured with fecal matter due to the chronic squalor in which she is forced to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The next question that arises is whether there was sufficient evidence to have found that Cat\u00f3n caused the risk. In addressing this issue, the trial court found that the evidence was uncontradicted that Cat\u00f3n lived in the home and that \u201cthe conditions in the home occurred over a period of time.\u201d As stated by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">\u201cThe dried food about the house and dried feces on the walls and carpet in Jessica\u2019s room indicate that the filth did not just appear instantaneously. As an adult living there, the Court finds that Defendant Debbie Cat\u00f3n knew of the conditions of the home where she resided and that she took no action to alleviate them and protect Jessica Cat\u00f3n from the risks they posed to the child\u2019s health and safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s analysis. While it is true, as Cat\u00f3n argues, that there was no evidence that she physically created the conditions that surrounded Jessica (she argues, for example, that there was no evidence that she actually placed the feces in the child\u2019s bedroom), we do not find such evidence necessary to her conviction. Nor do we find persuasive her argument that \u201c[a]t most, [Caton\u2019s] failure to remove Jessica from the dirty bedroom may have heightened the pre-existing risk to Jessica\u2019s safety, a risk that was directly created by Jamie Caton\u2019s poor housekeeping and not by Debbie Caton\u2019s conduct.\u201d There was no evidence presented that the dirty bedroom was the result of Jamie Caton\u2019s poor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>housekeeping, as opposed to Caton\u2019s. The duty of care and protection Cat\u00f3n owed Jessica, moreover, did not depend on who created the mess. Rather, the duty arose as a result of Caton\u2019s custody or control of Jessica, and the breach of that duty was her failure to do anything to remove Jessica or ameliorate the harmful conditions surrounding the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">\n<em>8. Recklessness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">In her fifth assignment of error, Cat\u00f3n argues that there was insufficient evidence that she acted recklessly with regard to Jessica\u2019s condition. She argues that the state failed to present any evidence that she had knowledge of the \u201csubstandard apartment conditions to which Jessica was exposed.\u201d or that she was aware that \u201cshe may have owed a duty of care to Jessica.\u201d We are not persuaded by either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">A person acts recklessly with respect to circumstances when, \u201cwith heedless indifference to the consequences, he [or she] perversely disregards a known risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.\u201d R.C. 2901.22(C). Based on this record, we hold that there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to have concluded that Cat\u00f3n must have known of the risk to Jessica, and that she perversely disregarded that risk. It was reasonable to infer that anyone living in the apartment was aware of the deplorable conditions. The fact that Cat\u00f3n may have been oblivious to the duty of care she owed her granddaughter did not negate her duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">\n<em>b. Weight of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">In her sixth and final assignment, Cat\u00f3n challenges her conviction based upon the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">The role of a reviewing court in reviewing a challenge to the weight of the evidence was set forth in <em>Thompkins:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">\u201cWhen a court of appeals reverses a judgment of a trial court on the basis that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, the appellate court sits as a \u2018thirteenth juror\u2019 and disagrees with the factfinder\u2019s resolution of the conflicting evidence. <em>Tibbs [v. Florida </em>(1982), 457 U.S. 31] at 42, 102 S.Ct. [2211] at 2218, 72 L.Ed.2d [652] at 661. See, also, <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 219, 485 N.E.2d 717, 720-721 (\u2018The court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019).\u201d <em>Thompkins, supra, </em>at 387, 678 N.E.2d at 546-547.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Cat\u00f3n argues that society cannot punish \u201cevery grandparent, even grandparents who are highly involved in the lives of their grandchildren, for parenting mistakes made by the children\u2019s actual parents.\u201d While such a statement is generally true, we believe that society can punish a grandparent who lives with a grandchild, shares in the custody or control of the child, and recklessly allows the child to remain in an environment that puts the child\u2019s health and safety at substantial risk. Based upon the evidence of record, we hold that the trial court did not lose its way or create a manifest miscarriage of justice by concluding that Cat\u00f3n was guilty of breaching her duty to her granddaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Accordingly, Caton\u2019s six assignments of error are overruled and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b782-7\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Shannon, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b782-8\">Raymond E.
