For the reasons stated herein, this court affirms the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Appellant, Melanie M., mother<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Nicholas H., sets forth the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">\u201cASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">\u201cWhether the trial court erred in finding that Lucas County Children Services should be granted permanent custody of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Nicholas was born on February 28, 1997. LCCS became involved with this family shortly after Nicholas was born as the result of a referral that he suffered from nonorganic failure to thrive. LCCS offered services while allowing the child to stay in the home. A LCCS family advocate was assigned to work with the family and did so for eight months, twice a week. However, problems with caring for Nicholas continued. Appellant failed to seek medical treatment for Nicholas on more than one occasion. In February 1998, the family advocate transported Nicholas to the hospital where he was admitted for weight loss, an ear infection, and a high fever. After this occurred, LCCS filed the complaint in dependency and neglect and was granted interim temporary custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">A guardian <em>ad litem </em>was appointed for Nicholas. Counsel was appointed for appellant. The original goal of services was reunification with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">In regard to appellant, case plan, filed on March 20, 1998, was established to address concerns of unsafe and unstable housing, poor parenting and not meeting Nicholas\u2019s needs, a history of domestic violence, and appellant\u2019s intellectual/psychological impairments. Appellant was to complete a diagnostic assessment, follow through with recommendations of the assessor, participate in Project Grow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>at St. Vincent Medical Center, and attend medical appointments for monitoring the child\u2019s weight gains.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">LCCS was awarded temporary custody effective May 14, 1998, following a hearing on May 12, 1998. LCCS filed a motion for permanent custody on March 30, 1999. On June 3, 1999, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>for Nicholas filed a report recommending that permanent custody was in his best interest. Trial was held on September 15,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">A psychologist at Harbor Behavioral Health Care (\u201cHarbor\u201d) who conducted a psychological assessment of appellant testified that she initially saw appellant over a period of three days in the summer of 1998 for an evaluation of her intellectual functioning and her parenting skills. The psychologist stated that appellant had limited insight and minimized the stressors in her life. The psychologist testified that appellant indicated that she had her first child at age sixteen and that she had lost custody of that child to LCCS but was unsure why except to say that LCCS \u201cwants white babies.\u201d The psychologist testified that appellant scored at the borderline level of functioning on the intellectual test and showed poor social and practical judgment; appellant also indicated a high level of distress and scored in the severely depressed range. The psychologist testified that although appellant was able to verbalize appropriate parenting responses on a parenting questionnaire, appellant was unable when asked to provide more detail or discuss unusual parenting situations. Appellant\u2019s responses on one parenting questionnaire indicated that she felt overwhelmed and inadequate in her parenting role. The psychologist opined that appellant suffered from a major depressive disorder. The psychologist also testified that appellant appeared to be very resistant to receiving help from others and when appellant discussed the parenting classes, appellant stated that she did not learn anything new. The psychologist was concerned that appellant appeared to have very poor insight as to why her children' were removed by LCCS and did not accept any responsibility for their removal. At the conclusion of her evaluation, the psychologist had recommended that appellant begin individual therapy and be evaluated for medication for her depression and have a parent aide work closely with appellant to implement techniques from parenting classes and monitor appellant\u2019s efforts to meet the child\u2019s needs. The psychologist did not see appellant after the assessment because the psychologist left Harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">A psychiatrist who evaluated appellant on September 1, 1998 testified that appellant appeared to have symptoms of depression such as sleep and appetite disturbance, crying spells, suicidal thoughts, and feelings of hopelessness. The psychiatrist prescribed an antidepressant medication in September, and appellant was seen for seven follow-up appointments with either the psychiatrist or her nurse. Appellant kept the appointments through March 25, 1999, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>medication appeared to help her. Appellant did not keep appointments with the psychiatrist after March 25, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">An LCCS parent educator testified in regard to her involvement in this case from December 1998 through March 1999. She testified that the parenting program has two portions, an instructional component and a home visit/observation portion. The parent educator testified that appellant attended seven of ten class sessions of the instructional portion. The educator testified that appellant did not participate in class, did not complete any of her homework assignments, and did not bond with other class participants. The educator testified that appellant did not complete or pass the program. The educator also testified that appellant refused to visit with the educator outside of the agency. The educator testified that although a nutritionist had lectured on healthy foods, appellant brought pop and candy to visits with Nicholas. The educator opined that appellant showed increased knowledge in only one area of parenting, positive attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The LCCS caseworker who had worked with this family from January 1998 testified that appellant moved from an apartment that was appropriate to one that was not appropriate because it had no lights, no gas, no door locks, broken windows, and no food. Upon the caseworker\u2019s recommendation, appellant then went to the Battered Women\u2019s Shelter at the YWCA, although appellant had initially resisted this recommendation. The caseworker testified that appellant and the alleged father had a history of domestic violence and that appellant had sustained broken ribs and bruises. Appellant continued to be involved with the alleged father despite the domestic violence. Appellant\u2019s whereabouts were unknown at the time of the hearing, as she refused to tell the caseworker where she was living. The caseworker also testified that appellant informed her that appellant was discontinuing the antidepressant medication because appellant did not like the way she felt when taking the medication. The caseworker testified that she encouraged appellant to continue the medication and to discuss this with the psychiatrist as well as to continue services with the psychiatrist. The caseworker also testified that appellant had not participated in LCCS services since March 1999. The caseworker further testified that Nicholas has had no feeding or failure-to-thrive problems since he was removed from appellant\u2019s care. The caseworker testified that it is in Nicholas\u2019s best interests that he be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The family intervention coordinator at the Battered Women\u2019s Shelter at the YWCA testified that although appellant completed a parenting theory class, appellant was unable to put the theory into practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">On October 4, 1999, the trial court entered a judgment entry awarding permanent custody of Nicholas to LCCS. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>In her assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that granting the motion for permanent custody was in the best interest of Nicholas. This court finds no merit in this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">R.C. 2151.414(E)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires the trial court to find that the child cannot be placed with either of his or her parents within a reasonable time or should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>placed with the parents once the court has determined by clear and convincing evidence that one or more of the enumerated factors exist. Once the trial court finds from all relevant evidence that one of the enumerated factors exists, it then must consider whether permanent commitment is in the best interest of the child. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>R. C. 2151.414(D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Only then may it grant permanent custody of the child to the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">On appeal, this court must determine whether the lower court complied with the statutory requirements of R.C. 2151.353 and 2151.414 and whether there was sufficient evidence to support a finding by clear and convincing evidence that one or more of the factors listed in R.C. 2151.414(E) exist. Permanent custody may not be granted unless the trial court finds clear and convincing evidence that one or more of the enumerated factors in R.C. 2151.414(E) exist. <em>In re William S. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 95, 101, 661 N.E.2d 738. Clear and convincing evidence is that level of proof that would cause the trier of fact to develop a firm belief or conviction as to the facts to be proven. <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus. The trial court must consider the best interests of the child by examining the factors listed in R.C. 2151.414(D). An appellate court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s determination concerning parental rights and child custody unless the determination is not supported by sufficient evidence to meet the clear and convincing standard of proof. <em>In re Adoption of Holcomb </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 361, 368, 18 OBR 419, 425-426, 481 N.E.2d 613, and <em>In re Ball </em>(1982), 5 Ohio App.3d 56, 58, 5 OBR 152, 154-155, 449 N.E.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">This court has thoroughly reviewed the entire record in this case. Upon consideration of the law and of the entire record of the proceedings in the trial court, this court finds that there was clear and convincing evidence presented at the hearing to support the trial court\u2019s decision. The evidence clearly supports the trial court\u2019s award of permanent custody and the trial court\u2019s decision that permanent commitment was in Nicholas\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">On consideration whereof, the court finds that substantial justice has been done the party complaining, and the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay the court costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b477-7\">Melvin L. Resnick and Pietrykowski, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-15\">.
