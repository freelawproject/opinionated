Consumer Protection Div., </em>423 Md. 450, 31 A.3d 919 (2011). We shall hold that the Division has the authority to issue the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>trative subpoena at issue in this case, and shall therefore affirm the circuit court\u2019s enforcement order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In this case, we are asked to address a problem of potentially overlapping agency jurisdiction in the context of \u201cshared regulatory space.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Division seeks documents that it claims are relevant to its investigation into potential unfair and deceptive trade practices that are within the ambit of its regulatory and enforcement authority under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (CPA). <em>See </em>Md.Code (1975, 2005 Repl.Vol., 2011 Supp.), \u00a7 13-405 of the Commercial Law Article (Com.Law). Washington Home Remodelers (WHR), the target of the Division\u2019s investigation, has demurred, asserting that the Division has overreached by seeking discovery into matters in which the regulatory authority resides exclusively with either the Commissioner of Financial Regulation of the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (DLLR) or the Maryland Home Improvement Commission under then-respective enabling statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> WHR insists that the Division subpoena is therefore not authorized by law and maintains that the circuit court erred in ordering its enforcement. Because we shall hold that the Division\u2019s subpoena is authorized by the Consumer Protection Act, we need not delve into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>conflicting investigatory prerogatives of separate administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">WHR is a licensed home improvement contractor based in College Park, Maryland. Acting on complaints from former WHR employees and consumers concerning WHR\u2019s sales solicitation practices, the Division initiated an investigation. Three former employees complained that WHR had misrepresented the individual licensing status of its sales people.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consumers also alleged that WHR accessed their credit histories without their knowledge and consent before soliciting a business relationship. For example, as stated in the Division\u2019s brief, one consumer alleged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">On 3/4/08 Washington Home Remodelers contacted me by phone offering home remodeling services \u2014 including deck building.... The caller said they wanted to know if I would be interested in having a \u201cfree\u201d estimate on a deck for my home. I told him that I would like an estimate. We scheduled an appointment for Sat. 3/8/08 @ 4 pm.... I was unable to keep that appointment so we rescheduled for Thurs. 3/13/08 @ 7 pm. On Wednesday, 3/12/08 I was notified by the fraud alert service that I use that my credit report had been accessed by Washington Home Remodelers. I was alarmed by this since I had not met with their representative nor given them any personal information or made a request over the phone or given them permission verbally or in writing to access my credit. On Thursday 3/13/08 I contacted [Washington Home Remodelers\u2019] offices and spoke to Greg Troy, who identified himself as the Customer Service Manager. I told him that I was calling because I learned that they had accessed my credit without my permission and I was upset. I explained that I had neither met with their representative and had completed no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>paperwork nor request for their financing regarding a deck or any other service they provided. I told him I would be filing a complaint with the Maryland\u2019s [sic] Consumer Protection office because I thought this business practice was unlawful. He told me that they work through Equifax and apologized because \u2018someone jumped the gun\u2019 by running my credit report. I reminded him that each time someone\u2019s credit is accessed it affects their credit score....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">This was apparently not an isolated example. On May 29, 2009, a second prospective customer scheduled an appointment for an estimate for constructing a deck to his home, but, although no one appeared for the appointment, the prospective customer received an alert from the credit bureau that it had received an inquiry for his credit file, without his permission. On August 19, 2009, based on these complaints and those of former WHR employees, and acting on its perceived authority to investigate unfair and deceptive trade practices prohibited by the CPA, the Division served WHR with an administrative subpoena.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>In response to this subpoena, WHR produced some of its form sales documents and sales agreements, but otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>refused to comply further with the Division\u2019s demand. For example, WHR declined to provide documents that identified the licensing history of its current and former employees, information concerning its lending and credit practices, and the advertisements, scripts, forms and other documents it uses to communicate with consumers. Resisting any further disclosure, WHR maintained that the information sought was beyond the Division\u2019s authority, and contended that investigation and enforcement of the law regarding the licensure of its agents lies exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Maryland Home Improvement Commission and that the enforcement of the law proscribing unauthorized access to credit reports is a matter exclusively within the authority of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation of the DLLR. The information thus sought by the Division instead could only be requested by, and provided to, those latter agencies, WHR asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">On December 4, 2009, after informal efforts by the Division and WHR to resolve the dispute were unsuccessful, the Division sought judicial enforcement of its administrative subpoena by filing a Complaint for Enforcement of Administrative Subpoena in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The Division accompanied this filing with a motion for summary judgment. WHR, in turn, moved to dismiss and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, based on its claim that the Division\u2019s subpoena was without legal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Following a hearing on September 21, 2010, the circuit court, although initially agreeing with WHR, ultimately determined to enforce the Division\u2019s subpoena. The court, painting the Division\u2019s investigative authority with a broad brush, upheld the Division\u2019s authority to investigate the alleged unauthorized accessing of credit reports and employment of unlicensed salesmen. With a nod to the extensive reach necessary for an agency to address the potential adverse effects on consumers, the circuit court harbored</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">[n]o doubt the division has the investigatory authority regarding consumers and the consumer\u2019s welfare. And I think for me the salient word should be or phrase should be consumer welfare and everything turns on whether what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>division is doing is for the consumer welfare. They\u2019re not in this case they haven\u2019t charged anyone with anything. They\u2019re looking into complaints. And the legislature has determined that the division has the right to initiate an investigatory process to determine what is actually happening in the consumer area as far as consumers are concerned to see if in fact consumers are being taken advantage of by particular acts by companies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">[A]t the end of the day the balance goes in favor of the division because the legislature has given it the mandate to be the protector of the consumer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">WHR noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and, as noted above, this Court issued a writ of certiorari, before action by the intermediate appellate court, to consider the following questions presented<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">1. Does the Consumer Protection Division have investigative and enforcement authority over the access and use of consumer credit reports in Md.Code Ann., State Gov. \u00a7 14-1201, <em>et seq. </em>when that authority is specifically vested with the Commissioner of Financial Regulation of the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">2. Does the Consumer Protection Division have investigative and enforcement authority over the Maryland Home Improvement Law, Md.Code Ann., Bus. Reg. \u00a7 8-101, <em>et seq. </em>when that authority is specifically vested with the Maryland Home Improvement Commission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">By contrast, the Division asks:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">Did the circuit court correctly hold that the Division had authority under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act to issue a subpoena to investigate potential unfair or deceptive trade practices in consumer transactions involving the unli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>censed sale of home improvement services and the unauthorized access of consumers\u2019 credit records?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">This Court has recognized the following \u201cthreefold test for determining the validity of a subpoena issued by an administrative agency\u201d as set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Oklahoma Press Publ\u2019g Co. v. Walling, </em>327 U.S. 186, 208, 66 S.Ct. 494, 505, 90 L.Ed. 614, 629 (1946): \u201cWhether the inquiry is authorized by statute, the information sought is relevant to the inquiry, and the demand is not too indefinite or over-broad.\u201d <em>Banach v. State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 502, 506, 356 A.2d 242, 246 (1976). <em>See </em>Arnold Rochvarg, <em>Principles and Practice of Maryland Administrative Law, </em>\u00a7 5.7 at 62 (2011). This appeal invokes only the first element of the test, <em>viz. </em>whether the Division\u2019s subpoena is authorized by the CPA. Accordingly, our review of the circuit court\u2019s ruling on the petition to enforce the administrative subpoena in this instance is plenary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The circuit court ruled that the Division acted within its statutory authority and, accordingly, entered summary judgment in favor of enforcement. This presents a question of law. It is also long-established that the authority of an administrative agency to issue investigative subpoenas derives from statute. <em>See Banach, </em>277 Md. at 507, 356 A.2d at 246 (citing <em>United States v. Morton Salt Co., </em>338 U.S. 632, 642-43, 70 S.Ct. 357, 364, 94 L.Ed. 401, 410 (1950)); <em>Vulcan Waterproofers, Inc. v. Md. Home Improvement Comm\u2019n, </em>253 Md. 204, 210, 252 A.2d 62, 65 (1969). We recently stated within the context of reviewing a circuit court\u2019s summary judgment ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>This case presents a question of statutory interpretation, and therefore, we review the trial court\u2019s disposition through summary judgment under a non-deferential standard of review. <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2001 [2002]) (\u201c[W]here the order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a [non-deferential] standard of review.\u201d). The task of this Court, therefore, is to \u201c \u2018determine whether the [circuit court\u2019s decision] was legally correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Phillips, </em>413 Md. 606, 618, 994 A.2d 411, 419 (2010) (quoting <em>Murphy v. Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. 525, 530-31, 697 A.2d 861, 864 (1997)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><em>Breslin v. Powell, </em>421 Md. 266, 277, 26 A.3d 878, 885 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AgC\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The gravamen of WHR\u2019s resistance to the Division\u2019s subpoena is that this sweeping inquiry lies beyond the coverage of the CPA because the Division seeks the production of information that relates exclusively to two other statutes: the Maryland Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act, Md.Code (1975, 2005 Repl.Vol., 2011 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 14-1201 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law Article (Com.Law) and the Maryland Home Improvement Law, Md.Code (1975, 2004 Repl.Vol., 2011 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 8-101-8-702 of the Business Regulation Article (Bus.Reg.). In short, WHR avers, the Division has no business asking for the information at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">WHR reminds us that \u201cwhere one statutory provision specifically addresses a matter, and another more general statutory provision also may arguably cover the same matter, the specific statutory provision is held to be applicable and the general provision is deemed inapplicable.\u201d <em>See Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>302 Md. 248, 268, 487 A.2d 271, 281 (1985). WHR insists that, because section 14-1202(a) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>the Credit Reporting Agencies Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is \u201ca direct and explicit statutory authorization\u201d that vests in the Commissioner of Financial Regulation of the DLLR the authority over investigation and enforcement actions involving the unlawful obtention of consumers\u2019 credit scores without first obtaining the consumers\u2019 authorization, the Division is without authority to investigate and enforce such actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">To this point, appellant relies on legislative history which shows that the General Assembly specifically declined to enact an amendment conferring legislative and enforcement authority over Maryland credit reporting laws to the Consumer Protection Division. Senate Bill 500, which was proposed by the General Assembly in 1976 and later codified as Com. Law \u00a7\u00a7 14-1201, <em>et seq., see </em>1976 Md. Laws, Chap. 584, was recognized as mirroring the federal law with two main differences, one of which was the vesting of enforcement powers in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the Commissioner of Financial Regulation of the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This recognition of enforcement powers in the Commissioner was in contrast to the treatment of a proposed amendment to the bill which would have provided for enforcement by the Division. The adoption of this amendment was declined. A different amendment, which would have explicitly classified a violation of Maryland credit reporting laws as an unfair and deceptive trade practice, was similarly declined by the General Assembly. That the Division is attempting to exert the sort of authority that the General Assembly specifically refused to grant, posits WHR, is manifest from the legislature\u2019s refusal to grant the Division enforcement authority over Maryland\u2019s credit reporting laws, its declination to define a violation of such laws as an \u201cunfair or deceptive trade practice,\u201d and the fact that it adopted the bill in a form which gave authority over such matters to the Commissioner of Financial Regulation of the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Appellant likewise asserts that, because the Legislature, pursuant to Bus. Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 8-208, 301,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> has vested investigative and enforcement authority in the Maryland Home Improve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>ment Commission with respect to the licensing of home improvement salespeople, the Consumer Protection Division is without authority to investigate the same matters. WHR complains that the Division is attempting to \u201cseize enforcement power over Maryland\u2019s credit reporting laws[.]\u201d Further, citing two decisions by the Court of Special Appeals, WHR insists that the Division\u2019s enforcement authority is more circumscribed. We turn to these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In <em>Davidson v. Microsoft Corp., </em>143 Md.App. 43, 792 A.2d 336, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 571, 801 A.2d 1032 (2002), certain individual computer users and a local business filed a class action against Microsoft alleging that the software giant overcharged consumers for its Windows 98 computer operating system, and that its activities constituted violations of the Maryland Antitrust Act, Com. Law \u00a7\u00a7 11-201 <em>et seq. </em>and the CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The circuit court granted Microsoft\u2019s motion to dismiss and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. The intermediate appellate court first concluded that the plaintiffs did not qualify for relief under the Antitrust Act and also held that no remedy would lie under the CPA because an antitrust violation was \u201cnot listed\u201d in the roster of prohibited activities set forth in the CPA. <em>Microsoft, </em>143 Md.App. at 56-57, 792 A.2d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In <em>Klein v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 640, 452 A.2d 173 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>295 Md. 440 (1983), Ray Klein appealed from the denial of his motion to dismiss five separate bribery indictments. He averred that the bribery charges were barred because he had been the subject of a prior related civil action under the CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. That Court rejected Klein\u2019s argument that the criminal prosecution must be barred on double jeopardy and <em>res judicata </em>grounds. According to the intermediate appellate court, bribery does not constitute a deceptive or unfair trade practice, and it pointed out that bribery was not listed among the enumerated unfair trade practices set forth in the CPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>While the Division of Consumer Protection has authority under \u00a7 13 \u2014 204(12)(ii) to define unfair trade practices in addition to those specified in \u00a7 13-301, 62 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 535, 542 (1977), it has not included bribery. The section carefully enumerates what constitutes an unfair trade practice, and bribery is conspicuously absent. Notwithstanding the liberal interpretation to be afforded the Consumer Protection Act, \u00a7 13-105, we may not, by judicial fiat, add bribery to the list contained in \u00a7 13-301.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\"><em>Klein, </em>52 Md.App. at 645, 452 A.2d at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">WHR\u2019s arguments overlook the fact that the \u201cCPA provides a <em>nonexclusive </em>list of unfair and deceptive trade practices.\u201d <em>Golt v. Phillips, </em>308 Md. 1, 8, 517 A.2d 328, 331 (1986) (emphasis added). Moreover, we recognized in <em>Consumer Prot. Div. v. Consumer Publ\u2019g Co., </em>304 Md. 731, 745, 501 A.2d 48, 55 (1985), that the Division \u201cacts as an arm of the Attorney General entrusted with broad powers to enforce and interpret the Consumer Protection Act[.]\u201d In short, the fact that discrete activities may not be enumerated in section 13-301 does not preclude the investigation into whether that activity, or any adverse effects thereof, constitutes a violation of the CPA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">WHR, throughout, frames the issue in terms of the Division\u2019s \u201cinvestigation and enforcement\u201d authority, whereas the Division correctly points out that its complaint in the circuit court merely sought to enforce the administrative subpoena that it had served on appellant, in an attempt to obtain information from which it could determine whether there are potential violations of the Consumer Protection Act. The Division maintains that its initial investigation is not an enforcement action, and it readily concedes that it has no authority to enforce the provisions of any statute but the CPA. The Division further responds, however, that it does have the regulatory authority to investigate matters which may poten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>tially constitute unfair or deceptive trade practices, and contends that the unauthorized access and disclosure of consumer credit information and the deception of consumers as to the licensing status of home-improvement salesmen may well constitute violations of the CPA. The Division argues that it is, indeed, authorized to investigate complaints that may for the most part be based on issues outside of the Consumer Protection Act, provided that the activities complained of constitute a potential violation of the CPA. We agree with the Division and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">II. The Legislation</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The General Assembly, concerned that there was an erosion of public confidence in merchants who, in increasing numbers were engaging in deceptive practices during the course of consumer transactions <em>(i.e., </em>sales of goods, services and the extension of credit), determined that it was necessary to take \u201cstrong protective and preventive steps to investigate unlawful consumer practices, to assist the public in obtaining relief from these practices, and to prevent these practices from occurring in Maryland.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Com. Law \u00a7 18-103(b)(3). In 1967, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the General Assembly created the Division of Consumer Protection under the \u201cauthority of the Attorney General of Maryland.\u201d 1967 Md. Laws, Chap. 388. The new statute was then codified at Md.Code (1967 Supp.), Art. 83 [\u201cSales and Notices\u201d], \u00a7\u00a7 19-27. The Legislature revisited the statute in 1973 and granted the Consumer Protection Division stronger investigative authority by amending Art. 83, \u00a7 22(b). The purpose of the amendment was to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9z\">provide stronger enforcement powers for the Attorney General <em>in the consumer protection law, </em>including the power to subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, examine individuals under oath, and compel production of records, books, papers, contracts, and other documents....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">1973 Md. Laws, Chap. 761 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The CPA is now found in Title 13 of the Commercial Law Article and constitutes remedial legislation that is intended to be construed liberally in order to promote its purpose of providing a modicum of protection for the State\u2019s consumers. In articulating the scope of the Division\u2019s authority to enforce the mandate of this legislation, Judge Raker observed for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">The Consumer Protection Division is a division of the Office of the Attorney General with a mandate to protect and promote the welfare of consumers. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-201; \u00a7 13-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>204. As such, it is entrusted with broad powers to enforce and interpret the Consumer Protection Act. <em>See id. </em>The Attorney General is a constitutional officer, <em>see </em>Maryland Constitution Art. V, whose duties include prosecuting and defending cases on behalf of the State. <em>See Consumer Protection v. Consumer Publ., </em>304 Md. 731, 501 A.2d 48 (1985). The powers of the Division include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6s\">\u201cThe statutory powers of the Division include the power to receive and investigate consumer complaints, initiate its own investigation of any possibly unfair and deceptive trade practice, issue cease and desist orders, adopt rules and regulations which further define unfair or deceptive trade practices or otherwise effectuate the purposes of the Act, and seek a temporary or permanent injunction in a civil enforcement proceeding \u00a7\u00a7 13-204 and 13-403(c)(2). The statute further provides that the Division may \u2018exercise and perform any other function, power, and duty appropriate to protect and promote the welfare of consumers.\u2019 \u00a7 13-204(11).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 745, 501 A.2d at 55.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><em>Consumer Prot. Div. v. Morgan, </em>387 Md. 125, 140 n. 2, 874 A.2d 919, 927 n. 2 (2005) (emphasis added). <em>See Consumer Prot. Div. v. George, </em>383 Md. 505, 513-14, 860 A.2d 896, 901 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">III. Investigatory Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The Division emphasizes that the purpose of the subpoena is to ascertain whether WHR potentially violated the CPA, and that this matter has not ripened into a formal administrative charge. Given the limited purpose of this preliminary inquiry, we agree that the Division has acted within its authority to investigate WHR by seeking the production of documents and information pursuant to the subpoena at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">In <em>Converge Servs. Grp., LLC v. Curran, </em>383 Md. 462, 484 n. 19, 860 A.2d 871, 884 n. 19 (2004), we addressed the exercise of the Division\u2019s investigatory power, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>An administrative investigation pursuant to the CPA is initiated either after a consumer complaint or by the Division on its own initiative. \u00a7 13-204 of the Commercial Law Article. An investigation may proceed from a complaint from any potential or actual violation of the CPA; thus, the Division may begin an investigation on any complaint, <em>even one largely based on issues outside the CPA, if a potential violation of the CPA also occurred. </em>\u00a7 13-204. In the course of the investigation of a potential CPA violation, the Division may issue an administrative subpoena for a witness or compel production of documents. \u00a7 13-405. A public hearing may be held to determine if an alleged violator actually violated the CPA. \u00a7 13-403(a). This administrative hearing permits an alleged violator to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. \u00a7 13-403(a)(3). Regardless of whether a violation of the CPA is found, the Division must state its findings of fact and law after the hearing. <em>Only in the event that a violation of the CPA is found by a preponderance of the evidence, may the Division order administrative remedies against the violator. </em>\u00a7 13-403(b). Thus, regardless of the outcome of alleged violations of another statute, the Division can only order a post-hearing administrative remedy under the CPA if the CPA itself is violated. Otherwise, it must issue an order dismissing the complaint. \u00a7 13-403(b)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In <em>Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Freedom Express/Domegold, Inc., </em>375 Md. 2, 825 A.2d 354 (2003), we emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">[t]he only prerequisites expressly set forth in Art. 49B, \u00a7 11, for the issuance and judicial enforcement of a Commission subpoena are certain formal requirements, proper service of process, and a finding that \u201cthe production of the books, papers, records and documents is relevant or necessary for the proceedings.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 ll(d)(l)(iii), 11(d)(1)(h)). The requirement of \u201crelevance\u201d in \u00a7 11(d) is the same as the requirements of \u201crelevance\u201d or \u201creasonableness\u201d which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>generally applied by the courts in determining whether to enforce administrative subpoenas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><em>Freedom Express, </em>375 Md. at 12, 825 A.2d at 360 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">We reiterate that an administrative prosecution is not the function and purpose of the initial investigative subpoena. WHR insists that cases such as <em>Converge </em>illustrate that the Division is limited to investigating activities that are by their nature unfair or deceptive practices that are within the clear ambit of the CPA, and are not the subject of another statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">We believe that WHR\u2019s argument misses the point. At this stage, an investigative agency must retain the authority to obtain information that enables it to fulfill its statutory mandate, even in the context of \u201cshared regulatory space.\u201d The Division, in the case before us, is authorized by section 13-405 of the CPA to do just that. The investigative authority flows from section 13-405, and, again, the Division may initiate an investigation to determine whether there are adverse consumer effects of an unauthorized credit reporting or salesperson licensing issue. We reiterate that, if the investigation demonstrates that the CPA is not violated, then the Division is required to \u201cissue an order dismissing the complaint. \u00a7 13-403(b)(2).\u201d <em>Converge, </em>383 Md. at 484 n. 19, 860 A.2d at 884 n. 19. To require that the Division must demonstrate a CPA violation in the first instance would hamstring its investigative authority and render section 13-403(b)(2) of the CPA superfluous. Justice Robert H. Jackson\u2019s observation comes to mind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">We must not disguise the fact that sometimes, especially early in the history of the federal administrative tribunal, the courts were persuaded to engraft judicial limitations upon the administrative process. The courts could not go fishing, and so it followed neither could anyone else. Administrative investigations fell before the colorful and nostalgic slogan \u201cno fishing expeditions.\u201d It must not be forgotten that the administrative process and its agencies are relative newcomers in the field of law and that it has taken and will continue to take experience and trial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>error to fit this process into our system of judicature. More recent views have been more tolerant of it than those which underlay many older decisions. <em>Compare Jones v. Securities &amp; Exchange Comm\u2019n, </em>298 U.S. 1 [56 S.Ct. 654, 80 L.Ed. 1015 (1936) ], with <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>307 U.S. 183, 191 [59 S.Ct. 795, 83 L.Ed. 1211 (1939) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">The only power that is involved here is the power to get information from those who best can give it and who are most interested in not doing so. <em>Because judicial power is reluctant if not unable to summon evidence until it is shown to be relevant to issues in litigation, it does not follow that an administrative agency charged with seeing that the laws are enforced may not have and exercise powers of original inquiry. </em>It has a power of inquisition, if one chooses to call it that, which is not derived from the judicial function. It is more analogous to the Grand Jury, <em>which does not depend on a case or controversy for power to get evidence but can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because it wants assurance that it is not. </em>When investigative and accusatory duties are delegated by statute to an administrative body, it, too, may take steps to inform itself as to whether there is probable violation of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\"><em>United States v.

The Division has conceded that point. Yet an investigation into possible unfair trade practices that may relate to activities proscribed by those statutes is properly the grist for the investigative mill. In the instant case, the Division began an investigation of WHR in response to multiple complaints it received in regards to WHR\u2019s requests for, and receipt of, consumer credit reports as well as its alleged employment of unlicensed salespeople. With regard to a determination that the employment of unlicensed salespeople could potentially constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the CPA, if the investigation established that WHR dispatched unlicensed salespersons to the homes of prospective customers, the ultimate determination as to whether such a practice constituted a deceptive practice would be made at the conclusion of the investigation. The substance of the complaints filed with the Division provided reasonable grounds upon which to institute an investigation and to gather information to confirm or dispel the suspicion that WHR had committed an unfair or deceptive practice. CPA \u00a7 13-301(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Similarly, given the consumer complaints related to WHR\u2019s pre-solicitation or pre-sale requests for, and use of, consumer credit reports without permission from prospective customers, it would indeed be unfair or deceptive should the investigation ultimately establish that the acts, as described in the complaint, occurred. That harm was done as a result of accessing credit reports without permission is patent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The complainant who had only made a preliminary inquiry regarding possibly engaging WHR\u2019s services had no reason to believe that the WHR employee contacted would access the consumer\u2019s credit score, causing potential economic harm. The WHR employee may cause the same detriment to the prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>consumer\u2019s credit score in a case in which the consumer, who, as a result of only scheduling an appointment for an estimate, prior to any discussion of price or method of payment, discovers that his or her credit has been accessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">We emphasize that the ultimate determination of what violations have been committed and which statutes, if any, have been violated, will be made at such time as any administrative proceedings are concluded.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At this juncture, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>er, during the incipient stages of its inquiry and before the filing of any enforcement action, the Division is authorized to conduct the investigation into the adverse consumer effects of the practices that prompted the issuance of the subpoena before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Our holding in this case does not require that courts must enforce every administrative subpoena. We made abundantly clear, in <em>Banach v. State Commission on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. at 506, 356 A.2d at 246, that a court that considers a request to enforce an administrative subpoena must determine \u201c[w]hether the inquiry is authorized by statute, the information sought is relevant to the inquiry, and the demand is not too indefinite or overbroad.\u201d The challenge to the instant subpoena is confined to the first element,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and Com. Law \u00a7 13-405 provides an answer to that.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The circuit court did not err by entering summary judgment in favor of the Division and thus enforcing the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">COSTS FOR PRINTING APPELLEE\u2019S RECORD EXTRACT TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> BALANCE OF COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\">.

State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 521, 526-27, 356 A.2d 254, 257-58 (1976) (detailing the policy reasons behind the exhaustion requirement). This rule, however, is not without exceptions. For example, our case law indicates that exhaustion of administrative remedies will not be required when a party can demonstrate that an administrative tribunal is \"palpably without jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See, e.g., State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Freedom Express/Domegold, Inc., </em>375 Md. 2, 19, 825 A.2d 354, 364 (2003) (finding that \"this Court has consistently taken the position that judicial review of [an] issue must await a final administrative decision unless 'the agency is \"palpably without jurisdiction\u201d \u2019 \").</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The case before us, however, is not a judicial review of an administrative proceeding, but a judicial action to enforce the Division\u2019s investigative subpoena. There are no administrative remedies yet to invoke, or exhaust. The goal of the Division at this juncture is to develop a record basis for potential enforcement action. WHR\u2019s goal in turn is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>prevent, or at least forestall, any enforcement under the Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b663-10\">. During oral argument, counsel for appellant acknowledged that appellant was not challenging the breadth of the subpoena, only the Division\u2019s authority to issue it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b663-11\">. On January 23, 2012, this Court, having considered the Motion of the Consumer Protection Division for Leave to File Appellee's Record Extract, Appellant's Opposition to Appellee\u2019s Motion for Leave to File Record Extract and the Cross-Motion to Strike Appellee\u2019s Record Extract, issued an Order granting the Division's motion pursuant to Maryland Rule 501(e), but, simultaneously, instructed the Clerk of the Court that the decision \u201cwho will bear the cost of its printing (in whole or in part), pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-607(b),\u201d would be reserved \u201cuntil oral argument and the decision of the case.\u201d Md. Rule 8-607 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-12\">Assessment of costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>(a) Allowance and allocation. Unless the Court orders otherwise, the prevailing party is entitled to costs. The Court, by order, may allocate costs among the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxZ\">(b) Unnecessary material. <em>When unnecessary material has been included in a record extract or appendix, </em>the Court may order that the costs of reproduction be withheld, apportioned, or assessed against the attorney or unrepresented party who caused the unnecessary material to be included. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">Appellant opposed Appellee's Motion for Leave to File Record Extract, citing examples in appellee's record extract that it contended were both \"duplicative materials ... and/or lacking in independent relevance materials.'' Upon our review, we agree that much of the material in appellee's record extract submitted as an appendix to its brief is duplicative to that in appellant\u2019s record extract and/or was not otherwise materially relevant in the disposition of this appeal. Accordingly, we shall assess the costs of printing appellee\u2019s record extract submitted as an appendix to its brief against appellee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
