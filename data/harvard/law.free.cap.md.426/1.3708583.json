In this case, Deputy Erick Gindlesperger of the Montgomery County Sheriffs Office had filed a subpoena request seeking to compel Sheriff Darren M. Popkin<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to produce documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>prior to a disciplinary hearing under the LEOBR. The hearing board denied the request, and Deputy Gindlesperger filed a Motion for Show Cause Order in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Circuit Court determined that Section 3-107(d)(1) entitled Deputy Gindlesperger to prehearing production of various enumerated documents. Sheriff Popkin appealed and, on our own motion, we granted certiorari to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">Did the Circuit Court commit reversible error when it ordered the pre-LEOBR Hearing production of unrelated internal affairs case files pursuant to \u00a7 3-107(d)(l) of the Public Safety Article, which only authorizes subpoenas for the production of records at LEOBR hearings?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">We shall hold that Section 3-107(d)(l) does not provide for compelling production of records and documents by subpoena in advance of an LEOBR disciplinary hearing and shall, therefore, reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s Order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">The LEOBR was originally enacted in 1974 \u201cto guarantee that certain procedural safeguards be offered to police officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>during any investigation and subsequent hearing which could lead to disciplinary action, demotion, or dismissal.\u201d <em>Blondell v. Baltimore City Police Department, </em>341 Md. 680, 691, 672 A.2d 639, 645 (1996), quoting <em>Abbott v. Administrative Hearing Board, </em>33 Md.App. 681, 682, 366 A.2d 756, 757 (1976). A deputy sheriff in the Montgomery County Sheriffs Office, as is Deputy Gindlesperger, as one who is authorized to make arrests, is covered by the LEOBR. Section 3-101(e).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The procedural safeguards, in the context of a summary punishment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are initiated once the law enforcement officer decides to refuse discipline imposed summarily. Upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>officer\u2019s refusal of discipline, the head of the law enforcement agency may convene a hearing and select the hearing board, which may be comprised of one or more officers. Section 3-111(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The hearing board issues subpoenas, takes judicial notice of facts, administers oaths and provides the law enforcement agency and the officer \u201cample opportunity to present evidence and argument about the issues involved.\u201d Sections 3-107(d), (e), (g), (h). The hearing board makes findings as to the officer\u2019s culpability and, if it finds that the officer is not guilty, the administrative action and the summary discipline are terminated. <em>See </em>Section 3-108(a)(3). Alternatively, if the hearing board finds the officer guilty, then the hearing board may recommend a penalty, which, in the context of a hearing following a summary punishment refusal, may be no greater than a three-day suspension without pay or a fine of $150. Section 3 \u2014 111(c)(1)(ii). The head of the law enforcement agency has the ultimate authority as to sanction, however. Section 3 \u2014 108(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">In this case, Deputy Erick Gindlesperger was charged with violating Section 33-5(h) of the Montgomery County Personnel Regulations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for \u201cnegligently and carelessly releasing] from custody\u201d an inmate in April of 2010:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">As a result of an Internal Investigation the following administrative violation has been <em>sustained </em>against you:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATL\"><em>Charge </em># <em>1: Negligent or Careless in Performing Duties</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">Source: Montgomery County Personnel Regulations 2001</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">Section: 33-5 Causes for Disciplinary Actions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Number: (h) p. 217</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-4\">On April 13, 2010, while on duty, DSIII Eric Gindlesperger was negligent and careless in performing his official duties as a deputy sheriff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">\n<em>To Wit:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">On April 13, 2010, DSIII Eric Gindlesperger negligently and carelessly released from custody Calvin Miller, an inmate committed to the Montgomery County Department of Correction and Rehabilitation, from the District Court of Maryland, in Rockville, MD.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">As a result of this violation, the following <em>Disciplinary Action </em>is being taken:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">\n<em>Summary Punishment:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\"><em>Charge </em># <em>1: </em>Negligent or Careless in Performing Duties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">Sustained \u2014 2 days suspension without pay</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">Deputy Gindlesperger refused the summary punishment, disputed the charge and requested an LEOBR hearing, which was initially scheduled for July of 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">In June of 2010, Deputy Gindlesperger submitted three subpoenas to Sheriff Raymond Eight. The first two subpoenas sought the attendance and testimony of two witnesses; they are not in issue in this case. The third request sought the production of various documents before the hearing, which was opposed by Sheriff Eight on the basis that Section 3-107(d)(1) of the LEOBR did not authorize compelling production of documents before the hearing. Before any formal determination by the hearing board as to whether to issue the subpoena, Deputy Gindlesperger filed a Petition for Show Cause Order <em>&amp; </em>Motion For A Stay Of Proceedings Before The Montgomery County Sheriffs Office in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County; the Circuit Court denied the Motion to Show Cause without prejudice but granted the motion to stay proceedings in order \u201cto allow the Hearing Officer an opportunity to rule on Petitioner\u2019s requests for subpoenas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Deputy Gindlesperger then requested that the hearing board issue a subpoena to the Montgomery County Sheriffs Office for the following documents:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">1.

All documents describing the types of conduct the Montgomery County Sheriffs Office deems \u201cnegligent\u201d or \u201ccareless\u201d in effect at the time Deputy Gindlesperger was charged with negligence/carelessness as a result of the April 13th incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">8.

All documents detailing policies for the recommendation of a two-day suspension in effect at the time Deputy Gindlesperger was charged with negligence/carelessness as a result of the April 13th incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">The Instructions Section provided that \u201c[u]nless otherwise stated, each item in this subpoena covers the period from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>January 1, 2005, to the date of the hearing.\u201d (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Sheriff Kight did not object to the production of Deputy Gindlesperger\u2019s personnel file in item 1 and asserted that he was unaware of the existence of any records related to items 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9; none of these requests is in issue before us. Sheriff Kight, however, opposed the production of documents pertaining to items 2 and 6, one relating to the \u201cmistaken release of an inmate\u201d by a particular officer and the other seeking all records relating to the \u201caccidental release of an inmate\u201d since January 2005, respectively, because compelled production of these documents before the hearing was not authorized under Section 3-107(d) and the records requested were not \u201cdiscoverable, relevant or material.\u201d The hearing board denied the subpoena request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">This subpoena has been denied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">In accordance with \u00a7 3-107(d) I have considered the subpoenas but decline to issue at this time, I am denying due to confidentiality, relevance, and necessity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Deputy Gindlesperger then filed another Motion for a Show Cause Order &amp; Stay of Proceedings and Request for a Hearing in the Circuit Court, arguing that compelled production of documents before the hearing was necessary to develop his defense that he accidentally rather than negligently or carelessly released an inmate. Sheriff Kight again opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The Circuit Court, after a hearing, determined that the request for compelled pre-hearing production of records identified in categories 2 and 6 of the subpoena, pertaining to a particular officer\u2019s \u201cmistaken release of an inmate\u201d and any \u201caccidental release of an inmate for the time period\u201d since January 2005, was governed by Section 3-107(d)(1), specifically the phrase \u201c[i]n connection with a disciplinary hearing,\u201d which it construed to include time before the hearing. The Circuit Court Judge then determined that the timing of compelled pre-hearing production of documents should be defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>by the amount of time required to review documents before the hearing and concluded, based on the estimated quantity of records at issue, that those records should be produced five days before the hearing. The Circuit Court denied the Motion to Stay Proceedings as moot, and Sheriff Popkin timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Whether Section 3 \u2014 107(d)(1) entitles Deputy Gindlesperger to compelled production of documents and records before an LEOBR hearing, pursuant to a subpoena appropriately issued before the hearing, is the gravamen of our consideration. Section 3-107(d)(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">(d) <em>Subpoenas. </em>\u2014 (1) In connection with a disciplinary hearing, the chief or hearing board may issue subpoenas to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, records, and documents as relevant or necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">We have not, heretofore, had the opportunity to interpret this statutory provision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">Sheriff Popkin argues that neither Section 3 \u2014 107(d) nor the larger context of the LEOBR confers an entitlement to compulsion of pre-hearing production of documents. Rather, he argues that the language of the provision, specifically \u201c[i]n connection with a disciplinary hearing,\u201d instructs that only at the hearing may a law enforcement officer enjoy the compelled production of relevant and necessary documents. He contends that a separate LEOBR provision, Section 3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>104(n)(1), limits pre-hearing production only to the disclosure of the investigative file and exculpatory information.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Deputy Gindlesperger, conversely, asserts that compelled pre-hearing production comports with the language and purpose of the LEOBR and is necessary for an adequate defense, a fair trial and due process. He urges us to interpret the plain meaning of \u201c[i]n connection with a disciplinary hearing\u201d to include compelled production of documents before the hearing; he cites \u201cthe broad remedial purpose of the LEOBR\u201d and the statute as a whole, including Section 3-107(e)(2) which provides the officer with \u201cample opportunity to present evidence and argument about the issues involved\u201d at the hearing, as confirmation that his proposed broad interpretation is reasonable. He further argues that in order to prepare his defense of disparate treatment, he is entitled to review, in advance of the hearing, the records of officers investigated for the \u201cmistaken release of an inmate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Our goal and the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to \u201cascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Baltimore Police Department, </em>424 Md. 41, 50, 33 A.3d 972, 978 (2011), quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>415 Md. 413, 421, 2 A.3d 368, 373 (2010). To do so, we first look to the language of the statute itself, to \u201cdetermine its \u2018normal, plain meaning,\u2019 and we \u2018neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 33 A.3d at 978. If we determine that the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the purpose of the statute, then our inquiry ends and \u201cwe apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 33 A.3d at 978, quoting <em>Johnson, </em>415 Md. at 421, 2 A.3d at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">By its express language, Section 3-107(d)(l) does not mandate the compelled production of documents before an LEOBR hearing. The omission of the language \u201cbefore a hearing\u201d is telling because the Legislature in the LEOBR did include such language in other sections. In Section 3-104(n) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the LEOBR, pre-hearing disclosure must be made of the name of the witnesses and charges as well as the investigatory file and exculpatory information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">(n) <em>Information provided on completion of </em>investigation.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">(1) On completion of an investigation and at least 10 days <em>before a hearing, </em>the law enforcement officer under investigation shall be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">(1) notified of the name of each witness and of each charge and specification against the law enforcement officer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adk\">(ii) provided with a copy of the investigatory file and any exculpatory information.... [<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">(italics added). In the same vein, the Legislature also instructed the hearing board to notify each party of judicially-noticed facts before or during the hearing, or in preliminary reports under Section 3 \u2014 107(g)(2)(i):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">(2) The hearing board shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">(i) notify each party of the facts so noticed either <em>before </em>or <em>during </em>the hearing, or by reference <em>in preliminary reports </em>or otherwise[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">(italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">Deputy Gindlesperger argues, nonetheless, that the phrase \u201c[i]n connection with a disciplinary hearing\u201d in Section 3-107(d)(1) does serve as a broad, express mandate for prehearing compulsion of the requested documents. Sheriff Pop-kin, conversely, maintains that \u201cin connection with\u201d means at the hearing, such that a subpoena could not compel the production of documents before the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">The Legislature used the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in the LEOBR only in two instances, in Section 3 \u2014 107(d)(1), the present provision under review, and Section 3-107(h)(2), which refers to oath-taking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>(h) <em>Oaths. </em>\u2014 (1) With respect to the subject of a hearing conducted under this subtitle, the chief shall administer oaths or affirmations and examine individuals under oath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">(2) In connection with a disciplinary hearing, the chief or a hearing board may administer oaths.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Connection, when used in the phrase \u201cin connection with,\u201d is defined as a \u201crelationship in fact.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 264 (11th ed.2005). Oath-taking under the LEOBR only occurs at the hearing, so that \u201c[i]n connection with a disciplinary hearing,\u201d then, refers to that which transpires at the hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">We reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s Order because Section 3-107(d)(1) of the LEOBR, by its plain meaning, does not entitle Deputy Gindlesperger to the compelled production of documents in advance of the LEOBR hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.
