(\u201cDr. Kumar\u201d or \u201cPetitioner\u201d) sued Anand M. Dhanda, M.D. (\u201cDr. Dhanda\u201d or \u201cRespondent\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County alleging breach of contract and the breach of a covenant not to compete. The contract at issue provided for disputes to be initially addressed through mandatory, non-binding arbitration. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss the action, asserting that the suit was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Petitioner opposed dismissal, arguing that the complaint was timely because his cause of action had either not \u201caccrued\u201d or that limitations was tolled until the completion of arbitration. The trial court dismissed the action as time-barred and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. Based on the record before us, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and hold that while non-binding arbitration may have been a condition precedent to litigation, it neither affected the accrual of the underlying breach of contract claims, nor otherwise tolled the statute of limitations applicable to maintaining an action in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The complex procedural history essential to our resolution of this case stems from a single contract, prepared without the assistance of counsel. Petitioner and Respondent entered into an employment agreement (\u201cthe contract\u201d or \u201cthe agreement\u201d) on August 28, 2001, whereby Respondent agreed to work as a doctor in Petitioner\u2019s urology practice through August 31, 2002. The contract contained, <em>inter alia, </em>a non-compete clause which prohibited Respondent from practicing within a specified radius of Petitioner\u2019s multiple offices or soliciting or accepting Petitioner\u2019s patients for three years following the expiration of the contract, or through August of 2005. An addendum to the contract prohibited Dr. Dhanda, during the term of the agreement, from practicing medicine or engaging in other professional activities outside of Dr. Kumar\u2019s practice, unless he obtained the consent of the association. The con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>tract also included the following mandatory, non-binding arbitration clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">D. <em>Arbitration: </em>All disputes arising out of this Agreement [excluding one paragraph], shall be resolved pursuant to arbitration conducted in accordance with the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, in Baltimore, Maryland. Both parties can go to Court if not satisfied by the decision of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act [sic].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">As a result of discord between the parties, the employment relationship was not renewed upon termination of the Agreement on August 31, 2002. Soon thereafter, Respondent filed an initial suit for breach of contract against Petitioner in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. He sought damages for an alleged breach of contract based on Petitioner\u2019s refusal to grant Respondent partner status in the business and the withholding of certain monies.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Petitioner filed an Answer and Demand for Jury Trial on October 18, 2002, which noted that \u201cdisputes are to be submitted to arbitration pursuant to agreement between the parties.\u201d Four months later, on February 26, 2003, Petitioner filed a motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss the action. The judge presiding in Anne Arundel County dismissed the action without prejudice on April 24, 2003, stating that the \u201cclaims are subject to mandatory arbitration,\u201d but noting that \u201c[t]he case may be reopened to enforce the arbitration award, if necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The record is silent with regard to any activity between the parties for over two years following this dismissal. On April 29, 2005, however, Petitioner filed, in the Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Baltimore City, a petition to compel arbitration and to appoint an arbitrator. The petition also included separate counts concerning the substantive claims for breach of contract and breach of the non-compete provision. Following an apparent delay in service, on March 9, 2006, Respondent filed both a response to Petitioner\u2019s petition to compel arbitration and his own motion to dismiss the substantive counts for improper venue and as claims subject to mandatory arbitration. Petitioner then filed a response to the motion to dismiss, offering to withdraw the substantive counts if the Circuit Court would compel arbitration in order to resolve the issues. The court dismissed the substantive counts on April 28, 2006, but did not order arbitration. Four months later, on August 25, 2006, Petitioner filed a motion for summary judgment, urging the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to grant the earlier petition to compel arbitration. Following a brief bench trial, on November 20, 2006, the presiding judge granted the petition to compel arbitration and appointed J. Snowden Stanley, Jr. as the arbitrator the underlying dispute between the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">After this apparent victory in securing an order compelling arbitration, Petitioner allowed nearly two more years to pass before actually submitting the matter to the arbitrator in March of 2008. Mr. Stanley issued his award on June 20, 2008. The award denied all relief to Petitioner and also denied relief to Respondent, save for an award of $868.00 as reimbursement for certain disability insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Finally, on March 16, 2009, almost a year after the arbitration award was issued, Petitioner filed the instant action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The complaint stated that \u201c[t]he Agreement requires arbitration as a requirement before Plaintiff can pursue a remedy in court ... [t]he matter went to Arbitration, and a decision in favor of the Defendant was rendered in June of 2008. This matter is brought <em>de novo.\u201d </em>Respondent filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the applicable three-year statute of limitations barred the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>because the alleged breaches of contract occurred between 2002 and 2005. Petitioner filed in opposition, contending that, because completion of arbitration was a condition precedent to filing a claim, the statute of limitations had not begun to run until the arbitration decision of June 20, 2008. After a hearing and supplemental briefing by the parties, Judge McGann, of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County dismissed the action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Petitioner noted a timely<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and the intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal. <em>Kumar v. Dhanda, </em>198 Md.App. 337, 17 A.3d 744 (2011). We granted <em>certiorari </em>in the instant case, <em>Kumar v. Dhanda, </em>420 Md. 463, 23 A.3d 895 (2011), to address the following questions presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">1. Where a contract specifically requires that the parties submit to non-binding arbitration, and states that the parties may \u201cgo to court if not satisfied by the decision of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, [sic]\u201d does the cause of action accrue at the time of the breach or at the time of the non-binding arbitration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">2. When the parties agree not to \u201cgo to court\u201d until after a non-binding arbitration, does the statute of limitations begin to run at the time of the breach or at the time a party can \u201cgo to court?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">We shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and hold that while non-binding arbitration, mandated by the contract, may have constituted a condition precedent to litigation, pursuing arbitration neither postponed the accrual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>of the underlying breach of contract claims, nor otherwise tolled the statute of limitations applicable to maintaining an action in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">We recently reiterated the standard of review applicable to motions to dismiss in <em>Parks v. Alpharma, Inc., </em>421 Md. 59, 25 A.3d 200 (2011), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">On appeal from a dismissal for failure to state a claim, we must assume the truth of, and view in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, all well-pleaded facts and allegations contained in the complaint, as well as all inferences that may reasonably be drawn from them, and order dismissal only if the allegations and permissible inferences, if true, would not afford relief to the plaintiff, <em>i.e., </em>the allegations do not state a cause of action for which relief may be granted. We must confine our review of the universe of facts pertinent to the court\u2019s analysis of the motion to the four corners of the complaint and its incorporated supporting exhibits, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\"><em>Parks, </em>421 Md. at 72, 25 A.3d at 207 (internal quotations omitted). In the instant case, Respondent moved to dismiss based on the affirmative defense of limitations, asserting that Petitioner\u2019s claims regarding the underlying contractual disputes were time barred, as a matter of law. We have held consistently that \u201cthe question of accrual in \u00a7 5-101 is left to judicial determination.\u201d <em>Frederick Rd. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Brown &amp; Sturm, </em>360 Md. 76, 95, 756 A.2d 963, 973 (2000). We review the grant of Respondent\u2019s motion in order to \u201cdetermine whether the court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Parks, </em>421 Md. at 72, 25 A.3d at 207 (quotation omitted), <em>accord Doe v. Roe, </em>419 Md. 687, 693, 20 A.3d 787, 791 (2011) (\u201cIn reviewing the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, our task is confined to determining whether the trial court was legally correct in its decision to dismiss.\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The applicable statute of limitations is encompassed in Maryland Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 5-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which states that: \u201c[a] civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it <em>accrues </em>unless another provision of the Code provides a different period of time within which an action shall be commenced.\u201d <em>See Jones v. Hyatt Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>356 Md. 639, 647 &amp; n. 5, 741 A.2d 1099, 1103 &amp; n. 5 (1999) (applying \u00a7 5-101 to a breach of contract claim); <em>Baltimore County v. RTKL Assocs., </em>380 Md. 670, 689, 846 A.2d 433, 444 (2004) (same); <em>Himelfarb v. American Express Co., </em>301 Md. 698, 703, 484 A.2d 1013, 1015 (1984) (same); <em>Millstone v. St. Paul Travelers, </em>183 Md.App. 505, 515, 962 A.2d 432, 437 (2008) (holding that a suit filed on a specified date \u201cwould have been well within the three year statute of limitations that is generally applicable to contract actions.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>412 Md. 424, 987 A.2d 116 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Petitioner first contends that because the contract between the parties required the completion of non-binding arbitration as a condition precedent to filing suit, his causes of action had not \u201caccrued\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5-101 until the arbitration award was issued on June 20, 2008. Therefore, under his argument, Petitioner would have had three years from that date, or until June 20, 2011, to timely file in court. In support of this theory, he cites case law in which we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">It is clear that the test to be utilized in fixing the accrual date of a cause of action \u201cis to ascertain the time when plaintiff could have first maintained his action to a successful result. The fact that he might have brought a premature or groundless action is immaterial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\"><em>James v. Weisheit, </em>279 Md. 41, 44, 367 A.2d 482, 484 (1977) (quoting <em>W., B. &amp; A. Elec. R.R. Co. v. Moss, </em>130 Md. 198, 205, 100 A. 86, 89 (1917)); <em>accord Henry\u2019s Drive-In, Inc. v. Pappas, </em>264 Md. 422, 428, 287 A.2d 35, 38 (1972) (\u201c[Limitations will run from the time the plaintiff could have acted.... \u201d). Inserting the language from these precedents into his argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ment, Petitioner summarizes the instant case in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\">Dr. Dhanda filed a premature lawsuit in Anne Arundel County. That lawsuit was dismissed because the contract between the parties required them to go to arbitration before they could \u201cgo to court.\u201d Dr. Dhanda\u2019s suit was premature and could not be pursued to a successful result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">The same logic applies to Dr. Shailendra Kumar M.D., P.A.\u2019s suit. The association could not have brought its lawsuit until June 2[0], 2008. By the terms of the contract it was not permitted to \u201cgo to court\u201d before that date. Any suit filed before that date would have been premature and would have been dismissed. Therefore, the cause of action did not accrue until that date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Respondent argues otherwise, asserting that the causes of action for breach of contract accrued for the purpose of the statute of limitations at the time of the alleged breaches. Accordingly, the latest possible date for accrual of the breach of contract cause of action was the contract\u2019s termination date of August 31, 2002, and the latest date for the accrual of the breach of the non-compete clause was August 31, 2005, the date upon which the clause expired by its own terms. Applying the three-year statute of limitation to these dates makes clear that both claims were time-barred when Petitioner instituted the current suit on March 16, 2009, and were therefore properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We agree with Respondent\u2019s assessment of the applicable accrual dates. As our case law makes clear, in the context of the statute of limitations, \u201c[t]he law is concerned with accrual in the sense of testing whether all of the <em>elements </em>of a cause of action have occurred so that it is complete.\u201d <em>St. Paul Travelers v. Millstone, </em>412 Md. 424, 432, 987 A.2d 116, 121 (2010) (emphasis added) (quotation omitted). In breach of contract cases, a cause of action typically accrues at the time of the breach. <em>See Jones v. Hyatt Insurance Agency, Inc., </em>356 Md. 639, 648, 741 A.2d 1099, 1104 (1999); <em>Federalsburg v. Allied Con., </em>275 Md. 151, 157, 338 A.2d 275, 280 (1975); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>Cotham v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>260 Md. 556, 562, 273 A.2d 115, 118 (1971). In the instant case, although not specifying the particular dates, both parties agree that the alleged breaches of contract occurred more than three years prior to the filing of the complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The cases Petitioner cites in order to assert that limitations does not begin to run until a plaintiff can \u201cmaintain his action to a successful result,\u201d all concerned whether the necessary elements of a cause of action had arisen under the facts that were presented. <em>See James v. Weisheit, </em>279 Md. 41, 44, 367 A.2d 482, 484 (1977) (analyzing accrual as the point in time that \u201cthe plaintiff could have proved all five of the essential elements of deceit\u201d); <em>Henry\u2019s Drive-In, Inc. v. Pappas, </em>264 Md. 422, 287 A.2d 35 (1972) (considering whether a cause of action could arise for breach of lease before the lessor made a demand for payment); <em>W., B. &amp; A. Elec. R.R. Co. v. Moss, </em>130 Md. 198, 100 A. 86 (1917) (evaluating, and ultimately remanding to the jury, whether the plaintiffs claim was barred by limitations in a <em>quantum meruit </em>suit where plaintiff asserted that he had completed the services less than three years prior to filing). In the instant case, neither party disputes that all of the <em>elements </em>of Petitioner\u2019s breach of contract claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>existed, at the very latest, as of the dates upon which the applicable contractual provisions terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">As the intermediate appellate court aptly noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">The fact that Dr. Kumar and Dr. Dhanda had contracted, pursuant to the Agreement, to engage in non-binding arbitration as a condition precedent to bringing suit in circuit court did not mean that Dr. Kumar\u2019s causes of action (or Dr. Dhanda\u2019s causes of action) did not accrue under CJP section 5-101 when all of their elements had arisen. (Indeed, both parties\u2019 causes of action necessarily had to have accrued even before arbitration was undertaken; otherwise the arbitrator would not have had the claims before him to resolve.) It meant only that the parties, and each of them, had to take timely steps to engage in arbitration before limitations expired; enter into a further agreement to toll limitations; or file suit and request a stay pending arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\"><em>Kumar, </em>198 Md.App. at 345, 17 A.3d at 749 (footnote omitted). We agree with this analysis. As we explain, <em>infra, </em>Petitioner was not precluded by the contractual language from filing suit in the proper court and seeking a stay of the action pending arbitration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the intermediate appellate court noted, \u201c[t]he permissive language, \u2018can go to court,\u2019 does not prohibit a party from filing suit prophylactically to guard against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>running of the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Kumar, </em>198 Md.App. at 345 n. 3, 17 A.3d at 749 n. 3. Petitioner asserts before this Court, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u201cthe specific language of the arbitration clause contradicts [the holding of the Court of Special Appeals]. The clause says that the parties must resolve the matter by arbitration. If not satisfied, the parties can \u201cgo to court.\u201d There is no right to bypass the arbitration or make a \u201cprophylactic\u201d filing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">To bolster his point, Petitioner cites the Ninth Circuit case of <em>Wolsey, Ltd. v. Foodmaker, Inc., </em>144 F.3d 1205 (9th Cir.1998), which explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">Although it defies easy definition, the essence of arbitration, we think, is that, when the parties agree to submit their disputes to it, they have agreed to arbitrate these disputes through to completion, <em>i.e. </em>to an award made by a third-party arbitrator. Arbitration does not occur <em>until the process is completed and the arbitrator makes a decision. </em>Hence, if one party seeks an order compelling arbitration and it is granted, the parties must then arbitrate their dispute to an arbitrators\u2019 decision, and <em>cannot seek recourse to the courts before that time.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\"><em>Wolsey, Ltd., </em>144 F.3d at 1208 (quoting <em>Harrison v. Nissan Motor Corp., </em>111 F.3d 343, 350 (3rd Cir.1997)) (emphasis in original). It is clear to us, however, that the <em>Wolsey </em>Court uses the word \u201crecourse,\u201d to signify litigating for judicial resolution of a case, which is by definition different than filing an action in order to ensure later compliance with the statute of limitations. <em>See Harris v. Bridgford, </em>153 Md.App. 193, 206, 835 A.2d 253, 260 (2003) (\u201cMaryland courts have indicated ... that <em>full judicial resolution </em>of the dispute constitutes a waiver [of the right to arbitration], but some limited participation in judicial proceedings does not.\u201d (emphasis added) (citations omitted)). The <em>Wolsey </em>case, therefore, does not lend support to Petitioner\u2019s argument, and is not inconsistent with the fact that Petitioner could have filed a timely action and sought a stay of his substantive claims pending arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Indeed, the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, to which the parties agreed to be bound,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> specifically allows for stays of court proceedings pending arbitration. It states:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">3-209. Stay of Proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">(a) <em>Conditions for stay. </em>\u2014 A court shall stay any action or proceeding involving an issue subject to arbitration if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">(1) A petition for order to arbitrate has been filed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">(2) An order for arbitration has been made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">(b) <em>Severability of issue. </em>\u2014 If the issue subject to arbitration is severable, the court may order the stay with respect to this issue only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">(c) <em>Order to include stay. </em>\u2014 If a petition to stay has been filed with a court where any action or proceeding concerning arbitration is pending, the court\u2019s order to arbitrate shall include the stay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Md.Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 3-209 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. In accordance with the statute, this Court and the Court of Special Appeals have recognized the ability of a party to file an action to compel arbitration and seek a stay of claims that are related to arbitrable issues. <em>See Frederick Contractors, Inc. v. Bel Pre Medical Ctr., Inc., </em>274 Md. 307, 316, 334 A.2d 526, 531 (1975) (\u201cBecause we have a viable precedent in our case law, we have no hesitancy in holding that while Bel Pre, by demanding arbitration, should have been allowed to stay the [mechanic\u2019s lien foreclosure] proceedings in the circuit court, such a stay will remain effective only until arbitration is concluded or Bel Pre\u2019s demand is withdrawn.\u201d); <em>Letke Sec. Contractors, Inc. v. United States Sur. Co., </em>191 Md.App. 462, 471, 991 A.2d 1306, 1311 (2010) (noting that under the Arbitration Act \u201c[n]ot only suits to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s award, but also suits to compel arbitration and <em>suits to stay court action pending arbitration, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>are now to be viewed as \u2018favored\u2019 actions.\u201d (emphasis added) (quotation omitted)); <em>Redemptorists v.

Although this mode of dispute resolution may not necessarily promote the efficiency, speed, or economy achieved through binding arbitration, it will nevertheless be enforced as a term agreed upon by the parties. <em>See Gold Coast Mall, Inc. v. Larmar Corp., </em>298 Md. 96, 103, 468 A.2d 91, 95 (1983) (\u201cArbitration is a matter of contract which the parties should be allowed to conduct in accordance with their agreement.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>NRT Mid-Atlantic, Inc., v.

In its non-binding form, arbitration is a condition precedent to litigation, however, the parties are not bound by the decision of the arbitrator and afterwards are free to pursue independent legal claims concerning the same issues pursued in arbitration. <em>See General Accident Ins.

Therefore, even where all issues are subject to non-binding arbitration, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>party should be able to seek a stay of the legal claims pending arbitration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>By way of comparison, the principle of staying an action involving an issue subject to non-binding arbitration is similar to that specifically approved by this Court in <em>Arroyo v. Board of Educ. of Howard County, </em>381 Md. 646, 851 A.2d 576 (2004), with respect to administrative proceedings generally. That case involved an educator\u2019s wrongful termination action, which he filed in court over three years after the final administrative decision upholding his termination. We made clear that, in accordance with the primary administrative remedies available to the plaintiff under Maryland Code (1978, 2001 Repl.Vol., 2003 Supp.) \u00a7 6-202(a) of the Education Article, the statute of limitations on Arroyo\u2019s civil cause of action began to run no later than after the final administrative decision, making his tort claim time-barred as a matter of law. We also explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">[Wjhere there is both an administrative remedy and an independent judicial remedy <em>(i.e., </em>a specific judicial remedy exists other than judicial review of the administrative decision), where the administrative agency may have primary jurisdiction, and where the plaintiff invokes the judicial remedy prior to exhausting the administrative procedures ... the trial court may retain jurisdiction pending exhaustion of the administrative procedures. Once the administrative procedures are exhausted, the trial court may proceed; the plaintiff whose case is meritorious may be entitled to whatever relief is available under either the independent judicial action or the administrative/judicial review remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoW\"><em>Arroyo, </em>381 Md. at 659-60, 851 A.2d at 584 (quoting <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n v.

Accordingly, we empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>sized that in addition to being free to file his legal action immediately after the final administrative decision was issued, the plaintiff could \u201chave filed it even sooner subject to the separate action being stayed during the administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>Arroyo, </em>381 Md. at 650, 851 A.2d at 579. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUS\">[WJe perceive that there is no prohibition against <em>filing </em>an independent judicial action while primary administrative proceedings are under way, but, that there is a prohibition against <em>deciding, i.e., adjudicating, </em>the issue in the independent judicial case until a final administrative determination is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><em>Arroyo, </em>381 Md. at 660, 851 A.2d at 584-585 (emphasis added); <em>McCullough v.

Therefore, under these circumstances, the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the arbitrable claims is neither \u201cextremely limited,\u201d <em>Letke Sec. Contrs., Inc. v. United States Sur. Co., </em>191 Md.App. 462, 472, 991 A.2d 1306, 1312 (2010), nor is the action governed by the limitation periods applicable to appeals of binding arbitration awards. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-223; \u00a7 3-224 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Like the situation in <em>Arroyo, </em>while <em>resolution </em>of the legal action must wait until the satisfaction of the condition precedent, the court\u2019s jurisdiction may be maintained and the claim properly stayed prior to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">It is clear, as discussed <em>supra, </em>that Petitioner\u2019s cause of action accrued more than three years prior to his filing suit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>We now examine the issue implicated by Petitioner\u2019s second question before this Court, namely, whether the limitations period was tolled by either a legislative or judicial exception at any point after accrual. We can find no applicable exception to Maryland Code \u00a7 5-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or language within the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, Maryland Code \u00a7\u00a7 3-201 to 3-234 that would toll the statute of limitations in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This of course, suggests the legislature\u2019s intent that the general statute of limitations not be tolled by the pursuit of arbitration. <em>See Booth Glass Co. Inc. v. Huntingfield Corp., </em>304 Md. 615, 623, 500 A.2d 641, 645 (1985) (\u201cIndeed, the General Assembly has expressly provided exceptions to \u00a7 5-101 in those instances where it determined that a time limitation should be computed differently.\u201d). Further, as explained <em>infra, </em>we decline to adopt a judicial tolling exception to accomplish a result neither intended by the legislature under the Act, nor consistent with the purposes of the statute of limitations. <em>See Garay v. Overkoltzer, </em>332 Md. 339, 359, 631 A.2d 429, 439 (1993) (noting the general rule that \u201cwhere the legislature has not expressly provided for an exception in a statute of limitations, the court will not allow any implied or equitable exception to be engrafted upon it.\u201d (citations omitted) (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>In <em>Bertonazzi v. Hillman, </em>241 Md. 361, 216 A.2d 723 (1966), we recognized a judicial tolling exception where a case was filed timely, but in the incorrect forum. The plaintiff in <em>Bertonazzi </em>mistakenly believed that the defendant lived in Baltimore County rather than Baltimore City, and therefore filed suit in the County. By the time the Circuit Court for Baltimore County dismissed the suit for improper venue, the Baltimore City filing was time-barred. In reversing, this Court reasoned that a tolling exception was consistent with the policy inherent in the statute of limitations. We said, \u201c[statutes of limitations are designed primarily to assure fairness to defendants on the theory that claims, asserted after evidence is gone, memories have faded, and witnesses disappeared, are so stale as to be unjust.\u201d <em>Bertonazzi, </em>241 Md. at 367, 216 A.2d at 726. Under the facts presented it was clear that \u201c[t]he appellee ... was as fully put on notice of the appellant\u2019s claim by the suit in Baltimore County as she would have been by suit in Baltimore City....\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further explained the rationale behind our <em>Bertonazzi </em>holding in the later case, <em>Walko Corp. v. Burger Chef Systems, Inc., </em>281 Md. 207, 378 A.2d 1100 (1977). There, we noted that the narrow exception to the general rule against implying exceptions to the statute of limitations was supported in <em>Bertonazzi </em>by the fact that, at the time, Maryland was one of few states to have neither a saving statute nor a venue transfer statute, \u201ca fact which, absent the Court\u2019s limited holding, might well have wrought great injustice on unwitting plaintiffs in particular cases.\u201d <em>Walko Corp., </em>281 Md. at 214, 378 A.2d at 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">In <em>Philip Morris v. Christensen, </em>394 Md. 227, 905 A.2d 340 (2006) we reaffirmed <em>Bertonazzi </em>and explicated for the first time two factors which continue to guide our consideration of whether to apply a judicial tolling exception in a particular case. In order for an exception to be applied we must find that: \u201c(1) there is persuasive authority or persuasive policy considerations supporting the recognition of the tolling exception, and, (2) recognizing the tolling exception is consistent with the generally recognized purposes for the enactment of statutes of limitations.\u201d <em>Philip Morris, </em>394 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>at 238, 905 A.2d at 347. In <em>Philip Morris, </em>we adopted an exception by which the individual causes of action that were also asserted in a class action complaint for putative plaintiff class members, would be tolled during the pendency of the putative class action suit. The exception fulfilled the two conditions for recognizing a tolling exception because it was necessary in order to protect class action procedures under the Maryland Rules, and also maintained fairness to defendants who were already apprized of the claims by virtue of being named in the class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Recently, in <em>Swam v. Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Inc., </em>397 Md. 528, 919 A.2d 33 (2007) we again determined that a judicial tolling exception was appropriate. In that case the plaintiff accompanied her father to the hospital where he would undergo surgery. Plaintiff was injured while in a waiting area, when she was stuck by an uncapped hypodermic needle after placing her hand on a counter. She filed suit in the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office, however, her suit was dismissed because she was not a patient receiving treatment, and therefore her injury was not a \u201cmedical injury\u201d within the meaning of the Maryland Health Care Malpractice Claims Act. Her subsequent claim in the Circuit Court for Harford County was filed beyond the statute of limitations and was therefore also dismissed. In reversing, we held that the complaint related back to the plaintiffs timely, albeit misdirected, filing with the alternative forum and therefore could proceed on the merits. We explained that under the first requirement set out in <em>Philip Morris, </em>the \u201cpersuasive policy supporting the exception\u201d was the \u201cambiguity regarding the appropriate forum for a medically-related claim and basic fairness to the parties.\u201d <em>Swam, </em>397 Md. at 543, 919 A.2d at 41 (noting that \u201c[t]he difficulty in determining the proper forum is analogous to the difficulty faced by the plaintiff in <em>Bertonazzi.\u201d). </em>The second component of the <em>Philip Morris </em>test was met because recognizing a tolling exception \u201cwould not contravene the general purpose of the statute of limitations\u201d as the hospital had notice of the Swams\u2019 claims within three years of the injury such that the claims were not \u201cso stale as to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>unjust.\u201d <em>Swam, </em>397 Md. at 544, 919 A.2d at 42 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">There have also been several cases in which we have refused to recognize a tolling exception because it would not comport with the factors expressed in <em>Philip Morns. </em>Particularly important to our consideration of the issues in the instant case is our decision in <em>Walko Corp. v. Burger Chef Systems, Inc. </em>281 Md. 207, 378 A.2d 1100 (1977). In that case we considered on certification from federal court, whether the statute of limitations was suspended during the pendency of a motion for leave to intervene in a suit against the same defendant, ultimately denied as procedurally defective. <em>Walko, </em>281 Md. at 209, 378 A.2d at 1101 (noting that the federal district court denied the motion to intervene after finding the \u201callegations to be \u2018entirely unrelated to the subject matter\u2019 of the underlying suit.\u201d). We held that there was no justification for tolling the statute of limitation under the facts presented. Despite the fact that fairness to the defendant was arguably ensured, as the defendant would have received notice of the plaintiffs claim through the motion to intervene, other policy reasons militated against recognizing an exception. This conclusion was based on our determination that if tolling were permitted, a plaintiff could, by filing defective motions, \u201ceffectively postpone the running of the statute [of limitations] for an indefinite period of time.\u201d <em>Walko, </em>281 Md. at 215, 378 A.2d at 1104. The plaintiff also had ample opportunity prior to the expiration of the limitations period to file suit, both following the denial of the motion to intervene and during its pendency, but offered \u201cno explanation for its failure to file a separate but timely action.\u201d <em>Walko, </em>281 Md. at 215, 378 A.2d at 1104. From these facts we concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">Walko\u2019s approach to this case was hardly one of vigilance. The statute of limitations reflects a legislative judgment of what is deemed an adequate period of time in which a person of ordinary diligence should bring his action. The unexplained delay in bringing a timely action here hardly bespeaks the ordinary diligence required of one seeking to toll the statute of limitations. In a very real sense, Walko <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>has slept on its rights, and cannot be heard to complain now for its own tarriance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><em>Walko, </em>281 Md. at 215, 378 A.2d at 1104 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Returning to the instant case it is clear that where arbitration is non-binding, \u201cthe court house door remain[s] open to resolve that same controversy <em>provided that a lawsuit is filed before the applicable statute of limitations has run.\u201d </em>3 Thomas H. Oehmke, <em>Commercial Arbitration, </em>49:8 (3rd ed.2011) (emphasis added). We find no \u201cpersuasive authority or persuasive policy considerations supporting the recognition of the tolling exception,\u201d under the facts presented. <em>See Philip Morris, </em>394 Md. at 238, 905 A.2d at 347. There is no doubt that arbitration is favored and encouraged in Maryland because it \u201cprovides an informal, expeditious, and inexpensive alternative to conventional litigation.\u201d <em>RTKL </em>Assocs. <em>Inc. v. Baltimore Cnty., </em>147 Md.App. 647, 656, 810 A.2d 512, 517 (2002) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The ability, however, to contractually affect the statute of limitations applicable to the underlying cause of action within the arbitration agreement, suggests to us that a judicial tolling policy is not necessary to ensure the continued use of arbitration in Maryland or fairness to the parties. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-323(g)(15); <em>Kim v. Comptroller, </em>350 Md. 527, 536, 714 A.2d 176, 180 (1998) (stating that \u201c[statutes of limitation are not ordinarily jurisdictional, and are generally waivable.... \u201d). We agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s assessment that, therefore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">The parties negotiating a mandatory non-binding arbitration agreement thus are free to agree to a provision tolling limitations generally or in the event the arbitration process is not concluded before limitations would run. If the parties so agree, it is known from the outset that limitations will not be a bar. If the parties do not so agree their situation is likewise clear. Limitations will apply (assuming it is raised as an affirmative defense), and therefore any party wanting to make certain that a remedy in circuit court will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>available will need to take steps to ensure that arbitration is completed before limitations runs or to file suit and request a stay within the limitations period if timely completion appears unlikely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><em>Kumar, </em>198 Md.App. at 350, 17 A.3d at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Further, tolling limitations during the pendency of mandatory, non-binding arbitration would not comport with the \u201cgenerally recognized purposes for the enactment of statutes of limitations.\u201d <em>Philip Morris, </em>394 Md. at 238, 905 A.2d at 347. While, to be sure, arbitrating parties are on notice of any possible claims against them, thereby guarding them from stale claims, another purpose of the statute of limitations would be threatened by tolling in this situation. We have repeatedly touted the value of statutes of limitations as not only ensuring fairness between the parties, but also as essential to judicial economy and the pursuit of diligence in litigation. As we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">Statutes of limitations, ... are intended simultaneously to provide adequate time for diligent plaintiffs to file suit, to grant repose to defendants when plaintiffs have tarried for an unreasonable period of time, and to serve societal purposes, including judicial economy. There is no magic to a three-year limit. It simply represents the legislature\u2019s judgment about the- reasonable time needed to institute suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeJ\"><em>Bragunier Masonry Contrs. v.

Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>296 Md. 656, 665, 464 A.2d 1020, 1026 (1983). In declining to adopt a judicial tolling exception in <em>Walko, </em>we emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">[Statutes of limitation] are by definition arbitrary, and their operation does not discriminate between the just and unjust claim, or the voidable and unavoidable delay. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>have come into the law not through the judicial process but through legislation. They represent a public policy about the privilege to litigate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-7\"><em>Walko, </em>281 Md. at 210, 378 A.2d at 1101 (citations and quotation omitted). As demonstrated by the record, summarized again below, Petitioner\u2019s pursuit of his legal claims, just as in <em>Walko, </em>was \u201chardly one of vigilance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The breach encompassed in the first count of Petitioner\u2019s complaint must have occurred no later than August 31, 2002, the date upon which the contract expired by its own terms. Any breach of the non-compete provision must have occurred prior to August 31, 2005, three years after Dr. Dhanda\u2019s termination from employment. The statute of limitations on the claims expired, therefore, at the very latest, on August 31, 2005, and August 31, 2008, respectively. Petitioner filed his petition to compel arbitration in Baltimore City on April 29, 2005. After receiving the Court\u2019s order permitting arbitration in 2006, he delayed two years, until March 2008 to actually submit the claim to the court-appointed arbitrator. After the arbitration award was issued in June of 2008, and Petitioner, under his own logic could \u201cgo to court,\u201d he waited another nine months before filing in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on March 16, 2009. Therefore, we hold that when Petitioner filed his cause of action nearly six years after the termination of the contract, and more than three years after the expiration of the non-compete provision, his action was time-barred, as a matter of law. It is more than feasible that arbitration could have been completed before the expiration of the three-year statute of limitations, and nothing prevented Petitioner from filing his claims and requesting a stay if timely arbitration was in doubt. Thus, while completion of arbitration may have represented a condition precedent to litigation, because of Petitioner\u2019s failure timely file in court he \u201ccannot be heard to complain now for [his] own tarriance.\u201d <em>See Walko, </em>281 Md. at 215, 378 A.2d at 1104 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The issue is not before us on <em>certiorari, </em>and Respondent does not dispute that the appeal was timely filed. In any event, we agree with the intermediate appellate court\u2019s analysis that the appeal was, in fact, timely filed pursuant to Maryland Rule l-203(a)(2) (providing, in essence, that if the office of the clerk is closed on the last day of the period for filing a paper in court, the period will run until the end of the next day that the office is open.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b222-6\">.

The Arbitration Act provides for specific, extremely limited judicial review, such that any post-arbitration proceeding will not constitute a renewed adjudication of the merits of the controversy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-223(b) (grounds for correcting or modifying award); \u00a7 3-224(b) (grounds for vacating award); \u00a7 3-224(c) (\"The court shall not vacate the award or refuse to confirm the award on the ground that a court of law or equity could not or would not grant the same relief.\u201d); <em>Bd. of Educ. of Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Prince George's Cnty. Educators\u2019 Assoc., Inc., </em>309 Md. 85, 98, 522 A.2d 931, 937 (1987) (noting that with regard to binding arbitration, \u201c[arbitrators are judges chosen by the parties to decide the matters ... finally and without appeal.... A contrary course would be a substitution of the judgment of the [judge] in place of the judges chosen by the parties, and would make an award the commencement, not the end, of litigation.\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>Letke Sec. Contrs., Inc. v. United States Sur. Co., </em>191 Md.App. 462, 472, 991 A.2d 1306, 1312 (2010) (\u201c[T]he standard of review of arbitral awards is among the narrowest known to the law. [An appellate court] will not vacate an arbitration award simply because the court would not have made the same award as the arbitrator, or for mere legal error.\u201d (citations omitted) (internal quotation omitted)); <em>Redemptorists, </em>145 Md.App. at 153, 801 A.2d at 1125 (noting in a parenthetical that \"[o]nce a <em>binding </em>[arbitration] award has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>been rendered, issues settled by the award are no longer subject to future arbitration or litigation.\u201d (quoting Martin Domke, <em>Domke on Commercial </em>Arbitration, \u00a7 31:02, at 452 (2nd ed.1984))). Further, seeking such judicial review of binding arbitration awards is governed by special statutory limitations periods under the Act. \u00a7 3-223 (\"A petition to modify or correct the award shall be filed within 90 days after delivery of a copy of the award to the applicant.\u201d); \u00a7 3-224 (\"[A] petition to vacate the award shall be filed within 30 days after delivery of a copy of the award to the petitioner.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b230-5\">. This can be contrasted, for example, with \u00a7 5-202 which states that: \"If a debtor files a petition in insolvency which is later dismissed, the time between the filing and dismissal is not included in determining whether a claim against the debtor is barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>See Ali v.

Servs., Inc., </em>416 Md. 249, 259, 6 A.3d 890, 896 (2010) (noting that by enacting the tolling provision, \"the Maryland Legislature has made it its business to give plaintiffs additional time [to file suit]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\">. This statute can be contrasted with Maryland's Health Claims Mediation and Arbitration Act which does explicitly provide for the tolling of the statute of limitations pending completion of arbitration in front of the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office. <em>Group Health Assn., Inc. v. Blumenthal, </em>295 Md. 104, 115, 453 A.2d 1198, 1205 (1983).
