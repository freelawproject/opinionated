A year-long disagreement between Forster and the Board of Trustees (the Board) of the Office of Public Defender (\u201cthe Office\u201d) (collectively referred to as \u201cthe State\u201d) over operation of the Office culminated penultimately in a letter from the Board to Forster demanding a suite of management and personnel changes in the Office, accompanied with a warning that, if the changes were not implemented by a date certain, Forster would be terminated. Forster refused to acquiesce to the Board\u2019s demands, contending that the Board lacked the authority to issue such edicts, their implementation would harm indigent clients, cost more money than would be saved, and would violate provisions of the Public Defender Act. True to its threat, the Board terminated Forster. In response, Forster filed a wrongful discharge action against Appellee, the State of Maryland, Office of the Public Defender, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The Circuit Court, on the State\u2019s motion, dismissed Forster\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, one of the two grounds advanced by the State in its motion. The Court did not reach the merits of the State\u2019s other assertion that Forster failed to exhaust her available administrative remedies under the State Personnel and Pensions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Forster maintains before us that the Circuit Court granted erroneously the State\u2019s motion to dismiss because, under our jurisprudence regarding wrongful discharge, she pleaded properly the elements of that cause of action, including that the Board\u2019s demands of her for action were ultra vires and illegal. We do not reach, however, the merits of this claim. As a threshold matter, we conclude that Forster failed to exhaust the available and primary administrative remedy provided to at-will, executive service State employees under Ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ryland Code (1994, 2009 Repl.Vol.), State Personnel &amp; Pensions Article, \u00a7 11-305, even though she was not given written notice by the Board of the availability of that avenue of appeal. By parity of reasoning with our opinion in <em>Smack v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 835 A.2d 1175 (2003), and the rule of statutory construction that when two statutory provisions appear to conflict, that the more specific statute serves as an exception to the more general one, we conclude that \u00a7 11-305 applies to a termination of an at-will State employee, whether for misconduct or for no reason at all. Section 11-106 applies to at-will State employee misconduct where the disciplinary action taken is other than termination. Because \u00a7 11-305 does not require the appointing authority to provide notice of the available administrative appeal, and Forster failed to appeal administratively her termination, we conclude, as a matter of law, that Forster\u2019s complaint was barred by the doctrine of administrative exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">I. FACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">On 21 August 2009, Forster was terminated as Maryland\u2019s State Public Defender. Forster served as the State Public Defender for five years. She was employed by the Office of the Public Defender for twenty-five years in sum. The General Assembly established the Office, a semi-autonomous agency within the Executive Branch of State government, in 1971. <em>See </em>1971 Md. Laws 209, \u00a7 1; Maryland Code (1971), Art. 27A, \u00a7 3(a) (the \u201cPublic Defender Act\u201d). The stated policy of the Public Defender Act is to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">(1) provide for the realization of the constitutional guarantees of counsel in the .representation of indigent individuals, including related necessary services and facilities, in criminal and juvenile proceedings in the State; (2) assure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>effective assistance and continuity of counsel to indigent accused individuals taken into custody and indigent individuals in criminal and juvenile proceedings before the courts of the State; and (3) authorize the Office of the Public Defender to administer and assure enforcement of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARE\">Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 16-201. The State Public Defender is the executive head of the Office, and is appointed by, and serves at the pleasure of, the Board of Trustees. Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 16-203(a). The primary duty of the State Public Defender is to \u201cprovide representation for indigent individuals.\u201d Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 16-207(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The State Public Defender is empowered to appoint a Deputy Public Defender, District Public Defenders, and other personnel to assist him or her in performing the duties of the Office. Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 16-203(c), (e). The State Public Defender must maintain the Office \"within its appropriation in the State budget. Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 16-203(g). Additional duties of the State Public Defender include: general responsibility for the operation of the Office; coordination with \u201cprofessional groups about the causes of criminal conduct and the development of effective means to\u201d reduce crime and rehabilitate those charged and convicted of crimes; and adoption of regulations and programs to carry out the purpose of the Public Defender Act. Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 16-207. Panel attorneys (attorneys in private practice appointed to represent certain, select indigent individuals) are supervised by the State Public Defender. Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 16-208(a). Each year, the State Public Defender must submit a report to the Board, the Governor, and the General Assembly providing data regarding the projected needs of the Office, the number and types of cases handled, the disposition of its cases, and recommendations for statutory changes. Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 16-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The Board is comprised of three members appointed by the governor. Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 16 \u2014 301(b). The duties of the Board are to \u201c(1) study and observe the operation of the Office; (2) coordinate the activities of the regional advisory boards; and (3) advise the Public Defender on panels of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>attorneys, fees, and other matters about the operation of the public defender system.\u201d Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 16-302. In addition to appointing the State Public Defender, the Board may exercise veto power over the State Public Defender\u2019s appointment of the Deputy Public Defender and the District Public Defenders. Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 16 \u2014 203(b). Two members of the Board constitute a quorum for taking action. Crim. Proc. Art., \u00a7 16 \u2014 301(f). In 2008, Governor Martin O\u2019Malley re-appointed T. Wray McCurdy (a prior Chair of the Board) to a three-year term as the Chair, re-appointed Margaret Mead to a three-year term, and appointed Theresa Moore to a three-year term.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Forster was appointed to the position of State Public Defender in 2004. For a year or so preceding her termination in August 2009, Forster and the Board engaged in a dispute over management of the Office. The dispute may be traced most clearly to 10 July 2008, when the freshly re-appointed/appointed Board notified Forster that they wanted to meet and discuss issues, including \u201c[t]he status and role of the Juvenile Defenders program\u201d and \u201cupper level management positions\u201d at the Office. The Board noted concerns, during a meeting on 5 August 2008 attended by Forster, specifically about the incumbent Deputy Public Defender and the District Eight Public Defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In the fall of 2008, as she foresaw pressing against the limits of the Office\u2019s budget appropriation, Forster wrote a letter to the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals alerting him that the Office would cease, after its funds were projected to become depleted in April 2009, referring to panel attorneys cases where the Office had a conflict of interest with existing representation of an indigent defendant; thereafter, judges would have to appoint private attorneys to handle such cases, paying them as best as they could (if at all). The Department of Budget and Management requested that Forster reduce the fiscal year 2010 budget by $3 million and, on 3 October 2008, Forster ceased paneling cases to private attorneys in all cases, except juvenile matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>On 8 October 2008, Forster met with the Board to explain her budgetary and operations actions. The Board approved the actions. The Chair indicated he would speak to the Governor about getting additional funds for the Office. No additional funds materialized, however. On 23 December 2008, Chair McCurdy emailed Forster requesting a line-byline budget analysis for the next Board meeting. The Board met with Forster and the Office\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) on 7 January 2009 to discuss budget issues. At the meeting, the Board questioned the effectiveness of the Office\u2019s Juvenile Protection Division (\u201cJPD\u201d). Moreover, the Board expressed a view that private panel attorneys should be used in Child in Need of Assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d) cases, rather than Office staff attorneys. The Director of the JPD, in testimony, defended the JPD\u2019s effectiveness at the next Board meeting on 11 February 2009. In response to a Board request at the meeting, Forster emailed the Board an outline of fiscal year 2008 salary information for all Office attorneys and the JPD staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">At the next Board meeting on 11 March 2009, Board members McCurdy and Meade pressed further for private panel attorneys in CINA cases and requested that the JPD and Capital Defense Division be disbanded. McCurdy requested that Forster, in her name, send to all Office employees an email that he authored. The draft email stated, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he Board\u2019s goal is to assist the attorneys and staff to better streamline office procedures [and] to make [the Office] more efficient ... it is imperative to ... eliminate redundancy within the agency.\u201d The email stated further that \u201c[t]he Board requests input from you as to what programs could be eliminated or merged into other existing programs,\u201d and encouraged the staff to speak directly with the Board and offered that their \u201ccommunication with the Board [would] be held in strict confidence and ... without repercussion.\u201d Forster told the Board that sending such an email would undermine her authority and invite complaints from disgruntled employees. Nonetheless, she offered to attempt to re-write the draft email in a way such that its content would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>acceptable to her. She withdrew later that offer, however. She informed the Board further that she would not implement the requested changes to the Office because to do so, in her estimation, would increase costs, harm indigent clients, and violate the Public Defender Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">At the next Board meeting, on 8 April 2009, the Office\u2019s CFO provided budget analyses for the preceding four years and answered Chair McCurdy\u2019s questions as to \u201cwhich budget items over the past four fiscal years have run deficits and by how much each year.\u201d The Board notified Forster that the May meeting was canceled. No meeting was held in June.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">On 2 July 2009, the Board sent a letter to Forster informing her that it was dissatisfied with her performance as the State Public Defender and her failure to make \u201cprogress toward reorganization of the OPD operations.\u201d The letter stated that the Board would terminate Forster if she did not make the following changes within the ensuing 60 days:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">a. Disband the Capital Defense Division and disperse the clerical staff and personnel into the District Public Defender offices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">b. Disband the Juvenile Defender Division and disperse the clerical staff and attorneys into District Public Defender offices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">c. Close Northwest Community Defenders operations and merge them into the traditional district operations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">d. Prepare an annual report pursuant to Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 16-401 that breaks down by district the information required by the Annual Report;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">e. Begin paneling CINA representation in no less than two districts, reassigning CINA attorneys to district operations and administration of CINA paneling operations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">f. Reorganize and justify which, if any, social workers are necessary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">g. Rehire law clerks as needed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-13\">h. Remove [the incumbent] District Eight District Public Defender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>One Board member, Moore, did not concur with the conclusions in the letter and expressed her disagreement directly to the Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">On 13 July 2009, Forster wrote a letter to the Governor asking for a meeting in light of what she described as the \u201cBoard\u2019s ultra vires demands\u201d that would require her to \u201cviolate the law.\u201d Forster sent a letter to the Board on 16 July 2009 contending that the Board\u2019s orders, if executed, were unlawful because they violated the rights of merit-system State employees, demoted State employees without basis, contravened a State hiring freeze, and would cost more than they would save. In her letter, Forster told also the Board effectively that \u201cyou are not the boss of me,\u201d e.g., it did not have the legal authority \u201cto order me, as you do in your letter, to demote, fire and hire various personnel, or, in fact, to order me to do anything at all.\u201d On 29 July 2009, Forster met with the Governor and his staff about her concerns. On 11 August 2009, Forster emailed the Board inquiring whether there would be a meeting that month. Chair McCurdy responded \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">On 20 August 2009, the Board met with its legal advisor from the Office of the State Attorney General concerning Forster\u2019s position. The Board voted, two-to-one, to terminate Forster. Later that day, the Board appointed an Acting Public Defender. The next morning, Forster was notified, in a hand-delivered letter, that she was terminated, effective immediately.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Forster did not pursue an administrative appeal of her termination. Instead, on 27 January 2010, she filed a claim with the State Treasurer, under the Maryland Tort Claims Act (\u201cMTCA\u201d). Md.Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>State Gov\u2019t Art., \u00a7 12-107. On the MTCA claim form, Forster indicated that she was terminated \u201cfor refusing to obey a negligent, unlawful, and <em>ultra vires </em>order from the Board to violate numerous statutory obligations.\u201d Forster sought four million dollars in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">On 16 August 2010, Forster filed a complaint against the State in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City advancing one count of wrongful discharge. The complaint alleged that the Board was authorized by statute only to \u201cstudy and observe the operation of the Office\u201d and to advise; therefore, the Board\u2019s demand of specific actions to be taken by Forster was ultra vires, required Forster to violate State law (the Public Defender Act and the State Personnel and Pensions Article), and was contrary to Maryland\u2019s public policy. She asserted that her refusal to comply with the Board\u2019s unlawful orders rendered her termination wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">On 15 October 2010, the State moved, in writing, to dismiss the complaint. The State\u2019s motion argued that Forster\u2019s complaint was barred because she failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies under Title 11, Subtitle 3 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, before seeking recourse in court. Alternatively, the State contended that Forster\u2019s complaint failed to state a viable claim for the tort of wrongful discharge because, as an at-will employee who could be terminated at any time, she served at the pleasure of the Board. Assuming the truth of Forster\u2019s allegations for the sake of argument, the State argued that her complaint failed to plead the element of wrongful discharge that requires that the termination violate a clear mandate of public policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After receiving respective rejoinders from the parties, the Circuit Court, without a hearing (none was requested), granted, on 25 February 2011, the State\u2019s motion to dismiss. A memorandum opinion memorialized the reason for the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>The Circuit Court\u2019s opinion addressed the alleged public policy violations stemming from the Board\u2019s ultimatum to Forster. The court accepted the truth of Forster\u2019s well-pleaded facts and allegations in her complaint, and reasonable inferences drawn from them. Quoting from <em>McIntyre v. Guild, </em>105 Md.App. 332, 344, 659 A.2d 398, 404 (1995), the opinion stated that Forster needed to assert</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFu\">clear, specific allegations of fact tending to show that the employer either (1) violated the legal rule at issue, or (2) punished the employee for exercising some legal right.... A claim for wrongful discharge may also be asserted in cases where the employee has been discharged for refusing to violate the law, or refusing to violate the legal rights of some third party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Characterizing the dispute between Forster and the Board as \u201cpassionate disagreements about the conduct of Office operations between an at-will executive employee and members of her Board,\u201d the Circuit Court concluded that there was nothing in the complaint that reflected \u201cunlawful or particularly reprehensible conduct of the Board.\u201d Observing that the primary responsibility of the State Public Defender is to provide representation to indigent defendants, the opinion noted that Forster did not allege that the \u201cBoard instructed or required her, or anyone else with the Office, not to provide representation of indigent individuals.\u201d The opinion concluded that Forster\u2019s \u201callegations do not raise even the spectre of a violation of law such as denying legal representation to any individual qualified for [the Office\u2019s] services.\u201d Alluding again to <em>McIntyre, </em>105 Md.App. at 345, 659 A.2d at 404, as well as <em>Lee v. Denro, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 822, 832, 605 A.2d 1017, 1022 (1992), the Circuit Court resolved that \u201c[s]uch differences in opinion, between an executive and members of a board to which the executive answers, without allegations of actual statutory breaches, are too general, too vague, too conclusory as to constitute a prima facie claim of wrongful discharge.\u201d In a footnote, the Circuit Court said it \u201cneed not reach and does not address\u201d the State\u2019s administrative remedy exhaustion ground for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>On 17 March 2011, Forster filed timely a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari on our initiative, <em>Forster v. State, </em>424 Md. 54, 33 A.3d 981 (2011), before the intermediate appellate court could decide the appeal. Appellant poses two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">1. Did the lower court err in granting the motion to dismiss Forster\u2019s wrongful discharge cause of action where she clearly alleged that her employment was terminated because she refused in implement ultra vires orders from the Board of Trustees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">2. Did the lower court err in granting the motion to dismiss Forster\u2019s wrongful discharge cause of action where she plainly alleged that her employment was terminated because she refused to engage in unlawful activity as ordered by the Board, she refused to violate clear public policy and because she exercised her statutorily prescribed duties as the Maryland Public Defender?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The State re-introduced in its brief the failure to exhaust available administrative remedy ground advanced to, but undecided by, the Circuit Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">3. Is Forster\u2019s wrongful discharge action barred by her failure to exhaust administrative remedies that were available to her as a State employee in the executive service under Title 11 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">We hold that a termination of an at-will State executive service employee triggers the primary administrative remedy provided by State Personnel and Pensions Article \u00a7 11-305, which requires terminated at-will State employees to appeal assertedly illegal or unconstitutional terminations through the administrative mechanism of \u00a7 11-113. Forster failed to do so, thus, she failed timely to exhaust the primary and available administrative remedy for her termination and her Circuit Court complaint for wrongful discharge is barred. Therefore, we do not reach the merits of whether the trial court erred in dismissing Forster\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>which relief may be granted. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, we assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts and allegations in the complaint, as well as the reasonable inferences drawn from them, in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>RRC Ne., LLC v. BAA Md., Inc., </em>413 Md. 638, 643, 994 A.2d 430, 433 (2010) (citing <em>Lloyd v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>397 Md. 108, 121-22, 916 A.2d 257, 264-65 (2007)); <em>Sprenger v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>400 Md. 1, 21, 926 A.2d 238, 249-50 (2007); <em>Pendleton v. State, </em>398 Md. 447, 458, 921 A.2d 196, 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Appellate review of the grant of the motion to dismiss evaluates whether the trial court was correct legally. <em>Pendleton, </em>398 Md. at 459, 921 A.2d at 203 (citing <em>Benson v. State, </em>389 Md. 615, 626, 887 A.2d 525, 531 (2005)). To determine whether the trial court\u2019s judgment was correct legally in the present case, we encounter a question of statutory interpretation. We consider the interpretation of a statute without deference. <em>Breslin v. Powell, </em>421 Md. 266, 286, 26 A.3d 878, 885 (2011) (citing <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The goal of statutory interpretation is to \u201c \u2018ascertain and implement, to the extent possible, the legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 304, 835 A.2d at 1178 (quoting <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002)). An appellate court interprets a statute by first looking to its plain language, giving the words their natural and ordinary meaning. <em>Breslin, </em>421 Md. at 286, 26 A.3d at 891 (citing <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments and Tax\u2019n v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>348 Md. 2, 13, 702 A.2d 690, 696 (1997)). To determine the plain meaning of language, we consider also the statutory scheme in which the particular provision or provisions appear. <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339, 1341 (1996) (citing <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor &amp; City </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>Council of Balt., </em>309 Md. 505, 514, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987)) (\u201c[The meaning of the plain language] is controlled by the context in which it appears.\u201d). If the language is clear and unambiguous on its face, our inquiry ends. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Marriott Emps. Fed. Credit Union v. MVA, </em>346 Md. 437, 445, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997)). When two provisions of the large scheme appear to conflict, \u201cthe statutes may be harmonized by viewing the more specific statute as an exception to the more general one.\u201d <em>Gov\u2019t Emps. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r of Md., </em>332 Md. 124, 133, 630 A.2d 713 , 718 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">III. FAILURE TO EXHAUST ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">We consider the State\u2019s contention, as a threshold question, that Forster\u2019s complaint was barred because she failed to exhaust an available and primary administrative remedy. In addition to Maryland Rule 8-131(a) indicating generally that we may consider issues \u201craised in <em>or </em>decided by the trial court,\u201d we may consider, sua sponte, whether available administrative remedies have been exhausted. <em>See, e.g., Md. Reclamation Assocs. v. Harford Cnty., </em>342 Md. 476, 490 n. 10, 677 A.2d 567, 574 n. 10 (1996) (\u201c \u2018[T]he exhaustion or exclusivity of an administrative remedy is ... an issue\u2019 which \u2018an appellate court ordinarily will address even though [it was] not raised by a party\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Moats v. City of Hagerstown, </em>324 Md. 519, 525, 597 A.2d 972, 975 (1991))).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">In the present context, the issue of administrative remedy exhaustion was raised by the State, but the Circuit Court declined to reach this threshold issue in its memorandum opinion, preferring to grapple directly with the sufficiency of Forster\u2019s pleading of her sole claim. This posture, however, does not preclude us from making the jurisdictional determination whether the claim is barred by the doctrine of administrative remedy exhaustion. In the interest of judicial efficiency, we may affirm the judgment of a trial court to grant a motion to dismiss on a different ground than that relied upon by the trial court, as long as the alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ground is before the Court properly on the record. <em>See City of Frederick v.

The administrative remedy exhaustion question is fleshed out sufficiently in the record of the present case and the parties\u2019 briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">There is a general rule in Maryland courts that if there is an available primary administrative remedy provided by the Legislature, it must be exhausted before a party may seek relief from a court. <em>Sprenger, </em>400 Md. at 24, 926 A.2d at 252 (citing <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v.

The Relevant Statutory Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The administrative remedy available to Forster was provided by Title 11 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, available to all State employees within the Executive Branch, with the exception of temporary employees. State Pers. &amp; Pens. Art., \u00a7 11-102. Section 11-104 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article empowers generally an appointing authority to take disciplinary action against a State employee, including written reprimands, suspension without pay, and termination. Prior to disciplining an employee for misconduct, however, the appointing authority must \u201c(1) investigate the alleged misconduct; (2) meet with the employee; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>consider any mitigating circumstances; (4) determine the appropriate disciplinary action, if any, to be imposed; and (5) give the employee a written notice of the disciplinary action to be taken and the employee\u2019s appeal rights.\u201d State Pers. <em>&amp; </em>Pens. Art., \u00a7 11-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">If an employee fails to appeal disciplinary action in accordance with Title 11, the action is considered accepted by the employee. State Pers. &amp; Pens. Art., \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(1). Appeals for employees in the management service, in the executive service, or who are appointed specially are governed specifically by \u00a7 11-113. As the head of a principal unit of State government,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Public Defender is a position in the executive service. State Pers. &amp; Pens. Art., \u00a7 6-404(a)(l). Under \u00a7 11-113, an appeal must be filed within 15 days after the employee receives notice of a disciplinary action taken against him or her. State Pers. <em>&amp; </em>Pens. Art., \u00a7 11 \u2014 113(b)(2)(i). Appeals under this section may challenge the disciplinary action based only on grounds that the discipline was illegal or unconstitutional; the employee bears the burden of proof. State Pers. &amp; Pens. Art., \u00a7 11 \u2014 113(b)(2)(ii), (b)(3). The appeal is taken to the head of the principal unit where the employee is, or was, employed, whose decision on the appeal is the final administrative decision. State Pers. &amp; Pens. Art., \u00a7 11-113(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Termination of State employees in the management and executive services, as well as special appointees, is governed also by State Personnel &amp; Pensions Article, \u00a7 11-305. This provision states that employees subject to its terms are at-will employees who serve at the pleasure of the appointing author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ity and \u201cmay be terminated for any reason that is not illegal or unconstitutional, solely in the discretion of the appointing authority.\u201d State Pers. &amp; Pens. Art., \u00a7 ll-305(b). When executive branch employees are terminated under \u00a7 11-305 they may file a written appeal under \u00a7 11-113. State Pers. &amp; Pens. Art., \u00a7 ll-305(d). No notice by the appointing authority to the fired employee of the availability of the appeal right is required under \u00a7 11-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">B. Relevant Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">We explored the statutory cross-currents of State employee terminations in <em>Smack, </em>concluding that a probationary employee could be terminated without regard to the pre-termination procedural/substantive requirements of \u00a7 11-106. 378 Md. at 314, 835 A.2d at 1184. Stephanie Smack was a social worker still in her mandatory six-month probationary period required by State Personnel &amp; Pensions Article, \u00a7 7-402(a), when she was terminated for failing to attend and conduct a weekly group therapy session with clients in her charge. <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 302, 835 A.2d at 1177. Smack appealed her termination under \u00a7 11-110, but an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) of the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (acting by delegation for the Secretary of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) concluded that termination of a probationary employee, because of the nature of the probationary class of employment, could not be for \u201cmisconduct\u201d and, therefore, Smack was not entitled to the protective pretermination requirements provided by \u00a7 11-106. <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 303, 835 A.2d at 1177-78. The Circuit Court for Worcester County and the Court of Special Appeals agreed with the ALJ. <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 303-04, 835 A.2d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Before this Court, Smack argued that \u00a7 11-106 applied to disciplinary actions based on misconduct taken against any category of State employee, except a temporary employee; thus, her purported termination was subject to the preliminary procedures of \u00a7 11-106 not followed by the employer. <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 303, 835 A.2d at 1177-78. We noted that the termination, demotion, or removal of a probationary em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ployee is governed specifically by two subsections, \u00a7\u00a7 11-303 and 11-304. <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 309, 835 A.2d at 1181. Relying on the precept of statutory construction that when two statutes appear conflicting, and one is general and the other specific (\u201c \u2018the statutes may be harmonized by viewing the more specific statute as an exception to the more general one\u2019 \u201d), we determined that \u00a7 11-303 governed Smack\u2019s termination. <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 306, 835 A.2d at 1179 (quoting <em>Gov\u2019t Emps. Ins. Co., </em>332 Md. at 133, 630 A.2d at 718). Section 11-303 contains stand alone procedures (notice, appeal, suspension) for the termination of probationary employees and does not refer to any other sections of the State Personnel and Pensions Article to layer additional procedures. <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 312, 835 A.2d at 1183. Section 11-106 applies also to disciplinary procedures generally, including termination, against probationary employees, creating the appearance of a conflict with \u00a7 11-303. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Chief Judge Bell, writing for the Court in <em>Smack, </em>noted that, because \u00a7 11-303 is focused narrowly on only one form of discipline, termination, the two sections \u201ccan be reconciled by treating \u00a7 11-303, the more specific of the two, as an exception to \u00a7 11-106, the more general.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He concluded that where \u201cthere is a provision that specifically, and without any doubt, addresses the termination, as opposed to the discipline generally, of probationary employees, that provision must control over a provision that applies, but only generally, as \u00a7 11-106 does.\u201d <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 313, 835 A.2d at 1183. Providing a separate procedure for termination of probationary employees does not render \u00a7 11-106 illogical or inconsistent because the General Assembly permitted the appointing authority \u201cto take disciplinary action against a probationary employee or to terminate that employee, both in accordance with Title 11.\u201d <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 314, 835 A.2d at 1183 (internal quotations omitted). Thus, whenever a probationary employee is disciplined, short of termination, \u00a7 11-106 applies as pre-discipline required steps. <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 315, 835 A.2d at 1184-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>In <em>Public Service Commission v. Wilson, </em>389 Md. 27, 34, 882 A.2d 849, 853 (2005), Chrys Wilson, a management service employee with the Maryland Public Service Commission (\u201cPSC\u201d), was terminated purportedly (along with four other employees) by the then-Chair of the PSC, Kenneth Schisler. Shortly after the terminations, at the request of the terminated employees, an Assistant Attorney General authored an opinion letter concluding that the Chair, acting without the authorization of the other Commissioners of the PSC, could not alone terminate a management service employee. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 35, 882 A.2d at 854. Wilson filed an administrative appeal, under \u00a7 11-113, contending her termination was illegal and unconstitutional. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 36, 882 A.2d at 854. Chair Schisler, as head of the principal unit, presided over and rejected Wilson\u2019s appeal, explaining that Wilson was an at-will employee not fired \u201cfor cause\u201d and, therefore, not entitled to a pre-termination hearing under \u00a7 11-106. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 37, 882 A.2d at 855. Schisler explained that Wilson \u201cdid not possess sufficient skills, judgment, or work ethic to perform in her position\u201d and, although he suspected previously Wilson may have misrepresented her time sheet hours, there was insufficient evidence of wrongdoing on that score and this was not a reason for Wilson\u2019s termination. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 35, 882 A.2d at 854. Schisler concluded also that he did not need the approval or delegation of the other Commissioners of the PSC to fire Wilson. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 37, 882 A.2d at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Wilson sought judicial review in the Circuit Court, which ordered her reinstatement based on its determination of an unlawful termination by the Chair acting alone. The court opined that only a majority of the PSC Commissioners could terminate Wilson. It directed that any subsequent administrative appeal on remand could not be presided over by Schisler or his staff. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 38-39, 882 A.2d at 856. Compliant with the judgment of the Circuit Court, the PSC sent a letter to Wilson reinstating her; however, the same letter re-terminated her by a majority vote of the Commissioners and gave her notice of her rights to appeal administratively the new termination action. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>at 39, 882 A.2d at 856. Wilson did not appeal administratively the second termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The PSC sought concurrently an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from the Circuit Court judgment and filed contemporaneously a motion with the Circuit Court to reconsider that aspect of its judgment awarding back pay and benefits to Wilson. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 39, 882 A.2d at 856-57. Wilson, for her part and in response to the PSC\u2019s escalation, sought from the Circuit Court an order of contempt against the PSC based on her re-termination. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 40, 882 A.2d at 857. The Circuit Court issued a second order reiterating the findings of its prior order and adding that Wilson\u2019s re-termination was illegal because she was fired \u201cfor cause\u201d as the result of alleged misconduct, without the proper statutory pre-termination protections of \u00a7 11-106 and that the firing was unconstitutional due to biased decision-makers. <em>Id. </em>The PSC filed a second notice of appeal with the Court of Special Appeals from this action, but we issued a writ of certiorari before the intermediate appellate court decided the case. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 41, 882 A.2d at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Wilson argued that although her second termination was effected by a majority of the PSC Commissioners, it was illegal because she was not afforded the required pre-termination notice when an employee is terminated \u201cfor cause\u201d and, alternatively, that if she was fired for no reason as an at-will employee, the appeal process offered to her was unconstitutional because Chair Schisler (who fired her initially) would preside over the appeal and could not be impartial. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 49, 882 A.2d at 868. As a starting point in analyzing at-will employee termination generally, we noted that courts and juries may not review the motivation or factual basis behind an employer\u2019s decision to terminate, and that decision, absent a \u201ccontravening public policy,\u201d may be unreviewable even if arbitrary, capricious, or even fundamentally unfair. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 61 n. 21, 882 A.2d at 869 n. 21 (citing <em>Towson Univ. v. Conte, </em>384 Md. 68, 82-83, 862 A.2d 941, 949 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>We assumed, rhetorically (without deciding) for the purposes of analyzing Wilson\u2019s claim, that the appointing authority\u2019s actions were constrained by \u00a7 11-106 when an at-will employee is disciplined for misconduct. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 61, 882 A.2d at 869 (citing <em>Danaher v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, </em>148 Md.App. 139, 166, 811 A.2d 359, 375 (2002)) (holding that \u00a7 11-106 applies to at-will employees in the management service). \u201cMisconduct\u201d is not defined in the State Personnel and Pensions Article. We looked to the statutory history of the State system governing terminations, related regulations, dictionary definitions, and other cases to evaluate Wilson\u2019s claim that she was terminated for misconduct. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 61, 882 A.2d at 869. Examining the Code of Maryland Regulations governing professional service with the State, we noted that \u201cmisconduct\u201d involves \u201cnegligence, willful disregard of one\u2019s duties, failure to comply with employer regulations, knowingly violating a statute, or the commission of a criminal act,\u201d while discharge for performance implicated incompetence or inefficiency. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 74-75, 882 A.2d at 877. Adopting a definition from an unemployment compensation case, we concluded that \u201cmisconduct,\u201d for the purposes of analyzing Wilson\u2019s claim, meant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\">\u201ca transgression of some established rule or policy of the employer, the commission of a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, or a course of wrongful conduct committed by an employee, within the scope of his employment relationship, during hours of employment, or on the employer\u2019s premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 77, 882 A.2d at 879 (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation v. Hider, </em>349 Md. 71, 85, 706 A.2d 1073, 1079 (1998)). Under these assumptions, we concluded that nothing in Wilson\u2019s alleged, on-the-job behavior rose to the level of misconduct, nor could the performance issues alleged regarding her employment constitute a \u201cdereliction of duty.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 78, 882 A.2d at 879-80. Dereliction of duty involves \u201clacking a sense of duty; in breach of a legal or moral obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that \u201cin order to rise to the level of \u2018employee misconduct,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the alleged conduct would need to involve some element of wrongdoing, culpable negligence, or breach of a legal or moral obligation.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 78, 882 A.2d at 880. Based on the record before us, we determined that Wilson\u2019s termination was not due to misconduct and she was not entitled on that basis to the pre-termination procedural protections of \u00a7 11-106. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 78-79, 882 A.2d at 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Acknowledging that \u00a7 11-106 serves to protect at-will employees from discipline on the basis of unsubstantiated accusations, however, we concluded that \u201cif it appears that a disciplinary action may have been based, even <em>sub silentio, </em>on alleged facts constituting \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d the \u201cappointing authority\u201d must be held accountable to follow the procedures outlined in \u00a7 11-106.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 82-83, 882 A.2d at 882. We noted further that when management service employees are disciplined, they bear the burden of proof to show that the proper procedures were not followed, and absent \u201csuch a demonstration, a termination or other discipline of an at-will employee, without a reason being given and without obeisance to the statutory procedures in \u00a7 11-106, is not unlawful necessarily.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 84, 882 A.2d at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">We declined to decide whether Wilson\u2019s unpursued administrative appeal from the second termination would have been futile or unfair in a constitutional sense because Chair Schisler might preside over it. Our declination to reach this issue was because Wilson failed to pursue, i.e., exhaust, \u201cthe specific administrative remedy provided by statute when a management service, at-will employee of the PSC is terminated for other than misconduct.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 88-89, 882 A.2d at 885-86. Quoting from <em>SEFAC Lift &amp; Equipment Corporation v. Mass Transit Administration, </em>367 Md. 374, 380, 788 A.2d 192, 196 (2002), we reiterated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">[w]e have long held, and have recently confirmed, that where an administrative agency has primary or exclusive jurisdiction over a controversy, the parties to the controversy must ordinarily await a final administrative decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>before resorting to the courts for resolution of the controversy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 89, 882 A.2d at 886 (internal quotations and citations omitted). We noted that \u00a7 11-113 allowed Wilson to challenge the illegality or constitutionality of her second termination in an administrative appeal taken within 15 days of receiving notice of the action. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 92, 882 A.2d at 888. We concluded that Wilson was barred by the doctrine of administrative exhaustion from seeking alternative redress in the Circuit Court. <em>Id. </em>Wilson urged this Court, if we determined she was not terminated \u201cfor cause,\u201d to remand the case back to the trial court for further discovery to determine whether she was terminated, as she claimed, by the Republican-dominated PSC Commissioners because of her political affiliation as a Democrat. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 93, 882 A.2d at 888-89. This request too was barred because Wilson failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">C. The Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Forster argues that this Court cannot decide the issue of administrative remedy exhaustion because the trial court did not dismiss her complaint on this ground. As discussed <em>supra </em>in Part III, we may consider and decide this issue regardless of whether the trial court relied upon this basis to dismiss Forster\u2019s complaint. Forster contends also that additional fact-finding, after discovery, must be allowed to determine what notice of her administrative appellate rights she was provided and whether she was terminated for misconduct, specifically insubordination. <em>Smack </em>guides us in deciding these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">In <em>Smack, </em>we concluded that, because a provision, \u00a7 11-303, in the State Personnel and Pensions Article, applied specifically to termination of probationary employees, rather than to discipline of State employees generally, \u00a7 11-303 regulated terminations of probationary employees exclusively. <em>Smack, 378 </em>Md. at 313, 835 A.2d at 1183. Employee misconduct that is the gravamen of disciplinary proceedings up to, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>including termination, however, was governed by \u00a7 11-106.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 315, 835 A.2d at 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Section 11-305, which governs termination of at-will employees, including those in the executive service, is analogous to \u00a7 11-303, governing termination of probationary employees. Like \u00a7 11-303, \u00a7 11-305 applies only to targeted categories of State employees. The categories targeted by \u00a7 11-303 and \u00a7 11-305 are employees with limited rights to continued employment. Section 11 \u2014 305(b) makes clear that executive service employees, like Forster, are at-will employees that may be terminated for any (or no) reason as long as the action was not infected by illegality or unconstitutionality, which grounds are recognized expressly in the statutory scheme as having to be raised initially and decided in an administrative appeal. This is the fundamental structure of an at-will employment relationship that we cautioned against disrupting in <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 83, 882 A.2d at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The plain language of \u00a7 11-305 covers all terminations of at-will employees for any cause, or no cause at all. At-will employees may be terminated at any time, so long as the termination is not politically-motivated, illegal, or unconstitutional. Section 11-305 contains no provision exempting terminations due to misconduct, nor any reference to \u00a7 11-106. Section 11-305, like \u00a7 11-303 discussed in <em>Smack, </em>contains a separate appeal provision, which limits to illegality or unconstitutionality the grounds upon which an appeal may be maintained. Section 11-305 is a specific statutory provision providing procedures available only to termination of at-will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>employees and, therefore, as in <em>Smack, </em>is an exception to the more general disciplinary procedures in \u00a7 11-106.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Forster\u2019s termination, as an executive service employee, was governed by \u00a7 11-305 exclusively. Forster\u2019s argument that her termination was illegal and unconstitutional would have been in the wheel-house of an administrative appeal challenging an at-will employee termination; however, her claims were asserted too late and in the wrong forum in the present litigation. Forster did not appeal administratively (in writing and within 15 days) her termination under \u00a7 11\u2014 113, as directed by \u00a7 ll-305(d). Because she did not appeal her termination, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies bars her complaint for wrongful discharge in the Circuit Court. Forster\u2019s claim that she did not receive written notice of her appeal rights fails also because \u00a7 11-305 does not contain a notice provision and no notice is required by \u00a7 11-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Forster argues alternatively that because she was the head of a principal unit, when she was fired she could not file an appeal to herself. This claim has no merit. When the Board majority voted to terminate Forster, it appointed (virtually concurrently) an interim Public Defender. Forster\u2019s 21 August 2009 termination letter from the Board provided this information to her.

This theory is unpersuasive, however, because it is eroded by Forster's equally passionate contention that the Board did not have the legal authority \"to order me, as you do in your letter, to demote, fire and hire various personnel, or, in fact, to order me to do anything at all.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\">.

I would affirm the Circuit Court on the grounds used in its decision \u2014 that Forster has not stated a claim for wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Although the Majority devotes much attention to Forster\u2019s notice argument, it gives short shrift to her statutory interpretation argument. Forster contends that Maryland Code (1994, 2009 Repl.Vol.), Section 11-113 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article should not be read to require that, when the head of a principal unit is disciplined, her road to judicial review must include an appeal to herself or her replacement. Such an interpretation, she says, would violate the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation precluding results that are \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cnonsensical.\u201d <em>See City of Bowie v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>384 Md. 413, 426, 863 A.2d 976, 983 (2004) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>(\u201cIn discerning the legislative intent absurd results in the interpretive analysis of a statute are to be shunned.\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted)); <em>Blandon v.

In other words, we should reject a proposed statutory interpretation if its consequences are inconsistent with common sense.\u201d (citations and quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">As Justice Stone said in <em>United States v. Katz, </em>a statute should be construed narrowly \u201cwhere the literal application of the statute would lead to extreme or absurd results, and where the legislative purpose gathered from the whole Act would be satisfied by a more limited interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Katz, </em>271 U.S. 354, 362, 46 S.Ct. 513, 516, 70 L.Ed. 986 (1926). <em>Bowie </em>applied this rule to an administrative exhaustion issue, <em>see </em>384 Md. at 424-27, 863 A.2d at 982-84, and other jurisdictions have used it to deny motions asserting failure to exhaust administrative remedies, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Dorsett, </em>308 F.Supp.2d 537, 544 n. 10 (D.V.I.2003) (\u201cIn this case, however, it would be absurd to find that Dorsett did not exhaust administrative remedies[.]\u201d); <em>Gwinn v. Collier, </em>247 Va. 479, 443 S.E.2d 161, 163 (1994) (declining to require administrative exhaustion because it would \u201cinvolve a manifest absurdity\u201d). Thus, this basic rule of statutory interpretation clearly applies in this case and should receive our full attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The Majority\u2019s Reliance on <em>Wilson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Instead of addressing the statutory interpretation question, however, the Majority falls back on <em>Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. 27, 882 A.2d 849 (2005), in which we rejected a terminated employee\u2019s claim that she should have been excepted from the administrative appeal requirement because her appeal would have been decided by the same person who terminated her. To be sure, both Wilson and Forster alleged bias in the administrative appeal, but <em>Wilson </em>does not control here because we based that holding on a different rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><em>A. </em>Wilson\u2019s <em>Constitutional Rule is not Applicable Here</em></p>\n<p id=\"AoF\">As we explained, Wilson mounted a constitutional challenge to the exhaustion requirement, arguing that \u201cunder Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (\u2018Article 24\u2019), she was entitled to a fair and impartial agency adjudicator.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 88, 882 A.2d at 885. She argued that, because the hearing officer was the same person who fired her, \u201cshe need not exhaust the administrative process following re-termination because he was <em>unconstitutionally </em>biased against her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 882 A.2d at 887. We declined to address the merits of that argument, however, citing a rule specific to constitutional challenges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">Although we recognize that a constitutional challenge to a statute or regulation on its face may provide an exception to the normal application of the exhaustion doctrine, we conclude that that exception is not applicable here because Wilson\u2019s constitutional challenge is framed as an \u201cas applied\u201d one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Thus, our holding in <em>Wilson </em>was based on a narrow rule pertaining specifically to constitutional challenges to exhaustion requirements. <em>See also </em>Arnold Rochvarg, <em>Principles &amp; Practice of Maryland Administrative Law </em>(2011) (\u201cThe first step in the constitutional exception analysis is that the attack must be made to the constitutionality of a statute as a whole.\u201d) (citing <em>Goldstein v. Time-Out Family Amusement Ctrs., Inc., </em>301 Md. 583, 483 A.2d 1276 (1984)). Because the constitutional rule decided the case, we did \u201cnot reach or decide the issue of whether Wilson was deprived unconstitutionally of a fair and impartial agency adjudicator[.]\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 88-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>89, 882 A.2d at 886. We simply held that when the alleged constitutional bias takes the form of an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge, it must be raised in the administrative forum first. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, our discussion suggested that Wilson could have shown unconstitutional bias if she had raised the issue in the administrative appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 90, 882 A.2d at 887 (\u201cHad the Chairman decided the appeal ... [Wilson] would have taken from the Chairman and the Commission the argument they make here that the Commission intended to delegate that responsibility to another.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><em>Wilson </em>does not apply here because we are not faced with any constitutional issue. Forster, instead of raising constitutional arguments, simply argues that Section 11-113 cannot rationally be interpreted as applying to the head of a principal unit. Indeed, she refers to the Respondent\u2019s (and the Majority\u2019s) interpretation of Section 11-113 as \u201cnonsensical,\u201d \u201cabsurd,\u201d and \u201clegally baseless,\u201d but never calls the procedure \u201cunconstitutional\u201d or \u201cillegal.\u201d Our application of the constitutional rule in <em>Wilson, </em>therefore, presents no obstacle to Forster\u2019s statutory interpretation argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><em>B. </em>Wilson <em>did not Involve a Direct Pecuniary Conflict of Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\"><em>Wilson </em>is distinguishable for a second, more important reason, which is that the conflict of interest here is direct and pecuniary, whereas the bias alleged in <em>Wilson </em>was not. Wilson asked us to hold that any employer responsible for a termination decision would not be able to fairly review that decision in an administrative appeal. This Court rejected that notion, refusing to assume that \u201csome kind of blind pride of authorship or hubris of power renders an administrative decision-maker <em>ipso facto </em>unable to assess fairly and objectively arguments that his or her decision should be revisited, changed, or abandoned.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 92, 882 A.2d at 888. We also observed that \u201cthe record in this case does not reveal a factual predicate for specific personal bias against Wilson[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Here, in contrast, we are not merely dealing with \u201csome kind of blind pride of authorship or hubris,\u201d but instead must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>address a specific conflict of interest, in which the adjudicator has a direct pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case. If we interpret Section 11-113 to apply to the head of a principal unit, then in the case of a dismissal, as here, the hearing officer would be asked to decide whether to reinstate Petitioner, thereby ejecting herself from her new job. <em>See, e.g., Bruno v. Crown Point, </em>950 F.2d 355, 360 (7th Cir.1991) (holding that it is proper to restore an employee to her rightful position \u201ceven where incumbents are bumped from their jobs because those incumbents would not have been hired if the [unlawful employment action] had not occurred.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The inherent bias of the adjudicator is much more invasive in cases like this, where the status of the adjudicator\u2019s job cannot be separated from the status of the appellant\u2019s job. This sort of built-in bias is qualitatively different from, and much more powerful than, any leaning a neutral arbiter (such as that in Wilson) might bring to bear upon reconsidering his decision. When a hearing officer has a direct pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case, fair adjudication is impossible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><em>Wilson </em>does not support or justify the incestuous process that is condoned by the Majority. This analysis does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>change simply because, in this case, Forster\u2019s immediate successor was an interim replacement. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 591, 45 A.3d at 195. Interim replacements often seek to make their positions permanent, and in any case, a permanent replacement could have been installed by the time Forster\u2019s appeal would have been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">For these reasons, I submit, an interpretation of Section 11-113 that requires the head of a principal unit to appeal to herself or her replacement is \u201cinconsistent with common sense\u201d and would \u201clead to absurd results,\u201d and I would reject it. <em>Blandon, </em>304 Md. at 319, 498 A.2d at 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The Office of Administrative Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The Majority suggests that this absurd result was avoidable because Forster\u2019s replacement could have delegated the hearing to the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d). <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 591-92 n. 7, 45 A.3d at 195-96 n. 7. I disagree that a Section 11-113 appeal may be referred to OAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Title 11 allows for referral to OAH under one section only, Section 11-110, which describes in some detail the procedures applicable at OAH.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In contrast, the sections of Title 11 at issue here (Sections 11-305 and 11-113) do not mention OAH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>at all. Rather, as the Majority observes, the procedure at issue here is a unique and narrowly specified appeal right, limited to (1) grounds of illegality or uneonstitutionality and (2) \u201ctargeted categories of State employees ... with limited rights to continued employment.\u201d Maj. Op. at 590, 45 A.3d at 195. Appeals under Section 11-110, on the other hand, are available generally to employees in the skilled or professional services and are not limited to any specific grounds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The distinction between Section 11-110 and Section 11-113 is further confirmed by legislative history. Both appeal rights were created by the State Personnel Management System Reform Act of 1996,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and from the outset they were meant to be separate. The task force that studied the implementation of the Act observed that \u201cemployees in the Management or Executive Service, or who are special appointees, have different disciplinary appeal procedures.\u201d <em>See </em>Task Force to Reform State Personnel, <em>Highlights of the State Personnel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>Management System Reform Act of 1996 </em>(1997) (emphasis added). In 2002, the Legislature singled out Section 11-113, limiting it to special appointees and employees in the management and executive services. <em>See </em>Chapter 296 of the Acts of 2002. No such limitation was applied to Section 11-110. The Legislature returned to Section 11-113 in 2007, limiting the grounds for appeal to illegality or unconstitutionality. <em>See </em>Chapter 592 of the Acts of 2007. No such limitation was applied to Section 11-110. Indeed, in 2006 the Legislature expanded OAH\u2019s authority under Section 11-110, allowing it to reinstate employee benefits and impose costs upon the principal unit. <em>See </em>Chapter 553 of the Acts of 2006; Chapter 600 of the Acts of 2006. No such powers were added under Section 11-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">With two separate appeal procedures, and only Section 11-110 mentioning OAH, the clear message is that the Legislature did not intend for Section 11-113 appeals to be referred to OAH. <em>See Gardner v. State, </em>420 Md. 1, 11, 20 A.3d 801, 807 (2011) (\u201c[WJhere Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another ... it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d (quoting <em>Keene Corp. v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 200, 208, 113 S.Ct. 2035, 2040, 124 L.Ed.2d 118 (1993)) (citations and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Moreover, as the Court of Special Appeals explained in <em>Dozier v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>164 Md.App. 526, 533-37, 883 A.2d 1025, 1029-31 (2005), it would not make sense to refer a Section 11-113 appeal to OAH, because it is not a \u201ccontested case.\u201d Only \u201ccontested cases,\u201d as defined in the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, may be referred to OAH.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As <em>Dozier </em>correctly observes, Section 11-113 does not contain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>elements traditionally associated with \u201ccontested cases,\u201d including \u201ctrial type\u201d procedures and mandatory hearings. <em>Id. </em>at 534-36, 883 A.2d at 1029-31 (quoting <em>Sugarloaf v. Ne. Md. Waste Disposal Auth., </em>323 Md. 641, 651 n. 5, 594 A.2d 1115, 1119 n. 5 (1991) (\u201ccontested case\u201d means \u201ca hearing which provides trial type procedures, such as cross-examination\u201d)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An appeal under Section 11-113, on the other hand, accords the appellant no trial or hearing rights, and merely gives the head of the principal unit the option to confer with the employee before making a decision. <em>See </em>Section ll-113(c) (\u201cThe head of the principal unit may confer with the employee before making a decision.\u201d). Thus, quite sensibly, the Legislature has provided only a limited right of appeal for those persons holding the highest management positions in each agency.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Without the option of referral to OAH, Forster's appeal would have come before her replacement, who would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>have had a direct conflict of interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Again, I believe this result is patently absurd, and therefore not a legitimate interpretation of the statute. <em>See Bowie, </em>384 Md. at 426, 863 A.2d at 983.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Goals of Exhaustion</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The goals of administrative exhaustion are not advanced by the Majority\u2019s holding. The central goal of administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>exhaustion \u2014 conservation of judicial resources \u2014 would not likely be advanced because the agency ruling would likely be adverse to Forster, and she would be left to seek relief in the courts. Indeed, forcing Forster to explain and argue the hearing officer\u2019s conflict of interest, in addition to the merits of her case, has created additional, unnecessary work for the courts. This runs contrary to the goal of conserving judicial resources. <em>See </em>Rochvarg, \u00a7 14.14 (explaining that when \u201cthe case will most likely require judicial involvement to obtain the proper remedy ... one of the main goals of the exhaustion doctrine \u2014 judicial economy \u2014 would not be served by requiring exhaustion\u201d). Agency expertise, another goal,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is not a compelling factor if the agency\u2019s decision maker is a person in the same position as the fired employee, with less experience. Nor is legislative choice<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> persuasive, when the statute does not explicitly address whether Section 11-113 applies when a head of a principal unit is terminated. A fourth goal, \u201cpreventing] the courts from interfering with the administrative process until it has run its course,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is not a persuasive reason when the \u201cadministrative process\u201d necessarily involves a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Finally, I find it telling that no one sent Forster a notice advising her that she must appeal to the new Public Defender or Acting Public Defender. Likely, neither the Board of Directors nor anyone in leadership at the agency interpreted the statute the way the Majority does. In short, enforcing administrative exhaustion in this case simply creates more \u201cgotcha jurisprudence\u201d of the kind I objected to in <em>Hansen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>City of Laurel, </em>420 Md. 670, 697-98, 25 A.3d 122, 139 (2011) (Adkins, J., dissenting), and <em>Smith v. County Comm\u2019rs, </em>418 Md. 692, 720, 18 A.3d 16, 32-33 (2011) (Adkins, J., dissenting). I respectfully dissent from the Majority\u2019s resting its decision on exhaustion grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Yet I concur with the Majority\u2019s decision that Forster does not prevail in her appeal. Rather than holding that she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, I would rest our decision on Forster\u2019s failure to state a claim of wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Failure to State a Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The Circuit Court granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that Forster\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim of wrongful discharge because none of the Board\u2019s demands violated the law or public policy. The court reasoned that Forster\u2019s primary legal duty, providing representation to indigent individuals, was not contravened by any of the Board\u2019s instructions. Thus, it held that the complaint simply evidenced</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">a disagreement ... about how best to accomplish the important work of the Office of Public Defender.... Such differences of opinion, between an executive and members of a board to which the executive answers, without allegations of actual statutory breaches, are too general, too vague, too conclusory as to constitute a prima facie claim of wrongful discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">In reviewing a motion to dismiss, this Court views the factual allegations in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, but reviews whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law were \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>RRC Ne., LLC v. BAA Md., Inc., </em>413 Md. 638, 643-44, 994 A.2d 430, 433-34 (2010). As we said in <em>Parks v.

We must confine our review ... to the four corners of the complaint and its incorporated supporting exhibits, if any. The well-pleaded facts setting forth the cause of action must be pleaded with sufficient specificity; bald assertions and conclusory statements by the pleader will not suffice.

Mascari II, Inc., </em>374 Md. 402, 434, 823 A.2d 590, 609 (2003) (\u201c[T]here is no sufficiently clear mandate of public policy that has been violated on the facts alleged here such that vindication by bringing a wrongful discharge action is required to protect the public interest.\u201d); <em>Adler v. Am. Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 45-46, 432 A.2d 464, 472 (1981) (\u201cThe bald allegations of Adler\u2019s complaint do not provide a sufficient factual predicate for determining whether any declared mandate of public policy was violated.... The allegations are therefore legally insufficient to state a cause of action for wrongful discharge.\u201d), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>Chapter 223 of the Acts of 1993, <em>as recognized in Wholey v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>370 Md. 38, 68-69, 803 A.2d 482, 500 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Forster alleges that the Board\u2019s decision to terminate her contravened the public policy outlined in the Title 16 of the Criminal Procedure Article,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which governs the Office of the Public Defender. Specifically, Forster contends that her termination violated the policies outlined in Section 16-201, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">It is the policy of the State to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">(1) provide for the realization of the constitutional guarantees of counsel in the representation of indigent individuals, including related necessary services and facilities, in criminal and juvenile proceedings in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">(2) assure the effective assistance and continuity of counsel to indigent accused individuals taken into custody and indigent individuals in criminal and juvenile proceedings before the courts of the State; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">(3) authorize the Office of the Public Defender to administer and assure enforcement of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Forster alleges that her termination violated these public policies in three ways. First, she argues the Board made demands that would have prevented her from carrying out the statutorily mandated mission of the Office. Because failing to carry out the Office\u2019s mission would have been \u201cunlawful,\u201d she says, she was terminated for \u201crefusing] to engage in unlawful activity as ordered by the Board[.]\u201d Second, she says, carrying out the Office\u2019s mission was her statutory duty, which means that she was also terminated for \u201cexercising] her statutorily prescribed duties as the Maryland Public Defender.\u201d Finally, she alleges that her termination violated the public policy stated in Section 16-302, which lists the duties of the Board,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> because her termination was premised on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>failure to comply with demands that the Board had no authority to make.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The State responds that nothing in the complaint shows that Forster\u2019s termination contravened a clear mandate of public policy. Rather, the State asserts that Forster\u2019s allegations, and any reasonable inferences drawn from them, at most show that Forster was fired because of the Board\u2019s \u201cdissatisfaction with her job performance,\u201d particularly its \u201cview that she was engaging in fiscal mismanagement to the detriment of the mission of the [Ojffice and the administration of justice[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The Public Policy Against Unlawful Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">After reviewing the cases that address the public policy against requiring an employee to commit unlawful acts, it is apparent Forster\u2019s allegations do not fit the classic mold. As we said in <em>Makovi v. Sherwin-Williams Co., </em>316 Md. 603, 610, 561 A.2d 179, 182 (1989), this public policy is most often implicated when an employee is fired for refusing to give false testimony. It has also been implicated when an employee refused to provide sexual favors amounting to prostitution,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> commit fraud by submitting false claims for health insurance,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or commit torts and violate others\u2019 privacy rights.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Here, on the other hand, the alleged \u201cunlawful activity\u201d is better characterized as managerial decisions that Forster believed would not have best accomplished the mission of the Office. For example, Forster claims that it would have been \u201cunlawful\u201d for her to begin using panel attorneys in CINA proceedings,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> because Section 16 \u2014 204(b)(1) requires the public defender to provide representation. Yet Section 16-204(a) specifically provides that the representation mandated by subsection (b) may be provided by panel attorneys. <em>See </em>Section 16-204(a). Indeed, Section 16 \u2014 208(b)(2) provides that panel attorneys \u201cshall be used as much as practicable.\u201d Using panel attorneys, therefore, clearly was not unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The same is true of Forster\u2019s allegation that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">the Board\u2019s demands that she disband the Capital Defense Division, the Juvenile Protection Division and close the Northwest Community Defenders would have forced her to violate the Public Defender Statute, requiring [the Office] to provide representation in \u201ca criminal or juvenile proceeding in which a defendant or party is alleged to have committed a serious offense,\u201d \u00a7 16 \u2014 204(b)(l)(i), and \u201cin all stages of a proceeding,\u201d \u00a7 16 \u2014 204(b)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">As the State points out, it is not reasonable to infer, from the facts alleged in the complaint, that the Board intended to prevent the Office from representing indigent defendants. Instead, I agree with the State that the Board\u2019s demands were simply a \u201crequest[ ] that she reorganize the Office by merging programs and that she utilize more panel attorneys in order to maximize resources.\u201d This is not unlawful activity.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The serious budget shortfall underlying this case must inform any reasonable inference drawn from Forster\u2019s allegations. The complaint reveals that, as early as 2008, Forster wrote to Chief Judge Bell regarding the \u201csevere budget shortfalls\u201d affecting the Office. In 2010, she \u201crequested an emergency meeting with the Governor regarding [the Office\u2019s] desperate budget situation.\u201d The complaint also references a hiring freeze instituted by the Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Forster claims that her mandate to operate within the budget and follow the hiring freeze would have been violated if she had complied with the Board\u2019s demands to empanel more attorneys and rehire law clerks. Yet it is obvious that the Board was not demanding that Forster violate her mandate to operate within the budget or contravene the Governor. On the contrary, in the context of the \u201cdesperate budget situation,\u201d the only reasonable inference is that the Board believed its changes were part of a necessary response to the budget crisis, to ensure that the Office continued to fulfill its mission while also operating within its squeezed budget. It would be unreasonable to interpret the facts, as alleged in the complaint, as showing that the Board instructed Forster to violate the law by overspending.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Forster comes close to alleging a violation of law when she posits that the Board instructed her to violate the rights of merit system employees by demoting them without basis. The complaint does not specify, however, which of the Board\u2019s demands would have required her to do this, or indeed which law would have been violated. The complaint simply makes a general, conclusory statement that the Board\u2019s demands would have \u201cviolated the rights of merit-system state employees\u201d and the \u201cconstitutional rights of [Office] employees[.]\u201d I think this statement is \u201ctoo general, too conclusory, too vague and lacking in specifics to mount up to a prima facie showing that the claimed misconduct ... violated the public policy of this state.\u201d <em>Adler, </em>291 Md. at 44, 432 A.2d at 471. Rather, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>context of the ongoing dispute regarding how to deal with the budget crisis, the Board\u2019s demands look less like a mandate to break the law and more like an honest attempt to ensure that the Office would continue to fulfill its mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Statutory Duties</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In addition to arguing that the Board\u2019s demands would have required her to commit unlawful acts, Forster argues that those same demands interfered with her statutory duties as Public Defender, and thus implicated the public policy against firing employees for exercising a specific legal right or duty. <em>See, e.g., Makovi, </em>316 Md. at 611, 561 A.2d at 183. As with the public policy against illegal acts, however, reviewing the cases that have implicated this public policy suggests that Forster\u2019s claim does not fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">To begin with, this public policy is typically implicated when an employee exercises a personal right or privilege, not a legal duty. <em>See </em>Stanley Mazaroff <em>&amp; </em>Todd Horn, <em>Maryland Employment Law </em>(2d ed.2011), \u00a7 5.01[2][c] (observing that \u201c[m]ost of the reported wrongful discharge cases in Maryland fit within\u201d the \u201ccategory of cases ... involving] the discharge of an employee for exercising a legal right or privilege\u201d); <em>see also Watson v. Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co., </em>322 Md. 467, 469, 588 A.2d 760, 760-61 (1991) (employee fired for suing a coworker for sexual harassment and assault and battery); <em>Ewing v. Koppers Co., </em>312 Md. 45, 50, 537 A.2d 1173, 1175 (1988) (employee fired for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim). Forster does not allege that she was fired for exercising any statutory right or privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Moreover, when a wrongful discharge involves the exercise of a statutory duty, instead of a right or privilege, it is typically the duty to report the illegal activity of others in the organization. <em>See </em>Mazaroff &amp; Horn, \u00a7 5.01[2][b] (referring to the \u201cpublic interest in protecting employees from retaliatory discharge when they inform law enforcement officials of suspected criminal behavior by their employer or its managers\u201d); <em>Makovi, </em>316 Md. at 611, 561 A.2d at 183 (1989) (\u201cIllustrating the ... category [of] cases where the employee was fired for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>performing an important public obligation, are <em>Sheets v. Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 427 A.2d 385 (1980) (employee fired for insisting that employer comply with state and federal product labeling and licensing law); <em>Palmateer v. International Harvester Co., </em>85 Ill.2d 124, 52 Ill.Dec. 13, 421 N.E.2d 876 (1981) (employee discharged for reporting the suspected criminal activity of co-employee to law enforcement authorities); <em>Nees v. Hocks, </em>272 Or. 210, 536 P.2d 512 (1975) (en banc) (employee fired for serving jury duty).\u201d); <em>Bleich v. Florence Crittenton Servs. of Balt., Inc., </em>98 Md.App. 123, 135-36, 632 A.2d 463, 469 (1993) (employee punished for fulfilling the duty to report child abuse or neglect).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Here, the facts are nothing like the above cases. Forster cites the same Board directives that she claimed were demands to break the law, now alleging that they were demands to stop exercising her statutory duties. She claims that she was fired for \u201crefusing to implement operational and personnel changes demanded of her ... that were contrary to [her] duties and obligations as the Public Defender.\u201d Yet the Board\u2019s instructions, for the same reasons they did not require her to break the law, clearly did not require her to refrain from exercising her statutory duties. Rather, the Board\u2019s instructions simply represented its opinion regarding how best to fulfill those duties in a cash-strapped situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">At the heart of this case is Forster\u2019s belief that the Board\u2014 because Section 16-302 provides that it shall \u201cstudy,\u201d \u201cobserve,\u201d \u201ccoordinate,\u201d and \u201cadvise\u201d the Office \u2014 could not make specific demands of her and then fire her for failing to comply with those demands. To be sure, the history and structure of the statutory scheme, as Forster well explains, suggests that the Legislature did not intend for the Board to manage the operations of the Office. That job was given to the Public Defender, the head of the principal unit. <em>See </em>Section 16-207; Maryland Code (1994, 2009), \u00a7 6-404(a)(1) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The problem with Forster\u2019s argument, however, is that it proves too much, as she provides no limiting principle on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>discretion over the Office\u2019s operations. Under her interpretation, she is free to manage and direct the Office with complete impunity, subject to no check on her power to interpret and implement the Office\u2019s statutory directives. Yet the Legislature created an important check on her power when it invested the Board with the ability to fire her. As the Ninth Circuit has explained, it is a well-recognized principle of administrative law that the power to terminate necessarily implies some modicum of control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">The power to remove is the power to control. The truth of this statement was recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 602, 55 S.Ct. 869, 79 L.Ed. 1611 (1935). \u201cFor it is quite evident that one who holds his office only during the pleasure of another, cannot be depended upon to maintain an attitude of independence against the latter\u2019s will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629 [55 S.Ct. 869]. In <em>Bowsher </em>the Court maintained that the removal power need not be exercised to exert effective control, the mere existence of removal authority is likely to influence behavior. 478 U.S. at 727 n. 5 [106 S.Ct. 3181]. \u201cIn Constitutional terms, the removal powers over the Comptroller General\u2019s office dictate that he will be subservient to Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730 [106 S.Ct. 3181].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\"><em>Silver v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>951 F.2d 1033, 1039 (9th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>Bowsher v. Synar, </em>478 U.S. 714, 106 S.Ct. 3181, 92 L.Ed.2d 583 (1986); <em>Humphrey\u2019s Ex\u2019r v.

Act in the hands of an officer who is subject to removal only by itself, Congress in effect has retained control over the execution of the Act[.]\u201d (quoting <em>Bowsher, </em>478 U.S. at 733-34, 106 S.Ct. at 3191-92)); <em>City of Balt.

Suffice it to say that Forster cannot be right in her claim that any \u201cinterfere[nce] with her performance of statutory duties\u201d by the Board constitutes an <em>ultra vires </em>act that she has a duty to ignore. This is because, in light of the Board\u2019s ability to terminate her at will, her duty must include, to some extent, working out agreements with the Board. As in <em>Bowsher, </em>\u201cthe [Board\u2019s] removal powers over the [Public Defender] dictate that [s]he will be subservient to [the Board].\u201d 478 U.S. at 730, 106 S.Ct. at 3190.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Because I believe that Forster\u2019s claim should not have been dismissed under exhaustion principles, I would decide this case on the grounds used by the trial court, <em>i.e., </em>that the complaint does not state a cause of action for wrongful discharge. Although this Court, in the context of a motion to dismiss, is required to assume the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint, and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, even the most generous inferences do not suggest that Forster\u2019s termination violated a clear mandate of public policy. There is simply nothing to suggest that the Board fired her for refusing to break the law or for exercising her duties as Public Defender. Rather, her termination was simply the culmination of a long-running disagreement with the Board about how best to deal with the financial crisis plaguing the Office. Because Forster\u2019s termination did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>not violate a mandate of public policy, it does not state a cause of action for wrongful discharge, and should be dismissed. For this reason, I concur with the Majority\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Judge BATTAGLIA has authorized me to state that she joins in this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\">. Forster\u2019s argument is based on the portion of the statute providing that a Section 11-113 appeal goes to the head of the principal unit. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1994, 2009 Repl.Vol.), Section 11-113(b)(1) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (\"An employee or an employee\u2019s representative may file a written appeal of a disciplinary action with the head of the principal unit.\u201d). Forster, of course, was the head of the principal unit in this case. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 582, 45 A.3d at 190.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-5\">. Moreover, in the case of discipline short of dismissal, the unit head would remain in her position, thus being forced to adjudicate her own grievance.

Nor was it made unlawful by Forster\u2019s bald allegation that the Board\u2019s directives would have resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel, as that question cannot be determined until each case occurs. Indeed, Forster\u2019s allegation about ineffective assistance of counsel demonstrates even more strongly that what her complaint really alleges is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>her belief that the Board\u2019s directives were not the best course of action for the Office, not that any clear mandate of public policy was violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\">.
