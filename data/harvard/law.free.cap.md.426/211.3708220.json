Section 10 \u2014 408(c) of the Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, permits a Maryland judge to enter an ex parte order authorizing the interception of \u201cwire, oral, or electronic communications ... sent by a communication device anywhere within the State.\u201d As a result of the intercepted communication, the police seized from Petitioner, Tyrone Davis (the caller), controlled dangerous substances when he returned to his Maryland residence. Petitioner moved in the Circuit Court to suppress all evidence obtained by police through the asserted illegal search and seizure, on the basis that the wiretap order did not authorize interception of the extraterritorial communication and the court issuing the order could not authorize such an interception. The hearing judge denied the motion, citing federal case law defining the location of an \u201cinterception\u201d as where the mobile communication was first intercepted or redirected <em>and </em>where it was first heard by law enforcement officers. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Although, in a few aspects, Maryland\u2019s wiretapping statute is more protective of individual privacy rights than Title III of the Federal Omnibus Crime and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (\u201cTitle III\u201d), generally the Maryland statute is an \u201coffspring\u201d of Title III. We have read analogous provisions in our statute to be <em>in pari materia </em>with Title III, as interpreted by federal courts. Because the Title III and Maryland wiretap statute definitions of \u201cinterception\u201d are verbatim, we shall adopt here the federal gloss in determining the proper jurisdiction and scope for an ex parte wiretap order. Thus, as long as the \u201clistening post\u201d where the law enforcement officers first hear the intercepted communications is within the geographical jurisdiction of the court issuing the order, the interception is proper under the Maryland statute. Accordingly, we conclude that the motion to suppress evidence was denied properly by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>I. Factual and Legal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The following was gleaned from the record of the suppression hearing. On 8 September 2006, the State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County filed an ex parte application to intercept and record wire, oral, and electronic communications from Petitioner\u2019s mobile cell phone. Petitioner lived in Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland. The application was supported by affidavits from a Montgomery County Police Department Detective and a Special Agent for the United States Drag Enforcement Agency, who were coordinating an ongoing investigation into the distribution of controlled dangerous substances within Montgomery County. Petitioner was one of the targets of the investigation. The affidavits contained evidence, gathered pursuant to wiretaps approved previously, evincing probable cause to believe that Davis was transporting controlled dangerous substances into Maryland from outside the state. On the day the wiretap application pertinent to the present case was filed, Judge Ann Harrington of the Circuit Court issued an order approving the application. The order, on its face, allowed investigators to intercept Davis\u2019s mobile phone communications <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and required T-Mobile (operator of the relevant mobile phone infrastructure) to provide position and caller identification information, without geographic limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">On 11 September 2006, Montgomery County police (stationed at a covert location in Montgomery County) were monitoring the communications on Davis\u2019s mobile phone and overheard a call that, based on the officers\u2019 training and experience, indicated that Davis was approaching the Washington, D.C., area after a journey to Miami, Florida, and potentially transporting controlled dangerous substances into Maryland. Approximately one hour after the call was inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>cepted, two officers confronted Davis as he arrived at his residence in Montgomery County. The officers concocted a cover story, which they told Davis, that they believed that he matched the description of a suspect in a recently committed robbery and requested to search Davis, his vehicle, and a suitcase in the trunk of his car. During the search, the officers found over nine pounds of marijuana in the suitcase.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The officers did not arrest Davis at that time, purportedly to avoid disrupting the ongoing drug investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">On 22 October 2009, a grand jury indicted Davis for possessing marijuana on 11 September 2006, \u201cin sufficient quantity to indicate reasonably under all circumstance an intent to distribute the controlled substance,\u201d in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 2002 RepLVol.), Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 5-602(2). Petitioner filed a pre-trial, omnibus motion, which included a request to suppress evidence obtained through an illegal search and seizure under Maryland Rule 2-252. Judge Michael Algeo of the Circuit Court presided over the suppression motion hearing on 8 April 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">At the hearing, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel argued that the police violated Maryland Code (1957, 2006 RepLVol.) Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 10-408(c)(3), by intercepting a call made from Davis\u2019s cell phone, registered to a Virginia address, to a recipient located in Virginia, while Davis also was in Virginia when the call was placed and during the entire communication. Judge Algeo reasoned that the definition of \u201cintercept\u201d was the same under the Maryland wiretap statute and Title III and that the federal court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cintercept\u201d in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>968 F.2d 130, 136 (2d Cir.1992), that \u201cthe interception must also be considered to occur at the place where the redirected contents are first heard,\u201d should apply <em>in pari materia </em>to interpretation of the parallel Maryland statute. Judge Algeo concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Davis\u2019s call was \u201cintercepted\u201d lawfully in Montgomery County, where the investigators first heard the mobile phone conversation and, therefore, denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized by the police. At trial, Davis was convicted of violating Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 5-602(2) and sentenced to five years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Davis noted timely an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. A panel of the intermediate appellate court, in <em>Davis v. State, </em>199 Md.App. 273, 21 A.3d 181 (2011), affirmed. The intermediate appellate court concluded that the location of the mobile phone, the caller, or the recipient of the call were not material. The critical location in the analysis was where the \u201cinterception\u201d occurred. <em>Davis, </em>199 Md.App. at 287, 21 A.3d at 189. The panel held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">interception ... may be at either or both of two places: 1) where the suspect phone which is the subject of the interception order is located, regardless of whether that phone is sending a message or receiving a message; and 2) where the police are located as the monitor and hear the intercepted message, to wit, the location of the \u201clistening post.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Because the Montgomery County police\u2019s \u201clistening post\u201d was located within Montgomery County, Maryland, the intermediate appellate court concluded that the interception of the communication from Davis\u2019s mobile phone, although associated physically with Virginia, was lawful. <em>Davis, </em>199 Md.App. at 304, 21 A.3d at 199. Davis filed timely a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted, <em>Davis v. State, </em>421 Md. 557, 28 A.3d 644 (2011), to consider the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in affirming the trial court\u2019s decision denying Mr. Davis\u2019s motion to suppress derivative evidence seized by Montgomery County police after the police intercepted Mr. Davis\u2019s phone call from his Virginia phone, placed while he was in Virginia, to a Virginia phone line when the call\u2019s recipient was also in Virginia, in violation of the Maryland Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, Md.Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 10-401, et seq.?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>As foretold earlier in this opinion, we conclude that interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication, for the purposes of the Maryland wiretap statute, occurs where law enforcement officers capture or redirect first the contents of the communication overheard by the wiretap and where they heard originally the communication. Therefore, as long as the \u201clistening post\u201d was located within the territorial jurisdiction of the court issuing the ex parte wiretap order, neither the physical location of the mobile phone at the time the call was placed and during the communication or the recipient of the call are material. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals that the Circuit Court for Montgomery County denied properly Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">When interpreting a statute, a court\u2019s goal is \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied.... \u201d <em>Ray v. State, </em>410 Md. 384, 404, 978 A.2d 736, 747 (2009) (quoting <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2008)). We approach the statutory interpretation process by looking first at the plain language of a statute, giving the words their natural and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 172, 935 A.2d at 708). If the language is clear and unambiguous on its face, our inquiry ends ordinarily. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 708-09).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">If, however, the language is ambiguous, we move on to examine the \u201clegislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute\u201d to aid us in ascertaining the intent of the Legislature. <em>Ray, </em>410 Md. at 405, 978 A.2d at 748 (citations omitted). When focusing on the relevant part of a statutory scheme, we attempt to harmonize the part with the whole, considering the \u201cpurpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). When interpreting an ambiguous statute, we must reject any construction that would be illogical or nonsensical. <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 302, 783 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>A.2d 667, 671 (2001) (citing <em>State v. Brantner, </em>360 Md. 314, 322, 758 A.2d 84, 88-89 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Reviewing a trial court\u2019s disposition of a motion to suppress evidence, we view the evidence presented at the hearing, along with any reasonable inferences drawable therefrom, in a light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Bailey v. State, </em>412 Md. 349, 363, 987 A.2d 72, 80 (2010) (citing <em>Crosby v. State, </em>408 Md. 490, 504, 970 A.2d 894, 902 (2009); <em>Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 498, 924 A.2d 1129, 1135 (2007)). The reviewing court defers to the fact-finding of the hearing court, unless the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>We apply, however, a non-deferential standard of review when making the ultimate legal determination as to whether the evidence was seized properly under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Williamson v. State, </em>413 Md. 521, 532, 993 A.2d 626, 632 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In 1968, Congress enacted Title III, which provided minimum standards for the interception of oral, wire, and electronic communications during criminal investigations and prosecution. <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 69, 591 A.2d 481, 483 (1991). Title III was intended to balance privacy concerns and the public interest in effective criminal prosecutions. <em>Id. </em>(citing, among others, <em>United States v. Kahn, </em>415 U.S. 143, 151, 94 S.Ct. 977, 982, 39 L.Ed.2d 225, 235 (1974)). Each state was required to enact a responsive statute that was at least as protective of private citizens\u2019 rights as Title III. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Siegel, </em>266 Md. 256, 271, 292 A.2d 86, 94 (1972)). In 1977, the Maryland Legislature responded by enacting the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Law. 1977 Md. Laws 693. The Maryland wiretap statutory scheme begins with a general prohibition on intercepting willfully, endeavoring to intercept, or procuring \u201cany other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral or electronic communication.\u201d Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 10-402(a)(l). Intercept means \u201cthe aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>electronic, mechanical, or other device.\u201d Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 10-401(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">An exception to the general prohibition on interception was created to enable law enforcement investigators to capture evidence of certain enumerated crimes, including dealing in a controlled dangerous substance. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 10-402(c)(2)(ii)(l)(L). In order to obtain evidence of the enumerated crimes, the \u201cAttorney General, a State Prosecutor, or a State\u2019s Attorney may apply to a judge of competent jurisdiction, and the judge, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 10-408 ..., may grant an order authorizing the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications.... \u201d Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 10^06(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">To obtain an ex parte order authorizing a wiretap, a law enforcement officer must provide a judge (of competent jurisdiction) with a written application, upon oath or affirmation, that includes a \u201cfull and complete statement of facts\u201d justifying the order, including: details about the offense that is being, or will be, committed; a particular description of the communication to be intercepted; a description of previous failed investigative procedures or an explanation as to why they are too dangerous to be used; the time period for interception; and a list of previous wiretap applications. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 10 \u2014 408(a)(l)(i)\u2014(v). A judge may enter an ex parte order, upon receipt of the application, authorizing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai4\">interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications <em>within the territorial jurisdiction permitted </em>under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, if the judge determines (i) There is probable cause for belief that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a particular offense enumerated in \u00a7 10-406 of this subtitle; (ii) There is probable cause for belief that particular communications concerning that offense will be obtained through the interception; (iii) Normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous;.... Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 10 \u2014 408(c)(1) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">An ex parte order \u201cmay authorize the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications <em>only within the territorial jurisdiction of the court </em>in which the application was filed.\u201d Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 10-408(c)(2) (emphasis added). Section \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) expands on the physical jurisdiction aspect of the wiretap providing that an order may</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">authorize the interception of communications received or sent by a communication device <em>anywhere within the State </em>so as to permit the interception of the communications regardless of whether the communication device is physically located within the jurisdiction of the court in which the application was filed at the time of the interception. The application must allege that the offense being investigated may transpire in the jurisdiction of the court in which the application is filed. (Emphasis added.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The provisions of \u00a7 10-408(c) relating to jurisdiction are the crux of the present case. Petitioner maintains that \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) allows Maryland law enforcement officers, operating under an ex parte order issued by a Maryland circuit court judge, to intercept communications only when the target \u201celectronic, mechanical, or other device\u201d is located within Maryland. Petitioner and his cell phone were located in Virginia when he initiated a call to a person, also situated in Virginia, and the Montgomery County Police intercepted the message pertinent to this case. Therefore, Petitioner contends the plain language of \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) renders the interception unlawful. Respondent, on the other hand, points us to assertedly relevant federal case law that holds that, so long as the interception of the mobile communication occurs within the geographical jurisdiction of the court that issued the order, the interception is valid. After a careful reading of the statute and the overall scheme, we conclude that the language of \u00a7 10-408(c) is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, and, therefore, we must look to the relevant legislative history to ascertain the intent of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Section 10-408(c) was added to the Maryland wiretap statute in 1991. 1991 Md. Laws 285. The amendment was added to account for the development of cellular phone technology.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Floor Report, S.B. 153 (1991). Prior to 1991, an ex parte order for the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications could be issued only for communications within the jurisdiction of a particular circuit court. <em>Id. </em>The new section obviated the need for law enforcement agents to obtain multiple ex parte orders for each jurisdiction where a mobile phone might be located and allowed them to apply for one ex parte order in the jurisdiction where the \u201cbase station\u201d was located. <em>Id. </em>During a hearing on Senate Bill 153, the bill sponsor (Senator Murphy) emphasized the burden of multiple wiretap applications on law enforcement and the potential advantage this provided to drug traffickers by allowing them to \u201cweav[e] in and out of counties and across one jurisdictional boundary after another within the state.\u201d Hearing Before the Judicial Proceedings Committee (30 Jan. 1991). This section of the wiretap statute was \u201cintended to allow the law to keep pace with current technology.\u201d Bill Analysis, S.B. 153 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In 1993, the words \u201cor a paging device\u201d were added, following the phrase \u201ca mobile phone,\u201d in \u00a7 10-408(c). 1993 Md. Laws 598. Later, in response to our holdings in <em>Perry v. State, </em>357 Md. 37, 741 A.2d 1162 (1999), and <em>Mustafa, </em>323 Md. at 65, 591 A.2d at 481, which held that communications intercepted in another state are inadmissible at trial if they would violate the Maryland wiretap statute had they been intercepted in Maryland, the Legislature added a provision to the statute allowing certain out-of-state interceptions. 2001 Md. Laws 370. The words \u201ca mobile phone or a paging device\u201d were replaced with \u201ccommunication device\u201d by the Maryland Security Protection Act of 2002. 2002 Md. Laws, ch. 100. This Act added also the phrase \u201cwithin the state having jurisdiction over the offense under investigation\u201d to the defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tion of \u201cjudge of competent jurisdiction\u201d in \u00a7 10-401(8). 2002 Md. Laws, ch. 100. Section 10-408(e)(4) was added also by the Security Protection Act of 2002, allowing a judge of competent jurisdiction to \u201cauthorize continued interception within the State, both within and outside the judge\u2019s jurisdiction, if the original interception occurred within the judge\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Although none of the legislative history speaks directly to the interception of communications emanating from an out-of-state source, it is clear that the statute has been evolving steadily, trying to keep pace with emerging technology-</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In addition to this legislative history, relevant federal and state court opinions provide a persuasive approach for interpreting \u00a7 10-408 and applying it to the facts developed at the suppression hearing in the present case. As we have noted previously, Maryland\u2019s wiretap statutory scheme is an \u201coffspring\u201d of Title III. <em>State v. Bailey, </em>289 Md. 143, 151, 422 A.2d 1021, 1026 (1980), <em>superceded by statute on other grounds in McNeil v. State, </em>112 Md.App. 434, 685 A.2d 839 (1996); <em>see also Adams v. State, </em>289 Md. 221, 223, 424 A.2d 344, 345 (1981) (stating that \u201cMaryland\u2019s Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Law ... tracks extensively Title III ...\u201d). Notwithstanding that, in some areas, Maryland\u2019s statute provides greater protections against wiretapping than does the federal scheme. <em>Miles v. State, </em>365 Md. 488, 509, 781 A.2d 787, 799 (2001) (noting that Maryland law requires two-party consent versus one-party consent required under federal law). Despite these differences, \u201cit is clear through both legislative history and case precedent that the federal wiretap statute ... served as the guiding light for the Maryland Act[; therefore, we read the acts in pari materia....\u201d <em>Fearnow v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co. of Md., </em>104 Md.App. 1, 32, 655 A.2d 1, 32 (1995), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>342 Md. 363, 676 A.2d 65 (1996). Because of the similarities, we look to apt federal courts cases for persuasive guidance interpreting analogous provisions of the Maryland statute. <em>Adams v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 528, 531, 406 A.2d 637, 639 (1979) (noting that both federal and state statutes define the terms \u201cintercept\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201celectronic, mechanical, or other device\u201d with the same language), aff<em>'d, </em>289 Md. 221, 424 A.2d 344 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The provision in Title III analogous to \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">Upon such application the judge may enter an ex parte order, as requested or as modified, authorizing or approving interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications <em>within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the judge is sitting </em>(and outside that jurisdiction but within the United States in the case of a mobile interception device authorized by a Federal court within such jurisdiction), if the judge determines on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">(a) there is probable cause for belief that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a particular offense enumerated in section 2516 of this chapter [18 USCS \u00a7 2516];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">(b) there is probable cause for belief that particular communications concerning that offense will be obtained through such interception;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">(c) normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous ... 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(3) (2011) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The seminal federal case addressing where \u201cinterception\u201d of a telephone call occurs under Title III is <em>United States v.

At trial, defendants made a motion to suppress the wiretap evidence; the motion was denied. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, a new trial was sought because assertedly the Southern District of New York court did not have jurisdiction to authorize wiretaps on New Jersey phones and, therefore, the wiretap obtained illegally the evidence. <em>Rodri</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>guez, </em>968 F.2d at 135. As discussed <em>supra, </em>Title III authorizes a judge to intercept wire, oral, or electronic communications \u201cwithin the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the judge is sitting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The appellate court in <em>Rodrigv&amp;z </em>concluded that because the definition of interception included the \u201caural\u201d acquisition of the contents of the call, the interception occurs where the contents of the wiretap were captured or redirected originally, as well as \u201cthe place where the redirected contents are first heard.\u201d 968 F.2d at 136. The listening post, where the calls were first heard by law enforcement agents, was located in Manhattan, New York, within the federal Southern District of New York; therefore, the appellate court determined that the admission of the wiretap evidence at trial was proper. <em>Rodriguez, </em>968 F.2d at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Other federal courts followed the <em>Rodriguez </em>approach in determining challenges to the propriety of the jurisdiction of the issuing court by focusing on where the \u201cinterception\u201d occurred or, alternatively, by looking to where the calling or receiving phones were located. <em>See United States v. Denman, </em>100 F.3d 399, 403 (5th Cir.1996) (concluding that because \u201cinterception includes both the location of a tapped telephone and the original listening post,\u201d the trial court allowed properly evidence from a wiretap of a phone located in the Southern District of Texas where the listening post was located in the Eastern District of Texas and the wiretap order was issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas); <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>112 F.3d 849, 851-53 (7th Cir.1997) (upholding a wiretap order from the United States District Court in the Western District of Wisconsin where the listening post and tapped mobile phone were located in Minnesota, but the target of the investigation and the receiving phone were located in the Western District of Wisconsin); <em>United States v. Luong, </em>471 F.3d 1107, 1110 (9th Cir.2006) (affirming the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence gathered under a wiretap order issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California where the mobile phone had an area code, billing address, and mobile service provider associated with the Eastern District of California, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>because the wiretapped communications were first heard at a listening post in San Francisco, within the Northern District of California); <em>United States v.

Recently, however, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California addressed the question of interception of wholly extraterritorial mobile communications in <em>United States v. Cosme, </em>2011 WL 3740337, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742 (S.D.Cal.2011). In <em>Cosme, </em>defendants, members of something called the Fernando Sanchez Organization (\u201cFSO\u201d), were indicted by a grand jury for conspiring to conduct a pattern of racketeering activity and conspiring to distribute cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine. 2011 WL 3740337, at *1, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742, at *7-8. The indictment was supported by evidence gained through electronic surveillance of telephones used by defendants and co-conspirators. <em>Cosme, </em>2011 WL 3740337, at *1, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742, at *8. The wiretap application was made by an Assistant United States Attorney to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and was supported by allegations of an FBI agent investigating the drug trafficking and associated violent activities of FSO from Mexico into the San Diego area. <em>Cosme, </em>2011 WL 3740337, at *1-2, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742, at *8-9. One defendant, joined by others, filed a motion to suppress evidence derived from wiretaps because they exceeded allegedly the jurisdiction of the authorizing court under Title III. <em>Cosme, </em>2011 WL 3740337, at *8, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742, at *27. The FBI intercepted a defendant\u2019s communication \u201cwhile he was using a cellular phone in Mexico to communicate with others located in Mexico for the entire duration of the conversation.\u201d <em>Cosme, </em>2011 WL 3740337, at *8, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742, at *27.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The defendant argued that Title III did not authorize interception of communications initiated and received entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>within another country. <em>Cosme, </em>2011 WL 3740337, at *8, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742, at *28. The government conceded that Title III did not allow a court to authorize a wiretap in Mexico, but countered that no language in Title III \u201csuggests that Congress limited the ability of a judge to authorize the interception of only those conversations which occur solely in the United States.\u201d <em>Cosme, </em>2011 WL 3740337, at *8-9, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742, at *29. Relying on the definitions of \u201cinterception\u201d in <em>Luong, </em>the District Court concluded that the record established conclusively that the intercepted communications were heard only by law enforcement officials in a \u201cwire room\u201d located within the Southern District of California and, therefore, all of the communications were \u201cintercepted\u201d within the jurisdiction of the court that issued the wiretap order. <em>Cosme, </em>2011 WL 3740337, at *9-10, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742, at *32-33. The court noted that drug traffickers and violent offenders \u201care not exempted from the valid wiretap order by making their plans across the border\u201d and denied the motion to suppress evidence obtained from the wiretap. <em>Cosme, </em>2011 WL 3740337, at *10, 22-23, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742, at *33, 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Petitioner urges us to construe the phase \u201canywhere within the state\u201d in \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) of the Maryland statute as modifying \u201ca communication device.\u201d This narrow reading would require Maryland-based law enforcement officers, operating under an otherwise valid ex parte wiretap order, to shut down interception of mobile phone communications when the target phone enters another state or the District of Columbia. This would present an enormous logistical and technological challenge to law enforcement operators and, in cases where the subject of an investigation crosses back and forth over state or other boundary lines (as in a drug distribution operation in Montgomery County and/or the District of Columbia), the task may be impossible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But this challenging burden alone does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>not shape our decision in this case. Rather, the legislative history of the Maryland wiretap statute and analogous federal case law lead us to a different result than that urged by Petitioner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The widespread use and highly mobile nature of cellular phones, especially in the circumstances of drug distribution rings, presents a unique challenge for courts in determining the proper jurisdiction for acting on applications for ex parte wiretap orders. We must determine what the Legislature was trying to regulate. We do so by looking at the entirety of the wiretap statute. The target of the statute is \u201cinterception\u201d; therefore, critical to our interpretation of \u00a7 10-408(c) is the definition of \u201cinterception.\u201d Under \u00a7 10-401(3), the definition of interception is \u201cthe aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication.... \u201d The common and generally most understood meaning of \u201caural\u201d is \u201cof or relating to the ear or to the sense of hearing.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 116 (1989). Because \u201cinterception\u201d is the tipping point of the statute, it provides naturally the jurisdictional anchor for an ex parte order authorizing law enforcement officers to intercept wire, oral, or electronic communications. Where \u201cinterception\u201d occurs and, therefore, where jurisdiction is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ferred, has been addressed by numerous federal courts, discussed <em>supra. </em>Because Maryland\u2019s wiretap statute defines \u201cinterception\u201d to include aural acquisition of communication in the same way that Title III defines the term; we accept and apply the rationale employed in <em>Rodriguez </em>(followed by other courts), that interception occurs where the communications were first captured or redirected, as well as where they were first heard by law enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The <em>Cosme </em>case, decided recently, involved an analogous circumstance to the case at hand. There, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California expanded the analysis undertaken initially in <em>Rodriguez, </em>and later in <em>Luong, </em>that the location of \u201cinterception\u201d is the jurisdictional focus for a wiretap order, despite the fact that a mobile phone conversation was initiated and received within Mexico entirely. Thus, <em>Cosme </em>makes clear that the location of interception is the essential element of jurisdiction, rather than the notion of a national umbrella federal jurisdiction (when federal courts are concerned) being the animating force for the results reached under the Title III cases. Nevertheless, an ex parte order may be issued by a Maryland circuit court only if the application alleges \u201cthat the offense being investigated may transpire in the jurisdiction of the court in which the application is filed.\u201d Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 10-408(c)(3). Establishing the location of the alleged criminal activity under investigation places a necessary and reasonable constraint on applicants for ex parte wiretap orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Petitioner maintains that the wording of \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) restricts interception to communication devices only when they are located within Maryland. This interpretation is not in accordance with the intent of the Legislature. When the legislature added \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) to the statutory scheme, in addition to the geographically restrictive clause \u201cwithin the State,\u201d the phrase \u201cso as to permit the interception of the communications regardless of whether the mobile telephone is located physically within the jurisdiction of the court in which the application was filed ...\u201d was added. The purpose of this phrase was to broaden a circuit court\u2019s authority and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>effectiveness of law enforcement investigators wiretapping mobile phones, without losing continuity due to jurisdictional constraints. This interpretation is supported by the legislative history of \u00a7 10 \u2014 401(3)(c), which was designed to enhance the authority of judges issuing ex parte wiretap orders, rather than restricting their authority. In 1991, the sponsor of Senate Bill 193, which became eventually \u00a7 10 \u2014 401(3)(c), testified that in \u201cthe midst of a drug epidemic,\u201d drug traffickers were exploiting the jurisdictional restrictions of the current wiretap laws which tied \u201cthe hands of police trying to apprehend drug traffickers and put them in prison.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">In the present case, the ex parte order was issued by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, the county where the alleged drug distribution activities were occurring. The \u201clistening post,\u201d where law enforcement officers first heard the communications intercepted from Petitioner\u2019s mobile phone, was located in a covert facility within Montgomery County. Although the Petitioner was situated in Virginia when he placed the call in question that facilitated the seizure of the marijuana and his ultimate arrest, and his call was received by a person also in Virginia, the communication was intercepted aurally by police detectives monitoring the \u201clistening post\u201d in Montgomery County. Therefore, the interception was lawful and the denial of the motion to suppress proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">BELL, C.J., and GREENE, J. dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\">.

Like the intermediate appellate court, <em>Davis v.

I do not agree, and, therefore, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The facts relevant to the resolution of this appeal are straightforward and undisputed. The petitioner, a resident of Silver Spring, Maryland, was the target of an investigation of the organized distribution of controlled substances within Montgomery County. Pursuant to that investigation, the State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County filed, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, an ex parte application to intercept and record wire, oral, and electronic communications from the petitioner\u2019s mobile cell phone, which was registered in Virginia. On the basis of the application and the supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>affidavits, a judge of that court approved the application, executing an order authorizing interception, from the petitioner\u2019s mobile phone, of \u201ctelephonic communications, short message service text messaging, caller identification information, electronic photographs, electronic video, precise positioning information, and cellular tower location data\u201d and requiring the petitioner\u2019s mobile service provider, T-Mobile, to provide position and caller identification information, without geographic limit. Thereafter, while stationed at a \u201clistening post\u201d \u2014 a covert location within the county, established for the purpose of monitoring the petitioner\u2019s communications \u2014 the Montgomery County Police overheard a telephone call, placed by the petitioner in Virginia, from his Virginia mobile phone, to a Virginia telephone line. On the basis of the information they thus received, believing that the petitioner was transporting dangerous substances from Miami, Florida into Maryland, the petitioner was confronted by the officers at his residence in Montgomery County, searched, resulting in the seizure of over nine pounds of marijuana from his suitcase and, eventually, arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress evidence was made pursuant to \u00a7 10 \u2014 408(i)(l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argued then, as he does now, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>that the wiretap order was obtained in violation of \u00a7 10-408(c)(3). That section, he maintains, is clear and unambiguous, and, by its plain language, does not authorize law enforcement officers, operating under an ex parte order issued by a Maryland circuit court judge, to intercept communications when the \u201celectronic, mechanical, or other device\u201d is located outside of this state. He concludes, since the petitioner\u2019s cell phone was registered to a Virginia address, and the entire intercepted communication took place while the petitioner was in Virginia, and was with a recipient who was located outside the state of Maryland, that the interception exceeded the permissible scope of the ex parte order and was, thus, impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The majority holds that \u201cinterception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication, for the purposes of the Maryland wiretap statute, occurs where law enforcement officers capture or redirect first the contents of the communication overheard by the wiretap and where they heard originally the communication.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>op. at 218, 43 A.3d at 1048. Therefore, it reasons, \u201cas long as the \u2018listening post\u2019 was located within the territorial jurisdiction of the court issuing the ex parte wiretap order, neither the physical location of the mobile phone at the time the call was placed and during the communication or the recipient of the call are material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 43 A.3d at 1048. To reach this result, the majority rejects, as it must, the petitioner\u2019s plain language argument and concludes that \u201cthe language of \u00a7 10-408(c) is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 221, 43 A.3d at 1050. Nota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>bly, however, the majority does not provide an explanation for this conclusion, stating only that a reading of \u00a7 10 \u2014 408(c) that construes the phrase, \u201canywhere within the state\u201d as modifying the phrase, \u201ca communication device,\u201d rather than the word, \u201cinterception,\u201d \u201cwould present an enormous logistical and technological challenge to law enforcement operators and, in cases where the subject of an investigation crosses back and forth over state or other boundary lines ..., the task may be impossible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 43 A.3d at 1054. As a result, it looks to the legislative history of the statute to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Davis, </em>op. at 221-22, 43 A.3d at 1049-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Turning first to a consideration of the legislative purpose underlying the enactment of the Maryland Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Law, Md.Code. (1957, 2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7\u00a7 10-401\u201410-414 of the Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Article, <em>Davis, </em>op. at 219-20, 43 A.3d at 1048-49, the majority looks to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2521, passed by Congress in 1968 to \u201cprovide minimum standards for the interception of oral, wire, and electronic communications during criminal investigations and prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 43 A.3d at 1048. Noting that Title III permitted each state, in response, to enact a statute addressing the interception of such communications which would be at least as protective of individual rights as Title III, <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 69, 591 A.2d 481, 483 (1991), it found it significant that the Maryland wiretap statutory scheme was enacted, in 1977, in response to Title III. <em>Davis, </em>op. at 219-20, 43 A.3d at 1048-49. Then looking to the history of the Maryland Wiretap Act in an effort to determine the intent of the Legislature regarding the jurisdictional reach of an ex parte order under \u00a7 10-408(c), <em>id. </em>at 221-23, 43 A.3d at 1049-51, and finding no elucidation, in that regard, the majority reminds us that, notwithstanding the fact that the Maryland Act is more restrictive, in multiple places,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Maryland Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>is an \u201coffspring\u201d of Title III, <em>id. </em>at 223, 43 A.3d at 1051, and, therefore, relies on this connection between the two statutory schemes, as well as similarities between the Maryland Act and Title III, to justify \u201clook[ing] to apt federal courts cases [interpreting Title III] for persuasive guidance interpreting analogous provisions of the Maryland statute.\u201d Op. at 223, 43 A.3d at 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">From this overview of federal case law,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the majority concludes that Title Ill\u2019s grant of authority to a judge to \u201center an ex parte order, as requested or as modified, authorizing or approving interception of we, oral, or electronic communications within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the judge is sitting (and outside that jurisdiction but within the United States in the case of a mobile interception device authorized by a Federal court within such jurisdiction)\u201d analogously allows state law enforcement officers, acting pursuant to an ex parte order issued under \u00a7 10-408, to intercept communications anywhere in the country as long as the \u201clistening post\u201d is located within this state. <em>Id. </em>at 228-29, 43 A.3d at 1054. The majority also concludes that, since \u201cinterception\u201d, as defined by \u00a7 10-408(c), and similar to Title III, refers to \u201cthe aural or other acquisition,\u201d or the hearing, \u201cof the contents of any wire,\u201d the point of interception is where the contents of the communication are actually heard, that is, at the \u201clistening post.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229-30, 43 A.3d at 1054-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">I disagree. Section 10-408(c)(3) is clear and unambiguous. Its plain language requires that, for lawful interception to occur, the communication device from which the wire, oral or electronic communication is to be intercepted, must be within the state. Holding otherwise impermissibly expands the authority of a circuit court, pursuant to \u00a7 10-408(c)(3), to issue an order that, beyond the location of a \u201clistening post,\u201d need not establish a connection, through the device wiretapped, between the party whose communication is being intercepted, and the state of Maryland, and has neither boundaries nor standards. Its reach could be anywhere in the United States and, indeed, the world. Furthermore, \u00a7 10-408(c)(3)\u2019s legislative history confirms my construction. It demonstrates an intent to expand the statute\u2019s reach beyond a court\u2019s territorial boundary, to be sure, but only <em>within </em>the state, and not outside of it. The majority\u2019s reliance on Title III to interpret \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) is also misplaced, as that statutory scheme is considerably more expansive in its reach; it contemplates federal jurisdiction and, therefore, unlike state jurisdiction, requires that federal law enforcement be able to operate across state lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">To determine the intended reach of the Maryland Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, Md.Code.

Article, we are guided by the rules of statutory interpretation. We \u201cbegin[ ] with the plain language of the statute,\u201d and look to \u201cordinary, popular understanding of the English language [to] dictate[ ] interpretation of its terminology.\u201d <em>Kushell v.

It is important, in so doing, that we \u201cneither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain language of the statute; nor construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d <em>Price v.

Accordingly, \u201c[i]f there is no ambiguity in that language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances ..., we do not then need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction, for the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u201d <em>Arundel Corp. v.

The purpose of Title III was to provide \u201cuniform minimum standards governing the interception and use of oral, wire, and electronic communications in connection with the prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of certain criminal offenses.\u201d <em>Mustafa, </em>323 Md. at 69, 591 A.2d at 483. The Act \u201cprohibited the interception and use of oral and wire communications unless obtained in strict conformity with the Act\u2019s provisions, which prescribed a uniform minimum national standard governing the interception and use of such communications in connection with a number of designated criminal offenses.\u201d <em>Ricks v. State, </em>312 Md. 11, 13-14, 537 A.2d 612, 613 (1988). By its terms, it did not apply to the states. Because each state had to pass an implementing state law, which \u201cmay not be less but may be more restrictive than the federal law,\u201d <em>Mustafa, </em>323 Md. at 69, 591 A.2d at 483, <em>see also, </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(2), the state of Maryland adopted the Maryland Wiretap Act which, although it largely mirrored the provisions of the federal law, was, in certain respects, more restrictive, <em>supra, </em>note 3. <em>Mustafa, </em>323 Md. at 69, 591 A.2d at 483; <em>Ricks, </em>312 Md. at 15, 537 A.2d at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">As indicated, Title III contains a general prohibition against the interception, \u201cthe aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(4), and disclosure of wire, oral, or electronic communications. That portion of the Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\u201c(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201c(a) intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201c(b) intentionally uses, endeavors to use, or procures any person to use or endeavor to use any electronic, mechanical, or other device to intercept any oral communication when\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">\u201c(i) such device is affixed to, or otherwise transmits a signal through, a \"wire, cable, or other like connection used in wire communication; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u201c(ii) such device transmits communications by radio, or interferes with the transmission of such communication ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">\u201c(c) intentionally discloses, or endeavors to disclose, to any person the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subsection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201c(d) intentionally uses, or endeavors to use, the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subsection.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">Moreover, \u201c[w]henever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part of the contents of such communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing or other proceeding ... if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of [the] chapter.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">There is an exception to this general prohibition, however. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(1). That section allows the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, or any Assistant Attorney General to \u201cauthorize an application to a Federal judge of competent jurisdiction\u201d for \u201can order authorizing or approving the interception of wire or oral communications by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a Federal agency having responsibility for the investigation of the offense as to which the application is made, when such interception may provide or has provided evidence of\u2019 certain designated offenses. Section 2518 prescribes the procedure for obtaining an ex parte order authorizing the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications and the jurisdictional reach of such an order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\u201c(1) Each application for an order authorizing or approving the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>under this chapter shall be made in writing upon oath or affirmation to a judge of competent jurisdiction and shall state the applicant\u2019s authority to make such application----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">\u201c(3) Upon such application the judge may enter an ex parte order, as requested or as modified, authorizing or approving interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications <em>within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the judge is sitting (and outside that jurisdiction but within the United States in the case of a mobile interception device authorized by a Federal court within such jurisdiction), </em>if the judge determines on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\u201c(a) there is probable cause for belief that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a particular offense enumerated in section 2516 <em>[supra </em>] of this chapter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\u201c(b) there is probable cause for belief that particular communications concerning that offense will be obtained through such interception;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201c(c) normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.... \u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">With regard to state authorities and state judges, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">\u201cThe principal prosecuting attorney of any State, or the principal prosecuting attorney of any political subdivision thereof, if such attorney is authorized by a statute of that State to make application to a State court judge of competent jurisdiction for an order authorizing or approving the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications, may apply to such judge for, and such judge may grant in conformity with section 2518 of this chapter and with the applicable State statute an order authorizing, or approving the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications by investigative or law enforcement officers having responsibility for the investigation of the offense as to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>application is made, when such interception may provide or has provided evidence of the commission of the offense of murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, bribery, extortion, or dealing in narcotic drugs, marihuana or other dangerous drugs, or other crime dangerous to life, limb, or property, and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, designated in any applicable State statute authorizing such interception, or any conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Like Title III, the Maryland Act contains a general prohibition against \u201c[w]illfully intercepting], endeavoring] to intercept, or procuring] any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication.\u201d \u00a7 10-402(a)(l). It also, again like Title III, defines \u201cinterception\u201d as the \u201caural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\u201d \u00a7 10-401(3). The Maryland Act likewise contains exceptions to the general prohibition. Section 10-406(a) permits the Attorney General, State Prosecutor, or any State\u2019s Attorney to \u201capply to a judge of competent jurisdiction, and the judge, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 10-408 ..., [to] grant an order authorizing the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications by investigative or law enforcement officers when the interception may provide or has provided evidence of the commission of,\u201d among other crimes, \u201c[d]ealing in a controlled dangerous substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The Maryland analog to \u00a7 2518 is \u00a7 10-408. That section prescribes the process by which the Attorney General, State Prosecutor, or a State\u2019s Attorney may obtain an ex parte interception order from a judge of competent jurisdiction and the jurisdictional reach of that order. Subsection (c)(1) delineates the showings required to be made by the applicant for an ex parte order, prerequisite to the issuance of such order. Upon those showings having been made, subsection (c)(2) provides that any ex parte order issued \u201cmay authorize the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications only within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>application was filed.\u201d Where, however, the application is filed by the Attorney General, the State Prosecutor, or, as in this case, a State\u2019s Attorney, the order may authorize communications made outside of the territorial jurisdiction of the issuing court to be intercepted, but only those \u201cinterception[s] of communications received or sent by a communication device anywhere within the State ....\u201d\u00a7 10-408(c)(3). The General Assembly gave its reason for drawing that distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">\u201cso as to permit the interception of the communications regardless of whether the communication device is physically located within the jurisdiction of the court in which the application was filed at the time of the interception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfL\">Subsection (c)(4) contains another exception, not relevant here, concerning the reach of the order after jurisdiction once has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The petitioner\u2019s main contention is that \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) does not authorize the interception of wire, oral or electronic communications that are not received or sent by a communication device in this state. The Court of Special Appeals rejected this argument, believing that it required it \u201cto look at what is now \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) in a vacuum.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>199 Md.App. at 289, 21 A.3d at 190. It reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">\u201cthe entitlement to intercept is indifferent to whether an inculpatory message is inbound from Macao or from Mt. Airy....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">\u201c... The critical situs at which an interception occurs may be at either or both of two places: 1) where the suspect phone which is the subject of the interception order is located, regardless of whether that phone is sending a message or receiving a message; and 2) where the police are located as they monitor and hear the intercepted message, to wit, the location of the \u2018listening post.\u2019 The judge who issues the interception order must have jurisdictional authority over at least one of those two places as well as over the place where the crime has occurred and is to be prosecuted. The other end of the line, on the other hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>wherever it may be, has nothing to do with the issue of jurisdiction. If the appellant were right that the location of the other end of the line had jurisdictional significance, we would dread to contemplate the implications of intercepting a conference call.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><em>Id., </em>199 Md.App. at 287, 21 A.3d at 189. The majority agrees with this position, and concludes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">\u201c[bjecause Maryland\u2019s wiretap statute defines \u201cinterception\u201d to include aural acquisition of communication in the same way that Title III defines the term; we accept and apply the rationale employed in <em>Rodriguez </em>(followed by other courts), that interception occurs where the communications were first captured or redirected, as well as where they were first heard by law enforcement agencies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-6\"><em>Davis, </em>Op. at 230, 43 A.3d at 1055. I disagree with the position of my colleagues on this Court, and the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Section 10-408(c)(3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">\u201cIf an application for an ex parte order is made by the Attorney General, the State Prosecutor, or a State\u2019s Attorney, an order issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection may authorize the interception of communications received or sent by a communication device <em>anywhere within the State </em>so as to permit the interception of the communication regardless of whether the communication device is physically located within the jurisdiction of the court in which the application was filed at the time of the interception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmY\">(Emphasis added). This provision establishes a clear limit on the reach of an ex parte order authorizing interceptions of communications: only those communications that either are received or sent by a communication device \u201canywhere within the state\u201d are covered. This is the only reasonable construction of this statute. The words, \u201cwithin the State,\u201d must modify the immediately preceding words, \u201ccommunication device,\u201d and <em>not, </em>contrary to what the majority believes, the words, \u201ccommunications received or sent.\u201d <em>See Davis, </em>op. at 228-29, 43 A.3d at 1054. There are several reasons that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>is so. Section 10-408(c)(3) permits the interception of more than electronic communications, wire and oral communications are also subject to being intercepted. Thus, landlines, not simply mobile phones, are covered. Moreover, the intercept order requires that there be an object, a device, to be monitored for interceptable communications, through which the sought communications emanate and through which they are transmitted. The communication device, the phone, is that object; the communication is the product, the result; it does not, cannot, exist apart from the device. Thus, central to the ex parte order is the communication device, whose communications, in and out, are to be monitored. Without it, there could be no intercept order because there could be no interceptable communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The communication device is the critical element of \u00a7 10-408(c)(3), as well. It is the transmitter of the communications and the receptacle for the communications; the communications that may be intercepted are those that are \u201creceived or sent by a communication device.\u201d And, because of that intermediary role, \u201cwithin the state\u201d must delineate the requirement of the physical location of the communication device. It could not refer to the \u201clistening post\u201d since that is not the device being monitored and, thus, to which it was sent or received. It also is relevant that the communication device comes immediately after, and provides an explanation for, providing that the communication to be intercepted be to or from the communication device.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Where, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>communications were neither sent from, nor received by, a communication device within the state, the interception of such communications is patently outside the coverage of \u00a7 10-408 and, thus, illegal. As to this, there is, and can be, no ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The petitioner notes, and I agree, that \u00a7 10-408(c)(2) supports this construction. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">\u201cExcept as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection, an ex parte order issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection may authorize the interception of wire, oral, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>or electronic communications only <em>within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the application was filed.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-U\">(Emphasis added). This section establishes an initial limitation on the reach of the ex parte order. \u201cTerritorial jurisdiction,\u201d as relevant here, is defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, (9th Ed.2009), as the \u201c[tjerritory over which a government, one of its courts, or one of its subdivisions has jurisdiction.\u201d In the state of Maryland, the \u201cterritorial jurisdiction\u201d of a state circuit court is the county in which the court is located, or the city of Baltimore, if that is where the presiding judge is sitting. Md.Code. (1973, 2006 RepLVol., 2011 Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 1-501 &amp; 1-503 of the Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Article. Where, therefore, the application for an ex parte order is not made by the Attorney General, the State Prosecutor, or a State\u2019s Attorney, an ex parte order, issued by a circuit court, may authorize the interception of communications within the county or, as relevant, the city over which it has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">When \u00a7 10-408(c)(2) is read together with \u00a7 10-408(c)(3)\u2019s provision that the ex parte order, if pursuant to an application filed by the Attorney General, the State Prosecutor, or a State\u2019s Attorney, may \u201cauthorize the interception of communications received or sent by a communication device <em>anywhere within the State ... regardless of whether the communication device is physically located within the jurisdiction of the court in which the application was filed,\u201d </em>it becomes clear that the Legislature intended to expand the reach of the ex parte order, in that circumstance, beyond the territorial jurisdiction of a circuit court, but only within the State\u2019s borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The majority concludes that \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) is ambiguous. There is nothing in the language of \u00a7 10-408 to support that interpretation. Indeed, the majority\u2019s conclusion, in that regard, is as \u201cforced,\u201d and \u201cstrained,\u201d <em>Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 577, 870 A.2d at 193, as its conclusion on the merits, that \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) authorizes the interception of communications sent, in effect, from anywhere in the United States and, indeed, the world, as long as the law enforcement officers monitoring such communications are located in Maryland while doing so. Construing this statute to be ambiguous is possible only if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>significance of the communication device in the -wiretap process is disregarded or undervalued, in favor of its product, the communication, and by reading the location modifier, \u201canywhere in this State\u201d, as applicable to the communication, rather than to the communication device. As to the latter, applying the modifier to the communication is grammatically incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Even if \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) were ambiguous and we were required to consult legislative history for guidance in discerning its meaning and the legislative intent in enacting it, my conclusion would be confirmed. There is sufficient indication in those portions of the legislative history upon which the majority relies, <em>Davis, </em>op. at 221-23, 43 A.3d at 1049-51, to establish that the Legislature intended to authorize interception of only those communications that take place within the state, that are \u201creceived or sent by a communication device anywhere within the state.\u201d That is what the summary of Senate Bill 153, the legislation responsible for the addition of \u00a7 10-408(c) to the Maryland Wiretap Act and, thus, the expansion of a circuit court\u2019s authority regarding ex parte orders, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u201cThis bill permits a State\u2019s Attorney to obtain an ex parte order authorizing the interception of communications sent or received by mobile telephone <em>anywhere in the state </em>regardless of where the mobile telephone is physically located at the time of interception regardless of the territorial jurisdiction of the court that issues the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-7\"><em>Davis, </em>199 Md.App. at 290, 21 A.3d at 191 (2011) (emphasis added). It is consistent with the statute, as signed into law. Just as the statute does, the summary emphasizes, not just communications, but those \u201csent or received by mobile telephone anywhere in the state.\u201d The reference to the physical location of the phone merely recognizes that it could be anywhere in the state when the interception occurs; it need not be located in the jurisdiction of the issuing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Furthermore, the stated Background for Senate Bill 153 is to the same effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\u201cUnder current law, an ex parte order (an order granted at the request and for the benefit of one party only without giving notice to the adverse party or providing the adverse party with an opportunity to contest the order) authorizing the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications may be issued only for communications within its territorial jurisdiction of the circuit court in which the application is filed. Therefore, to intercept communications on a mobile telephone, a separate order must be obtained from the circuit court in each jurisdiction in which the mobile telephone might be moved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">\u201cThis bill removes the need for obtaining multiple ex parte orders by providing for multijurisdictional wiretap orders from mobile telephones.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">(Emphasis added). This Background makes the point even clearer. It demonstrates the reasoning behind the addition of subsection (c)(3), in the process recognizing explicitly that the location of the communication device is critical, for it is that which is the receptacle or transmitter of the communications subject to interception: \u201cto intercept communications on a mobile telephone, a separate order must be obtained from the circuit court in each jurisdiction in which the mobile telephone might be moved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">As the majority, itself, notes, Senator Murphy, the sponsor of Senate Bill 153, stated, during a hearing on the Bill, that expanding the reach of ex parte orders issued by circuit court judges in those limited circumstances contemplated by subsection (c)(3) would allow law enforcement to better respond to drug trafficking problems by enabling them to \u201cweav[e] in and out of <em>counties </em>and across one jurisdictional boundary after another <em>within the state.\u201d </em>Hearing Before the Judicial Proceedings Committee (30 Jan. 1991) (emphasis added). This is yet another clear indication that the expansion sought by subsection (c)(3) was only intended to enhance law enforcement operations -within the borders of Maryland. Had the Legislature intended Maryland ex parte orders to operate beyond the borders of the State, assuming it has that authority, it certainly should and could have said so. Indeed, as I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>stated earlier, \u201cthe Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u201d <em>Arundel Corp., </em>388 Md. at 502, 860 A.2d at 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Moreover, I believe the majority\u2019s reliance on Title III, as interpreted by federal courts, to be misplaced. So, too, is its \u201cadoption] [of] ... the federal gloss in determining the proper jurisdiction and scope for an ex parte wiretap order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214, 43 A.3d at 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">It is true that the language of the Maryland Wiretap Act, not unexpectedly, closely tracks the language of Title III in a number of provisions; however, the majority overstates and overemphasizes this similarity. The similarities simply are not sufficiently overarching to justify interpreting the state statutory scheme in an identical manner as the federal act. In fact, in addition to \u201cthose minor respects in which the Maryland law is more restrictive than its federal counterpart,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>199 Md.App. at 278, 21 A.3d at 184, Title III differs from its Maryland offspring in an extremely important respect: while, for jurisdictional purposes, Title III makes a clear distinction between interceptions of communications involving a landline and those involving a mobile phone, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(3), section 10-408(c)(3), does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In deferring to the interpretation, by the federal courts, of the federal statute as instructive, even dispositive, of the interpretation of the comparable Maryland statute, the majority is persuaded by the fact that both statutes define \u201cintercept\u201d in the exact same way. While true, there is a critical difference \u2014 the effect and consequence on jurisdiction of intercepting communication from mobile phones \u2014 that has significance to this case. Title Ill\u2019s definition of \u201cintercept,\u201d today, includes electronic communication among those that may be acquired using the prescribed communication devices. \u00a7 2510(4). At its enactment, it encompassed only communications occurring over landlines; it did not cover electronic communications. Once Title III was amended to account for mobile telephones, Congress recognized the need to \u2014 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>did \u2014 change the jurisdictional effect on ex parte orders involving mobile phones.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The Maryland definition of \u201cintercept\u201d has a similar progression, which the Court of Special Appeals acknowledged and on which it commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\u201cNeither the original Title III nor the original Maryland Wiretapping Act ... covered communications between cellular phones. Such expanded coverage would not, indeed, follow until 1986 on the federal side, or until 1988 on the Maryland side. In <em>Bartnicki v. Vopper, </em>532 U.S. 514, 524, 121 S.Ct. 1753, 149 L.Ed.2d 787 (2001), Justice Stevens described the time and the substance of the enhanced coverage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">\u2018As enacted in 1968, Title III did not apply to the monitoring of radio transmissions. In the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 1848, however, Congress enlarged the coverage of Title III to prohibit the interruption of \u201celectronic\u201d as well as oral and wire communications. By reason of that amendment, as well as a 1994 amendment which applied to cordless telephone communications, 100 Stat. 4279, Title III now applies to the interception of conversations over both cellular and cordless phones.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cMaryland followed the federal lead by enacting ch. 607 of the Acts of 1988. To the definitions in \u00a7 10-401, which already included \u201cwire communication\u201d and \u201coral communication,\u201d Maryland, again following Title Ill\u2019s example, added as \u00a7 10-401(11) a definition of \u201celectronic communication\u201d:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">\u2018(ll)(i) \u2018Electronic communication\u2019 means any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic, or photooptical system.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">\u201cWhereas \u00a7 10-402(a), the operational criminalizing provision, had originally only prohibited the interception of wire and oral communications, it now added, again following Title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Ill\u2019s example, \u201celectronic communication\u201d to the protective coverages:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">\u2018(a) Unlawful acts. \u2014 Except as otherwise specifically provided in this subtitle it is unlawful for any person to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACi\">(1) Wilfully intercept, endeavor to intercept, or procure any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication[.]\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201cIt was necessary to add \u2018electronic\u2019 to \u00a7 10-402(a) because a cellular communication is neither a \u2018wire communication\u2019 nor an \u2018oral communication\u2019 and, therefore, was not covered by the existing law. Although it did not do so until 1988, \u00a7 10-402 now clearly covers communications involving cellular phones. The law, as amended in 1988, therefore covers the present case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\"><em>Davis, </em>199 Md.App. at 285-86, 21 A.3d at 187-88 (emphasis omitted). Maryland, unlike Congress, did not carve out a jurisdictional niche for communications derived from mobile phones; it did not amend \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Neither the intermediate appellate court nor the majority addresses the difference between \u00a7 2518(3), specifically with regard to the distinction it draws, jurisdictionally, when the communications are obtained from the wiretapping of a mobile phone, and \u00a7 10-408(c)(3), which draws no such distinction. This is an important difference. In 1986, along with its inclusion of \u201celectronic communications\u201d in the language of Title III, Congress, in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(3), substituted \u201cwire, oral, or electronic\u201d for \u201cwire or oral\u201d and inserted, \u201c(and outside that jurisdiction but within the United States <em>in the case of a mobile interception device authorized by a Federal court within such jurisdiction),\u201d </em>Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, Pub.L. 99-508 (emphasis added). This amendment accomplished two things: first, it created an exception to the general prohibition of \u00a7 2518(3), limiting interceptions to \u201ccommunications within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the judge is sitting\u201d by, second, authorizing interception across state lines, but <em>only </em>pursuant to an ex parte order issued by a Federal court, and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>communications sent or received by a mobile device. Section 2518(3), thus, authorizes the \u201caural ... acquisition,\u201d \u00a7 2510(4), of an \u201coral communication\u201d or \u201cwire communication,\u201d only within the territorial jurisdiction of the issuing court, while authorizing \u201caural ... acquisition\u201d of an \u201celectronic communication\u201d involving a mobile device \u201cwithin the United States.\u201d It makes sense, given the need to help law enforcement better perform their function, to allow greater latitude, albeit within the limits of the country\u2019s borders, in the case of mobile phones, while creating a jurisdictional anchor for landline communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">In contrast, the Maryland Legislature, in amending \u00a7 10-401(3) and \u00a7 10-402 to include \u201celectronic communications,\u201d did not amend \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) to draw such a jurisdictional distinction. Consequently, read as the majority does, \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) authorizes the interception of any communication\u2014 oral, wire and electronic, without geographic limit, occurring anywhere in the United States \u2014 or, as the majority opinion suggests, <em>Davis, </em>op. at 230-31, 43 A.3d at 1055-56, and certainly the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion states, <em>Davis, </em>199 Md.App. at 287, 21 A.3d at 189, anywhere in the world, as long as the law enforcement officers are located within the state. This reading of the statute is not only attenuated, it is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 362, 88 S.Ct. 507, 517, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 588 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring) (\u201c[RJeasonable expectations of privacy may be defeated by electronic as well as physical invasion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The Maryland Wiretap statute was required, by Title III, to be at least as protective of individual rights as the federal act. <em>See United States v. Kahn, </em>415 U.S. 143, 151, 94 S.Ct. 977, 982, 39 L.Ed.2d 225 (1974); <em>Mustafa, </em>323 Md. at 69, 591 A.2d at 483; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(2). Indeed, we have recognized, in that regard, that \u201cwhile Title III requires an appropriate state act before it can be effectuated, under no circumstances is that law enforceable if it is less restrictive than the federal statute so that it grants the governing power more rights at the expense of its citizens.\u201d <em>State v. Siegel, </em>266 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>256, 271, 292 A.2d 86, 94 (1972). Interpreting \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) as the majority does violates that requirement. That interpretation permits a circuit court judge to issue, and a state law enforcement officer to execute, an order that authorizes the interception of the communications of <em>any </em>individual in the United States, or, as Judge Moylan states, in China, <em>Davis, </em>199 Md.App. at 287, 21 A.3d at 189, whether, or not, the communication device being monitored and from which the communications emanate has any tangible connection to the state of Maryland. The only requirement, as this statute is construed, beyond the limits of form, content and probable cause set forth by the statute, is that the communication be heard by the investigating police officers in Maryland. This is not protective of individual rights and, if it were to any degree, it is far too tenuous to justify the level of infringement that it makes upon individual privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Premised on \u00a7 2518(3) and the federal cases interpreting it, <em>see supra </em>note 4, the majority believes that its interpretation of \u00a7 10-408(c)(3) merely places Maryland on a par with the federal courts and, therefore, Maryland is no less protective of individual rights than are those courts. <em>Davis, </em>op. at 223-24, 43 A.3d at 1051. I do not agree. There is a real difference between State and federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">It is a long standing principle, dating back to the common law, that a state\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to the confines of its own borders. <em>See St. Louis v. The Ferry Co., </em>78 U.S. 423, 430, 11 Wall. 423, 20 L.Ed. 192, 194 (1870) (\u201cIf the legislature of a State should enact that the citizens or property of another State or country should be taxed in the same manner as the persons and property within its own limits and subject to its authority, or in any other manner whatsoever, such a law would be as much a nullity as if in conflict with the most explicit constitutional inhibition. Jurisdiction is as necessary to valid legislative as to valid judicial action.\u201d); <em>State v. Knight, </em>3 N.C. 109, 2 Hayw. (NC) 109 (1799) (\u201cThis state cannot declare that an act done in Virginia by a citizen of Virginia shall be criminal and punishable in this state: our penal laws can only extend to the limits of this state, except as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>to our own citizens.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Joseph H. Beale, The Jurisdiction of a Sovereign State, 36 Harv. L.Rev. 241, 246 (1923). This broad principle of \u201cterritorial jurisdiction\u201d has an impact in several contexts, with regard, for example, to one state\u2019s ability to criminalize conduct that occurred in another, or a state law enforcement officer\u2019s ability to pursue a criminal beyond the officer\u2019s state\u2019s borders or to make an arrest in a neighboring state without that state\u2019s express content. <em>See State v. Butler, </em>353 Md. 67, 72-73, 724 A.2d 657, 660 (1999) (\u201cTerritorial jurisdiction describes the concept that only when an offense is committed within the boundaries of the court\u2019s jurisdictional geographic territory, which generally is within the boundaries of the respective states, may the case be tried in that state.\u201d). That principle applies with no less force in this context. Authorizing communications, which were received by communication devices and, therefore, disclosed, entirely outside the state from which the order emanates, to be intercepted by an order issued in that state is as violative of the permissible scope of state\u2019s jurisdiction as are the more traditional contexts. Judge Moylan\u2019s statement, that \u201cthe entitlement to intercept is indifferent to whether an inculpatory message is inbound from Macao or from Mt. Airy,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>199 Md.App. at 287, 21 A.3d at 189, is, for the reasons I have stated, simply incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">This is not to say that a state court may not exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction. It may, but, unless, I submit, expressly empowered by federal law, it must be in the context of, and limited to, the State. In fact, the Maryland judges have been authorized to exercise power outside the jurisdiction of their courts. The General Assembly relaxed the restrictions enumerated in \u00a7 2518(3) when it promulgated the Maryland Act, in particular, \u00a7 10-408(c)(3), but it did so by expanding the jurisdictional reach of ex parte orders issued by circuit court judges <em>only </em>in response to applications made by the Attorney General, the State Prosecutor or a State\u2019s Attorney. And, then, it limited, as I believe it had to, that expansion to the intra-state situation, appropriate, in any event, since the coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ty, where the circuit courts are based, is a unit of State government.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">By contrast, federal district courts are units of the federal government. While, to be sure, they operate within jurisdictional boundaries, Fed.R.Civ.P. 4, as do state courts, when authorized to act extra-territorially, it is logical that the authority would be defined, and limited by the governmental structure of which it is a part. That explains the extraterritorial feature of \u00a7 2518(3). As we have seen, in the case of mobile phones, the court is empowered to authorize interceptions co-extensive with federal jurisdiction, anywhere in the United States. Therefore, it does not follow that a state court acquires the same extra-territorial authority that a federal court does simply because the statutes under which they operate are similar. The governmental structure must be considered. In any case, when, as here, one of the statutes, the federal statute, also has a substantial distinguishing feature, i.e. the differentiation, for jurisdictional purposes, between the sources for the various communications permitted to be intercepted, that surely cannot be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">I am not persuaded that there is any, never mind sufficient, basis for the adoption of a \u201cfederal gloss\u201d for the interpretation of \u00a7 10-408(c)(3). The primary case interpreting Title III, and more particularly, \u00a7 2518(3), on which the majority heavily relies, <em>Rodriguez, </em>968 F.2d 130, is, I believe, consistent with my reading of this provision. Notably, <em>Rodriguez </em>dealt with the propriety of interstate wiretapping based on an order issued by a <em>federal </em>court in New York. <em>Id., </em>968 F.2d at 134. The court held that the interception of a communication that took place in New Jersey was proper. <em>Id., </em>968 F.2d at 135-36. That holding simply construed \u00a7 2518 and, arguably, did so correctly, given the facts and the statute involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">As the petitioner notes, and I agree, the majority\u2019s reliance on judiciary interpretations of non-Maryland wiretap statutes, including those passed by other states<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is misplaced, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>none of the cases it mentions deals with communications that occur wholly outside the jurisdiction in question.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Davis, </em>op. at 226-27, 43 A.3d at 1052-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">I do not agree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 10-408(c) and, accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Judge GREENE has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\">.

I am not persuaded by the reasoning of <em>United States v. Cosme, </em>2011 WL 3740337, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742 (S.D.Cal.2011), on which the majority relies to justify its interpretation of the Maryland Act as authorizing interceptions of communications that occur wholly outside the state of Maryland. As I previously explain, <em>supra </em>at 255-56, 43 A.3d at 1069-70, there is a clear distinction between state and federal jurisdiction. It is important to note, therefore, that the ex parte order in <em>Cosme </em>was issued by a federal district court, pursuant to \u00a7 2518(3), <em>id. </em>at *1, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742 at *7. While that court, as we have seen, operates within jurisdictional boundaries as articulated in Fed.R.Civ.P. 4, when authorized to act extra-territorially, as it is by \u00a7 2518(3), it may do so, as a unit of the federal government, within the limits of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Had the <em>Cosme </em>court held that it was proper to conduct a wiretap in Mexico, that case would be analogous to the majority's holding, <em>Davis, </em>op. at 214-15, 43 A.3d at 1046 and, as I see it, would amount to an equally impermissible expansion of jurisdiction. That is not what the <em>Cosme </em>court holds, however. 2011 WL 3740337 at *9-10, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742 at *32-33. Instead, relying on the Second Circuit's interpretation of \u201cintercept,'' <em>Rodriguez, </em>968 F.2d at 136, as defined by Title III, it concludes that the communication in question was, in fact, properly intercepted within the boundaries of the United States since \u201c[t]he intercepted conversations ... were first heard and were only heard by law enforcement officials within the Southern District of California and all conversations were intercepted within the authority conferred by \u00a7 2518(3).\u201d 2011 WL 3740337 at *10, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94742 at *33. Thus, given the circumstances, it, like the other federal court interpretations of Title III upon which the majority rests its reasoning, is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
