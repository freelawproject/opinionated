Secondarily, we decide what constitutes a request for grounds of an objection within the meaning of Maryland Rules 5-103(a) and 4-323. After his convictions for attempted second-degree murder, attempted armed carjacking, and first-degree assault, Petitioner Chaz K. Bazzle appealed, arguing that the trial court had committed reversible error by (1) failing to instruct the jury on voluntary intoxication and (2) allowing a witness to testify as to the certainty of his eyewitness identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, and Petitioner filed a petition for <em>certiorari, </em>which we granted. <em>Bazzle v. State, </em>423 Md. 450, 31 A.3d 919 (2011). For the reasons described below, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and hold that (1) the evidence did not generate an instruction on voluntary intoxication because it was insufficient to allow a jury to rationally conclude that Petitioner was so intoxicated that he was unable to form the intent necessary to constitute his crimes; and (2) Petitioner failed to preserve his objection to the witness\u2019s testimony because the trial court, by stating that it would overrule the objection unless grounds were provided, triggered the requirement, under Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Rules 5-103(a) and 4-323, that Petitioner provide grounds or lose the opportunity to raise the objection on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Facts and Legal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">On June 29, 2008, Petitioner Chaz K. Bazzle got drunk with his friends. According to Petitioner, he consumed at least three 40-ounce containers of beer in an apartment complex, went to a mall in Columbia, and drank more alcohol. He left the mall and was walking to meet his friend Lakita Butler when he was attacked and stabbed six or seven times. He ran to Butler\u2019s house, arriving around 11 p.m. Butler testified that Petitioner was \u201cbleeding\u201d and \u201calmost about to pass out\u201d when he arrived. She called 911, and Petitioner was taken to a hospital, where his blood alcohol content was measured at .157, and then again at. 137. At the hospital, Petitioner spoke with Detective Donald Guevara, telling him that he had been attacked by one man and one woman \u201con the footbridge that goes across Little Patuxent Parkway from the waterfront towards the mall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Petitioner was asleep in a hospital bed when Kohlya Eggleston, who was also being treated for stab wounds suffered that evening, recognized Petitioner as his attacker. According to Eggleston\u2019s testimony, earlier that evening he had been sitting in a truck in a gas station when a man approached, opened the door, and said, \u201cGet out of the motherfucking car.\u201d The man then stabbed him multiple times with a weapon before he could exit. Eggleston could not tell what kind of weapon was used because the man had wrapped a shirt around his hand to conceal it. The man had also been wearing a bandana to cover his face, but it slipped down during the encounter, allowing Eggleston to recognize him as Petitioner, whom he already knew as an acquaintance. Asked how certain he was that Petitioner was his attacker, Eggleston testified: \u201cvery certain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Petitioner testified in his own defense, denying that he had attacked Eggleston. He also said that he was unable to recall some of his own behavior on the night he was attacked. He objected to the question about Eggleston\u2019s certainty, but was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>overruled. He also requested a jury instruction on voluntary intoxication, but his request was denied. A jury found Petitioner guilty of attempted second-degree murder, attempted armed carjacking, and first-degree assault. Petitioner appealed, arguing, among other things, that the trial court erred by denying his request for an instruction on voluntary intoxication and admitting Eggleston\u2019s testimony about his certainty. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, and Petitioner filed a petition for <em>certiorari, </em>asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\">1. Where, during the same evening that Petitioner was alleged to have committed specific-intent offenses, hospital personnel measured his blood alcohol level at .157 and .187, Petitioner testified that he drank heavily throughout the evening, and a witness described him as \u201cbleeding\u201d and \u201calmost about to pass out,\u201d did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the jury upon the defense theory of voluntary intoxication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">2. In a prosecution in which the identity of the perpetrator is at issue, is it appropriate to admit into evidence the level of certainty of the complaining witness?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Voluntary Intoxication Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals held that Petitioner had not presented enough evidence to entitle him to an instruction on voluntary intoxication. To be entitled to such an instruction, the court held, a defendant must show \u201csome evidence of the <em>great intoxication </em>required to negate a specific intent crime.\u201d The court held that, although there was evidence that Petitioner was intoxicated, there was no evidence that his intoxication was so severe that he could not form a specific intent, did not appreciate what he was doing, or was robbed of his mental faculties. Thus, it held that an instruction on voluntary intoxication was not generated by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Petitioner disagrees, arguing that a voluntary intoxication instruction was relevant and generated by the evidence. The instruction was relevant, he says, because it provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>intoxication can negate the specific intent element of a crime, and his convictions \u2014 attempted second-degree murder, attempted armed carjacking, and first-degree assault \u2014 each contained a specific intent element.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The instruction was generated by the evidence, he says, because four pieces of evidence show that he was \u201cso intoxicated, at the time of the act, that he was unable to form\u201d a specific intent: (1) his elevated blood alcohol content; (2) his memory loss; (3) the \u201csenseless manner\u201d in which the assault was committed; and (4) witness testimony describing him as \u201calmost about to pass out\u201d on the night of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The State responds that Petitioner has not produced enough evidence to generate the instruction because, although there was evidence of intoxication, there was no evidence that he was \u201cso intoxicated when he committed the crimes that he could not form the necessary legal intent.\u201d The State asks that we adopt the reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Lewis v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 1, 13 n. 4, 555 A.2d 509, 515 n. 4 (1989), which held that, without more, mere evidence that a defendant consumed alcohol, even in an \u201cinordinate amount,\u201d is not sufficient to raise the issue of whether the defendant was so intoxicated that he could not form a specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides: \u201cThe court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law[.]\u201d We review \u201ca trial court\u2019s refusal or giving of a jury instruction under the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Stabb v. State, </em>423 Md. 454, 465, 31 A.3d 922, 928 (2011). In doing so, we keep in mind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Judicial discretion is a composite of many things, among which are conclusions drawn from objective criteria; it means a sound judgment exercised with regard to what is right under the circumstances and without doing so arbitrarily or capriciously. Where the decision or order [of the trial court] is a matter of discretion it will not be disturbed on review except on a clear showing of abuse of discretion, that is, discretion manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Don Mc., </em>344 Md. 194, 201, 686 A.2d 269, 272 (1996)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">In evaluating whether an abuse of discretion occurred: We consider the following factors when deciding whether a trial court abused its discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny a request for a particular jury instruction: (1) whether the requested instruction was a correct statement of the law; (2) whether it was applicable under the facts of the case; and (3) whether it was fairly covered in the instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 465, 31 A.3d at 928-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Here, the parties do not dispute that the requested instruction was a correct statement of the law and was not covered elsewhere in the trial court\u2019s instructions. The only question is whether the instruction was applicable under the facts of the case. The requested instruction, Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 3:31.1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">You have heard evidence that the defendant acted while intoxicated by [drugs] [alcohol]. Generally, voluntary intoxication is not a defense and does not excuse or justify criminal conduct. However, when charged with an offense requiring a specific intent, the defendant cannot be guilty if [he] [she] was so intoxicated, at the time of the act, that [he] [she] was unable to form the necessary intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">A specific intent is a state of mind in which the defendant intends that [his] [her] act will cause a specific result. In this case, the defendant is charged with the offense of (offense requiring a specific intent), which requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>State to prove that the defendant acted with the specific intent to (specific intent). [Voluntary intoxication is not a defense to (list offenses not requiring a specific intent).] In order to convict the defendant, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the degree of the intoxication did not prevent the defendant from acting with that specific intent. A person can be [drinking alcoholic beverages] [taking drugs] and can even be intoxicated, but still have the necessary mental faculties to act with a specific intent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">A requested jury instruction is applicable if the evidence is sufficient to permit a jury to find its factual predicate. As we said in <em>Dishman v. State:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">The threshold determination of whether the evidence is sufficient to generate the desired instruction is a question of law for the judge. The task of this Court on review is to determine whether the criminal defendant produced that minimum threshold of evidence necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case that would allow a jury to rationally conclude that the evidence supports the application of the legal theory desired. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\"><em>Dishman v. State, </em>352 Md. 279, 292-93, 300, 721 A.2d 699, 705, 709 (1998) (holding that, because \u201cthe evidence allowed the jury to conclude that Petitioner acted with gross negligence and not a specific intent to kill or cause serious bodily injury, the trial court erred by refusing the manslaughter instruction\u201d); <em>see also Binnie v. State, </em>321 Md. 572, 580, 583 A.2d 1037, 1040-41 (1991) (\u201cWe first must determine if the evidence adduced at the trial generated a jury issue as to whether [the defendant] acted in the honest belief that he had the right to obtain or exert control over the property as he did.... In our view, [the defendant\u2019s] testimony was sufficient to support fairly the issue whether he acted in an honest belief[.]\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); <em>Smith v. State, </em>302 Md. 175, 183, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>486 A.2d 196, 200 (1985) (\u201cThe instruction should be given in every case where there is sufficient evidence to take the issue to the jury.\u201d (citations and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">As we explained in <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 216-17, 571 A.2d 1251, 1257 (1990), the threshold is low, as a defendant needs only to produce \u201csome evidence\u201d that supports the requested instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\"><em>Some evidence </em>is not strictured by the test of a specific standard. It calls for no more than what it says \u2014 \u201csome,\u201d as that word is understood in common, everyday usage. It need not rise to the level of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d or \u201cclear and convincing\u201d or \u201cpreponderance.\u201d The source of the evidence is immaterial; it may emanate solely from the defendant. It is of no matter that the self-defense claim is overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary. If there is any evidence relied on by the defendant which, if believed, would support his claim ... the defendant has met his burden. Then the baton is passed to the State. It must shoulder the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the jury [the specific facts stated in the instruction].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\"><em>See also State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. 197, 207-08, 362 A.2d 629, 636 (1976) (\u201c[T]he burden of initially producing some evidence on the [requested instruction] (or of relying upon evidence produced by the State) sufficient to give rise to a jury issue with respect to [the instruction], is properly cast upon the defendant.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201c[i]n evaluating whether competent evidence exists to generate the requested instruction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the accused.\u201d <em>General v. State, </em>367 Md. 475, 487, 789 A.2d 102, 108 (2002).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Petitioner contends that four pieces of evidence, viewed together and in the light most favorable to him, meet this low threshold. He argues that his blood alcohol content and memory loss on the night of the crime, combined with Butler\u2019s testimony that he was \u201calmost about to pass out\u201d and the illogical manner in which the assault was committed (asking Eggleston to exit the vehicle and then not giving him the opportunity to do so<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>), constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>allow a jury to rationally conclude that he was so intoxicated that he could not form a criminal intent. Thus, he argues, the trial court invaded the province of the jury by refusing to give a voluntary intoxication instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The State responds that such evidence, at most, only goes to show that Petitioner\u2019s functioning was impaired by alcohol, not that he was incapable of forming an intent. The State cites <em>Lewis, </em>in which Judge Pollitt for the Court of Special Appeals wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">[T]he single fact that one has consumed what some may consider to be an inordinate amount of alcohol, standing alone, with no evidence as to the [effect] of that alcohol on the defendant, would not permit a jury reasonably to conclude that he had lost control of his mental faculties to such an extent as to render him unable to form the intent[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">[T]here was no attempt in this case to offer expert opinions as to the [effect] on the defendant of the ingestion of those quantities of alcohol.... Without knowing the level of one\u2019s tolerance, no good correlation can be observed between the amount of alcohol consumed and the degree of drunkenness displayed. In short, it is not the amount consumed but the effect on the consumer that is important.

State, </em>mere intoxication is insufficient to negate a specific intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-10\">Evidence of drunkenness which falls short of a proven incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to constitute the crime merely establishes that the mind was affected by drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion and does not rebut the presumption that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>man intends the natural consequence of his act.

Warren &amp; Basil M. Bilas, <em>Warren on Homicide </em>\u00a7 332 (1938) (\u201cWith regard to charging on the defense of intoxication, the usual rule applies that the charge must be based on and applicable to the evidence, and such a charge is properly refused where there is no evidence tending to show such intoxication.\u201d). Mere drunkenness does not equate to the level of intoxication necessary to generate a jury instruction on intoxication as a defense to a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">In this case, the evidence is insufficient to allow a jury to rationally conclude that Petitioner was so severely impaired that he could not form the intent necessary to constitute his crimes. To be sure, Petitioner\u2019s blood alcohol content of .157 was nearly twice the legal driving limit. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1977, 2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 11-174.1 of the Transportation Article (setting the limit at .08). Illogical behavior and memory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>loss are also generally associated with excessive alcohol consumption.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Yet Petitioner has not shown that such phenomena, which are undoubtedly \u201csome evidence\u201d that he was drunk, are also \u201csome evidence\u201d that he was unable to form a specific intent. Essentially, all Petitioner has shown is that he was drunk and exhibited the typical characteristics of being drunk. This is not evidence that he was unable to form a specific intent, and is therefore insufficient to raise a jury issue on voluntary intoxication as a defense to a specific intent crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Regarding Butler\u2019s testimony that Petitioner was \u201cbleeding\u201d and \u201calmost about to pass out,\u201d we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that those statements, in the context of describing Petitioner\u2019s appearance after having just been stabbed, \u201cplainly appear to refer to [his] injured state.\u201d We do not decide whether, in some circumstances, describing a defendant as about to pass out from alcohol could be sufficient to generate a jury issue on voluntary intoxication. We simply hold that when a person has just been attacked and stabbed, and then walked bleeding to a friend\u2019s house, a general description of him as \u201cbleeding\u201d and \u201cabout to pass out,\u201d without more specification, is insufficient to constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d that he was so intoxicated that he could not form a specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Moreover, some of Petitioner\u2019s actions on the night in question are inconsistent with the intoxication defense. To begin with, when Petitioner was attacked and stabbed after leaving the mall, he was able to recognize the gender of his two attackers, escape by running (not walking) away from them, and then locate Ms. Butler\u2019s house on foot in the dead of night while severely injured. Surely this was no easy task, and his ability to complete it, immediately after having consumed all the alcohol that he claims to have consumed, is flatly inconsistent with his assertion that he was so extremely intoxicated that he was unable to form a specific intent. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>Kreijanovsky v. State, </em>706 P.2d 541, 544 (Okla.Crim.App.1985) (holding that \u201cappellant\u2019s testimony negated the [intoxication] defense by demonstrating he was in control of his mental faculties\u201d); <em>State v. Davis, </em>81 Ohio App.3d 706, 612 N.E.2d 343, 345 (1992) (defendant\u2019s ability to be \u201cproperly oriented regarding his location\u201d and \u201cfully aware of the facts and circumstances occurring around him\u201d was inconsistent with the intoxication defense); <em>State v. Netter, </em>79 So.3d 478, 483 (La.Ct.App.2011) (testimony that the defendant \u201cwas not stumbling or staggering\u201d was inconsistent with the intoxication defense); <em>State v. Williamson, </em>668 S.W.2d 597, 600 (Mo.Ct.App.1984) (defendant\u2019s ability to spend the afternoon \u201cchopping wood and dismantling a fireplace\u201d was inconsistent with the intoxication defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Petitioner\u2019s ability to speak intelligibly while allegedly intoxicated also contradicts his intoxication theory. Petitioner\u2019s speech, even after he had consumed all the alcohol that he claims to have consumed, was understandable to both Eggleston and Detective Guevara, as Eggleston was able to repeat Petitioner\u2019s words verbatim at trial, and Guevara testified that Petitioner had explained the details of being robbed by one male and one female on \u201cthe footbridge that goes across Little Patuxent Parkway from the waterfront towards the mall.\u201d Such clear, detailed speech is inconsistent with the level of intoxication required to negate a specific intent. <em>See Netter, </em>79 So.3d at 483 (holding that the evidence did not generate an intoxication instruction because, among other things, a witness testified that \u201cyou could ... understand what [the defendant] was talking about\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Furthermore, Petitioner\u2019s decision to wear a bandana over his face and wrap a shirt around the weapon that he used to stab Eggleston demonstrates a significant amount of design in planning the crime, which is inconsistent with the assertion that he was unable to form any specific intent that night.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>See Terry v. State, </em>465 N.E.2d 1085, 1088 (Ind.1984) (holding that the defendant\u2019s ability to give directions and make \u201cdecisions on a course of action for himself\u2019 was inconsistent with the intoxication defense); <em>see also Shell, </em>307 Md. at 62, 512 A.2d at 366 (\u201cThe question ... is whether a defendant has reached that stage of intoxication that renders him incapable of forming the requisite <em>mens rea </em>which is a necessary element of all specific intent crimes.\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted)). Finally, Petitioner\u2019s memory loss was not complete, as he was able to remember being interviewed by police on the night in question. Indeed, his own explanation of his memory loss \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t recall much after I got stabbed\u201d \u2014 seems to contradict his assertion that it was the alcohol, not the stabbing, that caused him to forget certain things.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Thus, not only is there insufficient evidence, standing alone, to support his intoxication theory, but there is also ample evidence, uncontradicted at trial, that is inconsistent with the intoxication defense. Even taking for granted everything Petitioner claims about his drunken state \u2014 that he behaved illogically, was unable to recall some of his behavior, was \u201cabout to pass out\u201d after being stabbed, and had a blood alcohol content of .157, twice the legal driving limit \u2014 we are left with insufficient evidence to \u201crebut the presumption that a man intends the natural consequence of his act.\u201d <em>See Hook, </em>315 Md. at 31 n. 9, 553 A.2d at 236 n. 9; <em>Davis, </em>612 N.E.2d at 345 (refusing to instruct on intoxication even though the defendant had a .15 blood alcohol content); <em>Toler v.

Petitioner simply cannot point to evidence sufficient to satisfy that standard, leaving us with no basis to hold that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to give the instruction. <em>See Dickey v.

Thus, the court held, under Maryland Rule 5-103(a), the objection was not preserved for appeal. The court also provided an alternative ground for its judgment, holding that even if the objection had been preserved, it was rightly overruled, as testimony about a witness\u2019s certainty is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Petitioner contends that his objection was preserved because, although the trial court \u201cinvited defense counsel to approach the bench for the apparent purpose of affording an opportunity to elaborate on her objection, the court did not direct her to do so\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, Petitioner argues that the objection was preserved under <em>Gutierrez v. State, </em>423 Md. 476, 32 A.3d 2 (2011), and <em>Johnson v. State, </em>408 Md. 204, 969 A.2d 262 (2009). Furthermore, Petitioner argues on the merits that testimony about a witness\u2019s certainty is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>unreliable and prejudicial and should not be admitted, citing persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The State responds that the objection is not preserved because the trial court requested grounds and defense counsel declined to provide them. The State argues that, under <em>Boyd v. State, </em>399 Md. 457, 474-76, 924 A.2d 1112, 1122-23 (2007), and other cases, the trial court\u2019s statement that it \u201cwould overrule\u201d the objection unless grounds were provided constituted a request for grounds, triggering the requirement that counsel provide grounds to preserve the objection. In the alternative, the State argues that even if the issue is preserved, the trial court \u201cdid not abuse its discretion in permitting the victim to testify to the certainty of his identification[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">We shall not reach the State\u2019s alternative grounds, as this issue may be resolved by application of Maryland Rule 5-103(a). This rule, applicable in civil and criminal cases,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">Error may not be predicated upon a ruling that admits or excludes evidence unless ...

Similarly, Rule 4-323, applicable in criminal cases only,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A04\">The grounds for the objection need not be stated unless the court, at the request of a party or on its own initiative, so directs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">As we said in <em>Boyd:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">[A] contemporaneous general objection to the admission of evidence ordinarily preserves for appellate review all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>grounds which may exist for the inadmissibility of the evidence. Under Rules 2-517,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 4-323, 5 \u2014 103(a)(1), and this Court\u2019s opinions, the only exceptions to the principle that a general objection is sufficient are where a rule requires the ground to be stated, where the trial court requests that the ground be stated, and where the objector, although not requested by the court, voluntarily offers specific reasons for objecting to certain evidence!)] (Citations and quotation marks omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><em>Boyd, </em>399 Md. at 476, 924 A.2d at 1123; <em>see also Wilt v.

In this case, the trial court specifically offered to hear grounds for the objection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>and said that without grounds, it would overrule. That was sufficient to put defense counsel on notice that the objection would not be preserved, under Rules 5-103(a) and 4-323, unless grounds were provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">As the State points out, \u201ca principal purpose of the preservation requirement is to prevent \u2018sandbagging\u2019 and to give the trial court the opportunity to correct possible mistakes in its rulings.\u201d <em>See Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 240, 786 A.2d 706, 719 (2001). We agree with the State that \u201cto the extent that Bazzle made a strategic decision to avoid stating a basis for his objection at trial so that appellate review would not be limited to the stated basis, such gamesmanship should be rejected.\u201d As we said in <em>Robinson v. State, </em>410 Md. 91, 104, 976 A.2d 1072, 1080 (2009):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">It would be unfair to the trial court and opposing counsel ... if the appellate court were to review on direct appeal an un-objected to claim of error under circumstances suggesting that the lack of objection might have been strategic, rather than inadvertent.... [I]f the failure to object is, or even might be, a matter of strategy, then overlooking the lack of objection simply encourages defense gamesmanship.

As to the preservation of the objection, Petitioner cites <em>Gutierrez </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>but those cases say nothing about what constitutes a request for grounds. In <em>Gutierrez, </em>we simply stated that the trial court \u201cdid not ask [for] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ground(s) for [the] objection,\u201d 423 Md. at 488-89, 32 A.3d at 9, and in <em>Johnson, </em>we simply stated that the trial court \u201coverruled the objection without directing that the grounds ... be stated,\u201d 408 Md. at 223, 969 A.2d at 272-73.

Petitioner also failed to preserve his objection to Eggleston\u2019s testimony because the trial court, by stating that it would overrule the objection without grounds, triggered the requirement, under Rules 5-103(a) and 4-323, for Petitioner to provide grounds or lose the opportunity to raise the objection on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

By deciding whether the evidence is sufficient to generate a jury instruction, we do not place any burden on the defendant to prove his innocence. In <em>State v. Evans, </em>we explained that, although the Supreme Court held that it is unconstitutional to require a criminal defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>prove an affirmative defense, <em>see generally Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975), there is no constitutional infirmity in requiring a criminal defendant to put forth some evidence supporting a defense before granting his or her request to instruct the jury on it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">Of course, nothing in <em>Mullaney </em>per se precludes the use of traditional presumptions or logical inferences arising from established facts; what <em>Mullaney </em>precludes is the use of such presumptions or inferences only when they operate, ultimately, to relieve the State of its burden of persuasion in a criminal case, <em>i.e., </em>its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt all the facts necessary to constitute the offense when the issue of their existence becomes an issue in the case. The ... burden of initially producing \u201csome evidence\u201d on the issue of mitigation or self-defense (or of relying upon evidence produced by the State) sufficient to give rise to a jury issue with respect to these defenses, is properly cast upon the defendant. Once the issue has been generated by the evidence, however, the State must carry the ultimate burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt on that issue. Nothing in <em>Mullaney </em>in any way purports to circumscribe this well-established procedure; indeed in <em>Mullaney </em>the Court recognized that many states do require the defendant to make a threshold showing that there is \u201csome evidence\u201d indicating that the defendant acted in the heat of passion before the prosecution is required to negate this element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words, the prosecution need not in the first instance introduce evidence of facts which negate the existence of mitigating circumstances or of self-defense; and if the defendant adduces no evidence of these matters, no issue of their existence is raised in the case and no jury instructions regarding mitigating circumstances or self-defense need be given.

Under Maryland Rule 4-325(c), a trial court must instruct the jury concerning intoxication and specific intent crimes if the defendant requests such an instruction and there is sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find that the defendant lacked specific intent for that reason. As the majority explains, a defendant need only be able to point to \u201csome evidence,\u201d even if that evidence is overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The evidence of intoxication at the trial of this case included consumption of at least three 40-ounce containers of beer in an evening (in addition to other alcoholic beverages), a blood alcohol level of twice the legal limit for driving, and the appearance of being about to pass out. The majority makes the best case that can be made, as did the State in its presentation, for the proposition that such evidence falls short of the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard. But I am not convinced. A reasonable juror might well be persuaded that, in light of the other evidence produced at trial, Bazzle had the requisite intent, despite his drunken state.
