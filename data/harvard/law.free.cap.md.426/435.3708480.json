Approximately two years later, Port and Cowan agreed mutually to separate. Port filed ultimately a divorce complaint, on the ground of voluntary separation, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (at the time, she was a resident of the County). Cowan answered the complaint in a \u201cno contest\u201d manner. The court denied the requested relief, explaining in its written order that the marriage was \u201cnot valid\u201d and \u201ccontrary to the public policy of Maryland.\u201d Being aggrieved equally, the parties filed appeals timely, asking why an out-of-state, same-sex marriage, valid when and where performed, was not cognizable in Maryland for purposes of the application of its domestic divorce laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Putting aside for present purposes whatever may turn out to be the view of the Maryland electorate regarding recognition of the performance in Maryland of domestic same-sex marriages, the treatment given such relationships by the Maryland Legislature (until recently) may be characterized as a case of multiple personality disorder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Exhibit One in this lay diagnosis is the currently effective version of \u00a7 2-201 of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code, defining marriage, for purposes of such ceremonies conducted in Maryland, as being only between a man and a woman.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Conaway v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>Deane, </em>401 Md. 219, 325, 932 A.2d 571, 635 (2007) (rejecting constitutional challenges to \u00a7 2-201). Exhibit Two is a long list of enactments protecting gay persons and same-sex couples from discrimination (by reason of their sexual orientation and relationships) in employment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> health care,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> estate planning,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and other areas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">These perceptually mixed legal messages bear directly on resolving the question presented in the present case because they are where we find most often the public policy of Maryland. In order for the parties\u2019 foreign same-sex marriage to be recognized in this State for purposes of the application of our domestic divorce laws, that marriage cannot be \u201crepugnant\u201d to Maryland public policy, as that term is understood under the common law doctrine of comity.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The evidence is undisputed in the record of this case. Port and Cowan were wed in a civil ceremony in California on 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>October 2008.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At that time, California recognized domestic same-sex marriage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That the parties\u2019 marriage was formed validly in California is neither contested nor at issue on this record. Therefore, we assume, for purposes of this appeal, that the parties\u2019 marriage was, and is, valid in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Approximately eight months after marrying, the parties agreed to separate on or about 24 June 2009. After the requisite period of separation, Port filed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on 12 July 2010 a complaint for an absolute divorce. Cowan filed timely a \u201cno contest\u201d answer to Port\u2019s divorce complaint. The couple were not parents. There was no dispute identified or decision sought by the parties regarding marital property, alimony, or support submitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The Circuit Court received testimony at a hearing on 15 October 2010 establishing and corroborating the divorce ground of mutual separation. In its 22 October 2010 dispositive order, the court concluded that Port met the residency requirements for divorce, had been separated voluntarily for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>more than one year, and had no hope or expectation of reconciliation. <em>See, e.g., Wallace v. Wallace, </em>290 Md. 265, 275, 429 A.2d 232, 238 (1981) (stating that the three elements of voluntary separation are \u201c(i) an express or implied agreement to separate, accompanied by a mutual intent not to resume the marriage relationship; (ii) voluntarily living separate and apart without cohabitation for twelve months prior to the filing of the bill of complaint; and (iii) that the separation is beyond any reasonable hope of reconciliation\u201d); <em>Fletcher v. Fletcher, </em>95 Md.App. 114, 123, 619 A.2d 561, 565 (1993) (explaining that jurisdiction over a divorce requires at least one of the parties to the marriage be domiciled in the State). Despite these conclusions, the Circuit Court denied Port\u2019s divorce request. The trial judge reasoned solely that the \u201csame sex marriage in which the parties hereto participated is not valid pursuant to Maryland law.... [T]o recognize the alleged marriage would be contrary to the public policy of Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Port filed timely an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Cowan filed timely a cross-appeal. Despite being opposing parties technically, Port and Cowan agree that their California marriage should be recognized in Maryland for purposes of the application of Maryland\u2019s divorce laws, and a divorce granted. Prior to the intermediate appellate court deciding the appeal, we issued, on our initiative, a writ of certiorari. <em>Port v. Cowen, </em>422 Md. 353, 30 A.3d 193 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">II. QUESTION PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Port and Cowan present in their respective appeals the same, single question for our consideration: \u201cMust the Circuit Court grant a divorce to two people of the same sex who were validly married in another jurisdiction and who otherwise meet the criteria for divorce under Maryland law?\u201d Because this question is purely a legal one, we review without deference the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusions. <em>See, e.g., Taylor v. Giant of Md., LLC, </em>423 Md. 628, 651, 33 A.3d 445, 459 (2011) (citing <em>Rosemann v. Salsbury, Clements, Bekman, Marder &amp; Adkins, LLC, </em>412 Md. 308, 314, 987 A.2d 48, 52 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The parties posit that an affirmative response by us to their question is compelled by proper application of the principles of the common law doctrine of comity. They argue alternatively that the Circuit Court\u2019s failure to recognize their marriage violated their equal protection and due process rights, contained within Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. No one appeared before us, in writing or in person, to argue that we should affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because we resolve this appeal on the non-constitutional ground of comity, we shall not reach the parties\u2019 equal protection and due process arguments. <em>Prof'l Staff Nurses Ass\u2019n v. Dimensions Health Corp., </em>346 Md. 132, 138-39, 695 A.2d 158, 161 (1997) (quoting <em>State v. Lancaster, </em>332 Md. 385, 404 n. 13, 631 A.2d 453, 463 n. 13 (1993)) (noting that the Court of Appeals will not reach a constitutional issue when a case may be decided on a non-constitutional ground).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">As we noted at the outset, \u00a7 2-201 of the Family Law Article provides (now and at the time the Circuit Court decided this case) that \u201c[o]nly a marriage between a man and a woman is valid in this State.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 2-201 (LexisNexis 2006). In 2007, we concluded that this prohibition on domestic same-sex marriage did not violate Articles 24 and 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>Conaway, </em>401 Md. at 325, 932 A.2d at 635. Thus, Maryland will recognize a marriage solemnized within its boundaries if it is between a man and a woman only.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>This appeal, however, does not require us to revisit <em>Conaway, </em>nor does the resolution of this case implicate the Civil Marriage Protection Act (CMPA), enacted by the General Assembly during its 2012 session. H.B. 438, 2012 Leg., 429th sess. (Md.2012). Instead, we are asked whether a valid out-of-state, same-sex marriage may be recognized in this State, for purposes of a domestic divorce action. Courts deciding whether a foreign marriage is valid in this State, for purposes of divorce or otherwise, employ the common law doctrine of comity, not principally our domestic marriage laws. <em>See, e.g., Henderson v. Henderson, </em>199 Md. 449, 457-58, 87 A.2d 403, 408 (1952); <em>Fensterwald v. Burk, </em>129 Md. 131, 137-38, 98 A. 358, 369 (1916).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We note that there appears to be a conflict among the Circuit Courts of this State regarding the issue before us. In addition to the present case, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City denied recognition to an apparently valid foreign same-sex marriage for purposes of applying Maryland\u2019s divorce laws. The Baltimore City case is pending before the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Brown v. Keller, </em>No. 24-D10-001660DA (Cir.Ct.Balt.City, Md.2011), <em>appeal filed, </em>No. 816, September Term, 2011 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.2011). Conversely, the Circuit Courts for Anne Arundel and St. Mary\u2019s Counties granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>divorces to same-sex couples, married validly outside-of-the-State. <em>Migues v. Johnson, </em>No. 02-C-10-155341DA (Cir. Ct. Anne Arundel Cnty., Md.2011); <em>Cole v. Clover, </em>No. 18-C-10-000327 (Cir. Ct. St. Mary\u2019s Cnty., Md.2010). The divergent treatment of foreign same-sex marriages by these Circuit Courts demonstrates the need for this Court to resolve the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">A. The Doctrine of Comity</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Under the doctrine of comity, long applied in our State, Maryland courts \u201cwill give effect to laws and judicial decisions of another state or jurisdiction, not as a matter of obligation but out of deference and respect.\u201d <em>Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. CAE-Link Corp., </em>330 Md. 115, 140, 622 A.2d 745, 757 (1993) (citing <em>Galloway v. Watts, </em>395 F.Supp. 729, 731 (D.Md.1975)). When considering a foreign marriage specifically, Maryland courts follow the choice-of-law rule of <em>lex loci </em>celebrationis,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> applying the substantive law of the place where the contract of marriage was formed. <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>82 Md. 17, 28, 33 A. 317, 318 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> Generally, Maryland courts will honor foreign marriages as long as the marriage was valid in the state where performed. <em>Henderson, </em>199 Md. at 458, 87 A.2d at 408; <em>Bannister v. Bannister, </em>181 Md. 177, 180, 29 A.2d 287, 288 (1942); <em>accord </em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 283(1) (1971). There are two exceptions to this rule: the foreign marriage may not be \u201crepugnant\u201d to Maryland public policy and may not be prohibited expressly by the General Assembly. <em>See Henderson, </em>199 Md. at 459, 87 A.2d at 409 (\u201c[T]he State is not bound to give effect to marriage laws that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>are repugnant to its own laws and policy. Marriages that are tolerated in another state but are condemned by the State of Maryland as contrary to its public policy will not be held valid in this State.\u201d); <em>Fensterwald, </em>129 Md. at 137-38, 98 A. at 360 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>82 Md. at 29-30, 33 A. at 318-19); <em>accord </em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 283(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Maryland recognizes liberally foreign marriages, even those marriages that may be prohibited from being formed if conducted in this State. Research by the parties, amici, and this Court failed to reveal a case, decided by this Court, voiding a valid out-of-state marriage that was prohibited from being formed in Maryland.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Liberal recognition of out-of-state marriages promotes \u201cuniformity in the recognition of the marital status, so that persons legally married according to the laws of one state will not be held to be living in adultery in another State, and that children begotten in lawful wedlock in one State will not be held illegitimate in another.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>199 Md. at 458, 87 A.2d at 408 (citing, among other authorities, <em>Lando v. Lando, </em>112 Minn. 257, 127 N.W. 1125 (1910)). Further, the recognition of foreign marriages instills stability in \u201cone of the most important of human relations.\u201d Eugene F. Scoles &amp; Peter H. Hay, <em>Conflict of Laws </em>429 (2d ed.1991); <em>see also </em>William M. Richman <em>&amp; </em>William L. Reynolds, <em>Understanding Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 116(a), at 362 (2d ed.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The following cases illustrate the liberal recognition of valid foreign marriages in this State. Maryland law prohibits the formation of common law marriages within the State. <em>Mendelson v. Mendelson, </em>75 Md.App. 486, 502, 541 A.2d 1331, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>1339 (1988). Yet, Maryland courts will recognize out-of-state common law marriages, if valid where formed. <em>See, e.g., Henderson, </em>199 Md. at 458-60, 87 A.2d at 408-09 (recognizing, for purposes of divorce, a common law marriage formed in the District of Columbia); <em>Whitehurst v. Whitehurst, </em>156 Md. 610, 620, 145 A. 204, 207-08 (1929) (recognizing, for purposes of administering the deceased husband\u2019s estate, a common law marriage formed in New York). The Court of Special Appeals has gone so far as to infer that a couple\u2019s two-day sojourn in Pennsylvania, a common law marriage state, created a valid foreign marriage, where their relationship fulfilled otherwise the common law marriage requirements. <em>Blaw-Knox Constr. Equip. Co. v. Morris, </em>88 Md.App. 655, 669-72, 596 A.2d 679, 685-87 (1991) (concluding that, for purposes of maintaining a wrongful death claim, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to consider whether a couple was married).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">We recognized, for domestic law purposes, a Rhode Island marriage between an uncle and a niece. <em>Fensterwald, </em>129 Md. at 137-38, 98 A. at 360. At that time in Maryland, an uncle-niece marriage was void and constituted further a misdemeanor, subject to a fine. Md.Code (1904), Art. 27 \u00a7 297, Art. 62 \u00a7 2. The couple traveled to Rhode Island expressly for the purpose of avoiding the Maryland prohibition (and possibly criminal prosecution). <em>Fensterwald, </em>129 Md. at 134, 98 A. at 359. Despite these facts, we deemed the marriage so formed in Rhode Island to be valid in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">B. Applying <em>Lex Loci Celebrationis </em>to the Parties\u2019 Valid Foreign Same-Sex Marriage</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\"><em>Henderson, Fensterwald, </em>and the other cases considered above demonstrate that Maryland courts will recognize liberally valid foreign marriages. <em>See also Frey v. Frey, </em>298 Md. 552, 560, 471 A.2d 705, 709 (1984) (\u201c[N]o state interest exists in preserving a marriage in which the relationship has broken down irretrievably.\u201d). The parties\u2019 California same-sex marriage is valid. Therefore, in order for their marriage to be valid for purposes of whether Maryland will adjudicate its dissolution, it must not run afoul of either exception to lex loci <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>celebrationis: that is, it cannot be prohibited by statute or \u201crepugnant\u201d to the public policies of Maryland. For the following reasons, Port\u2019s and Cowan\u2019s entitlement, on this record, to a Maryland divorce from their California same-sex marriage is not prohibited, as a matter of law and on this record, by these exceptions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Regarding the statutory prohibition exception, Family Law Article \u00a7 2-201 does not forbid expressly valid-where-formed foreign same-sex marriages. The plain wording of \u00a7 2-201 provides that \u201c[o]nly a marriage between a man and a woman is valid in this State.\u201d It does not preclude from recognition same-sex marriages solemnized validly in another jurisdiction, only those sought-to-be, or actually, performed in Maryland. To preclude the former from being valid, the statute in question must express a clear mandate voiding such marriages and abrogating the common law. <em>Molesworth v. Brandon, </em>341 Md. 621, 630, 672 A.2d 608, 613 (1996) (\u201c \u2018[A]b-sent a statute expressing a clear mandate of public policy, there ordinarily is no violation of [it].\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Watson v. People\u2019s Ins. Co., </em>322 Md. 467, 478, 588 A.2d 760, 765 (1991))); <em>Azarian v. Witte, </em>140 Md.App. 70, 95, 779 A.2d 1043, 1057 (2001) (citing <em>Robinson v. State, </em>353 Md. 683, 693, 728 A.2d 698, 702-03 (1999)). Moreover, we note that same-sex marriages are not listed in Family Law Article \u00a7 2-202 as among those marriages considered void.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Other states intending to prevent recognition of valid foreign same-sex marriages have done so expressly and clearly, rather than by implication, subtlety, or indirection. For example, the Pennsylvania Code provides, \u201cA marriage between persons of the same sex which was entered into in another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>state or foreign jurisdiction, even if valid where entered into, shall be void in this Commonwealth.\u201d 23 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 1704 (LexisNexis through 2011). The Virginia Code provides, \u201cAny marriage entered into by persons of the same sex in another state or jurisdiction shall be void in all respects in Virginia and any contractual rights created by such marriage shall be void and unenforceable.\u201d Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-45.2 (LexisNexis through 2011). The Missouri Statute provides, \u201cA marriage between persons of the same sex will not be recognized for any purpose in this state even when valid where contracted.\u201d Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 451.022(4) (LexisNexis through 96th General Assembly).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The language of \u00a7 2-201, by comparison, fails to void for present purposes valid foreign same-sex marriages.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">On at least eight occasions, the Maryland General Assembly failed to amend \u00a7 2-201 to preclude valid out-of-state same-sex marriages from being recognized in Maryland. For example, during the 2010 legislative session, House Bill 90 (cross-filed with Senate Bill 852) sought to add the following language to \u00a7 2-201: \u201cA marriage between two individuals of the same sex that is validly entered into in another state or foreign country is not valid in this State.\u201d H.B. 90, 2010 Leg., 427th Sess. (Md.2010) (died in a House committee). Similar amendments have failed to become law on at least seven other occasions, by our count. <em>See </em>H.B. 693, 2005 Leg., 420th Sess. (Md.2005) (died in a House committee); H.B. 728, 2004 Leg., 418th Sess. (Md.2004) (died in a House committee); H.B. 531, 2001 Leg., 415th Sess. (Md.2001) (died in a House committee); H.B. 1128, 1999 Leg., 413th Sess. (Md.1999) (died in a House committee); S.B. 565, 1998 Leg., 412th Sess. (Md.1998) (passed on third reading in the Senate, but died in a House committee with an unfavorable report); H.B. 398, 1997 Leg., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>411th Sess. (Md.1997) (died in a House committee); H.B. 1268, 1996 Leg., 410th Sess. (Md.1996) (died in a House committee). This pattern permits an inference, which we take, that the General Assembly intended the doctrine of comity regarding foreign same-sex marriages to remain the proper analysis to employ here. <em>See Potomac Valley Orthopaedic Assocs. v. Md. State Bd. of Physicians, </em>417 Md. 622, 639-41, 12 A.3d 84, 94-95 (2011) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We conclude also that the parties\u2019 same-sex marriage is not \u201crepugnant\u201d to Maryland \u201cpublic policy,\u201d as that term is understood properly in applying the doctrine of comity in modern times. Admittedly, \u201cpublic policy\u201d is an amorphous legal concept.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is agreed, however, that wherever found and identified, that public policy prohibits generally conduct that injures or tends to injure the public good. <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Wash. Nat'l Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 605-06, 386 A.2d 1216, 1228 (1978) (quoting <em>Egerton v. Brownlow, 4 </em>H.L. Cas. 1, 196 (1853)). The primary sources of public policy (and where typically we look to divine it) are the State\u2019s constitution, statutes, administrative regulations, and reported judicial opinions. <em>Adler v. Am. Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 45, 432 A.2d 464, 472 (1981) (quoting <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>282 Md. at 605-06, 386 A.2d at 1228). Although courts are not confined to these emanations of public policy in their search, secondary sources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>are perceived generally as less persuasive. <em>See Adler, </em>291 Md. at 45, 432 A.2d at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The bar in meeting the \u201crepugnancy\u201d standard is set intentionally very high, as demonstrated in <em>Fensterwald </em>and <em>Henderson. </em>In the former case, this Court recognized an uncle-niece marriage solemnized in Rhode Island, despite the fact that it would be void and a misdemeanor had it been attempted to be formed in Maryland. <em>Fensterwald, </em>129 Md. at 139, 98 A. at 360. In the latter case, we ruminated, in dictum, that a valid interracial marriage solemnized in another jurisdiction would be deemed invalid in Maryland.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The dictum in <em>Henderson </em>has been discredited, <em>Conaway, </em>401 Md. at 304 n. 66, 932 A.2d at 622 n. 66, and the anti-miscegenation statute repealed, 1967 Md. Laws 6. For present purposes, however, the dictum demonstrates how elevated a standard \u201crepugnancy\u201d is. At the time of <em>Henderson, </em>interracial marriage was condemned by statute (\u201can infamous crime\u201d) and carried a severe penalty \u2014 imprisonment for not less than eighteen months and not more than ten years. Md.Code (1935), Art. 27 \u00a7 365, <em>repealed by </em>1967 Md. Laws 6. By comparison, a same-sex marriage performed in Maryland does not carry for the couple (or the celebrant) a serious criminal penalty. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 2 \u2014 406(d)(2) (LexisNexis 2006) (providing that an individual who marries knowingly two people prohibited by Family Law Article \u00a7 2-202 is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine). Thus, based on the <em>Fensterwaldr-Henderson </em>line of cases, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>conclude logically that valid out-of-state same-sex marriages are \u201crepugnant\u201d to Maryland public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">With regard to the second exception to <em>lex loci celebration-is, </em>recognizing valid foreign same-sex marriages is consistent actually with Maryland public policy. Prior to the Attorney General\u2019s opinion surmising that this Court would recognize foreign same-sex marriages (valid where entered), the General Assembly enacted several laws that protect and support same-sex couples, as alluded to earlier in this opinion. An array of statutes prohibit public or private discrimination based on sexual orientation in the areas of employment, public accommodations, leasing commercial property, and housing. Md. Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7\u00a7 20-304, 401, 501, 606, 705, 901 (LexisNexis 2009); <em>see also </em>Md.Code Regs. 01.01.2007.16(A)(13) (2007) (gubernatorial executive order protecting State executive branch employees and applicants from sexual-orientation discrimination). Maryland\u2019s domestic partner statute extends to same-sex couples, who qualify as domestic partners, certain medical and decision-making rights as regards one another.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Md.Code Ann., Health-Gen. \u00a7 6-101 (LexisNexis 2009); <em>see also </em>Madeleine N. Foltz, Comment, <em>Needlessly Fighting an Uphill Battle: Extensive Estate Planning Complications Faced by Gay and Lesbia,n Individuals, </em>40 U. Balt. L.Rev. 495, 523-24 (2011). The General Assembly granted also recordation, transfer, and inheritance tax exemptions to same-sex couples who qualify as domestic partners. Md.Code Ann., Tax-Prop. \u00a7\u00a7 12-101(e-2), -108(c)(l)(ix), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>(d)(l)(ii), 13-207(a)(2)-(3) (LexisNexis Supp.2011); Md.Code Ann. Tax-Gen. \u00a7 7-203(() (LexisNexis <em>2010). </em>Finally, this Court rejected discrimination based on sexual orientation in the context of certain family law situations. In <em>Boswell v. Boswell, </em>we concluded that sexual orientation of a parent ordinarily is irrelevant in a visitation dispute (unless the court finds that the child would be impacted adversely in a demonstrable way because of the parent\u2019s conduct with his/her partner in front of the child). 352 Md. 204, 237-38, 721 A.2d 662, 678 (1998); <em>see also North v.

In <em>Christiansen v. Christiansen, </em>a same-sex couple, whose marriage was formed validly in Canada, appealed the denial of their divorce request by the courts of Wyoming. 253 P.3d 153, 154 (Wyo.2011). Wyoming has a statute limiting marriage to a man and woman, but fails to proscribe by legislation recognition of valid foreign same-sex marriages. <em>See </em>Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 20-1-101 (LexisNexis through 2011 regular session). It also recognizes foreign marriages pursuant to <em>lex loci celebrationis </em>(although the principle is codified, rather than a creature of the common law) and will not validate a foreign marriage \u201ccontrary to the policy of [Wyoming] laws.\u201d <em>Christiansen, </em>253 P.3d at 155-56 (citing Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 20-1-111 (LexisNexis through 2011 regular session)). The court, noting that the \u201cpolicy exception is necessarily narrow, lest it swallow the rule,\u201d concluded that recognizing a valid foreign same-sex marriage for purposes of a domestic divorce proceeding \u201cdoes not lessen the law or policy in Wyoming against allowing the creation of same-sex marriages [in Wyoming].\u201d <em>Christiansen, </em>253 P.3d at 156. New York, which prior to enacting a marriage-equality law in 2011 had comity and marriage laws similar to Maryland and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Wyoming, recognized foreign same-sex civil unions for purposes of divorce. <em>See Dickerson v. Thompson, </em>73 A.D.3d 52, 897 N.Y.S.2d 298, 299-301 (2010) (no subsequent appeal).

Taney, </em>11 Pa. D. &amp; C. 5th 558 (Pa.C.P.Ct.2010).

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Under the principles of the doctrine of comity applied in our State, Maryland courts will withhold recognition of a valid foreign marriage only if that marriage is \u201crepugnant\u201d to State public policy. This threshold, a high bar, has not been met yet; e.g., no still viable decision by this Court has deemed a valid foreign marriage to be \u201crepugnant,\u201d despite being void or punishable as a misdemeanor or more serious crime were it performed in Maryland. The present case will be treated no differently. A valid out-of-state same-sex marriage should be treated by Maryland courts as worthy of divorce, according to the applicable statutes, reported cases, and court rules of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTION TO GRANT A FINAL DIVORCE TO THE PARTIES.

Like the legislation considered in <em>Conaway v.

Whether the ongoing referendum petition \"drive\u201d to place this law on the November 2012 election ballot succeeds, and if so, whether the electorate rejects the CMPA, however, has no bearing on our consideration and resolution of the present case. If the electorate rejects the CMPA, \u00a7 2-201 will remain in its present formulation.
