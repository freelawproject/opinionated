The plaintiffs are the widow of the decedent and the adult children of her marriage with the decedent. They did not identify in their complaint, or notify, a stepson whom the decedent had adopted during a prior marriage. Well over three years have elapsed since the decedent\u2019s death, without the adopted son\u2019s joining, or seeking to join in, the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>The decedent, Elliott Muti (Elliott), died on March 4, 2005. His widow is Giuseppina Muti (Giuseppina), and the children of that marriage are Thomas G. Muti (Tom), born August 1, 1978, and David D. Muti (David), born March 12, 1985. We shall refer to Giuseppina, Tom, and David collectively as the Plaintiffs or the Mutis. The stepson adopted by Elliott during a previous marriage to a Bertha Muti is Ricky Muti (Ricky). Because the Plaintiffs omitted Ricky as a \u201cuse\u201d plaintiff when asserting their wrongful death claims, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City dismissed the Plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful death claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">We must decide whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">1. To dismiss with prejudice the wrongful death claims of the Plaintiffs, as the Defendant requests; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">2. To allow the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims to proceed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">a. after permitting the Plaintiffs to amend, under a relation back theory, by naming Ricky as a use plaintiff, as the Plaintiffs request; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">b. without naming Ricky as a use plaintiff, as alternatively requested by the Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">According to Giuseppina\u2019s February 2, 2009 deposition testimony, Ricky was ten or eleven years old in 1977 and living with Bertha in Edgewood. He left that home when he was eighteen, and Giuseppina has no idea where he might be living. On deposition, Tom testified that he was a young child when he last saw Ricky, that he does not know where Ricky, or Bertha, might be living or how to contact them. Ricky did not visit his adoptive father in the hospital or come to the funeral. David testified that he has never laid eyes on Ricky.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">Over thirty-four months after Elliott Muti died, Giuseppina, as personal representative of Elliott\u2019s estate, but not individually, asserted a medical malpractice claim in the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office (HCADRO) against University of Maryland Medical Systems Corporation (UMMSC or the Defendant). That claim was amended on February 21, 2008, to add claims for wrongful death by Giuseppina, Tom, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>and David in separate counts. March 4, 2008, marked the third anniversary of Elliott\u2019s death. In August 2008, the Plaintiffs waived arbitration, and HCADRO transferred \u201cthis case\u201d to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> UMMSC served interrogatories on Giuseppina in November 2008. Answers to these interrogatories listed Ricky as a child, by adoption, of Elliott.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">On August 31, 2009, UMMSC moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to join a necessary party, Ricky. The Defendant argued that the wrongful death act required \u201cone action by all wrongful death beneficiaries against the same defendant\u201d and that \u201call wrongful death beneficiaries must assert their claims within three years as a condition precedent to maintenance of their claims.\u201d The argument is derived from two parts of the statute, CJ \u00a7 3 \u2014 904(f) and (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Subsection (f) provides that \u201c[o]nly one action under this subtitle lies in respect to the death of a person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Subsection (g) reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\u201c(1) Except [in certain occupational disease cases], an action under this subtitle shall be filed within three years after the death of the injured person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">These subsections operate in the context of the following relevant provisions of \u00a7 3-904.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">\u201c(a) <em>Primary beneficiaries. </em>\u2014 (1) [With exceptions not applicable here], an action under this subtitle shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent, and child of the deceased person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-11\">\u201c(c) <em>Damages to be divided among beneficiaries. </em>\u2014 (1) In an action under this subtitle, damages may be awarded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the beneficiaries proportioned to the injury resulting from the wrongful death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">\u201c(2) Subject to [the cap on non-economic damages], the amount recovered shall be divided among the beneficiaries in shares directed by the verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201c(d) <em>Damages </em>\u2014 Death <em>of spouse, minor child or parent, unmarried children who are not minors. </em>\u2014 The damages awarded under subsection (c) of this section are not limited or restricted by the \u2018pecuniary loss\u2019 or \u2018pecuniary benefit\u2019 rule but may include damages for mental anguish, ... where applicable for the death of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201c(1) A spouse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">\u201c(2) A minor child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201c(3) A parent of a minor child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">\u201c(4) An unmarried child who is not a minor child[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Also applicable to an action involving a claim for damages for wrongful death is Maryland Rules of Procedure, Rule 15-1001 that, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">\u201c(b) Plaintiff</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">\u201cIf the wrongful act occurred in this State, all persons who are or may be entitled by law to damages by reason of the wrongful death shall be named as plaintiffs whether or not they join in the action. The words \u2018to the use of shall precede the name of any person named as a plaintiff who does not join in the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">\u201c(c) Notice to Use Plaintiff</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-14\">\u201cThe party bringing the action shall mail a copy of the complaint by certified mail to any use plaintiff at the use plaintiffs last known address. Proof of mailing shall be filed as provided in Rule 2-126.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-15\">\u201c(d) Complaint</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-16\">\u201cIn addition to complying with Rules 2-303 through 2-305, the complaint shall state the relationship of each plaintiff to the decedent whose death is alleged to have been caused by the wrongful act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Prior to the hearing on the Defendant\u2019s motion, the Plaintiffs never amended their complaint to name Ricky as a use plaintiff. At that hearing on October 2, 2009, the attorney who argued for the Plaintiffs took responsibility for not naming Ricky as a use plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel represented to the circuit court that \u201c[w]e have been unable to locate [Ricky] since the beginning of the litigation,\u201d and that the Plaintiffs would amend, by relation back, if they found Ricky alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The circuit court dismissed the complaint, based on the violation of Rule 15 \u2014 1001(b) arising from the failure to name Ricky as a use plaintiff. It pointed out that the Plaintiffs had not filed any affidavit affirming that they were unable to locate Ricky. The court said that, in any event, even if Ricky were unbeatable, the Rule required the Plaintiffs to put \u201ceveryone\u201d on notice of Ricky\u2019s existence (or possible existence). The circuit court also granted a UMMSC motion for summary judgment that had been filed against the survival claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The Plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. That court found that they had violated Rule 15-1001, but held that the circuit court had abused its discretion by denying the Plaintiffs leave to amend without first considering whether Ricky would be prejudiced by the denial. <em>Muti v. UMMSC, </em>197 Md.App. 561, 578-79, 14 A.3d 1179, 1189 (2011). Dismissal of the wrongful death claims was vacated, summary judgment on the survival claim was reversed, and the action was remanded to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">This Court granted UMMSC\u2019s petition for certiorari and the Plaintiffs\u2019 cross-petition. The former seeks review of the vacating of the dismissal of the wrongful death claims, and the latter asks this Court \u201cto determine the appropriate factors to be considered by a trial court when formulating a consequence for the inadvertent failure [sic] to name a potential wrongful death beneficiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Two amici curiae briefs have been filed, one by the Maryland Association for Justice, in support of the Plaintiffs, and the other by Maryland Defense Counsel, Inc., in support of UMMSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Positions of Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">UMMSC contends that the wrongful death statute\u2019s one-action provision required the Plaintiffs to name Ricky as a use plaintiff within three years of Elliott\u2019s death and that compliance with that requirement is a condition precedent to the Plaintiffs\u2019 ability to continue their wrongful death claims. The one-action condition, UMMSC asserts, operates in conjunction with the condition precedent requiring a wrongful death plaintiff to sue within three years of the decedent\u2019s death. The argument seems to be that, if the entire package is not assembled within three years, no part of the package may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The Plaintiffs deny that CJ \u00a7 3 \u2014 904(g) (\u201cOnly one action under this subtitle lies in respect to the death of a person\u201d) substantially affects their claims, inasmuch as UMMSC will be subject to but one-action, either with or without Ricky as a use plaintiff. Ricky, the Plaintiffs say, may be added as a use plaintiff more than three years after Elliott\u2019s death. In any event, the requirement that Ricky be identified as a use plaintiff arises solely from Rule 15-1001 and is a procedural, not a substantive, requirement. Thus, say the Plaintiffs, analysis of the sanction for a violation of Rule 15-1001 is governed by Rule l-201(a) which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">\u201c(a) General. These rules shall be construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay. When a rule, by the word \u2018shall\u2019 or otherwise, mandates or prohibits conduct, the consequences of noncompliance are those prescribed by these rules or by statute. If no consequences are prescribed, the court may compel compliance with the rule or may determine the consequences of the noncompliance in light of the totality of the circumstances and the purpose of the rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Under a totality of the circumstances standard, the Plaintiffs assert, dismissal was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The Defendant\u2019s reply is that Rule 15 \u2014 1001(b) makes explicit what is implicit in CJ \u00a7 3 \u2014 904(f) and that a rule of procedure may create a condition precedent. Alternatively, and assuming <em>arguendo </em>that relation back is permitted, dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful death claim is appropriate under the totality of the circumstances standard of Rule 1 \u2014 201(a), particularly because of the prejudice to UMMSC arising from the additional discovery required by the late inclusion of another plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AGC\">Review of the Law</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Maryland\u2019s wrongful death statute was first enacted by Chapter 299 of the Acts of 1852. It created a cause of action, brought in the name of the State, for the use of the spouse, parent, or child of the person tortiously killed \u2014 today\u2019s primary beneficiaries under CJ \u00a7 3-904(a)(l). The damages under the 1852 Act were \u201cthe pecuniary loss sustained by the parties entitled to the benefit of the action.\u201d <em>Stewart v. United Elec. Light &amp; Power Co., </em>104 Md. 332, 348, 65 A. 49, 53 (1906). Section 2 of the 1852 Act directed that the recovery \u201cbe divided amongst the before mentioned parties, in such shares as the jury by their verdict shall find and direct.\u201d Section 3 of the Act required the plaintiff to furnish particulars of the nature of the claim and of the persons on whose behalf the action was brought.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was not until 1969, by Chapter 352 of the Acts of that year, that the earliest provision for solatium damages was enacted. Pecuniary loss, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>any, and solatium damages are the components of the individual shares required by present CJ \u00a7 3-904(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The 1852 Act also contained two provisos, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\"><em>\u201cProvided, always, </em>That not more than one action shall lie for and in respect of the same subject matter of complaint; and that every such action shall be commenced within twelve calendar months after the death of the deceased person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Today, these provisos are found, respectively, in subsections (f) and (g) of \u00a7 3-904.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The first Rules of Procedure addressing wrongful death actions were part of the monumental project undertaken by the Rules Committee to cull procedural provisions from the Maryland Code and to embody them in Rules of Procedure adopted under this Court\u2019s constitutional authority. The project culminated in the adoption of the former Special Proceedings Rules presented in the Twentieth Report of the Rules Committee, effective January 1, 1962, followed by the enactment by the General Assembly of Chapter 36 of the Acts of 1962. That legislation repealed, <em>inter alia, </em>the provisions for a bill of particulars <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and for titling the action in the name of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The Special Proceeding Rules included Subtitle Q, \u201cDeath by Wrongful Act,\u201d which, in relevant part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cRule Q40. Application of Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">\u201cThe Maryland Rules shall apply to all actions for wrongful death brought under Code, Article 67 and under Article 101, Section 58, whether the cause of action arose in this State or elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">\u201cRule Q41. Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201ca. <em>Cause of Action in This State.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">\u201cWhere such cause of action arose in this State all persons who are or may be entitled to damages by reason thereof shall be named as plaintiffs whether or not they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>joined in bringing the action: however, the names of those who did not join in bringing the action shall be preceded by the words: \u2018to the use of .... \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">\u201cRule Q42. Necessary Allegations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cIn addition to all other facts required to be pleaded, the original pleading of the plaintiff in such action shall state the plaintiff\u2019s relationship to the decedent, his right to bring the action, the names and last known addresses of all persons who are or may be entitled by law to recover damages and their relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201cRule Q43. Intervention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201cAny person claiming to be entitled to damages in such action may intervene as a party plaintiff at any time prior to verdict or judgment <em>nisi.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Further relevant revisions of the Rules applying to wrongful death actions were made when the former Special Proceedings Rules were repealed. Present Rule 15-1001 was adopted, effective January 1, 1997, as part of the comprehensive revision of the Maryland Rules that commenced in 1984. <em>See </em>22 Md. Reg., Issue 24, 1 (Nov. 24, 1995) (publishing the 132nd Report of the Rules Committee), and 23 Md. Reg., Issue 14 (July 5,1996) (publishing the order of this Court adopting that Report). The 1997 changes added the requirement in Rule 15-1001(c) for notices to all use plaintiffs and for filing proof of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The Condition Precedent Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Since at least <em>State, u/o Stasciewicz v. Parks, </em>148 Md. 477, 479-82, 129 A. 793, 795 (1925), this Court has construed the time limit in the wrongful death statute to be a substantive provision, that is, a condition precedent to asserting the statutorily created cause of action. <em>See, e.g., Trimper v. Porter-Hayden, </em>305 Md. 31, 501 A.2d 446 (1985) (superseded in part by statute, \u00a7 3-904(g)(2), regarding occupational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>disease);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Slate v. Zitomer, </em>275 Md. 534, 542, 341 A.2d 789, 794 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1076, 96 S.Ct. 862, 47 L.Ed.2d 87 (1976). A plaintiff who does not assert the cause of action within the statutorily prescribed time, now three years, loses the right to sue a defendant who is not estopped to assert the defense. <em>See Chandlee v. Shockley, </em>219 Md. 493, 502-03, 150 A.2d 438, 443 (1959). Even infancy of the plaintiff when a wrongful death claim was asserted and settled by a parent of the plaintiff does not toll the triggering of the timeliness condition. <em>See Waddell v. Kirkpatrick, </em>331 Md. 52, 65, 626 A.2d 353, 359 (1993). <em>See also Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Benjamin, </em>394 Md. 59, 77-87, 904 A.2d 511, 522-27 (2006) (contrasting conditions precedent with statute of limitations).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Here, UMMSC seeks to have us construe the one-action provision, \u00a7 3-904(f), as a condition precedent, but with a significant twist. Ordinarily it is the wrongful death plaintiff who fails to sue timely who is out of court. UMMSC asks us to hold that those plaintiffs who timely sued in this case are also out of court because there may be another living child of Elliott\u2019s who may attempt to sue, leaving UMMSC theoretically exposed to more than one wrongful death action. This argument considers the statute to compel that a wrongful death action be a unitary action by all actual or potential beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">That is not the construction placed by this Court on the 1852 statute\u2019s one-action provision in <em>Deford v. State, u/o Keyser, </em>30 Md. 179 (1869). The deceased, Mrs. Keyser, a widow, had nine children, all of whom were alive when the reported wrongful death suit was filed by a next friend on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>behalf of four infant children and an adult daughter. <em>Id. </em>at 181, 184. The tortfeasor argued that, because there were children who had not joined in the declaration and who were not named in the particulars, \u201cthe plaintiff cannot recover under the pleadings ... because of such non-joinder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184. This Court, speaking through Judge Alvey, rejected the argument, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">\u201cThe action is brought in the name of the State as legal plaintiff, for the use of such of the children of the deceased as may have been actually damaged by her death; and those who have joined in bringing the suit are those, as we may presume, who supposed themselves damaged; and if there be others who have not joined, it cannot prejudice the rights of those who have. Nor is it a matter of which the defendant Deford can complain, that all the children are not joined, for he is subject to but one action, for and in respect of the same subject matter of complaint; and the jury can only \u2018give such damages as they may think <em>proportioned to the injury, </em>resulting from such death, to the parties respectively, <em>for whom, and for whose benefit such action shall be brought;\u2019 </em>and not to all the children, or even to all those who might or could show themselves injured by the death, unless they join in bringing the action. 1 Code, 449, Art. 65, sec. 2.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 208 (emphasis in original). Further, with reference to the joinder of the adult daughter, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201cAnd the joinder of a party, as <em>cestui que use, </em>who may not be entitled to a portion of the damages awarded, should not be allowed to defeat or prejudice the rights of others who may be entitled. It is for the jury, in all such cases as this, to say whether the condition of the child, without reference to age, is one of such dependence upon the deceased parent, as to entitle it to damages in respect of the injury suffered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQt\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The result of the omission of a beneficiary was stated in <em>State, u/o Bashe v. Boyce, </em>72 Md. 140, 19 A. 366 (1890), where Judge McSherry, writing for this Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201c[The 1852 Act] permits but one suit to be instituted against the same defendant for an injury resulting in death; and therefore all who have a right to unite as plaintiffs, but who omit to become parties, are excluded from bringing a subsequent action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 143, 19 A. at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Perkins\u2019s Notes to the <em>Deford case, </em>30 Md. at 180, note (f), published in 1898, state, citing to <em>Boyce, </em>that the one-action clause prevents a second suit. Herbert Tiffany, writing in 1925 on death caused by negligence, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201cThe defendant is liable to but one action, but the nonjoinder as equitable parties of one or more who might have sued, can not prejudice the rights of those who do sue; and the joinder of a party as an equitable plaintiff who may not be entitled to recover, does not defeat or prejudice the rights of others who may be entitled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">1 Poe, <em>Pleading and Practice </em>\u00a7 453, at 441 (5th Tiffany ed.1925). More recently, Matthew Bender <em>&amp; </em>Co., <em>Maryland Tort Law Handbook </em>\u00a7 13.2 (2011), states that \u201c[j]oinder of <em>all </em>potential plaintiffs, however, is not a requirement to maintaining the suit.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Thus, the one-action clause, that has been in the wrongful death statute since 1852 without substantial change, is not a basis for dismissing an original plaintiffs claim for failure to identify a potential beneficiary as a use plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">UMMSC submits, in response to the <em>Deford </em>and <em>Boyce </em>cases, that they have been overruled, implicitly, by <em>Walker v. Essex, </em>318 Md. 516, 569 A.2d 645 (1990), and <em>Ace Am. Ins. Co. v. Williams, </em>418 Md. 400, 15 A.3d 761 (2011). <em>Walker </em>stands for the proposition that a use plaintiff, who was not identified in the suit as filed, but who asserts his or her claim within the window of the three year condition precedent, and before any judgment has been entered for the original plaintiffs, must be joined. On appeal from an unenrolled judgment, the remedy applied in <em>Walker </em>was to enlarge the set of claimants seeking damages, not to dismiss the original plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The deceased in <em>Walker </em>died on February 9, 1986. He was survived by two sons by different mothers. One son, Lupe, sued through his mother in February 1987 and agreed upon a settlement in March. Before it was consummated, the defendant\u2019s insurer learned of the half-brother, Marcus, and resisted paying. Lupe amended the complaint to add Marcus as a use plaintiff, and moved to enforce the settlement. Marcus sought to intervene. At a hearing in August 1987, the circuit court entered judgment for Lupe in the amount of the settlement, and it also allowed intervention. Thus, the trial judge was prepared to let Marcus pursue his wrongful death claim after judgment had been entered on Lupe\u2019s wrongful death claim. The trial court refused to open the judgment, as requested by Marcus, and he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">This Court vacated the judgment for Lupe and remanded. We applied the one-action rule, describing it as designed \u201cto protect a defendant from being vexed by several suits instituted by or on behalf of different equitable plaintiffs for the same injury, when all the parties could be joined in one proceeding.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>318 Md. at 523, 569 A.2d at 648. The claims were not severable in that they could not be tried in separate actions, against the same defendant, as the trial judge considered them to be. Rather, \u201c[a] judgment should not have been entered in the circuit court unless it included the interests of all the <em>known </em>beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, 569 A.2d at 648 (emphasis added). This is because \u201c[t]he statutory language does not allow a judgment for one of the beneficiaries to be made a matter of record, as by its very nature, other claims are forever foreclosed or barred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523-24, 569 A.2d at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\"><em>Ace v. Williams, </em>like <em>Walker, </em>recognized the viability of claims of known beneficiaries who asserted their rights within three years of the decedent\u2019s death, but who had not been accounted for in a settlement that was reduced to judgment. <em>Ace </em>extended the holding of <em>Walker </em>by reopening an enrolled judgment in order to permit resolution of the claims of the omitted beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>In that case, the deceased was struck and killed by a motor vehicle on September 12, 2002. He was survived by two sons from a prior marriage (Group One) and by his widow and their two sons (Group Two). Group Two sued on May 14, 2003 <em>(Williams I). </em>Their complaint identified Group One in the background allegations, but did not name them as use plaintiffs. <em>Ace, </em>418 Md. at 407, 15 A.3d at 765. Group Two negotiated a settlement under which the principal contributor was Ace, the deceased\u2019s underinsured motorists coverage carrier. Ace insisted, <em>inter alia, </em>that Group One be named as use plaintiffs. Counsel for Group Two prepared an amended complaint, so providing, that was served on Group One, <em>id. </em>at 411, 15 A.3d at 767, but there was no record of its having been filed in court. Group Two petitioned for court approval of the settlement that excluded Group One, but that petition was not served on Group One. By an order docketed May 19, 2005, the court approved the settlement of <em>Williams I, </em>and declared all claims stemming from the death of the decedent to be satisfied. Group Two filed an order of satisfaction on June 6, 2005. <em>Id. </em>at 414-15, 15 A.3d at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">On July 21, 2005, about a month and a half before the third anniversary of the deceased\u2019s death, Group One filed suit against, <em>inter alia, </em>Ace <em>(Williams II </em>).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 415, 15 A.3d at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Group One asked that the judgment in <em>Williams I </em>be opened and that that case be consolidated with <em>Williams II. Id. </em>at 420, 15 A.3d at 772. The circuit court refused to do so, and entered summary judgment in <em>Williams II </em>for Group Two. On cross-appeals, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the enrolled judgment in <em>Williams I </em>and reversed the summary judgment in <em>Williams II. Williams v. Work, </em>192 Md.App. 438, 995 A.2d 744 (2010). It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u201cAlthough Rule 15-1001(b) does not require formal joinder, the failure to include a known statutory beneficiary as a plaintiff or a \u2018use plaintiff in a wrongful death action and to settle without providing for that beneficiary can be analogized to the failure to join a necessary party in an action where joinder is required. In our view, because of the one action rule, the failure to do so is a \u2018defect\u2019 or \u2018mistake\u2019 of jurisdictional proportions in the proceeding, which may be raised at any time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 455-56, 995 A.2d at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">This Court, on certiorari review, affirmed. We selectively quoted portions of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion, including the rationale set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\"><em>Ace </em>does not support UMMSC\u2019s position in the case before us. Ace does not hold that the original plaintiffs, Group Two, lost their <em>claims </em>because known beneficiaries, Group One, had not been identified as use plaintiffs in <em>Williams I. </em>Although the settlement, <em>i.e., </em>the judgment in <em>Williams I, </em>was vacated in <em>Ace, </em>and the judgment in <em>Williams II </em>was reversed, <em>Williams v. Work, </em>192 Md.App. at 468, 995 A.2d at 762, the entire matter was remanded for further proceedings to which the original plaintiffs and the use plaintiffs, who had joined the action, would be parties. Further, <em>Ace </em>does not affect the long recognized condition precedent that requires a beneficiary to sue within three years of death. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Ricky did not do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, Ricky\u2019s claim has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Relation Back</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The Mutis contend that the trial court erred by not applying the doctrine of relation back and treating Ricky as having been named as a use plaintiff when the Mutis filed their action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Relation back cannot be applied in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>however, because Ricky\u2019s claim has expired by operation of the three year condition precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Judge Kaufman so held, applying Maryland law, in <em>Knauer v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>638 F.Supp. 1369 (D.Md.1986). <em>Knauer </em>was an occupational disease case, decided under what is now CJ \u00a7 3 \u2014 904(g)(1).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> George Knauer and Ann Knauer, his wife, sued thirteen asbestos manufacturers on December 26, 1980, alleging that George had contracted mesothelioma. Ann joined in the action as a plaintiff in the claim for damage to their marital relationship. See <em>Deems v. Western Md. Ry. Co., </em>247 Md. 95, 231 A.2d 514 (1967). George died on May 1, 1982. On May 6, 1985, three years and five days after George\u2019s death, Ann moved to amend the complaint to assert, <em>inter alia, </em>a wrongful death claim. Although Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c) expressly recognizes that amendments relate back to the date of the original pleading, the court held that relation back could not be applied to the wrongful death claim because to do so would violate a fundamental precept of diversity jurisdiction jurisprudence, in that relation back would produce a result contrary to the result that would be reached by a state court applying the substantive law of Maryland. Citing <em>Smith v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>266 Md. 52, 291 A.2d 452 (1972); <em>Slate v. Zitomer, </em>275 Md. 534, 341 A.2d 789; and <em>Trimper v. Porter-Hayden, </em>305 Md. 31, 501 A.2d 446, the federal court recognized that, under Maryland law, the \u201c[fjailure to bring suit within the statutory three-year period bars both the remedy and the right to sue.\u201d <em>Knauer, </em>638 F.Supp. at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Judge Kaufman correctly analyzed Maryland law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, unless the Plaintiffs\u2019 action was properly dismissed as a sanc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tion for a Rules violation, the Mutis\u2019 claims can proceed, while Ricky\u2019s unasserted claim cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The Court of Special Appeals has recognized, in considered dicta, that wrongful death beneficiaries may be treated separately when applying CJ \u00a7 3 \u2014 904(g)(2). <em>See Benjamin v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>162 Md.App. 173, 873 A.2d 463 (2005), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>aff'd sub nom. Georgia-Pacific v. Benjamin, </em>394 Md. 59, 904 A.2d 511 (2006). In that occupational disease case, the claimants were the widow and two children of the deceased.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There was a dispute of material fact sufficient to overturn a summary judgment for the defendants on the issue of discovery of the wrongful death action. When remanding, the Court of Special Appeals advised the trial court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">\u201cIn the present case, there is no evidence that the children of the decedent were on inquiry notice any earlier than appellant. At trial, however, the fact finder might resolve the factual issue of notice differently as to each claimant. For the benefit of the court on remand, we express our view that the knowledge of each claimant is determinative as to that claimant. The knowledge of one claimant is not imputed to the other claimants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\"><em>Benjamin, </em>162 Md.App. at 206, 873 A.2d at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Rule 15-1001</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The fact remains that the Plaintiffs violated Rule 15-1001(b) when they did not identify Ricky as a use plaintiff. UMMSC alternatively argues that the violation of Rule 15-1001(b), on which the circuit court relied, automatically results in dismissal of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims because Rule 15 \u2014 1001(b) creates a condition precedent to the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims which must be satisfied within three years of Elliott\u2019s death. We have seen, however, that when the wrongful death statute was enacted, it did not impose such a condition, and this Court could not substantively alter a beneficiary\u2019s right by a rule of procedure. <em>See </em>Md. Const., Art. IV, \u00a7 16. We view the addition, by rule, of a second <em>automatic </em>limitation on the nature of the right to sue to be a substantive change.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">That is not to say that this Court may not, by a rule of procedure, create reasonable requirements governing the <em>exercise </em>of the statutory right. That was done in Rule 15-1001(b), which does not spell out the consequences of failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>comply with it. When a rule is violated that does not provide for the consequences of the noncompliance, the consequence is determined \u201cin light of the totality of the circumstances and the purpose of the rule.\u201d Rule l-201(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Here, the evidence under oath from the three Mutis is that Ricky, if living, is older than Tom, who was thirty-one years old when this action was dismissed. There has been no contact between the Plaintiffs and Ricky for many years, and his whereabouts are unknown. It is against that evidentiary background that we analyze the purpose of Rule 15-1001 and the circumstances of the non-compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\n<em>Purpose of Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The purpose of the rule is to implement the one-action provision in the statute. The purpose of that provision \u201cis to protect a defendant from being vexed by several suits instituted by or on behalf of different equitable plaintiffs for the same injury <em>when all of the parties could be joined in one proceeding.\u201d Walker v. Essex, </em>318 Md. at 523, 569 A.2d. at 648 (emphasis added). When the Mutis\u2019 claims were dismissed, Ricky could not be joined. His claim, if any, had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\n<em>Prejudice to Ricky</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">It is difficult to consider how a claim by Ricky could have any value, even if it were timely asserted. Given the estrangement between the Giuseppina and Bertha households, it would require a state of facts bizarre in the extreme for Ricky to establish damages of any kind under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\n<em>Prejudice to UMMSC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">At the time when this case was dismissed, there could be no prejudice to UMMSC, because Ricky\u2019s claim was extinguished. The Defendant\u2019s argument, that it would be required to undertake, and to respond to, additional discovery was in reply to the Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that relation back should be applied. We have held, <em>supra, </em>that relation back does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>apply to wrongful death claims barred by the three year condition precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\n<em>Duty of the Plaintiffs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The Mutis should have identified Ricky as a use plaintiff. Lack of knowledge of his whereabouts did not prevent compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Certified mail notice to the use plaintiffs last known address, per Rule 15 \u2014 1001(c), is a new requirement. <em>See </em>Reporter\u2019s Note, 22 Md. Reg., Issue 24 (Nov. 25, 1995). In the 1852 Act, the original plaintiff was required to deliver to the defendant, or to the defendant\u2019s attorney, full particulars of the persons on whose behalf the action was brought. That provision was \u201cmerely directory, and in nowise affect[ed] the right of the plaintiff to maintain the suit,\u201d <em>Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Balt. R.R. Co. v. State, u/o Bitzer, </em>58 Md. 372, 398 (1882). In the \u201cQ\u201d Rules, effective January 1, 1962, the plaintiff was required to state in the original pleading the names and last known addresses of all persons \u201cwho are or may be entitled by law to recover.\u201d Former Rule Q42. These provisions of the 1852 Act and former Rule Q42 seemed to put the onus on the defendant to fend for itself in achieving the benefit of the one-action rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Rule 15-1001 does not bring forward, in express terms, the former Rule Q42 requirement that the names and addresses of all beneficiaries be stated in the original pleading. This is because Rule 15-1001(b) requires that \u201call persons who are or may be entitled by law to damages\u201d be named as plaintiffs. Those beneficiaries who do not join are to be named as use plaintiffs. The Rules Committee considered that Rule 15-1001(b) would be read in conjunction with Rule l-301(a). <em>See </em>Reporter\u2019s Note, 22 Md. Reg., Issue 24 (Nov. 24, 1995). Rule l-301(a) in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">\u201cAn original pleading shall contain the names and addresses, including zip code, of all parties to the action if the names and addresses are known to the person filing the pleading. If the address of a party is unknown, the pleading shall so state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Thus, what the Mutis need only have done is state in their complaint that any address for use plaintiff Ricky was unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">It is important to note that, before that representation can be made by a plaintiffs counsel, counsel\u2019s duty of candor to the court requires that a good faith and reasonably diligent search first be made.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In cases in which the identity and location of the beneficiaries is known by the original plaintiffs, there ordinarily should be no difficulty in complying with Rule 15-1001. In cases where the whereabouts of an identified beneficiary are unknown, compliance with the steps outlined above, <em>ie., </em>identification of the use plaintiff, a bona fide and reasonably diligent search, and advising the court if the original plaintiff has been unable to find a last known address for the use plaintiff, ordinarily should satisfy whatever obligations an original plaintiff has to a use plaintiff that can be derived from the CJ \u00a7 3-904 or Rule 15-1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\n<em>Some Considered Dicta</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">No party to the instant case argues that Ricky should be deemed timely to have sued on the theory that, when the Mutis timely sued, they also represented Ricky whom they should have identified as a use plaintiff. We are nevertheless constrained to clarify some language in <em>Williams v. Work </em>and in <em>Ace v. Williams </em>that should not be read as producing that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">In <em>Work, </em>the Court of Special Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">\u201cIn common law pleading, a \u2018use plaintiff; is \u2018[a] plaintiff for whom action is brought in another\u2019s name.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 7th Ed., p. 1547. As explained above, Rule 15-1001(b) requires that all the statutory beneficiaries be made plaintiffs in a wrongful death action, whether or not they join. When they do not join in the action, they are identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>fied as \u2018use plaintiffs\u2019 and the action proceeds to their use or benefit. All known beneficiaries must be \u2018plaintiffs\u2019 under the rule and the court is put on notice that any recovery is for the benefit of all plaintiffs, joined or otherwise, in accordance with their statutory interest, whether that interest is represented by an award of damages as the result of a trial, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(c), or by a settlement, <em>Walker, </em>318 Md. at 518, 569 A.2d [at 645]. Notice to the use plaintiffs is required, but the duty owed to them as plaintiffs extends beyond mere notice. That continuing duty is, in our view, made clear in <em>Walker, </em>318 Md. at 524, 569 A.2d [at 648], where the Court explained that the claims of beneficiaries in such actions are not severable. As the Court stated: \u2018A judgment should not have been entered in the circuit court unless it included the interests of all of the known beneficiaries.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><em>Work, </em>192 Md.App. at 460-61, 995 A.2d at 758 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Our opinion in <em>Ace </em>did not incorporate the above passage, but we did say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201cTo interpret the Rule as simply a notice rule disregards: (1) the representative nature of wrongful death actions; (2) the language of Rule 15-1001(b), requiring that \u2018all persons who are or may be entitled by law to damages by reason of the wrongful death shall be named as plaintiffs whether or not they join in the action[;]\u2019 and (3) the provisions of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(c) relating to the award of damages to the statutory \u2018beneficiaries\u2019 \u2018proportional to injury resulting from the wrongful death.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-8\"><em>Ace, </em>418 Md. at 424, 15 A.3d at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The above passages were written in cases in which the wrongful death claim was affirmatively asserted by particular beneficiaries themselves who had been omitted as use plaintiffs by the original plaintiffs. In addition, those omitted use plaintiffs asserted their claims within three years of the deceased\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Even if Ricky had been identified as a use plaintiff when this action was filed, but did not \u201cjoin\u201d as a plaintiff within three years of Elliott\u2019s death, his identification as a use plaintiff would not permit him to join more than three years after Elliott\u2019s death. Rule 15-1001(b) distinguishes between those beneficiaries who join in the action for damages and those, the use plaintiffs, who do not. Use plaintiffs who wish to assert their respective claims for damages must timely join the action by indicating to the court and to the original parties in some clear fashion that they are claiming their \u201cshare.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Ordinarily, this is done by intervening. That procedure was spelled out in the \u201cQ\u201d Rules in Rule Q43. The structure of the current Rules of Procedure does not repeat in the Special Proceedings Rules procedures that are covered by Title 2. <em>See </em>Rule 1-101 (b) (\u201cTitle 2 applies to civil matters in the circuit courts, except for Juvenile Causes ... and except as otherwise specifically provided or necessarily implied\u201d). Intervention in wrongful death cases is now covered by Rule 2-214.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">CJ \u00a7 3-904 and Rule 15-1001 cannot be construed to anoint counsel for the original <em>(ie. </em>joined) plaintiffs as the attorney for the use plaintiffs as well. By designating potential beneficiaries as use plaintiffs, counsel demonstrates that he or she does not represent them and has no authority to make decisions for them or to present evidence, including proof of damages, on their behalf. To hold otherwise invites grave problems of conflict of interest. <em>See </em>R.T. Michael, <em>The \u201cUSE\u201d Plaintiff in Maryland Wrongful Death Cases: Some Ethical Observations, </em>Fall 2008 Trial Reporter 9 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">On the record before us, there is no basis for inferring that Ricky was omitted as a use plaintiff for the purpose of hiding the litigation from him or in the hope that the Mutis would increase their recovery. Under the totality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>circumstances, we hold that the circuit court abused its discretion in dismissing the Plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful death claims as a sanction for the omission. Consequently, we shall remand this case to the circuit court. On remand, the court may consider in its discretion, what, if any, sanction for the omission is appropriate from the standpoint of reinforcing for the Bar as a whole the requirement for naming, as a use plaintiff, a potential beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED AS TO THE MOTION TO DISMISS ONLY.

The Mutis refer us to two decisions of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland as illustrations of relation back applied after the time had run for asserting a wrongful death claim. When the decedent in <em>Smith v. Potomac Edison Co., </em>165 F.Supp. 681 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>(D.Md.1958), was killed, a wrongful death action was to be asserted in the name of the State of Maryland, and the condition precedent was eighteen months from death. In a complaint that was timely filed, the widow and infant daughter of the deceased claimed damages for loss of care, support, and maintenance in the name of the widow. After eighteen months had run, the widow sought leave to amend in order to bring the action in the name of the State, and the defendant opposed. The equitable plaintiffs, the facts alleged, the nature of the alleged cause of action, and the measure of damages remained the same in the proposed amended complaint as in the original complaint. \"The only change is in the nominal plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685.

Under the court\u2019s analysis, the substance of the wrongful death claim had been timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"A6u\">The Mutis also refer us to an unreported opinion by Judge Bredar in <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>Civil No. JKB-10-2757 (Oct. 4, 2011). There, the widow and two children of the deceased timely filed. The deceased was also survived by his parents who were not named as use plaintiffs, because they deliberately did not wish to claim (quite possibly to maximize any recovery for their daughter-in-law and grandchildren from available assets of the defendant). Apparently concerned by <em>Williams v. Work, </em>192 Md.App. 438, 995 A.2d 744, the original plaintiffs sought to amend by adding the deceased\u2019s parents as use plaintiffs more than three years after the death. The defendants contended that naming all use plaintiffs was a condition precedent to maintaining the action, but the court held that Maryland Rule 15-1001(b) was procedural. That conclusion is consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AA6\">The court in <em>Daniel </em>then held that Fed.R.Civ.P. 19 mandated the joinder of all required parties \"even to the point of making them involuntary plaintiffs if they do not wish to join the action.\u201d Opinion at 365, 44 A.3d at 384. The federal court thought that parents were required parties because, under Maryland law, \"any judgment rendered in their absence would be invalid[.]\u201d Opinion at 364 n. 1, 44 A.3d at 383 n. 1. As explained above, we do not agree. The court in <em>Daniel </em>did not cite Judge Kaufman\u2019s opinion in <em>Knauer, </em>638 F.Supp. 1369, or <em>Deford, </em>30 Md. 179. What is more fundamental, if the rule were that a judgment could be invalidated at the instance of an omitted use plaintiff, although the three year condition precedent for asserting that claim had not been satisfied, any judgment or settlement would be subject, in perpetuity, to the theoretical risk of loss of finality. That result takes the one-action rule to an unreasonable extreme. A judgment or satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>faction should not be opened to permit assertion of a claim that no longer exists.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b405-11\">. We infer that the children were adults.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\">. It would also have been prudent for the Mutis\u2019 counsel to have filed an affidavit describing the efforts made to locate Ricky.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\">. Because a share is no more than the amount of damages under the pecuniary loss/benefit loss rule and/or the solatium rule that the trier of fact finds for a particular plaintiff, it is not an automatic award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
