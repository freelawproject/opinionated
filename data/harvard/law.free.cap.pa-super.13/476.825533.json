S. Kistler, executrix of Catharine Myers, deceased. (6) The learned auditor erred in his fourth conclusion of law as follows: \u201c 4. The accountant, should be surcharged with interest on the balance in hands for distribution to legatees from the date of confirmation of account, June 22, 1897, to date of distribution, August 31, 1899.\u201d (11) In entering the following decree: \u201c The auditor-saw and heard the various witnesses and had an opportunity to judge of the respective weight to be given to their testimony. He believed what was said by Mrs. R. S. Waidlich and Mrs. Nannie North, notwithstanding their truthfulness, was impeached by the. accountant, and we can see no reason why his findings based thereon should be disturbed. The auditor also properly dismissed, for causes clearly stated by him, the motion made on behalf of accountant to open the-audit and take the testimony of Rev. John Kistler and others. We find no error in any of his conclusions either of fact or of law and think they are fully sustained by the evidence in the= case. And now, December 20, 1899, the exceptions to the-auditor\u2019s report are dismissed, the report is confirmed and the^ accountant is directed to pay out the fund in his hands in accordance with the schedule of distribution prepared by the-auditor.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-9\"><em>R.

As a matter of grace, a review may be granted for new proof, discovered after the decree, which proof could not possibly have been, used at the time when the decree was made: Riddle\u2019s Est., 19 Pa. 431; Russell\u2019s App., 34 Pa. 258; Hartman\u2019s App., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>36 Pa. 70; Milligan\u2019s App., 82 Pa. 389; Scott\u2019s App., 112 Pa. 427.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3W\">April 23, 1900:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-5\"><em>W.

Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The assignments of error in this case are eleven in number. Most of them involve questions of fact, which have been decided by the auditor and approved by the court below. Our examination of the evidence discloses no error based upon the facts warranting a reversal or meriting a discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">One or two matters of law are involved in the judgment to be here entered. The facts which invoke the rulings are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The decedent died February 6,1897. Her will was admitted to probate February 15, 1897. The appellant is the executrix and a distributee to the extent of one half of the estate. As executrix she filed an account which was confirmed June 22, 1897, having been regularly advertised by the Register. No distribution was then made, because, as alleged, there was a possible outstanding liability on an oral agreement to pay the debt of a third party. On November 14, 1898, a petition was presented by some of the legatees under the decedent\u2019s will praying a citation to show cause why the confirmation of the account of the executrix should not be stricken off. After answer filed by the accountant, the court struck off the confirmation, and, on January 19, 1899, referred the account to an auditor. It will be seen that all the proceedings up to the first confirmation were within the year following the decedent\u2019s death; that no distribution was made upon the confirmation; and that the reason for deferring distribution was alleged to be a possible liability on the part of the decedent on an oral guaranty of the debt of another. On the facts thus exhibited, the order opening the confirmation and directing a rehearing was well within the power of the court below: Jones\u2019s App., 99 Pa. 124; Kinter\u2019s App., 62 Pa. 318; Meckel\u2019s App., 112 Pa. 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">The next proposition of law raised by the assignments of error is that the executrix was not liable for interest on the funds in her hands. The auditor finds that the accountant seems \u201c to have mingled the money of the estate with her own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>money and used money in bank for her own private purposes; \u201d and adds her explanation to his finding. In the conclusions of law the auditor finds that \u201c the accountant should be surcharged with interest on the balance in her hands for distribution to legatees from the date of confirmation of the account, June 22, 1897, to date of distribution, August 31, 1899.\u201d From these findings, after a reading of the testimony, we think that thej surcharge for interest was properly made. Liability of an executor for interest where there is neglect or mismanagement, is well settled; and the rule is always enforced where the executor has used the moneys of the estate for his own gain. There is no recognized precedent nor existing rule of law by which, In such case, liability for interest may be evaded: Norris\u2019s App., 71 Pa. 106, 128; Clauser\u2019s Est., 84 Pa. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">After the audit was concluded, the accountant requested a reopening in order to introduce the testimony of her husband. 'This was refused, and the refusal of the auditor seems to be based in part upon the ground that the husband was not a competent witness. Eliminating this consideration, the auditor had the right to refuse the motion. The husband had been offered as a witness at the former hearing and withdrawn upon objection made. The record does not show that the auditor was required to rule on the competency of the witness. Opportunity had been afforded for the presentation of the testimony. If the evidence was a part of the case in chief, the time for its presentation had gone by. If it was offered in rebuttal, its admissibility was determinable by the auditor, the exercise of whose discretion was only reviewable in case of abuse. A petition was also presented to the court below asking that the audit be reopened and that leave be given to introduce further testimony. This was refused by the court at the time of passing upon the exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report. It was, we believe, rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Finding no error committed, the decree of the court below is .affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
