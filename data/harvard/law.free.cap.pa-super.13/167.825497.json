Kean, Jr., and John F. Betz, Jr., as sureties on an administration bond to recover the amount of a certain claim due and unpaid by the said William Hay as administrator of the estate of Arthur Godson, deceased. The claim was for $109 with interest from December 14, 1896, allowed in the adjudication of Godson\u2019s estate by the orphans\u2019 court of Philadelphia county. At that adjudication a balance was finally awarded Charles Godson, father of the decedent, of $1,751.19, as his next of kin. This award having been defaulted by the administrator, Godson brought suit on the same, whereupon the appellants paid Godson the entire amount of their bond, viz: $1,200. This was the subject of the affidavit of defense in the present suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-6\">A rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense was taken, which, upon hearing, was 2nade absolute by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-7\">Judgment for plaintiff.

Porten, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">This suit is brought against the sureties upon the* bond of the administrator of the estate of Arthur Godson, deceased. The use plaintiff is a creditor of that estate. The adjudication of the orphans\u2019 court upon the account of the administrator shows that the use plaintiff\u2019s claim was awarded payment. There is nothing to indicate that it was paid. The balance remaining after the allowance of certain claims (including that of the plaintiff), was awarded to Charles Godson, as next of kin. The administrator failed to make distribution. Godson, the distributee of the balance, brought suit upon the administration bond. Without waiting for the levy of an execution, or even the rendition of a judgment, the defendants in this case paid the full amount of their bond to the said distributee. The defendants claim that the payment thus made is a discharge. With this we cannot agree. Had there been a payment under the stress of an execution, better ground would have been laid for claiming an exonerator: \u201c The reason is a very obvious one. An execution is the end of the law. To permit money so collected or paid to be reclaimed in a new suit would lead to indefinite and endless litigation : \u201d Insurance Co. v. Robinson, 82 Pa. 357. The payment.made by the defendants was voluntary as to other parties in interest protected by the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Furthermore, the bond requires that the residue of the estate found by the orphans\u2019 court shall be delivered and paid \u201c unto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>such person or persons, respectively, as said orphans\u2019 court by their decree and sentence pursuant to law, shall limit and appoint.\u201d The breach of this condition is averred by the statement of claim, and is not specifically denied by the affidavit. We see no error committed by the court below in entering judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
