Three viewers were appointed who recommended the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">The rules of the court of quarter sessions in Luzerne county, section 230, provide as follows: \u201c Five days\u2019 notice of the intended applications for the appointment of viewers to lay out public roads in townships shall be given to the county commissioners or the county solicitor and to the township supervisors, and in case of a private road to the owner of the land.\u201d August Stolpe averred that he had not received the notice as required by the rules of court, and upon advice of counsel took no part in the proceedings before the court, but after the report of the viewers was presented filed the following exception:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-7\">1. The rule of the court of quarter sessions of said county with reference to the appointment of viewers for the location of a private road was not complied with, said rule being found at page 73, section 230, of the rules of court: \u201c Five days\u2019 notice of intended applications for the appointment of viewers to lay out public roads in townships shall be given to the county commissioners or to the county solicitor and to the township supervisors, and in the case of a private road to the owner of the land.\u201d No such notice was given to August Stolpe, the owner of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-8\">The court below dismissed the exception in an opinion which, in part, is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\">The first exception is that rule of court No. 230, which provides that \u201c five days\u2019 notice of intended applications for the appointment of viewers .... in the case of a private road, shall be given to the owner of the land.\u201d The notice required by this rule it is admitted was not given. The report of the veiwers shows that one notice of the time and place of meeting of the viewers was served upon Stolpe five days before the meeting. Hence it cannot be contended that he had not actual notice of who the viewers were and of the time and place of meeting.- With this knowledge it would seem'to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the duty of Mr. Stolpe, in case he was hot satisfied with the character of the persons appointed, to have so stated to the court. He certainly had no right to lie by with this knowledge until the viewers had performed their duties, incurred considerable expense and been discharged before making known his objection. He sat by until he ascertained the verdict and now complains, not of injustice done him, but that a rule of court was not observed by the attorney for the petitioner. He must now be considered as having waived any objection he had to the viewers or want of notice to him in their appointment.

If in a county where there is an active rule of the kind alleged we come with a petition at a time when the court will grant another\u2019s like petition and the court appoints viewers knowing that we have wilfully disregarded the giving of the notice, and afterwards the benefit is asked in proper time and form, refused, and exceptions noted and the case goes on with no other error upon the record, it may be that the court would be sustained by a higher tribunal.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A1O\">Rice, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">The rule of the court below provides as follows: \u201c Five days\u2019 notice of the intended application for the appointment of viewers to lay out public roads in townships, shall be given to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>county commissioners or the county solicitor, and to the township supervisors, and in case of a private road, to the owner of the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Is it necessary that the record shall show affirmatively that notice was given as prescribed by the rule of court? We think not. The rule is a good one, but the fact that it has been complied with is not one of those jurisdictional matters \u2014 (like notice of the view and assessment of damages: Road in Plum Creek, 110 Pa. <em>544; </em>Private Road in Redstone, 112 Pa. 183)\u2014 the omission of which from the record is fatal on appeal. The doctrine omnia prsesumunter rite esse acta applies. See Road in Derry, 11 Pa. Superior Ct. 232, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">A certiorari issued on an appeal from an order in a road proceeding brings up for review only what was brought up by certiorari before the passage of the Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 158, namely, the record of which the evidence forms no part. This has been ruled repeatedly. In Kirk\u2019s Appeal, 28 Pa. 185, it was said: \u201c The objection is.that no notice was given of the meetings of the viewers. That objection was heard and disposed of in the court below. It is a question of fact which is not the subject of review here. No bill of exceptions exists in such a case.\u201d In a late case our brother W. D. Porter said: \u201cWe take it for granted that every objection made to a road report- and overruled by the quarter sessions, and which is, in its nature, capable of being proved, is untrue in point of fact, unless the contrary appears from the record. In such cases we have before us nothing but the record proper, of which neither the testimony, nor the recital of fact in the opinion filed in the court below is a part: Schuylkill Falls Road, 2 Binney 250; New Hanover Road, 18 Pa. 220; Duff\u2019s Private Road, 66 Pa. 459; Sadsbury Township Roads, 147 Pa. 471; Keller\u2019s Private Road, 154 Pa. 547; \u201d Roches\u2019s Private Road, 10 Pa. Superior Ct. 87. See also Manheim Road, 12 Pa. Superior Ct. 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">But aside from this, we are not convinced that the court committed error even if we may look into the opinion and review the decision upon the facts there stated. The question is not whether the court may ignore the rule, but whether noncompliance with it may be waived by the party and is waived by failure to object to the appointment of the viewers within a reasonable time after notice thereof. It is to be observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>notice of the time when the petition will be presented is not a statutory requirement. If it were, a different question would be raised. The appellant had due notice of the view and ample opportunity to raise the objection, if he had any, before the expense of the view was incurred. The objection should have been made promptly. Under the circumstances, it not appearing that he suffered any substantial injury by reason of the omission to' comply with the rule of court, the appellant\u2019s conduct may fairly be regarded as a waiver. The reason for this conclusion, as stated in the opinion of the learned judge of the court below, is sound, and is of frequent application in all kinds of proceedings. As was said in a case where the objection was to the qualifications of one of the viewers: \u201c A man cannot reserve such an objection while he awaits the chances of a favorable report, and use it after he finds the report against him: \u201d Hill Townroad, 18 Pa. 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">We find no error in this record which would justify reversal. Therefore the order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
