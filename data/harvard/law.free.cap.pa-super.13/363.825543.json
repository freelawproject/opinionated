There is some controversy on that. The plaintiff claims that when this money was received it was received not in full settlement, as the check itself in language purports the settlement to have been, but that it was only a partial payment received by the claimant on account of the urgency of certain creditors of the estate for money, or certain claims against the estate for payment. The defendant asserts, .alleges and insists that the true settlement is set out in the correspondence, and that from the terms of the correspondence itself there was no variance made at the time that the check was turned over, which was on November 8, 1895, as nearly as the \u25a0evidence fixes it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-11\">If Mr. Roth\u2019s testimony is true in point of fact, if his side of this controversy is established, to wit: that the correspondence itself sets forth the true state of facts, and that a settlement was made, for the word \u201csettlement\u201d is used in the correspondence, upon the basis stated in the letters, then the plaintiff here would he held to the conditions of that arrangement, which the correspondence states are that this case shall be reopened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>upon production of the family records, or other satisfactory proofs of a mistake on the part of the company in stating the ages at forty-nine and fifty; in other words, the company agreed,' if the correspondence be the only settlement that was made, that if it should be proven to their satisfaction that there was a mistake made, they would be willing to correct the error, and, if there was a difference coming over to the estate of Mrs., Smith, to pay it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-5\">But the plaintiff claims that the settlement was not made as. stated in that correspondence; that at the time they came together finally and received the check and handed over the receipt, that then the money was only received and the receipt given upon the distinct understanding that they would sue for the balance. Mr. Wadlinger swears that at the time he stated that as to the balance, it would have to be left for future settlement, and that he saw no other way than to bring a suit for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-6\">[Now, you have both sides of the controversy, the one contending that there was an absolute and unqualified agreement of settlement as set down in the letters, the other side asserting that it was no final settlement at all, that the money received was a partial payment. If it was received as a partial payment, then the claimant had no other way, if this company would not pay the difference than to bring the case where it now is, let a jury determine the fact.] [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-7\">Defendant\u2019s points and the answers thereto among others were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-8\">[10. The evidence in the cause thus showing that the age of Mary Smith was thus understated at the time of the issuing of both of the policies in suit, anywhere from two years to nine years, the sum insured will, under the fifth condition embodied in both of said policies, \u201c be reduced to the amount the premium would pay for at the true age.\u201d Or under the act of June 23, 1885, \u201c to such sum as the premium paid would have purchased at the applicant\u2019s real age at the time of effecting the insurance.\u201d <em>Answer: </em>Refused without reading.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-9\">[12. The company defendant having offered to the administrator to pay him the said sum of 1856.63, thus adjusted and ascertained, in compromise settlement and payment in full of his claims against the company, the said administrator did accept the amount so offered, and did, on November 8, 1895, sign and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\u2022execute and deliver unto said company his receipt of that date for said amount, \u201c in full for all claims against said company, under policies No. 3,136,167-8,688,427, issued upon the life of Mary Smith, adjusted at ages 49 and 50 years respectively.\u201d <em>Answer: </em>Refused without reading.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-5\">[14. The said plaintiff having thus accepted and collected the company\u2019s check for the amount named, and having executed and delivered his receipt unto the company therefor, as aforesaid, is bow estopped from recovering any further sum or sums of money from said company defendant, under said policies of insurance, or either of them. <em>Answer: </em>Refused without reading.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\">[18.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">This was an action of assumpsit upon two policies of insurance issued upon the life of Mary Smith who died on September 19, 1895. In the first policy, dated November 4, 1889, her age was stated as being forty-five years; in the second, dated June 16, 1890, it was stated as being forty-six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">One of the agreements indorsed on the policies and made part of the same reads: \u201c In case the age of the insured shall have been understated by mistake, the sum insured will be reduced to the amount the premium would pay for at the true age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">It was stated in one of the certificates of identity that \u201cshe appeared to. be fifty-three years of age,\u201d in another fifty-five years, in the undertaker\u2019s certificate that her \u201c apparent age \u201d was sixty years, and in the attending physician\u2019s certificate it was stated that her \u201ccorrect age at death\u201d was fifty-six years. This last certificate was witnessed by a son of the deceased, and had this instruction plainly printed on it: \u201c Be careful to give correct age at death.\u201d All these certificates were submitted to the company by the administrator as parts of the proofs of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">On October 15, 1895, the superintendent of the company wrote to the administrator as follows: \u201c I beg to inform you that check drawn to your order 'in settlement of the claim under policies No. 3,136,167, etc., on the life of Mary Smith, deceased, is at this office awaiting your calling for the same, and I will thank you to arrange and call for the same. The company has adjusted the claim at ages forty-nine and fifty, but will be willing to reopen the case at any time upon receipt of the family record or other satisfactory proof that their adjustment is incorrect. Awai ting your calling, \u201d etc. On November 2 the attorney of the administrator wrote to the superintendent, and after referring to the above letter said: \u201c Under this adjustment I understand $856.63 will be paid. I have concluded to advise my client to accept this offer, and will settle the claim for the present on that basis, if your company is still willing to carry out their proposition. I would suggest, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>inasmuch as you requested us to surrender the original policies or certificates, that you furnish us with copies thereof for any future use for which they may be required.\u201d On November 8 the superintendent wrote in reply to this letter as follows: \u201c Replying to your favor of the 2d inst. T would inform you that check in the amount of $856.63, drawn in favor of the administrator of the Mary Smith estate, C. Benseman, administrator, is at this office awaiting his demand for the same upon giving the usual receipt therefor and surrendering of the policies and premium receipt books. As to furnishing of copies of the policies, would say that we deem the length of time in which these policies have been in your hands to be sufficient to fully acquaint yourself with the contents thereof, and do not consider copies necessary. Furthermore, the administrator holds our letter in which we \u2018 will be willing to reopen the case at any time upon receipt of family records or other satisfactory records that the adjustment is incorrect.\u2019 \u201d On the same day the parties met, and after some parleying the company\u2019s check for $856.63, \u201cin full for all claims under \u201d the policies was given the administrator, and he gave the following receipt: \u201c Received of the Prudential Insurance Company of America eight hundred fifty-six and sixty-three one hundredth dollars, which payment is in full for all claims against said company, under policyNo. 3,136,167 \u2014 3,688,427, issued upon the life of Mary Smith, adjusted at ages forty-nine and fifty years respectively.\u201d The check was duly paid, and was for the amount of insurance the premiums would pay for if the correct age of the insured was as stated in the proofs of death. This action was brought to recover the difference between that amount and the amount expressed on the face of the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">There was an unfortunate conflict of testimony as to what was said when this check and receipt were exchanged. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney testified: \u201cI said to Mr. Roth that Mr. Benseman would only accept a partial payment because of the pressing claims against the estate; Mr. Roth replied to that, \u2018 You can\u2019t have this money unless I get a receipt,\u2019 and I, about as short and snappy as him, said that \u2018 whenever you produce your receipt I will determine whether Mr. Benseman will sign it or not; \u2019 Mr. Roth went into an adjoining room and in a few minutes came back with the receipt which appears here and now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>bears the signature of Benseman, excepting that the receipt ended at the word Mary Smith; he handed the receipt to Benseman and Benseman turned it over to me, and I said, \u2018 Mr. Benseman, I instruct you not to execute that receipt,\u2019 and Mr. Both said, \u2018Well, then you can\u2019t have this check.\u2019 We had some further parley about the matter and I said, \u2018 There is only one way this can be settled, Mr. Both, and that is to accept this money as a partial payment and leave the balance of tins claim open for future adjustment, but in my opinion the only way it can ever be adjusted is by a law suit; \u2019 I said, \u2018 If you will put after the name Mary Smith something to show that this has been adjusted at your claim at the ages of forty-nine and fifty, we will take this partial payment; \u2019 Mr. Roth went in the other room and came back with the receipt containing these words, meaning the words,' \u2018 adjusted at ages forty-nine and fifty years respectively.\u2019 \u201d On the other hand, the defendant\u2019s representative, whilst admitting that these words were added at the plaintiff\u2019s request, denied that anything was said about bringing suit for the balance, and asserted, that, when the plaintiff\u2019s attorney spoke about settling the matter on account, \u201c I told him emphatically that it would not be settled in any other way excepting in accordance with my letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">A receipt in full is not conclusive, but is open to explanation (Sargeant v. Ins. Co., 189 Pa. 341, and cases cited); yet if there be no explanatory evidence it has a defined legal meaning. \u201c While a receipt of this kind is not conclusive, yet it is always prima facie evidence of a settlement, and should only be set aside for weighty reasons, especially after a lapse of years, and the reasons should be fully and clearly stated. Fraud, accident or mistake would be sufficient to avoid such an instrument, but in such case the cause of avoidance should clearly appear:\u201d Harris v. Hays, 111 Pa. 562; Hamsher v. Kline, 57 Pa. 397. Speaking of the case of Harris v. Hays, Mr. Justice Green said: \u201cWe thus have a clear and well defined expression as to the legal effect of such an instrument, and it is authoritatively ruled that it cannot be set aside except for weighty reasons, such as fraud, accident or mistake, and such causes for disregarding them must be made to appear distinctly. Such receipts then are placed in the same category as other written instruments which are made the. depositories of the solemn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>agreements of contracting parties. The rules as to setting aside or disregarding such contracts are too familiar to need recital here: \u201d Rhoads\u2019s Estate, 189 Pa. 460. Where a receipt in full was set up as a defense in an action for professional services, and the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that when the receipt was given it was agreed that it should not have the effect of a receipt in full, but that he should receive additional compensation, was directly contradicted by the defendant\u2019s agent, it was held, that, as the evidence was evenly balanced, the receipt was conclusive against the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover: Crawford v. Forest Oil Co., 189 Pa. 415. In the recent case of MacDonald v. Piper, 193 Pa. 312, the trial judge instructed the jury to the same effect, and this was held not to be error.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We are of opinion that these principles of the law of evidence are applicable in the present. case. There was no relation of trust or confidence between the parties. There was a controversy between them. They were dealing at arm\u2019s length. There was no concealment of facts, no fraud and no mistake either of fact or of law. At least, none was proved. On the contrary, the claim was adjusted on as favorable a basis as the plaintiff had a right to insist on if, as stated in the sworn certificate of the attending physician, the \u201c correct age at death \u201d of the insured was fifty-six years. Was there not a prima facie presumption that the adjustment was correct? It is urged that in an action on a life insurance policy the plaintiff is not bound by admissions contained in the proofs of death, and may offer evidence to contradict or vary them: Fisher v. Life Association, 188 Pa. 1. Let this be granted, yet this positive affidavit having been furnished by the plaintiff to the defendant as part of the death proofs it was, to say the least of it, some evidence of the age of the insured: Conn. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Schwenk, 94 U. S. <em>593; </em>24 L. ed. 294. In the absence of any evidence whatsoever to explain it or to show that it was not strictly true, it may well be questioned whether a jury ought to have been permitted to guess that it was not true, even if there had been no settlement. In other words, was not the burden of proof shifted ? We think it was. At all events it is clear that there was not sufficient evidence to warrant them in finding, not only that it was not true, but also that the receipt was not what it purported to be, a settlement in full of all claims under these policies. It fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>lows that the defendant\u2019s eighteenth point, (eighth assignment) should have been affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The eighth assignment of error is sustained, the judgment is reversed, and judgment is now entered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
