Under the will of Patrick Moran, the legacy given to his son, Patrick Moran, Jr., was not a charge upon the real estate devised to his son William Moran.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">2.

The affidavit of service of copy of original petition and rule to show cause upon William Moran, does not show that notice to appear and answer was served, although the same was attached to the copy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-9\">5. The record shows that the description of the land was amended and does not show notice of such amendment to have been served upon William Moran.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-10\">6. The record does not show a demand made upon William Moran to pay this legacy to any one entitled to receive it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-11\">7. While the original rule to show cause was served upon William Moran, the order of sale was made without said rule having been made absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-12\">OPINION.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-13\">It is clear that the condition of the devise of the real estate to William Moran is not only the payment by William of the debts and funeral charges, but also of the legacies to Walter, Patrick and Catherine. In Downer v. Downer, 9 W. 60, a devise to tes'tator\u2019s son <em>\u201c </em>provided he pay over to my executors for the benefit of the legatees hereafter mentioned,\u201d was held a charge upon the land devised. In Holliday v. Summerville, 3 P. &amp; W. 533, a devise of land to a son \u201cprovidedhe pays to my other three children, John, Ruth and May 300 pounds,\u201d etc. Legacies held a charge on land. The same principle was held in Henry Springer\u2019s Appeal, 111 Pa. 228, and in Pryer v. Mark, 129 Pa. 529, it was held that the legacies were a charge upon the land and the personalty exempted from payment of same, when the land was devised, provided the devise shall \u201cpay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>within, five years after the death of my wife, $200 each to my sons David and Stephen,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">Under these decisions it must be held that this legacy to Patrick Moran is a charge upon the land devised to William. It is undisputed that the personalty amounted to about $100, all of which was expended in funeral expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">The legacy to Patrick Moran is payable twelve years after the decease of testator. 2 Williams on Executors, 1087, lays down the rule <em>\u201c </em>that a bequest to a person payable or to be paid, at the end of any certain determined term confers on him a vested interest immediately on the testator\u2019s death.\u201d Also on page 1108, \u201c that though there be no other gift than in the direction to pay or distribute in future, yet if such payment or distribution appear to be postponed for the convenience of a fund or property, the vesting will not be deferred till the period in question,\u201d and in note on same page, \u201c when the postponement is for the benefit of the estate and not the donee, gift is considered to be a vested one.\u201d On page 1117 under the heading of \u201c the lapse of legacies payable out of the real estate,\u201d it is stated, that as to legacies payable out of real estate only, the rule as adopted with respect to legacies payable out of personal estate, viz: \u201c that when the gift and the time of payment are distinct, the legacy vests immediately, does not hold generally.\u201d In note to page 1119 the rule as to legacies charged upon real estate is stated as follows : \u201c When the legacy is a charge on the land, it may be added that the true rule with respect to the vesting of legacies payable out of real estate is this: where the gift is immediate but the payment is postponed until the legatee for instance attains the age of twenty-one years or marries, then it is contingent and will fail if the legatee dies before the time of payment arrives; but where the payment is postponed in regard to the convenience of the person and circumstances of the estate charged with the legacy, and not on account of the age, condition or circumstances of the legatee, in such a case it will be vested and must be paid, although the legatee should die before the times of payment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-7\">This rule appears to be the law in Pennsylvania as laid down by the Supreme Court. In Donner\u2019s Appeal, 12 W. &amp; S. 372, the testator devised land charged with the payment of a sum of money in yearly payments payable to certain parties as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>arrived at certain ages. It was held that the legacies vested, Huston, J., stating the rule to be, \u201c if the time of payment is postponed, not on account of the minority of the legatees, but for the benefit of the estate or of the devisee of the land, the legacy does not sink or merge in the land.\u201d In that case one of the legatees died prior to the date of payment of legacy, and the contest was between the administrator of the legatee and the devise of the land. In McClure\u2019s Appeal, 72 Pa. 414, Justice Williams said: \u201cAsa general rule, a legacy is deemed to be vested or contingent just as the time shall appear to be annexed to the gift, or the payment of it. If futurity is annexed to the substance of the gift, vesting is suspended, but if it appears to relate to the time of payment only, the legacy vests instantly. The point which determines the vesting is, not whether time is annexed to the gift, but whether it is annexed to the substance of the gift as a condition precedent; where there is an antecedent absolute gift independent of the direction and time of payment, the legacy is vested, but where there is no substantive gift and it is only implied from the direction to pay, the legacy is contingent, unless from particular circumstances on the whole face of the will a contrary intention is to be collected.\u201d In Reed\u2019s Appeal, 118 Pa. 215, Justice Paxson quotes approvingly Leeming v. Sherratt, 2 Hare, 14, as follows: \u201c The gift of a legacy under the form of a direction to pay at a future time or upon a future event is not less favorable to vesting than a simple and direct bequest of a legacy at a like future time or upon a like event. The question is one of substance and not of form, and in all cases it is whether the testator intended it as a condition precedent that the legatees should survive the time appointed by him for the payment of their legacies, and the answer to this question must be sought for out of the whole will, and not in the particular expression in which the gift is made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-5\">In the case at bar all the estate, real and personal, in different paragraphs, was given to testator\u2019s son, William Moran, upon condition that he pay debts, funeral expenses, and to certain children and grandchildren certain specified amounts, the language of the will being: \u201cAnd pay unto my son Walter Moran his heirs and assigns the sum of seven hundred dollars, without interest, the same to be paid six years after my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>decease. And also to pay unto my son Patrick Moran the sum of one thousand dollars, without interest, and the same' be paid twelve years after' my decease. And further to pay my granddaughter Catharine Moran, the sum of twenty-five dollars, and pay the same four years after my decease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\">The postponement of the payment of these legacies to the dates respectively fixed is evidently for the benefit of the devisee of the entire estate, William Moran. The one to Patrick Moran is, as all are, without interest and payable so far in the future, viz: twelve years after testator\u2019s death, that the actual value of the same at the time of testator\u2019s decease was but little, more than one half its face. There is nothing upon the face of the will in the language used, or in the description of the legatee or the circumstances of the legatee that denotes any purpose in the mind of the testator to make the payment of the legacy contingent upon the legatee living until after the time of payment. Taking the will as a whole, the giving of the entire estate to one son upon condition that he pay to the other natural objects of testator\u2019s bounty different sums at different times without interest is an evidence that the testator was making such a division of his property among his children as he thought equitable, and fixing the times of payment of these legacies without interest, so that the devisee could pay them without selling the real estate devised to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">Taking the will in its entirety we are of opinion that the legacies vested at the death of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-7\">In case where a legacy is charged upon real estate, the act of assembly provides that \u201c it shall be lawful for the legatee to, apply by bill or petition to the orphans\u2019 court having jurisdiction of the accounts of the executors of will by which such legacy was bequeathed; whereupon such court having caused due notice to be given to such executors and to the devisee or heirs as the case may be, of the real estate charged with such legacy, and to such other persons interested in the estate as justice may require, may proceed according to equity, to make such decree or order touching the payment of the legacy out of such real estate as may be requisite and just.\u201d When the legatee is dead and the legacy vested in his lifetime, the administrator or executor of such legatee stands in his stead and has all the rights of action, to enforce payment of the legacy, the legatee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>would have if living. The case cited by the counsel for William Moran was where the execiitor of the testator applied for rule on devisee to pay legacies; it was held that he had no authority to petition under the act; that the legatee was the ouly person who was entitled to petition although service should be made upon executor of testator. The petition of the administrator of a legatee is in substance a petition by legatee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">The proceedings in this case were by petition of administrator of legatee. There was service of copy of petition and rule upon the executor who was also devisee of land \u25a0 charged with legacy. Upon proof of such service there was an order made appointing a trustee to sell the real estate without any evidence taken upon the rule or any decree fixing the amount of legacy unpaid or order making rule absolute. There is a rule of court of common pleas which provides in rules to show cause which are founded upon affidavit and a copy of petition and rule are served upon respondent with notice to make answer within fifteen days, that such facts contained in the petition as are not denied by answer upon oath shall be taken as admitted upon the hearing of the rule. The decree was granted under the impression that this rule was in force in the orphans\u2019 court, but upon an examination of the rules of court there does not appear to be any memoranda or order extending this rule to the orphans\u2019 court. The respondent had a right to rely upon the absence of such a rule in the orphans\u2019 court under the circumstances, and to omit to make any answer to the petition until after the petitioner should have established the truth of the allegation contained in the petition by evidence, of the' taking of which respondent was entitled to notice. The records should show the establishment of all facts which would authorize an order of sale as a condition precedent to such order. It has also been held that the proper practice is for the decree of the court to embody the facts as established by the evidence. The amounts unpaid of legacy and the refusal of the devisee to pay the same should also be incorporated in it, and the order of sale should be by writ of levari facias.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">The petition of the administrator of the estate of Patrick Moran, deceased, is in proper form, and made in conformity with the provisions of the act of assembly. The decree of sale and sale of real estate being irregular and not founded upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>finding of fact in accordance with equity, are hereby set aside. The petitioner can proceed under the rules to establish such facts as are necessary to entitle him to a decree which would authorize a sale of the land charged with the payment of the legacy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-5\">The court subsequently entered the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\">And now, August 26, 1899, that matter came on to be heard on depositions, and thereupon, upon consideration, it is found that Patrick Moran, late of Apolacon, Susquehanna county, died March 18, 1885, testate, devising to his son and executor, William Moran, the land described in the proceedings, [and in this decree, charged with the payment of a legacy of $1,000 to Patrick Moran, of Denver, Colorado,] [4] the said legacy to be paid March 18, 1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-7\">That said Patrick Moran, of Denver, died January 16,1891, and that said legacy has not been paid.

Moran, and described herein.] [2] [And it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed, that if the same is not paid to Miller S.

On September 9, 1899, the court granted a rule to show cause why this decree should not be set aside. A bill of exceptions was also taken to said decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\">The court declined to specifically answer the following requests of law presented by said William Moran:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\">1. The orphans\u2019 court has no jurisdiction to decree the payment of a legacy out of the land belonging to the estate of Patrick Moran, late of Apolacon, deceased, nor to decree the sale of the real estate of the late Patrick Moran, deceased, on the petition of an administrator of a deceased legatee.

J., discharged the rule in the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-15\">Patrick Moran, of Apolacon township, died March 18, 1885, testate. By his will he devised to his son, William Moran, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>farm in Apolacon, upon condition that he pay, inter alia, to his son, Patrick Moran, the sum of $1,000, without interest, and the same to be paid twelve years after his decease. His son, \u25a0Patrick Moran, resided at Denver, Colorado, and died there January 16, 1891. On September 16, 1897,. Miller S.

There was nothing in the depositions which contradicted the facts set forth in the adjudication and decree of August 26, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-9\">The only questions raised upon the argument were the questions: (1) Whether this legacy given to Patrick Moran, Jr., was a charge upon the land devised to William C.

Pouter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">Little can profitably be added to what has been said in the opinion of the court below. The provision for Patrick Moran is not in the form of a substantive gift, but only of a direction to pay twelve years after the decedent\u2019s death. He died six years after the decedent. It is claimed that the legacy is contingent on, the survival of the legatee until the time fixed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>payment and that by his death the provision fell. In Reed\u2019s Appeal, 118 Pa. 215, it is said: \u201c The gift of a legacy under the form of a direction to pay at a future time, or upon a future event, is not less favorable to vesting than a simple and direct bequest of a legacy at a like future time or upon a like event. The question is one of substance and not of form, and in all cases it is whether the testator intended it as a condition precedent that the legatees should survive the time appointed by him for the payment of their legacies ; and the answer to this question must be sought for out of the whole will, and not in the particular expressions in which the gift is made.\u201d See also Allen\u2019s Estate, 192 Pa. 170; McClure\u2019s Appeal, 72 Pa. 414. In the present case a scrutiny of the whole will results in a conviction that the purpose of postponing the payment directed to be made to Patrick Moran, was for the ease and advantage of the devisee of the land. There is nothing in the language used, or in the description, condition or circumstances of the legatee, indicating a purpose in the mind of the testator to make the payment of the legacy contingent upon the survival of the legatee until the time fixed for the payment. The periodicity of the payments directed to be made by the devisee to the legatees strengthens the view that the time for the payment of the legacy is fixed for the benefit of the devisee and the relief of the estate. We are of opinion that the interest of Patrick Moran was vested. See Engles\u2019s Estate, 167 Pa. 463, and Donner\u2019s Appeal, 2 W. &amp; S. 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">It is furthermore clear that the legacy was a charge upon the land. To make a legacy a charge it is necessary that it should be so declared by express words, or be inferable from-the whole will that such was the intention of the testator: Shark\u2019s Estate, 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 372; Brandt\u2019s Appeal, 8 Watts, 198. If it appears from the language of the will that the testator intended to couple the payment of the legacy by the devisee with the devise of the land, so that the payment is to be made because, or as a condition on which, the devise has- been made, then the real estate devised is, in equity, chargeable with the payment of the legacy. In such a case the payment of the legacy is a condition on which an unincumbered title vests in the devisee. This statement of the law has been approved in Wise\u2019s Estate, 188 Pa. 258. See also Holliday v. Summerville, 3 P. &amp; W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>533; Springer\u2019s Appeal, 111 Pa. 228 ; Pryer v. Mark, 129 Pa. 529. The provision of the will in this ease is, in condensed form : I devise nnto my son, William Moran, and his heirs my farm \u201c on condition .... he pay unto my son, Patrick Moran, the sum of one thousand dollars, without interest, and the same be paid. twelve years after my decease.\u201d The acceptance by the devisee of the farm so devised, was subject to the conditions imposed, and the land was made the fund for the payment of the legacy: Holliday v. Summerville, supra; Downer v. Downer, 9 Watts, 60. It is argued that the petitioner here has no standing because he is not the legatee, but only the administrator of the legatee\u2019s estate. The act of February 24, 1834, provides that it shall be lawful for the legatee to pursue its provisions to enforce the payment of a legacy charged on land. The legacy having vested, the right, after the death of the legatee, to enforce its payment inures to his legal representatives. This view of the intent of the act is not in conflict with Hartzell\u2019s Estate, 178 Pa. 286, and Luckenbach\u2019s Estate, 170 Pa. 586, where it was held that the executor of the will creating the charge had no standing to proceed in behalf of the legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
