J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-5\">It appears from the record that a loan of $500 to the plaintiff was secured by the judgment note of J. Carlton Duke which was duly entered of record on August 21, 1890. On March 28, 1894, J. Carlton Duke conveyed premises subject to the lien of this judgment to his father, Henry J. Duke. This deed was not recorded until two years afterwards, to wit: March 24, 1896. On September 1, 1895, J. Carlton Duke confessed an amicable revival of the above-mentioned judgment. On April 10,1897, H. J. Duke conveyed the premises to <em>W. </em>F. Duke. On November 10, 1898, a writ of scire facias was entered to No. 160, November term, 1898, to revive and continue the lien of the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-6\">At the trial of the case an offer was made to show by certain letters and by other testimony that when J. Carlton Duke made the conveyance of the property to his father no consideration had been paid and that H. J. Duke, the grantee, assumed to pay the liens as purchase money. This offer was rejected by the court. The court directed a verdict in favor of defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-7\">Verdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-8\"><em>Errors assigned </em>among others were (2) in rejecting the following offer on the part of the plaintiff: Plaintiff offers depositions to show that there was no visible or open change of possession in the property described between the date of March 21, 1894, and the date of the conveyance from J. Carlton Duke to his father Henry J. Duke, on September 8,1895, the date of the amicable revival of the judgment against J. Carlton Duke, for the purpose of, showing that the plaintiff in the judgment had no notice of change of possession if such notice is necessary. (4) In rejecting plaintiff\u2019s offer to show by letters to be hereafter produced and identified of J. Carlton Duke and Henry J. Duke to A. G. Miller, counsel for the present holder of the judgment to show that when this property was conveyed by J. Carlton Duke to Henry J. Duke on March 24, 1894, the understanding and agreement between the parties to the conveyance was that it was conveyed subject to the lien of this judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>to be followed by proof that Henry J. Duke paid no consideration for the property except contracting to pay the lien against the same.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AJF\">April 23, 1900.:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-4\"><em>A.

Hitchcock, 98 Pa. 625; Buck\u2019s Appeal, 100 Pa. 109; Wetmore v. Wetmore, 155 Pa. 507; Lyon v. Cleveland, 170 Pa. 611; Suter v. Findley, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 168; Uhler v. Moses, 10 Pa.

His lien continues, and it is not a fraud to compel him to keep his judgment revived: Haak\u2019s Appeal, 100 Pa. 59; Armington v. Rau, 100 Pa. 165; Fidler v. John, 178 Pa. 112.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b311-9\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">On August 21, 1890, the plaintiff obtained judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>J. Carlton Duke. On September 3, 1895, an amicable revival of the judgment signed, by J. Carlton Duke alone was entered of record, and on November 10, 1898, a scire facias issued upon tbe last named judgment. On the trial of the issue between the plaintiff and H. J. Duke and W. F. Duke, named as terre-tenants, it appeared that J. Carlton Duke conveyed the premises bound by the lien of the original judgment to H. J. Duke on March 28, 1894, and that the latter conveyed the same to W. F. Duke on April 10, 1897. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, on the date of the amicable revival, the lien of the judgment had expired, and no action of the parties to it could restore it to life as against the land that had been aliened in the mean time, whether the deed to the alienee was on record or not. This seems too plain to require discussion. The letters offered in evidence fail to show a personal undertaking by H. J. Duke to pay the judgment, and even if they did it could not be enforced in this form of proceeding even as against him, much less against W. F. Duke to whom the land had been aliened before the scire facias issued. The court correctly rejected the offers and gave the jury binding instructions to find for the defendante in the issue they were sworn to try.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
