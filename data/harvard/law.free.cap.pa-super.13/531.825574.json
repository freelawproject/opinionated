Cornelius, deceased, being the amount of the proceeds of sale of decedent\u2019s real estate. The commissioners of Sewicldey Water Works presented their claim for $396.12 for water tax for the tax year from April 1, 1898, to March 31, 1899 for water supplied to the premises, asserting it to be a tax and a lien upon the real estate from the sale of which the fund had been obtained, and therefore a preferred claim, payable in full. Objection was made to the claim on the ground that water rent, assessed under the special act of assembly approved February 21, 1873, P. L. 147, is not a lien on real estate. The auditing judge allowed the objection to the allowance of said water tax as pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ferred claim and exceptions to the decree were dismissed by the court in banc. Sewickley Water Works appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) in overruling and dismissing the exceptions filed by the commissioners of Sewickley Water Works.

Woods, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFG\">\u2014The Act of February 23, 1824, P. L. 18, made taxes first liens in the city and county of Philadelphia. The provisions of this act of 1824 were extended to Allegheny county by the Act of April 5, 1844, P. L. 199.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-7\">Appellant is a public municipal corporation. The wording of the act of 1873 makes this plain, and in the case of the Commissioners of the Sewickley Water Works v. Sewickley Borough, 159 Pa. 194, it was decided by the Supreme Court that the commissioners were but the mere agents of the borough of Sewickley for constructing and operating the waterworks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-8\">The act of 1873 has never been before the court in this connection. No case involving an exactly similar question has been found. There are cases somewhat analogous. In Emaus v. Emaus School District, 2 Pa. Dist. Rep. 322, it was decided that under the special Act of February 18, 1871, P. L. 85, establishing waterworks in the borough of Emaus, water rents are taxes. The provisions in said act as to water rents are as follows : \u201c They may adopt a schedule of rates by which water rents shall be assessed to the owner or owners of the premises and collect these rents as borough taxes are collected.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-9\">And in the case of Davis v. Doylestown Borough, 3 Pa. C. C. R. 573, it was held that under the special act of March 13, 1867, P. L. 414, authorizing the town council of Doylestown to construct waterworks, water rents are taxes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-10\">In the case of Pittsburg v. Brace Bros., 158 Pa. 174, the Supreme Court held that the city of Pittsburg had a lien for water rent outside of its corporate limits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-11\">Under the recent Act of May 22, 1895, P. L. 111, appellant was entitled to the payment in full of its claim out of the fund distributed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-12\">Here we have an orphans\u2019 court sale of real estate.

It was clearly no lien.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b563-9\">Pee Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">The 6th section of the Act of February 21, 1873, P. L. 147, authorizes the Commissioners of Sewickley Water Works to fix and change a schedule of water rents, and collect the same from the owners or occupants of the premises where the water is used, \u201c and for this purpose they may appoint a collector, and issue their warrant to him to collect the same by levy and sale, in like manner as other taxes, of any property on the premises or elsewhere, belonging to the owner or occupant.\u201d This law does not make water rents a lien upon real estate, and if there is any other act making them a lien it has not been called to our attention. Certainly the act of April 5, 1844, extending the provisions of the Act of February 23, 1824, P. L. 18, to Allegheny county does not give them a lien, for it expressly provides that they \u201c shall not be considered as coming within the provisions of the act.\u201d Nor does the Act of May 22, 1895, P. L. 111, apply, for that relates only to taxes against land. The section of the act of 1873, above quoted, does not give all the remedies for the collection of water rents that are given for the collection of taxes, but only the specific remedy expressly mentioned. It differs materially from the acts construed in the cases cited in the appellants\u2019 brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">The decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
