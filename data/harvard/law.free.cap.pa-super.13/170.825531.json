It was shown that on several occasions decedent had expressed a. desire that when she was gone Mary Cahill should receive all her belongings, which consisted of a deposit in a savings bank. It was also shown that Mrs. Cahill had charge of the deposit book, and had drawn at her mother\u2019s instance, certain moneys which were essential for the expenses incurred by her illness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-4\">At the adjudication before Febg-uson, J., Mary Cahill claimed |4.00 a week for sixty-eight weeks for board and nursing her mother. She also claimed the balance of the estate, 1158.08, as a gift.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">One witness testified to a conversation with the decedent, inter alia, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">\u201c Q. Do you remember just exactly what her mother (the decedent) said? A. She often came and saw me, and she all the time says, \u2018Her only help is Mary.\u2019 No one would look after her. Q. Did she promise to pay Mary for taking care of her ? A. The last time I saw her, about a week before her death, I was there every night, and she says, \u2018 she sent Mary for getting the money in bank; \u2019 she said, \u2018 I want Mary shall take all out, and Mary would not do it, for Henry and Anna promised me they never will make Mary trouble.\u2019 That is what Mrs. Dettenmaier said the last time I saw her, \u2018 Henry and Anna promised me, they never will make Mary trouble.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-7\">A brother-in-law of decedent testified also:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-8\">\u201c I have known my sister-in-law for forty-eight years. When I came to visit her she told me o'ften, she says, \u2018 My daughter Mary Cahill, she treats me so nice.\u2019 She told me \u2018 she never gave me a bad look in her life,\u2019 and she told me \u2018 I couldn\u2019t never reward her for the good service she has done for me, many a night setting up all night when I would be very low.\u2019 She told me that \u2018 my other two children \u2014 sometimes they don\u2019t come for two or three weeks to see me.\u2019 Q. Did she say that she had promised to pay her anything for taking care of her ? A. She didn\u2019t tell me that. She said she couldn\u2019t reward her for what she done for her, and she could never reward her too much for what she had done for her. Q. Was Mrs. Cahill ever present when she said that ? A. No, nobody there but myself.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Another witness, one Katherine Miller, testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">\u201c Q. Did you ever hear her (the decedent) say anything about recompensing her daughter, Mary Cahill, for her care of her during.her illness ? A. She said to me at the time, \u2018 she should be paid for what she does for me.\u2019 Q. How often was that said to you? A. A couple of times. Q. Was Mrs. Cahill present? A. No, she was by herself. Q. Both times ? A. Some times she came in and out. Q. She was there some time, was she not? A. Yes, she said she should be paid for what she did.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">The orphans\u2019 court allowed her claim, and distributed the balance of the estate to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-6\">Exceptions filed by Harry Dettenmaier and Anna Peacock to this award were dismissed by the court in an opinion by Ashman, J., reported in 8 Pa.

Lukens, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap6\">A child is bound to render service and attention to her parent as a matter of filial duty, and cannot recover compensation therefor, without proof of an express contract for reimbursement, or of circumstances which necessarily imply such a contract: Candor\u2019s Appeal, 5 W. &amp; S. 513; Murphy v. Corrigan, 161 Pa. 59.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-9\">An attempt to establish such a contract by inference is regarded with great disfavor, and in order to establish it the proof must be clear, distinct and satisfactory: Lynn v. Lynn, 29 Pa. 369; Weaver\u2019s Estate, 182 Pa. 349.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-10\">The terms of such a contract must appear, from the evidence, to have been definite and certain: Graham v. Graham, 34 Pa. 475.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-11\">Mere loose declarations of the decedent are not sufficient: Murphy v. Corrigan, 161 Pa. 59; Weaver\u2019s Estate, 182 Pa. 349.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-12\">The evidence was insufficient to establish the necessary contract. The utmost that it tended to prove was that the services were rendered in the expectation of a legacy, and this has always been held insufficient to create a contract: Thompson v. Stevens, 71 Pa. 161; Miller\u2019s Estate, 136 Pa. 239.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AhO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>March 21, 1900:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-2\"><em>Henry J. Scott, </em>with him <em>A. Hagen, Jr., </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6G\">It has been repeatedly held that the finding of an auditing judge has all the effect of a verdict of a jury and, where confirmed by the orphans\u2019 court in banc, it will not be disturbed except upon the clearest proof of error: Mayhew\u2019s Est., 155 Pa. 94; Coulston\u2019s Est., 161 Pa. 151; Strauss\u2019s Est., 168 Pa. 561.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-3\">The evidence in this case is quite as strong as that in Miller\u2019s Appeal, 100 Pa. 568.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Afr\">William W. Pontee, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The rule deducible from the Pennsylvania authorities is formulated thus, in 4 Pepper and Lewis\u2019s Digest of Decisions, 6288: \u201c The law implies no promise on the part of a parent to pay for services rendered, or support or attendance given, by the child as such, even after the child has become of age, and in the absence of clear and distinct proof of an expressed contract, no allowance can be made or recovery had from a parent\u2019s estate on such a claim.\u201d This rule is applicable to the case at bar. The court below holds that there was sufficient proof of a prior and existing contract to pay for the services rendered by the claimant to her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Where a question of fact has been passed upon by an adjudicating judge and by the court on exceptions, the appellate courts rarely disturb the conclusion reached. In this case, however, we are constrained to hold that the evidence presented was not adequate to prove the existence of a contract to pay. To reverse the order of the court below doubtless bears hardly upon the claimant. The conduct of the appellants has been not improperly characterized by the learned judge of the court below as evincing \u201cundisguised selfishness.\u201d We cannot refuse, however, to give effect to a salutary rule of law because in a particular instance it results in apparent hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The decree of the court below is based upon findings that the decedent gave the control of her deposit book in the savings bank to the appellant and permitted her to withdraw moneys for the payment of some of the expenses attendant upon the decedent\u2019s illness ; that the decedent requested her daughter to withdraw the balance, for the reason that she desired her daughter to have it all before her death; that this was accompanied with the declarations by the decedent that her daughter should have what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>might remain of the decedent\u2019s estate, and that some of the declarations were made in the presence of the claimant. The balance of the deposit was not withdrawn by the daughter. These are the grounds upon which the claimant relied in asserting a contract to pay. The testimony itself is, in part, given by witnesses not fully familiar with the English language. The substance of the testimony is, however, as stated above. Taken as strongly as it in fairness can be, it is not sufficiently clear and distinct proof of an express contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The decree of the court below is therefore reversed, and the record is remitted that distribution of the estate may be made in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
