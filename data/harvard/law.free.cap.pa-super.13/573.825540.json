If the jury believes that the plaintiff, whilst in the employ of the defendant, accepted commission for the purchase of goods from the vendor of the same to the defendant, whilst the plaintiff was acting as agent of the defendant, then that sum may be used as a set-off against any claim the plaintiff may have against the defendant, with interest added to such sum. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed, provided Kinney\u2019s duty was, under the terms of his employment, to buy and advise concerning the buying of the machines here in question.] [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-11\">[2. If the plaintiff was' acting in bad faith, and in a way tending to injure the business of the defendant when he attempted to negotiate with Bertolet and others for the lease of the Weissport mill, if he knew that the defendant had an option on such mill, and offered to pay as much or more for the same as the defendants paid for it, then he was violating his contract and was rightfully discharged, and cannot recover in this action. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed. However, whether he was discharged, which defendant denies, is for the jury. If it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>not found that he was discharged, then no result from the alleged discharge will ensue.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-5\">The court charged the jury in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-6\">[Now if it is proved that it was part of Kinney\u2019s duty to put up and buy the machinery, or to buy these very mills, or if he advised the company to buy these very mills, and in consequence they did buy them, or it was his duty to give all his time to the construction of these mills, then, if these mills could be bought for \u00a780.00 less than the $800, it was Kinney\u2019s duty to make that fact known.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-7\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $807.20.

L. Kline, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8p\">Material facts and inferences of fact being disputed and in doubt, it became the exclusive province of the jury to determine what the facts were: Barker v. Gas Co., 157 Pa. 593.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AiKt\">Orlady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The plaintiff brought suit to recover a balance alleged to be due to him under a contract with the defendant company. Payment had been refused on the ground that while the plaintiff had been in its employ he had acted in such bad faith as to forfeit all right to a balance of wages, which had been retained under the terms of his employment. It was clearly proved on the part of the defendant, and practically admitted by the plaintiff, that the sum of $80.00 had been paid to the plaintiff, by a vendor of machines, as a commission on the purchase which he had induced his employers to make. At that time the plaintiff was under a contract to give his undivided attention to the business of the defendants, for which faithful performance he was to receive certain wages. He owed to his employers the fullest measure of good faith and could not claim his wages in full, if while earning them, he secretly accepted commissions from a party with whom his employers were dealing at arms length. He could not represent both, and having been paid by one he could not recover from the other. The plain dictates of business integrity, as well as the rules of law, forbid making a profit out of such double dealing The principal is entitled to the dealer\u2019s lowest price, and a servant cannot profit by conspiring against the interest of his employer: Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Flanigan, 112 Pa. 558; Rice v. Davis, 136 Pa. 439; Rich v. Black, 173 Pa. 92; Addison v. Wannamaker, 185 Pa. 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">As to the other part of the claim the evidence was so conflicting that it was rightly submitted to the jury. The court should have instructed the jury to allow the defendants the sum of $80.00 as of the time of its payment. This can be done yet, and the judgment is now affirmed subject to the credit of $80.00 with interest, to be entered by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
