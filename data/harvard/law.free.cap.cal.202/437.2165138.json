We are in accord with said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>opinion in many respects and adopt and approve the following portion thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-3\">\u201cCertiorari.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">\u201cThe purpose of this proceeding is to review certain findings, orders and the award made in pursuance of an application to the respondent Commission by an employee for adjustment of compensation as a result of injuries sustained by him while acting within the scope of his employment with the petitioner herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201cFrom the record it appears that the employee, whq was engaged as a \u2018spudder\u2019 on a pile driver operated by the petitioner, suffered an injury by reason of a large splinter which \u2018flew off a pile, striking him, proximately causing injury to the right eye and cheek\u2019; that in due course, on findings of temporary total disability, an award of continuing compensation and an order for future medical and surgical treatment of the employee were made by the Industrial Accident Commission, the respondent herein; that approximately twenty months thereafter, on the ground that the disability of the employee had become permanent, the employer (petitioner herein) filed an application with respondent Commission for the termination of the continuing award to the employee, together with a request that the percentage of such permanent disability be fixed and determined by said Commission;\u2014which petition finally resulted in an order by said Commission denying the employer\u2019s application that the award as theretofore made and then in force as to continuing compensation to said employee be terminated, at the same time ordering further medical and surgical treatment of the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u201cThe findings made by the Commission, together with its order last mentioned, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u2018 \u201cThat the temporary total disability resulting from the injury sustained by the employee on February 7, 1923, has not yet terminated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201c \u2018That further operative treatment as recommended in the report of Dr. George W. Pierce dated April 21, 1926, should be furnished to the employee at the expense of the defendant County of Los Angeles. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201c \u2018It is ordered that the defendant\u2019s (petitioner\u2019s) said petition to terminate indemnity be and it hereby is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u201c \u2018It is further ordered that the said defendant shall furnish to the applicant, within a reasonable time, the further operative treatment recommended in the report of Dr. George W. Pierce dated April 21, 1926.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-3\">\u201c \u2018It is further ordered that should said defendant neglect or refuse to furnish such treatment within a reasonable time from date hereof, the applicant shall be entitled to secure such treatment from his own physician, and said defendant County of Los Angeles will be liable for the reasonable expense thereof, to be determined upon the filing of itemized bills, in duplicate, and the approval of the Medical Department of this Commission. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">\u201cThe first point presented by petitioner is that the Commission acted in excess of its powers in making its finding in effect that total temporary disability of the employee had not terminated. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The employee Nelson testified as to his condition since sustaining the injury, and particularly as to his condition at the time of the hearing before the Commission. He in effect testified that he had not returned to work and that he had been unable to do any work since his injury; that he had visited his brother at his ranch in Minnesota and while there had assisted in the light chores when he felt well enough, such as driving the cattle and horses into the yard. As to having difficulty with his eye at the time he said: \u201cYes, lots of it, I cannot get the distance with it.\u201d Doctor Pierce testified before the Commission that an \u201cExamination of the mouth shows sinus opening above the right upper first molar, apparently from antrum. No sulcus behind the lower lid to hold artificial eye. There is a purulent discharge into the mouth. \u201d  There was undoubtedly sufficient evidence before the Commission to justify the finding that total temporary disability of the employee had not terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">We also adopt and approve the further portion of the opinion of the district court of appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">\u201cThe next finding and order of the Commission to which, petitioner directs attention is that wherein in effect it was found and ordered that the employer furnish to the employee \u2018the further operative. treatment recommended in the report of Dr. George W. Pierce\u2019; furthermore, that should the employer neglect or refuse to furnish such treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ment within a reasonable time after the date of the order, at the expense of the employer, the employee should be entitled to secure such treatment from his own physician.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-3\">\u201cAt the time the report of Dr. Pierce was made it appears therefrom that the condition of the employee was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">\u201c \u2018Present condition: Numerous scars over the entire right cheek; lower border of orbit, sunken, apparently fracture. There is a paresia of the upper lid. The palpebral fissure is one-half inch lower than on other side. There is some voluntary contraction in the orbicularis palpebrarum. The upper lid overlaps the lower at the outer canthus and is distorted at this point by adhesions. There is some loss of tissue of the lower lid with irregularity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201c \u2018Examination of the mouth shows sinus opening above the right upper first molar, apparently from antrum. No sulcus behind the lower lid to hold artificial eye. There is a purulent discharge from the orbit. There is also a continuous purulent discharge into the mouth. There is some loss of periorbital fat. \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u201cThe operative treatment recommended by Dr. Pierce to which reference was made in the order by the Commission was indicated in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">\u2018 \u2018 \u2018 There are two different stages of repair necessary in this case. First\u2014is the deepening of the socket which could be done in one operation by the method of epithelial inlay and which would not require over one week to ten days and then the lower lid would require some plastic operation to complete the borders while the upper lid could be freed and raised up. These operations would not require any great length of time. The second stage would be the cleaning out of the antrum and closure of the sinus. I cannot state just how long this would take.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201c \u2018By plastic operation, however, the appearance of the patient could be markedly improved and he would wear an artificial eye.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">\u201cIt is the contention of petitioner that the proposed operations and treatment recommended by Dr. Pierce were for cosmetic effect only, and that the Commission was without jurisdiction to malte the order of which complaint was made. But an inspection of the report discloses the fact that in part at least the purpose of the recommended treatment was to relieve the patient from the condition arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>primarily from the two \u2018purulent discharges\u2019 referred to in the report, together with the added feature of \u2018cleaning out the antrum and closure of the sinus.\u2019 To that extent, therefore, it is clear that the Commission was acting within its statutory powers. The principal attack of petitioner, however, is directed toward that part of the recommendation with reference to the other steps leading to the conclusion that \u2018the appearance of the patient could he markedly improved and he would wear an artificial eye.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-3\">\u201cTo put the position assumed by petitioner perhaps more plainly, it is that petitioner objects to any operation, the expense of which must be borne by it, for the ultimate purpose of so building up the tissue and bony structure surrounding the orbital cavity that the employee may be provided with and wear an artificial eye.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u201cSection 9 [a] of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act (Stats. 1917, p. 831, as variously amended) provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u201c \u2018Where liability for compensation under this act exists, such compensation shall be furnished or paid by the employer and be as provided in the following schedule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">\u201c \u2018(a) Such medical, surgical and hospital treatment, including nursing, medicines, medical and surgical supplies, crutches and apparatus, including artificial members, as may reasonably be required to cure and relieve from the effects of the injury, . . . \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201cRespondent directs particular attention to the words \u2018as may reasonably be required to cure and <em>relieve </em>from the effects of the injury.\u2019 The photographs of the employee, presented at the time of the hearing before the referee, together with the report made by Dr. Pierce (hereinbefore set forth) regarding the condition of the employee shortly preceding the time of the hearing, indicate a deplorable situation so far as the probability of the employee being able to secure employment was concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\u201cOn the part of the employer, the purpose of any surgical attempt in connection with an injury received by an employee is to restore him to as nearly a natural and normal condition as may be possible or practicable, to the end that his earning power by reason of his injury may be diminished to the least possible extent. To illustrate: If by accident arising from his employment the foot of a day laborer</p>\n<p id=\"b479-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>should be so crushed that by no known surgical skill could it be made useful as a member of his body, the probable medical course and practice would indicate the amputation of the foot. In due course thereafter it is clear that an artificial foot would greatly aid the employee in bringing about a restoration to a considerable extent of his earning power. Could it be doubted that the language of the statute which requires the furnishing by the employer of such surgical treatment, \u2018including artificial members\u2019 as may be required to \u2018cure and relieve from the effects of the injury,\u2019 would be applicable? In the instant case, that the present appearance of the employee would be a decided handicap to his obtaining employment \u2018in an open labor market\u2019 is obvious. The evident purpose of some of the proposed surgical operations on the employee is to give him a more presentable personal appearance. In his present condition, by reason of his limitations and the natural competition in securing employment, it might, and in all probability would, be extremely difficult for the employee to secure even such work as he is capable of doing. If successful, the result of the proposed surgical operations would place the employee not only in a position where he could secure better and more remunerative employment than at this time he may command, but his improved personal appearance would assist in enabling him to retain such position. The probabilities are that the morale of the employee would be bettered and his self-respect and appreciation of his good-workmanship qualities be increased\u2014all tending toward a rehabilitation and restoration of the earning powers of the employee as of the date of the injury which he sustained. The principle of the question here under consideration is treated to some extent in the case of <em>New York Central R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Bianc, </em>250 U. S. 596 [63 L. Ed. 1161, 40 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44, see, also, Rose\u2019s U. S. Notes Supp.] where, among other things, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-3\">\u201c \u2018Even were impairment of earning power the sole justification for imposing compulsory payment of workmen\u2019s compensation upon the employer in such cases, it would be sufficient answer to the present contention to say that a serious disfigurement of the face or head reasonably may be regarded as having a direct relation to the injured per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>son\u2019s earning power, irrespective of its effect upon his mere capacity for work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-3\">\u201c \u2018Under ordinary conditions of life, a serious and unnatural disfigurement of the face or head very probably may have a harmful effect upon the ability of the injured person to obtain or retain employment. Laying aside exceptional cases, which we must assume will be fairly dealt with in the proper and equitable administration of the act, such a disfigurement may render one repulsive or offensive to the sight, displeasing, or at least less pleasing, to the employer, to fellow employees, and to patrons or customers. (See <em>Ball </em>v. <em>William Hunt &amp; Sons, </em>A. C. 496, 81 L. J. K. B., N. S., 782, 106 L. T., N. S., 911, 28 Times L. R. 428, 56 Sol. Jo. 550, 5 B. W. C. C. 459.)\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u201c This court is therefore led to the conclusion that even though conceding that the major object of the proposed surgical operations on the employee may be for \u2018cosmetic purposes\u2019 only, the respondent Commission in making its order therefor was not acting in excess of its statutory powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u201c It is also objected by petitioner that \u2018the Industrial Accident Commission acted without, or in excess of, its powers in ordering petitioner to pay bills covering operative treatment rendered Philip Nelson by private parties prior to a finding upon notice as provided in section 10 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act, that petitioner\u2019s approved hospital was inadequate.\u2019 From an examination of the order by the Commission (hereinbefore set forth) relating to petitioner\u2019s objection, it will be noted, not that the Commission has arbitrarily ordered the employer to pay bills covering operative treatment rendered to the employee prior to a finding that the hospital of petitioner was inadequate, but that in fact, the order was to the effect that the employer furnish the proposed operative treatment within a reasonable time, or on its neglect or refusal so to do, the employee \u2018be entitled to secure such treatment from his own physician\u2019 at the expense of the employer. The point made by petitioner, therefore, is without application to the facts herein.  It may, however, be said that the record herein clearly discloses the fact that after twenty-two surgical operations on the employee, the employer admitted its inability to further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>relieve the employee from the effect of his injuries. Dr. Pierce, the evidence of whose surgical skill was admitted, promised the desired relief. In such circumstances, assuming the successful outcome of the proposed surgical operations, the case of <em>Union Iron Works </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Commission, </em>190 Cal. 33 [210 Pac. 410], is authority for the principle that the employer may be made liable for the necessary expense connected therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u201cFinally, it is urged by petitioner that the respondent Commission acted in excess of its powers in refusing to furnish petitioner with a transcript of the hearing before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u201cWithout deciding whether in ordinary circumstances, upon payment by the petitioner of the fees prescribed by statute therefor, it became the duty of the Commission to furnish such transcript, this court is of the opinion that the relief sought is one that cannot be considered in a petition for writ of review. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The award is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
