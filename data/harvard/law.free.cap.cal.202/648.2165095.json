In addition to other allegations not necessary to be mentioned, the complaint alleges that the decedent was the son of the plaintiff; that in July, 1923, she sold property belonging to her in the state of Kansas and handed over the proceeds to the decedent for the purpose of purchasing a home for himself and other members of her family; that decedent purchased the property in question, taking title in his own name; that the son invested no money of his own in the property, and that he held the title thereto in trust for plaintiff. Appropriate prayer for relief followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">We think the complaint states a cause of action to enforce a trust declared by section 853 of the Civil Code, which provides that when a transfer of real property is made to one and the consideration therefor is paid by another, a trust is presumed to result in favor of the person by whom the payment is made. On the record presented here we find no merit in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Richards, J., and Langdon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
