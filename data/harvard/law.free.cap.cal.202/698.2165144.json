It is alleged that the said lease was an <em>ultra vires </em>act on the part of the city and is illegal and void, and that Dorrington is a trespasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The city was never served with a copy of the complaint and the action proceeded against defendant Dorrington alone. He filed a general and special demurrer, attacking the complaint in over thirty-five different particulars. Amendments to the complaint were made from time to time, and finally, after the demurrer to the fifth amended complaint had been sustained, plaintiff declined to amend further and judgment went against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s position is that the filling station is a public nuisance, and that he, as a member of the public, is specially injured, entitling him to sue. The first position is not sustained by any authority, and it is apparent that a \u201cgasoline filling station and garage\u201d is not a nuisance <em>per se. </em>It was not in operation at the time the complaint was filed, and unless it is operated in some extraordinary manner so as to be a nuisance because of such operation this court cannot say that it is a nuisance requiring suppression at the suit of the representative of the public generally or at the suit of an individual specially affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The questions concerning the legality of the lease to defendant Dorrington are not involved in this action to enjoin Dorrington from proceeding with his building. Plaintiff claims no title to the strip of ground occupied by Dorrington and has no rights unless the erection of this structure is a nuisance. It is settled that an obstruction of a public street is a nuisance, and the authorities cited by plaintiff and appellant all deal with situations where a public street was obstructed, but the complaint herein does not show the obstruction of a public street, but, on the contrary, shows that the streets completely surrounding this plot of ground are open and accessible.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">It is unnecessary to go into all the questions raised by the demurrer. Upon the merits, plaintiff has not stated a cause of action and the demurrer was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Richards, J., and Shenk, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
