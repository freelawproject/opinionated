Defendant Man Wai Lee\u2019s third-party claim seeks indemnification and contribution based upon an assertion that the co-employee\u2019s negligence may have contributed to the accident causing plaintiffs injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">On our leave granted, plaintiff Jeffrey McDaniel<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeals from a provision in a July 8, 2010 order denying his request to dismiss a third-party complaint filed by defendants Man Wai Lee and PP Trucking, Inc. (PP Trucking) against plaintiffs co-worker Fernandino Devers. Plaintiff also appeals from additional provisions of the same order, which denied his request for frivolous litigation sanctions and prohibited counsel from representing both him and Devers in their respective personal injury actions against Lee. Defendants cross-appeal from a related provision permitting plaintiffs counsel to choose which of the two plaintiffs he will continue to represent, asserting the existence of a conflict demands counsel may not represent either plaintiff. We affirm the denial of sanctions, but reverse the denial of plaintiffs motion to dismiss and the order regarding counsel\u2019s continued legal representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">The essential facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff was employed by Sprint/Nextel. On the afternoon of September 23, 2008, while in the course of his employment, plaintiff was driving westbound on Raymond Boulevard in Newark. He stopped at a red light at the Blanchard Street intersection. Devers, plaintiffs co-worker, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>stopped directly behind plaintiff, driving another Sprint/Nextel vehicle. An eighteen-wheel truck, operated by defendant Lee, was behind Devers in the same lane of travel and failed to stop at the intersection, rear-ending Devers\u2019 vehicle. In a chain reaction, Devers\u2019 vehicle struck plaintiffs, which lunged forward. According to the separate interrogatory answers submitted by plaintiff and Devers, Lee\u2019s truck struck Devers a second time, causing it again to collide with the vehicle driven by plaintiff pushing it further into the intersection. Lee told the responding Newark Police officer that \u201cwhen the light turned red, he applied the brakes but the vehicle didn\u2019t stop quick[ly] enough[,] causing him to strike [Devers\u2019 vehicle] in the rear and causing [Devers\u2019] vehicle [ ] to rear-end [plaintiff\u2019s] vehicle.\u201d Devers was taken by ambulance to University Hospital; plaintiff drove himself to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Plaintiff and Devers filed separate worker\u2019s compensation petitions as a result of their respective injuries suffered in the accident. Additionally, Devers filed a complaint in the Law Division (Docket No. ESX-L-6655-09), against Lee and his employer, defendant PP Trucking, the truck\u2019s owner. Plaintiff also filed an action against Lee and PP Trucking (Docket No. ESX-L\u2014 1280-10). Both Devers and plaintiff were represented by the same attorney. The two matters were later consolidated for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In addition to answering plaintiff\u2019s complaint, defendants filed a third-party complaint against Devers, alleging his negligent operation of his employer\u2019s vehicle contributed to plaintiffs injuries. The third-party action sought indemnification and contribution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Plaintiff sent a <em>Rule </em>l:4-8(b)(l) notice to Lee\u2019s attorney requesting the withdrawal of the third-party action, which he characterized as fiivolous. He also advised of his intention to request sanctions if Lee declined to withdraw the pleading within twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>eight days. When Lee declined his request, plaintiff moved to dismiss. Lee cross-moved to disqualify plaintiffs attorney, claiming a conflict of interest. At the conclusion of oral argument, the court denied both motions without prejudice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Plaintiff renewed his motion to dismiss the third-party complaint as frivolous, and sought sanctions. The motion judge denied plaintiffs motion and granted, in part, defendant\u2019s cross-motion to disqualify counsel, ordering that he could represent either Devers or plaintiff. The court gave counsel thirty days to determine which party he would continue to represent. We granted the cross-requests for leave to appeal filed by plaintiff and Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">There are distinct but related issues to be examined: whether the third-party complaint by Lee against Devers can proceed and whether it is permissible for counsel to represent Devers and plaintiff in their respective actions against Lee and PP Trucking. Plaintiff, relying on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 of the Act, asserts the third-party suit must be dismissed, as plaintiff cannot prosecute a negligence claim against Devers. Plaintiff urges that because the parties\u2019 interests are not adverse, the same attorney can proceed on each plaintiffs behalf. To the contrary, Lee argues he is entitled to file a third-party action and obtain a third-party negligence verdict against Devers. Additionally, Lee maintains the conflict of interest between plaintiff and Devers precludes counsel from representing either plaintiff. We will examine each of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">\u201cThe workers\u2019 compensation system represents the bargain that was struck between employers and employees concerning workplace injuries, whereby employers shoulder the expense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>of workers\u2019 injuries arising out of the performance of work duties.\u201d <em>Basil v. Wolf, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>38, 53, 935 A.2d 1154 (2007). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cprovide[s] a method of compensation for the injury or death of an employee, irrespective of the fault of the employer or contributory negligence and assumption of risk of the employee.\u201d <em>Harris v. Branin Transport, Inc., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>38, 46, 711 A.2d 331 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>408, 719 A.2d 640 (1998). The Act serves as \u201cthe exclusive remedy for an employee who sustains an injury in an accident that arises out of and in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Ahammed v. Logandro, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>179, 190, 925 A.2d 733 (App.Div.2007) (citing <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-8). <em>See also Basil, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>at 55, 935 A.2d 1154. \u201cFundamental to the Act is the premise that by accepting the benefits provided by its schedule of payments, the employee agrees to forsake a tort action against the employer.\u201d <em>Ramos v. Browning Ferris Indus., Inc., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>177, 183, 510 A.2d 1152 (1986). <em>See also N.J.S.A </em>34:15-8.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The statute\u2019s exclusivity bar also prohibits an injured employee\u2019s legal action to recover for injuries caused by a fellow employee. <em>Basil, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>at 54 n. 7, 935 A.2d 1154. <em>See also Barone v. Harra, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>276, 278, 390 A.2d 571 (1978) (reiterating that the Act \u201cprecludes tort actions against fellow employees for compensable actions occurring while both persons are in the same employ, except for intentional wrongs\u201d). Specifically, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 provides, in pertinent part, \u201ca person shall not be hable to anyone at common law or otherwise on account of such injury or death for any act or omission occurring while such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>person was in the same employ as the person injured or killed, except for intentional wrong.\u201d This provision blankets co-employees with immunity from suit by injured co-workers. <em>Conrad, v. Robbi, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>424, 438, 775 A.2d 562 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>210, 785 A.2d 438 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the [immunity provision] was not so much to protect the fellow servant from liability as it was to protect the employer from paying twice, once through compensation and a second time through indemnification of the fellow servant against the injured employee\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Ahammed, supra, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 190, 925 A.2d 733. The Legislature intended to prevent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">burdening the employer indirectly with the common-law damages superimposed upon his workers\u2019] compensation liability by reason of either a legal, moral or practical obligation to indemnify the sued ... employee, or with the expense of carrying insurance to cover the personal liability of such ... personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\"><em>[Miller v. Muscarelie, </em>67 <em>N.J.Super. </em>305, 321, 170 A.2d 437 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>140, 174 A.2d 925 (1961).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">\u201cIn order for the statute to apply as a bar to a suit against a co-employee, three conditions must be satisfied: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered a compensable injury; (2) the plaintiff and defendant must have been co-employees; and (3) the defendant must have been acting \u2018in the course of his employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daus v. Marble, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 246, 636 A.2d 1091 (App.Div.1994) (quoting <em>Wunschel v. City of Jersey City, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>651, 659, 477 A.2d 329 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">With respect to an injured employee\u2019s claim against a third-party tortfeasor, the Act is neutral. Thus, an employee retains the right to pursue available common-law remedies for liability against third-parties, so long as recoveries are not duplicated. <em>Schweizer v. Elox Div. of Colt Indus., </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>280, 287-88, 359 A.2d 857 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">We have unearthed no matter discussing the application of the Act\u2019s exclusivity bar in a situation similar to the one at hand, which addresses asserted claims involving co-employees and a third-party tortfeasor. Nonetheless, sufficient guidance is gleaned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>from published authorities involving third-party claims against an employer to inform our review regarding the statute\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">In <em>Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey v. Honeywell Protective Services, Honeywell, Inc., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>11, 535 A.2d 974 (App.Div.1987), we addressed a matter involving \u201cthe triadic relationship between the employer, employee and [a] third-party tortfeasor\u201d finding the parties\u2019 claims were \u201cgoverned by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18, 535 A.2d 974. We concluded a \u201c \u2018third-party tortfeasor may not obtain contribution from an employer, no matter what may be the comparative negligence of the third party and the employer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 535 A.2d 974 (quoting <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 184, 510 A.2d 1152).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">As the Court stated in <em>Ramos, supra, </em>because the Act replaces a party\u2019s right to \u201cany other method, form or amount of compensation,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-8, an employer may not be liable in tort to an injured employee and cannot be considered a joint tortfeasor under the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:53A-3. 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 184, 510 A2d 1152; <em>see also Stephenson v. R.A. Jones &amp; Co., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>194, 199, 510 A.2d 1161 (1986). Likewise, the employer cannot be subject to third-party claims pursuant to the Comparative Negligence Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-5.3. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 194, 510 A.2d 1152; <em>Stephenson, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 199, 510 A.2d 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In an employee\u2019s action alleging negligence of a third-party, the Court has emphasized that despite the employer\u2019s negligence, there cannot be a claim for apportionment of liability to the employer, in an action for indemnification or contribution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 193-94, 510 A.2d 1152; <em>Stephenson, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 199, 510 A.2d 1161.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>As tempting as it may be in a given case to temper the exclusive-remedy provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and to permit a third party to recover against the employer, we defer to the balance of interests as struck by the Legislature. The unmistakable intention of the Legislature was that the sole liability of an employer for a work-related injury of an employee was that provided in the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ara\"><em>[Id. </em>at 188, 510 A.2d 1152.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">It is important to note that in <em>Stephenson, supra, </em>at the employer\u2019s request, the trial judge allowed the jury to respond to a special interrogatory asking it to apportion the relative negligence of the third-party and the employer under the Comparative Negligence Act. 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 198, 510 A.2d 1161. The jury found that the third-party was five percent negligent and the employer was ninety-five percent negligent. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court found error with this practice and rejected the third-party\u2019s claim of a right to a judgment for implied indemnification. <em>Id. </em>at 199, 510 A.2d 1161. Concluding the employer\u2019s negligence must not be assessed by the jury, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">Given the jury\u2019s finding that [the third-party]\u2019s negligence is less than that of [the employer], the effect of the legislative scheme may seem harsh. But we cannot distinguish in principle between a third-party tortfeasor that is [five] percent negligent and one that is [ninety-five] percent negligent. In both instances, the tortfeasor is liable in tort to the injured worker because of his wrongful conduct. By comparison, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides the exclusive remedy against an employer whose concurring negligence contributes to the injury of an employee. To permit the third-party tortfeasor to recover indemnification from the employer would subvert the immunity granted to the employer by the Act. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 189-190, 510 A.2d 1152.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">\n<em>[Ibid,.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In <em>Anderson v. A.J. Friedman Supply Co., Inc., </em>416 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46, 68, 3 A.3d 545 (App.Div.2010), we affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request to separate defendant\u2019s dual liabilities for two asserted causes of mesothelioma resulting in the death of plaintiffs decedent. <em>Ibid. </em>Defendant argued the jury verdict sheet should have differentiated its liability for decedent\u2019s asbestos exposure while she was in defendant\u2019s employ and subsequent bystander exposure as a consequence of washing her husband\u2019s asbestos laden work clothes. <em>Ibid,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Citing <em>Ramos, </em>we concluded that the defendant\u2019s dual status did not change the application of the law and the employer could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>be subject to contribution liability. Therefore, \u201cthere was no need to allocate responsibility between [decedentjs direct exposure as an [ ] employee and [decedent\u2019s] bystander exposure.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In <em>Ahammed, supra, </em>two Domino\u2019s Pizza delivery drivers were in a motor vehicle accident as one entered and the other exited the employer\u2019s parking lot. 394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 181-82, 925 A.2d 733. Even though the parties were operating vehicles not owned by their employer, we noted that the exclusivity of the Act\u2019s \u201cfellow-servant\u201d rule immunized one employee from liability for negligence to the other. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Having established plaintiffs employer is immune from suit, we now examine the viability of Lee\u2019s action for contribution and indemnification against the co-employee, Devers. We must determine whether third-party claims against a negligent co-employee fall outside the scope of the immunity bar of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The Court in <em>Ramos </em>and <em>Stephenson </em>squarely held that the immunity bar of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-8 prohibits an employer from ever being considered a joint tortfeasor. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 193-94, 510 A.2d 1152; <em>Stephenson, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 199, 510 A.2d 1161. That same statutory provision imposes an immunity bar to foreclose suit against an allegedly negligent co-employee. Without question, regardless of his degree of fault, Devers, like the employer, is immune from any suit brought by plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8. We find no discernable difference between the nature and purpose of the statute\u2019s grant of immunity to bar suit against an employer or against a co-employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>A co-employee\u2019s act of negligence while in the course of employment vicariously implicates the employer. As the Legislature\u2019s prohibition against doubling the financial burden on employers removes the employer from consideration as a joint tortfeasor, <em>Ramos, supra, 103 N.J. </em>at 184, 510 A.2d 1152, so too it removes a co-employee whose negligence falls to the employer. Reiterating the Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Ramos, supra, </em>\u201c[t]he unmistakable intention of the Legislature\u201d was that \u201cthe sole liability\u201d of the fellow servant was limited by the provisions of the Act. 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 188, 510 A.2d 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In order to maintain consistency with the purpose of the Act, as well as symmetry among the two immunity provisions, claims of negligence against a co-employee also must be circumscribed. Accordingly, we conclude the third-party tortfeasor may not seek indemnification and contribution from a negligent co-worker for a plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Relying on the fact that Devers was in a separate vehicle, defendants assert this scenario falls outside the scope of the Act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Here, Devers was working when Lee struck the rear of his vehicle, which in turn caused injury to plaintiff. It does not matter that plaintiff and Devers were in separate cars. Devers remains immune from any action to recover for plaintiffs injuries, including third-party claims for indemnification and contribution. <em>Barone, supra, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>at 279, 390 A.2d 571; <em>Kough v. N.J. Auto. Full Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>460, 464, 568 A.2d 127 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>638, 583 A.2d 331 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">We reject Lee\u2019s reliance on our holding in <em>Kane v. Hartz Mountain Industries, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 650 A.2d 808 (App.Div.1994), aff<em>'d o.b., </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>141, 669 A.2d 816 (1996), which found the employer\u2019s liability to a third-party tortfeasor based on a contractual indemnity agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 145-46, 650 A.2d 808. In <em>Kane, </em>the plaintiff sought damages for permanent injuries suffered when he fell from a steel beam while working as an iron worker. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>134, 650 A.2d 808. The plaintiff filed a tort action against the owner, general contractor and others involved in a commercial construction project, who he argued failed to comply with federal and state safety codes. <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiffs employer had contractually agreed to indemnify the owner for certain safety obligations regarding its employees while working on the project. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 650 A.2d 808. The owner joined the employer as a third-party defendant, <em>ibid., </em>because it had assumed \u201c \u2018a contractual duty to indemnify a third party through an express agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 650 A.2d 808 (quoting <em>Ramos, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 191, 510 A.2d 1152). The holding is inapposite here, where there was no contractual assumption of indemnification by Devers.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">As an aside, we note Lee has provided no factual basis to support a third-party liability claim against Devers in an attempt to shift blame from Lee. Defendants\u2019 suggestions that the accident was staged, plaintiff and Devers may have been drinking, the two may not have been working, or Gelco could be responsible for negligent entrustment of its vehicle to Devers are speculative scenarios that are belied by the evidence of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In the police report, completed at the scene of the accident, and interrogatory answers from plaintiff, Devers and Lee consistently report plaintiff and Devers were stopped at a red light when Lee could not stop his eighteen-wheeler in time. Lee does not assert his vehicle or its equipment malfunctioned. Tellingly, in responding to an inquiry seeking \u201cthe facts upon which you intend to predicate [a] third-party action[,]\u201d Lee responded, \u201cThis information is unknown to me at this time. Defendant reserves the right to amend this answer through the course of discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Following our review, we find Lee\u2019s third-party complaint against Devers is without legal basis. Accordingly, it must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Plaintiff also challenges the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that counsel could not represent him and Devers in their respective suits against Lee. In doing so, the court considered whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>available insurance recovery may be insufficient to satisfy both claims. Plaintiff argues the question presented here differs from the conflict of interest existing when the same attorney represents both a passenger and driver injured in the same accident, because here the co-employee is immune from suit. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Rule of Professional Conduct <em>(RPC) </em>1.7(a)(1) prohibits the representation of clients having adverse interests. The Supreme Court issued a Notice to the Bar, directing counsel\u2019s obligations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">The Supreme Court is of the view, because of the conflict of interest inherent in the situation, that an attorney should not represent both the driver of a car and his passenger in an action against the driver of another car, unless there is a legal bar to the passenger suing his own driver, as for example, where they are ... employees of the same employer and the accident occurred in course of their employment. Where an attorney does represent both a driver and his passenger and no such legal bar exists, if a erossclaim or counterclaim is made by the other driver, a conflict of interest arises and the Supreme Court has advised the Assignment Judges that the attorney should not be permitted to continue to represent either the driver or his passenger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">[91 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>81 (February 8, 1968).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">We part company with the motion judge\u2019s anticipation of a conflict from counsel\u2019s dual representation. Plaintiff may not sue Devers and vice versa, and we have rejected Lee\u2019s conjecture that Devers could be liable to Lee. Consequently, the interests of plaintiff and Lee are not adverse in their separate pursuit of recovery from Lee. Accordingly, the propriety of counsel representing both plaintiffs appears acceptable when \u201cthe liability question is obvious.\u201d Ethics Committee Opinion No. 248, 96 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>93, 95 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Having said this, we cannot ignore that if a future possibility arises, albeit remote, when plaintiffs and Devers\u2019 interests become adverse, counsel is required to completely withdraw from the representation of each client. Ethics Opinion No. 156, 92 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>481 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">Finally, we are asked to review the court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs request for frivolous litigation sanctions pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:4-8.
