We reject this argument and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Following a motor vehicle accident, in which defendant sustained personal injuries, defendant was issued summonses for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DWI), <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4\u2014 50, reckless driving, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-96, careless driving, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-97, and failure to wear a seatbelt, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3-76.2(f). At trial in municipal court, the State called Mark W. Maxwell, a forensic scientist, to testify about defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAC). Maxwell testified that he did not actually perform the test but instead observed another chemist, Major Mitchell, examine defendant\u2019s blood sample with a gas chromatograph; Mitchell was being retrained and required supervision. Maxwell signed the laboratory report, certifying the accuracy of the testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Defendant also argued, on the basis of his own expert\u2019s testimony, that there was no scientific support for Maxwell\u2019s application of a standard deviation of only five percent to the results obtained from the gas chromatograph, which placed defendant\u2019s BAC at .081, and above the legal limit. Defendant\u2019s expert, the former Chief Forensic Scientist for the New Jersey State Police Forensic Laboratories, testified that a deviation figure between nine and ten percent should have been applied, and if so, the result would place defendant\u2019s BAC below the legal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">The municipal judge rejected defendant\u2019s argument that the State\u2019s failure to call Mitchell violated the Confrontation Clause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>He also rejected the testimony of defendant\u2019s expert and convicted defendant of a per se DWI violation, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50. As a third time offender, defendant was sentenced to a 180-day jail term; the municipal judge also imposed a ten-year suspension of his operator\u2019s license and registration, a $1006 fine, and other financial penalties. The other summonses were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Defendant appealed to the Law Division. Judge Robert Neustadter rejected all of defendant\u2019s arguments, including the claim of a violation of the Confrontation Clause, in finding defendant guilty of DWI; he imposed the same jail sentence and other penalties as had the municipal judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Defendant appealed to this court, presenting the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">I. THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR BY ADMITTING TESTIMONY AND THE LAB REPORT INTO EVIDENCE THROUGH A CHEMIST THAT DID NOT PERFORM THE TESTING, AS THE ADMISSION OF SUCH EVIDENCE VIOLATED DEFENDANT\u2019S SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO CONFRONT WITNESSES UNDER THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, AS WELL AS DEFENDANT\u2019S CONCOMITANT RIGHTS UNDER THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, IN ACCEPTING THE STATE\u2019S PROFFERED EVIDENCE REGARDING THE DEVIATION IN TESTING, THEREBY RULING THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE EXISTED TO PROVE A PER SE VIOLATION OF DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED UNDER <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50a(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">We find insufficient merit in Point II to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). We also reject Point I for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">We start with the fundamental premise that the Confrontation Clause contained in the Sixth Amendment, which applies to the states by way of the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d The Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Court of the United States has held that the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of \u201c[testimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial\u201d except \u201cwhere the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>36, 59, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1354, 1369, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, 197 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The use of laboratory certificates was soon examined in the wake of <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>limitation on the use of out-of-court statements. In <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 <em>U.S. </em>-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>2527, 174 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>314 (2009), the Court considered whether the Confrontation Clause permitted, over defendant\u2019s objection, the admission of \u201caffidavits reporting the results of forensic analysis!,] which showed that material seized by the police and connected to the defendant was cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2530, 174 L.Ed.2d at 319.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court held that the certificates of analysis in question were testimonial because they constitute \u201csolemn declaration^] or affirmation[s] made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2532, 174 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 321. As a result, the Court concluded that \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment does not permit the prosecution to prove its case via ex parte out-of-court affidavits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2542, 174 L.Ed.2d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\"><em>Melendez-Diaz </em>has had no significant impact on prosecutions in this State. Prior to <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>we recognized the accused\u2019s right to confront the author of a BAC certificate. <em>See State v. Kent, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 375, 918 A.2d 626 (App.Div.2007); <em>State v. Berezansky, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 89, 899 A.2d 306 (App.Div.2006). And in 1987, the Legislature enacted a procedure that requires pretrial notice, and consent, before a laboratory certificate may be used at trial, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19. The Supreme Court recognized that its holding in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>would not adversely effect such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>procedures. <em>Id. </em>at - n. 3, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2534 n. 3, 174 L.Ed.2d at 323 n. 3. But new difficulties, not previously experienced by our courts, have followed in <em>Melendez-Diaz\u2019s </em>wake, in particular the constitutional sufficiency of a witness being called to testify about the laboratory results reached by another.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In 2010, the Supreme Court of New Mexico twice examined this \u201csurrogate witness\u201d problem. In <em>State v. Bullcoming, </em>147 <em>N.M. </em>487, 226 P.3d 1, 6 (2010), the Court considered the admission of testimony from one state analyst as to the results of a gas chromatography examination performed by another analyst, who was on unpaid leave. Because, in the court\u2019s view, the examination involved no \u201cindependent judgment\u201d or \u201cparticular methodology,\u201d and just warranted the operator to transcribe the results from the gas chromatograph machine, it determined that any qualified analyst could testify as to its results; in essence, the court determined that the analyst on leave \u201cwas a mere scrivener, and [defendant's true \u2018accuser\u2019 was the gas chromatograph machine which detected the presence of alcohol in [defendant's blood, assessed [defendant's BAC, and generated a computer print-out listing its results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. As a result, the court concluded that the witness could provide the machine\u2019s results because the information itself is not subject \u201cto the constraints of the Confrontation Clause\u201d and is something that experts in the field reasonably rely upon. <em>Id. </em>at 10. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari to review that determination, <em>Bullcoming v. New Mexico, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>62, 177 L.Ed.2d 1152 (2010), but has not yet ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">On the same day it decided <em>Bullcoming, </em>the Supreme Court of New Mexico found a violation of the Confrontation Clause in a slightly different circumstance in <em>State v. Aragon, </em>147 <em>N.M. </em>474, 225 P.3d 1280 (2010). The facts in <em>Aragon </em>reveal that police executed a search warrant and seized two clear plastic bags containing whitish, crystal substances. <em>Id. </em>at 1282. At trial, the prosecution called Eric Young, a chemist, who analyzed one bag, to testify not only about the contents of that bag but also the contents of the second bag, which was examined by another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>chemist, Andrea Champagne. <em>Ibid. </em>Over objection, the trial court admitted Champagne\u2019s report into evidence and allowed Young to testify about Champagne\u2019s findings. <em>Id. </em>at 1282-83. Relying on <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the court held that Champagne\u2019s report was testimonial, and its admission without Champagne\u2019s testimony would \u201copen[ ] wide the door to avoidance of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (quoting <em>Palmer v. Hoffman, </em>318 <em>U.S. </em>109, 114, 63 <em>S.Ct. </em>477, 481, 87 <em>L.Ed. </em>645, 650 (1943)). The <em>Aragon </em>Court also determined that Young\u2019s testimony about Champagne\u2019s findings was barred by the Confrontation Clause, holding that \u201c[ejxperts and their opinions are not fungible when the testifying expert has not formed an independent conclusion from the underlying facts or data, but merely restates the hearsay opinion of a non-testifying expert.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Our courts have yet to consider this surrogate-witness problem. After careful consideration, we have no hesitation in agreeing with <em>Aragon </em>that experts and their opinions are not fungible; to hold otherwise would make a mockery of the Confrontation Clause. We thus agree with the argument that the Confrontation Clause is not satisfied by calling just anyone to the stand to testify about laboratory tests or other scientific results. A \u201cstraw man\u201d will not do. The State must provide a witness who has made an independent determination as to the results offered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The right of cross-examination must be meaningful and is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>satisfied when the State calls a witness whose knowledge is limited to the four corners of the laboratory certification produced and executed by another.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Here, the State called Maxwell to prove defendant\u2019s BAC. Although Mitchell, and not Maxwell, operated the gas chromatograph in examining defendant\u2019s blood sample, Maxwell testified that he supervised the test. He claimed he had personal knowledge of the equipment and the manner in which the tests were performed and that he drew his own conclusions from the information provided by the gas chromatograph. Indeed, Maxwell executed the laboratory certification, thereby swearing that it \u201cfairly and accurately documents the type and results of the analysis performed,\u201d that he is \u201cthe person responsible for the analysis and the conclusions set forth in the\u201d report, that \u201cthe equipment used to perform the ... analysis ... was functioning properly,\u201d and that the \u201ctest procedures used are accurate, reliable, objective in nature, and performed on a routine basis within the laboratory.\u201d In addition, Maxwell testified that he observed Mitchell conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the tests and was with him \u201cevery step of the way\u201d as if he performed the tests himself because Mitchell was being retrained and, consequently, was not allowed to test the samples by himself. The records simultaneously created during the testing supported Maxwell\u2019s assertions; Mitchell\u2019s initials appear next to the word \u201coperator,\u201d and Maxwell\u2019s initials appear in the lower right hand corner of each page, memorializing that he observed \u201cthe physical movement of the sample into the vial.\u201d These records further demonstrate that the testing was a joint effort. Because he was the author of the laboratory certificate and because he supervised another\u2019s operation of the gas chromatograph, Maxwell was the appropriate person to be called to testify about the results of the testing of defendant\u2019s blood sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We lastly conclude that the State was not required to produce Mitchell in addition to Maxwell to satisfy defendant\u2019s confrontation rights. \u201c[I]t is not the case, that anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing ... authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing device, must appear in person as part of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra, </em>557 <em>U.S. </em>at -- n. 1, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2532 n. 1, 174 L.Ed.2d at 322 n. 1. Maxwell was able to thoroughly respond to all questions posed about the testing and the meaning and significance of the results obtained. The State was not obligated to call Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">For all these reasons, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the Confrontation Clause was violated in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-11\"> <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>400, 406, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1065, 1069, 13 L.Ed.2d 923, 927-28 (1965). In light of the disposition of this appeal, we need not consider whether our state constitution\u2019s Confrontation Clause, <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, \u00b6 10, should be interpreted more expansively than its federal counterpart.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-14\"> Specifically, the Court considered a Massachusetts statute that permitted the admission of \u201ccertificates of analysis\u201d as \u201cprima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight of the narcotic analyzed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2531, 174 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 320 (quoting <em>Mass.

The Court\u2019s consideration of that notion, however, was rendered in the context of determining the admissibility of the results of the Alcotest, which, \"reports a present, and not a past, piece of information or data\u201d in the circumstance where \"nothing that the operator does can influence the machine\u2019s evaluation of the information or its report of the data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 943 A.2d 114. The record here does not permit a determination as to whether a similar conclusion may be reached about the gas chromatograph and its operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
