We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">These consolidated appeals concern defendant\u2019s conviction by a jury in Camden County for attacking N.D. with a tire iron and attempting to sexually assault her, and his later guilty plea to first-degree attempted kidnapping of R.W. for the intended purpose of sexually assaulting her. Defendant gave a lengthy confession concerning both incidents, as well as several crimes he committed in Burlington County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His motion to suppress the confession was denied following a Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> hearing. The judge then severed the two cases for trial, and the N.D. trial was held first.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">At that trial, N.D. testified that as she was walking home at about 4:30 a.m. on March 29, 2003, she encountered a man who, without warning, began hitting her over the head with a tire iron. He also broke one of her hands as she was trying to ward off the blows to her head. As she lay on the ground, injured, the assailant pulled her legs straight, straddled her body, unbuttoned his pants and attempted to remove her pants. During the assault, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>she had a clear view of the assailant\u2019s face as he was sitting on her legs facing her. N.D. was able to escape after the attacker put down the tire iron and she grabbed it and started swinging it at him. N.D. initially told the police that the attacker had blonde hair. At the trial, N.D. identified defendant as the attacker, although he had dark hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">After defendant\u2019s confession was redacted with the agreement of both counsel, to remove irrelevant or prejudicial material, the confession was presented to the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his confession, defendant described in detail how he chose his victim, came up behind her, and repeatedly hit her with the tire iron. He admitted that he attempted to rape her, but gave up after she resisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The State also presented evidence concerning the tire iron, which the police found after defendant told them its location during his confession. Expert testimony confirmed that blood found on the tire iron matched a DNA sample taken from N.D. Although the expert could not say with absolute certainty that the DNA on the tire iron was from N.D., he testified to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, in the legal sense, that it was a \u201cmatch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">After he was convicted and sentenced in the N.D. case, defendant pled guilty to the attempted kidnapping of R.W., reserving his right to appeal from the denial of the <em>Miranda </em>motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">On this appeal, defendant raises the following points for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>POINT I: SINCE THE STATE FAILED TO SATISFY ITS BURDEN OF DEMONSTRATING THAT DEFENDANT\u2019S CONFESSION WAS VOLUNTARY, ADMISSION OF THIS STATEMENT INTO EVIDENCE VIOLATED DEFENDANT\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">POINT II: THE REDACTION OF THE TRANSCRIPT OF DEFENDANT\u2019S STATEMENT VIOLATED DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL BY ELIMINATING REFERENCES RELEVANT TO DEFENDANT\u2019S ABILITY TO FORM THE REQUISITE INTENT. (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">POINT III: THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW AS GUARANTEED BY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND <em>N.J. CONST., </em>ART. I, 1\u00cd. 1 WAS VIOLATED BY THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S ERRONEOUS, INAPPROPRIATE AND PREJUDICIAL INSTRUCTION TO THE JURORS ON THE LAW OF ATTEMPTED AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT. (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">POINT IV: THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN PERMITTING THE STATE\u2019S EXPERT TO TESTIFY CONCERNING THE RESULTS OF THE STR METHOD OF DNA TESTING. (Partially Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">POINT V: DEFENDANT\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS AND A FAIR TRIAL WERE DENIED BY THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S MISCONDUCT IN MAKING IMPROPER SUMMATION COMMENTS. (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">For the reasons that follow, we are satisfied that none of these arguments provide a basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">We first consider the arguments defendant raises in Point III: that the judge should not have instructed the jurors on the law of attempt before instructing them on the substantive crime of aggravated sexual assault, and that the judge gave an incorrect instruction on attempt. We consider these arguments under the plain error rule, which requires defendant to establish that, considered in the context of the entire charge and the evidence presented at trial, the error had \u201ca clear capacity to produce an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>see R. </em>1:7-2. \u201cThe standard for assessing the soundness of a jury instruction is \u2018how and in what sense, under the evidence before them, and the circumstances of the trial, would ordinary ... jurors understand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>instructions as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Savage, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>374, 387, 799 A.2d 477 (2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">Plain error in the context of a jury charge is \u201c[Ilegal impropriety in the charge prejudicially affecting the substantial rights of the defendant sufficiently grievous to justify notice by the reviewing court and to convince the court that of itself the error possessed a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result.\u201d The charge must be read as a whole in determining whether there was any error. Even so, if the error is in a jury instruction that is \u201ccrucial to the jury\u2019s deliberations on the guilt of a criminal defendant^]\u201d it is a \u201c \u2018poor candidatet ] for rehabilitation\u2019 under the plain error theory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\"><em>[State v. Torres, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>554, 564, 874 A.2d 1084 (2005) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">We find no error, plain or otherwise, in the judge\u2019s decision to explain to the jury the law of attempt, before explaining the elements of the substantive crime of aggravated sexual assault. With respect to the sexual assault on N.D., defendant was only charged with attempt, and therefore it made logical sense to explain the law of attempt first. Defendant cites no case law to support his argument concerning the organizational structure of the charge, and we find nothing in the order of the charge that would have confused the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Defendant next contends, and the State essentially concedes, that in addition to giving the jury the correct charge on attempt, the judge also included instructions on types of attempt that did not apply to this case. We begin by considering the statutory definition of the three types of criminal attempt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">(1) Purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as a reasonable person would believe them to be;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">(2) When causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing such result without further conduct on his part; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">(3) Purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as a reasonable person would believe them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-13\">b. ... Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under subsection a. (3) of this section unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAx\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-la to -lb.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Type a(l) concerns a completed crime which fails of its purpose because the facts are not as defendant believes them to be. <em>See State v. Condon, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>609, 616, 919 A.2d 178 (App.Div.) (citing as an example, performing an illegal abortion on a woman who turns out not to be pregnant), <em>certif. denied, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>74, 926 A.2d 857 (2007). Type a(2) involves a situation \u201c \u2018where the criminal act is very nearly complete and requires one more step either beyond the actor\u2019s control or not requiring his control for completion.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615-16, 919 A.2d 178 (quoting Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 2 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1 (2006)). Type a(3) requires that the actor, with intent to commit the crime, takes a substantial step toward its commission. <em>Id. </em>at 616, 919 A.2d 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Here, the applicable type of attempt was the \u201csubstantial step\u201d described in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:5-la(3) and -lb. However, in addition to instructing the jury about that type of attempt, the judge mistakenly included instructions concerning the two other types of attempt. Primarily relying on <em>Condon, </em>defendant argues that this error requires reversal, because we cannot be sure of the theory on which the jury convicted him. That was the result in <em>Condon, </em>where we reversed defendant\u2019s conviction based on an erroneous charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\"><em>Condon </em>involved an internet sting operation, in which the defendant made internet contact with a fictional thirteen-year-old girl and arranged to meet for the purposes of having sex with her. <em>Condon, supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 612-13, 919 A.2d 178. When he arrived at the meeting place, he was arrested. <em>Id. </em>at 613, 919 A.2d 178. He was convicted of attempted sexual assault, after the trial court charged the jury as to types a(l) and a(3). <em>Id. </em>at 613-14, 919 A.2d 178. In reversing, we reasoned that if a defendant completes an \u201cimpossible\u201d crime, he may be charged under both a(l) and a(3), because he necessarily has taken a substantial step. <em>Id. </em>at 617, 919 A.2d 178. However, if he only takes a substantial step, but does not complete the intended crime, he can only be charged under a(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>In order to complete a criminal act under subsection a(l), a defendant would have to have taken a substantial step toward the commission of the crime under subsection a(3). Accordingly, under subsection a(l), where a defendant \u201cpurposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as a reasonable person would believe them to be,\u201d we are satisfied that he or she could also be charged under subsection a(3). However, the same is not true when the defendant fails to complete the criminal act under subsection a(l). In that case, if the defendant has taken a substantial step toward the commission of a crime, he or she may only be charged under subsection a(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">Here, defendant did not complete the criminal act, nor under the circumstances, could he have done so. Accordingly, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-la(l) was not applicable. Under these facts, only subsection a(3) should have been charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Under the facts presented in that case, we found that the charging error was prejudicial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">Because the jury was instructed that it could convict defendant under either subsection a(l) or a(3), we are constrained to reverse. We cannot determine whether the jury convicted defendant solely under the impossibility theory a(l), and but for unknown reasons, would have acquitted him under subsection a(3); or whether they convicted him solely under the substantial step in the course of conduct theory under subsection a(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 617-18, 919 A.2d 178 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">As in <em>Condon, </em>we agree that the judge committed a charging error. But, we reach a different conclusion as to the consequence of the error. Unlike <em>Condon, </em>in which the theory of defendant\u2019s guilt may have presented some complexity to a lay jury, this case presented no complexity whatsoever. N.D. testified that, without provocation, defendant hit her with a tire iron multiple times, inflicting serious injuries and knocking her to the ground. He then pulled her legs straight, straddled her legs, unbuttoned his pants, and started trying to remove her pants. He only stopped after she grabbed the tire iron and began swinging it at him. Defendant confessed that he intended to rape N.D., attempted to rape her, and attacked her with the tire iron in furtherance of that attempt. Given this evidence, a conviction for attempted aggravated sexual assault, based on taking a substantial step toward that result, was virtually inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Moreover, despite his initial mistake in adding inapplicable definitions of attempt, the judge clearly explained to the jurors how the instructions he was giving them related to the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>presented. Additionally, the parties did not present conflicting theories on the attempt issue, such that an error in that portion of the charge would likely prove prejudicial. <em>Cf. State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>2,16-17, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990). Taken in context, there is no realistic likelihood that the jury would have focused on the clearly inapplicable theories of impossibility or a missing step beyond defendant\u2019s control. We will not speculate that \u201cfor unknown reasons\u201d the jury might have convicted defendant on either a(l) or a(2) when they \u201cwould have acquitted him\u201d under a(3). <em>Cf. Condon, supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 618, 919 A.2d 178.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given the overwhelming evidence in this record, there is no chance that any jury \u201cwould have acquitted\u201d this defendant under a(3). <em>Ibid.; see State v. Wilder, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>398, 415-18, 939 A.2d 781 (2008) (overruling <em>State v. Christener, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>55, 362 A.2d 1153 (1976), and cautioning against overturning jury verdicts based on speculation about the jury\u2019s reasoning, where substantial evidence supports the conviction).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We find no likelihood that the errors in the charge led the jury to convict defendant when they might otherwise have acquitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>him and, therefore, no basis to conclude that the error in the charge had \u201cthe clear capacity to produce an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>see State v. Macon, 57 N.J. </em>325, 335-37, 273 A.2d 1 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">[At the direction of the court, Parts III B, C, D and E, which are not deemed to warrant publication, <em>see R. </em>1:36\u20142(d), are omitted from the published version.]</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\"> In a companion appeal, we affirmed defendant's convictions for attacking women in Burlington County. <em>State v.

There was no objection to this procedure. The juiy was shown the redacted DVD, and was given the redacted transcript to use as an aid while watching the DVD. During a pre-trial <em>Driver </em>hearing, all counsel had agreed to certain corrections to the transcript. <em>See State v. Driver, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>255, 287-88, 183 A.2d 655 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b327-12\"> The fifteen-year sentence for the attempted kidnapping of R.W. was imposed concurrent to the nine-year sentence for the attack on N.D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\"> There was no indication of jury confusion.

That approach might no longer be legally correct, in light of <em>Wilder, </em>which was decided a year after <em>Condon. Wilder </em>dealt with \"overcharging,\" where the jury is improperly charged as to a more serious crime which is not supported by the trial evidence, but only convicts the defendant of a lesser included offense. <em>Wilder, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 939 A.2d 781. <em>Wilder </em>rejected the previously-accepted rationale that the overcharging is prejudicial error because the jury might have compromised on convicting defendant of the lesser offense when it might otherwise have returned an acquittal. <em>Id. </em>at 413, 415-18, 939 A.2d 781. In that context, the Court warned that we should not speculate about the jury\u2019s thought processes, but should instead focus on whether there was enough evidence to convict on the lesser included offense. <em>Id. </em>at 416-17, 939 A.2d 781. We need not reach a conclusion here as to whether the \"unknown jury reason\u201d aspect of <em>Condon </em>remains good law, because in this case the charging error was so clearly harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
