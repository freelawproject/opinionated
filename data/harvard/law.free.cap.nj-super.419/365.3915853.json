Kentucky, </em>559 <em>U.S. </em>-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), and <em>State v. Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>129, 975 A.2d 418 (2009), should apply to this noncitizen defendant\u2019s argument, raised for the first time in his post-conviction relief (PCR) petition, that his attorney failed to discuss with him the deportation consequences of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">On June 27, 2005, defendant pled guilty to third-degree distribution of a controlled dangerous substance within 1000 feet of a school, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7, and, on October 7, 2005, was sentenced to a five-year probationary term. Defendant did not file a direct appeal. Instead, on May 28, 2008, defendant filed a PCR petition claiming the ineffectiveness of his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">The PCR judge denied defendant\u2019s petition, and he appealed, raising the following issues for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-17\">I. THE COURT ERRED BY NOT ALLOWING ORAL ARGUMENT WHEREIN THE PETITIONER COULD HAVE MORE FULLY EXPLAINED THE PRIMA FACIE CASE OF INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>II. IT WAS ERROR NOT TO ALLOW THE DEFENDANT AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING OR GRANT HIS APPLICATION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">A. THE PETITIONER SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO WITHDRAW HIS PLEA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">III. PETITIONER WAS DENIED EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">A. TRIAL COUNSEL FAILED TO ADVISE THE PETITIONER OF THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF HIS PLEA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">IV. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY FAILING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER DEFENDANT UNDERSTOOD THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS PLEA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">We agree defendant was erroneously denied an evidentiary hearing concerning whether he received the effective assistance of counsel regarding the deportation consequences of his guilty plea and remand for that purpose.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">The PCR judge denied relief based on defendant\u2019s affirmative response to the plea form\u2019s Question 17, which inquired whether he understood \u201cthat if you are not a United States citizen or national, you may be deported by virtue of your plea of guilty.\u201d The judge also relied on the colloquy at the plea hearing, concluding that defendant\u2019s statements at that time demonstrated he \u201centered into [the plea] agreement with full knowledge that there could be collateral immigration consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">A few months after the PCR judge rendered his decision, our Supreme Court decided <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z, </em>which not only rejected application of the traditional direct/collateral methodology<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>context, but also determined that a simple \u201cyes\u201d answer to Question 17 was not conclusive in determining whether an attorney was effective, 200 <em>N.J. </em>at 141-42, 975 A.2d 418, and, in fact, concluded Question 17 required further \u201crefinement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 144, 975 A.2d 418. As a result, the PCR judge\u2019s considerable reliance on defendant\u2019s affirmative response to Question 17 was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">As mentioned, the PCR judge also relied on the following colloquy during defendant\u2019s plea hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">Q. You have no difficulty reading or writing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">Q. Did you then with your attorney read and discuss the four pages that make up the plea agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">Q. Did you read, understand, truthfully answer all questions on each page?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">Q. Were those answers circled as you gave them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-16\">Q. When each page had been filled in, completed, did you understand what it said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-19\">Q. Did you put your initials at the bottom of pages 1 and 2?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-20\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-21\">Q. Sign your name to page 3 and 4?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-22\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-23\">Q. Did you do that voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-24\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-25\">At first blush, this testimony may seem inconsistent with defendant\u2019s certification in support of post-conviction relief; however, closer examination of the latter suggests otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>5. In discussing the plea form with me[J [my attorney] asked me \u201cAre you a citizen\u201d to which I replied \u201cNo, I\u2019m a [l]awful [p]ermanent [resident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">6. [My attorney] did not discuss with me the possible implications of a guilty plea on my immigration status. Specifically, he did not advise me that I might become subject to removal as a result of a guilty plea to the offer made by the Office of the Prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">7. I had no personal knowledge that a guilty plea might result in the initiation of removal proceedings against me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Defendant\u2019s testimony during the plea hearing and the PCR certification are not incompatible. The words \u201cdeportation,\u201d \u201cremoval\u201d or \u201ccitizen\u201d were never uttered at the plea hearing. The closest the judge came to inquiring about the potential for deportation or about any such discussions between defendant and his attorney was when he asked defendant whether his attorney discussed the four pages of the plea form. Defendant does not deny in his PCR certification that his attorney asked whether he was a citizen, but when defendant said he was a legal permanent resident, defendant claims there was no discussion about the deportation possibilities. The sworn statements given at both the plea hearing and in the PCR certification are not inconsistent and the PCR judge was mistaken in holding otherwise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Because neither defendant\u2019s response to Question 17 nor his testimony at the plea hearing are inconsistent with his contentions in the PCR certification\u2014the two bases upon which post-conviction relief was denied\u2014we conclude that defendant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing as to the content and scope of his attorney\u2019s advice, if any, regarding his potential removal from the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The only potential obstacle to a remand for an evidentiary hearing is the State\u2019s argument that <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z </em>and <em>Padilla </em>should not be applied here. This argument is convoluted by the fact that these recent decisions contain or presuppose multiple principles, some of which are undoubtedly new and some of which are not. In any given case, whether or to what extent those principles may be given retroactive effect turns on the nature of the ineffectiveness argument, that is, whether the attorney gave incorrect advice, no advice, or only forecasted the possibility or probability of deportation. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that what is relevant about these recent decisions is not new and what is new about them is not relevant to the matter at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The State concedes that insofar as <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z </em>determined that the rendering of incorrect advice meets the first prong of the test for ineffectiveness,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it does not constitute a new rule, citing, among others, <em>State v. Garcia, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>332, 339, 727 A.2d 97 (App.Div.1999). While the State\u2019s contention in this regard is certainly true, it is not relevant since defendant does not contend he received bad advice, only that he received no advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">We discern from its arguments that the State views the rendering of no advice as requiring a different approach from that taken when a defendant contends an attorney rendered bad advice. We reject this contention for the same reasons enunciated by Justice Stevens for the Court in <em>Padilla:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVN\">fa] holding limited to affirmative misadvice would invite two absurd results. First, it would give counsel an incentive to remain silent on matters of great importance, even when answers are readily available. Silence under these circumstances would be fundamentally at odds with the critical obligation of counsel to advise the client of \u201cthe advantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement.\u201d <em>Libretti v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>States, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>29, 50-51, 116 <em>S.Ct </em>356 [368] 133 L.Ed.2d 271 [290] (1995). When attorneys know that their clients face possible exile from this country and separation from their families, they should not be encouraged to say nothing at all. Second, it would deny a class of clients least able to represent themselves the most rudimentary advice on deportation even when it is readily available. It is quintessentially the duly of counsel to provide her client with available advice about an issue like deportation and the failure to do so \u201cclearly satisfies the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>52, 62, 106 <em>S.Ct </em>366 [372], 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>203 [212] (1985) (White, J., concurring in judgment).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\"><em>[Padilla, supra, </em>659 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1484, 176 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 296-97.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The State\u2019s argument that the \u201cno advice\u201d scenario, found sufficient to meet the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test in <em>Padilla, </em>is a new rule that should be applied only prospectively is without merit. In fact, the <em>Padilla </em>Court relied upon \u201cthe weight of prevailing professional norms\u201d in so holding, citing authorities that preexisted defendant\u2019s guilty plea in this case. <em>Id. </em>at -, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1482-83, 176 L.Ed.2d at 294-95. Its holding that no advice is the equivalent of misadvice is not new. Thus, an attorney\u2019s rendering of bad advice or the failure to give any advice regarding deportation satisfied the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test at the time defendant pled guilty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">In this same vein, it also appears the State views <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z\u2019s </em>rejection of the direct/collateral methodology as a new rule that ought not be applied retroactively.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That argument may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>be accurate as a matter of state constitutional law, but the <em>Padilla </em>Court recognized that it had \u201cnever applied a distinction between direct and collateral consequences to define the scope of constitutionally \u2018reasonable professional assistance\u2019 required under <em>Strickland. </em>...\u201d 559 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1481, 176 <em>L.Ed.2</em>d at 293. Rather than create a new rule, the Court held that existing federal law compelled its rejection of Kentucky\u2019s direct/collateral approach. As a result, our Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the direct/collateral methodology in this context in Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z\u2014 whether or not that constitutes a new rule for purposes of state constitutional law\u2014has no direct impact here; when being advised to plead guilty, defendant was entitled to the benefits of federal constitutional law, which has never recognized the direct/collateral methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">To be sure, <em>Padilla </em>announces a new rule, which, in the Court\u2019s words, \u201cnow\u201d requires that counsel inform the noncitizen client \u201cwhether his plea carries a risk of deportation.\u201d 559 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1486, 176 L.Ed.2d at 299. Defendant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim here, however, is not based on his attorney\u2019s failure to advise whether deportation would occur but only on the attorney\u2019s alleged failure to give any advice. We, thus, need not presently determine whether or to what extent the new aspect of <em>Padilla </em>might apply here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">To summarize, what may arguably be viewed as \u201cnew\u201d in Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z\u2014the rejection of the direct/collateral methodology\u2014is not a new federal concept. And what may be viewed as \u201cnew\u201d in Padilla\u2014that counsel must now \u201cinform [the] client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation,\u201d 559 <em>U.S. </em>at -, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1486, 176 L.Ed.2d at 299\u2014is not relevant here, or at least not until the facts are further illuminated at the evidentiary hearing required.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Lastly, we would note that even were we to agree with the State that the standard required of defense counsel in this case necessarily relies on the new aspects of the recently-decided cases of <em>Padilla </em>or <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z, </em>or both, we do not agree they should not be applied here. Our Supreme Court has traditionally applied new. rules of criminal practice and procedure at least to cases in the pipeline existing at the time. <em>See, e.g., State v. Natale, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>458, 494, 878 A.2d 724 (2005); <em>Bellamy, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 142-43, 835 A.2d 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Here, defendant\u2019s PCR petition was denied on March 20, 2009. <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z </em>was decided on July 27, 2009, and defendant filed an appeal from the denial of his PCR petition on August 28, 2009; although defendant\u2019s appeal was not literally \u201cin the pipeline\u201d at the moment <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z </em>was decided, the fact that <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z </em>was decided shortly after the aggrieving order and before the filing of a notice of appeal\u2014the timeliness of which has not been challenged\u2014suggests the fairness of including defendant\u2019s appeal as entitled to the benefit of <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z. </em>Moreover, defendant\u2019s appeal was certainly in the pipeline when <em>Padilla </em>was decided on March 31,2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">It bears further observation that in unpublished decisions since <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z, </em>we have remanded similar matters to the trial courts for reconsideration of defendant\u2019s ineffectiveness arguments in light of <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z. </em>And, by remanding a matter to this court to reconsider an ineffectiveness argument in light of its decision in <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z, see State v. McIntyre, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>365, 981 A.2d 1277 (2009),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Court implicitly concluded that <em>N\u00fa\u00f1ez</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>Valdez </em>should at least apply to cases pending in our appellate courts at the time of decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-13\"> Defendant also argued in the trial court that his counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue the alleged fact that defendant was not informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights when arrested and for allegedly failing to sufficiently investigate defendant\u2019s claim of innocence. Those arguments have not been pursued in this court and are, therefore, waived. <em>State v. Robinson, 200 N.J. </em>1, 20, 974 A.2d 1057 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-14\"> In <em>State v. Bellamy, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>127, 137, 835 A.2d 1231 (2003), the Court explained the direct/collateral methodology in the following way: \"Traditionally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the determination of whether defendant must be informed of certain consequences of his plea turns on whether those consequences are 'direct or penal,' in which case defendant must be informed, or 'collateral,' in which case defendant need not be informed.\" The Court rejected that approach as having no relevance in determining the effectiveness of an attorney who failed to advise a defendant pleading to a sex offense of the possibility of involuntary civil commitment. <em>Id. </em>at 138-39, 835 A.2d 1231.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b398-9\"> Moreover, even if the plea testimony and the PCR certification were in conflict, the PCR judge could not find the former more credible than the latter absent an evidentiary hearing because he did not have the opportunity to see and hear defendant testify on any occasion. This is not to suggest, however, that a judge, who presided over the earlier phase, may not consider his or her view of a defendant\u2019s credibility in ruling on a PCR petition. But, when a PCR judge, as here, has not had the opportunity to see and hear the defendant testify, the PCR judge may not assign greater credibility to one written sworn statement over another.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\"><em> Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 519 A.2d 336 (1987). <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z s </em>holding is actually limited to determining what is required by <em>Fritz, </em>since the Court \"elect[ed] to decide this case under our state constitution.\u201d 200 <em>N.J. </em>at 139, 975 A.2d 418. As will be seen, <em>Strickland </em>imposes more extensive obligations on an attorney representing a noncitizen than does <em>Fritz.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\"> Such an allegation would also likely satisfy the first prong of the test at the time defendant pled guilly insofar as New Jersey law is concerned. The plea form used here contained Question 17, which was undoubtedly intended to engender a discussion between counsel and the accused about deportation. That question, in one form or another, has been used by our courts since 1988, as a response to Chief Justice Wilentz\u2019s dissent in <em>State v. Heitzman, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>603, 606-08, 527 A.2d 439 (1987), thus establishing a professional norm existing at the time defendant discussed the plea agreement with his attorney. <em>See AOC Administrative Directive </em># 1-1988 (Jan. 15, 1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b400-11\"> Certainly, in deciding <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z, </em>the Court for the first time jettisoned the direct/collateral methodology in deportation circumstances. Whether that aspect of <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z </em>should be viewed as a new rule or not\u2014a matter we need not decide\u2014certainly the direct/collateral methodology's demise was foreshadowed years earlier by the Court. <em>See Bellamy, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 138-39, 835 A.2d 1231 (deeming the direct/collateral methodology unhelpful in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>whether an individual pleading guilty to a sex crime should be advised of the possibilities of involuntary civil commitment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b401-13\"> Of course, such a determination may have to be made if, at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing required by today\u2019s judgment, the PCR judge determines that the attorney gave advice but only opined on the possibility of deportation rather than provide a firm opinion of the risk of deportation now required by <em>Padilla.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b402-9\"> McIntyre was sentenced in 2002 and had nearly completed his prison term when, in 2005, he filed a PCR petition, which was denied. We affirmed by way of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>an unpublished opinion. <em>See State v. McIntyre, </em>No. A-1280-07, 2008 <em>WL </em>5101244 (App.Div. Dec. 5, 2008). After the Supreme Court remanded, 200 <em>N.J. </em>365, 981 A.2d 1277, we considered the impact of <em>Nu\u00f1ez-Vald\u00e9z </em>and again affirmed because McIntyre\u2019s attorney had discussed the deportation consequences and had urged McIntyre to seek the advice of an immigration attorney. <em>See State v.
