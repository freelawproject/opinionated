Plaintiff, who purchased the supplement, principally alleges that the defendant sellers violated the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -184 (\u201cCFA\u201d), and the common law, by making false and exaggerated representations about the product\u2019s efficacy, which were allegedly lacking in scientific or objective support. The trial court granted defendants\u2019 pre-answer motion to dismiss plaintiffs lawsuit on two independent grounds: (1) plaintiff is precluded from suing defendants in New Jersey because of a forum selection clause contained within a disclaimer on defendants\u2019 internet website; and (2) the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because (a) it does not sufficiently allege that plaintiff sustained an \u201cascertainable loss of moneys or property\u201d under the CFA, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19, and (b) it does not sufficiently allege the elements of common-law fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We reverse the determinations of the trial court on these two discrete issues and remand for further proceedings. In particular, we hold that, subject to the potential development of additional facts on remand that might affect the jurisdictional analysis, the clause is presumptively unenforceable. We do so because defendants\u2019 website was evidently structured in an unfair manner so that the clause would not appear on a purchaser\u2019s computer screen unless he or she scrolled down to display the \u201csubmerged\u201d clause before adding the product to his or her electronic \u201cshopping cart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">In addition, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to state a cause of action. We do so because the complaint, when viewed under the generous construction that we must give to pleadings under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e), sufficiently alleges the CFA element of \u201cascertainable loss.\u201d The complaint also sufficiently alleges the elements of common-law fraud. The complaint therefore must be reinstated, subject to potential dis-positive motion practice after discovery is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Although it is not fully developed, the record presents the following circumstances and sequence of events relevant to the two key issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Plaintiff, Harold M. Hoffman, is an attorney and a resident of New Jersey. At various times in the past, plaintiff has brought lawsuits, in his own name and on behalf of other putative class members, against companies that sell and advertise products in a deceptive manner allegedly in violation of the CFA and other laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Defendants, Supplements Togo Management, LLC (\u201cSTM\u201d), and World Class Nutrition, LLC (\u201cWCN\u201d), have advertised and sold products on the internet on commercial websites<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> named \u201cwww.supplementstogo.com\u201d and \u201cwww.worldclassnutrition.com.\u201d According to a public record in plaintiffs appendix, STM is an Arizona corporation, with its place of business and registered agent in Scottsdale.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">As shown in plaintiffs appendix, defendants\u2019 website states that another company related to defendants, known as \u201cSTG Supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>ments,\u201d was started in Cincinnati in the early 1980s by a weightlifting enthusiast. According to that advertisement, STG Supplements has been in the industry \u201cover 25 years\u201d and the company has \u201ca name you can trust for results.\u201d The products offered include protein supplements, weight loss products, and energy-boosting drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">One of the products advertised and sold on defendants\u2019 website is a dietary supplement known as \u201cErection MD.\u201d The product is sold in bottles of sixty pills, at a price of $59.99 per bottle. Defendants\u2019 records reflect sales of Erection MD to at least three New Jersey customers, including plaintiff. The website describes Erection MD as \u201ca proprietary blend,\u201d consisting of various listed ingredients that defendants contend are \u201ccommonly found in diet pills and energy drinks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">According to an April 1, 2010 post-suit letter from defendants\u2019 counsel to plaintiff, the ads for Erection MD describe the product\u2019s benefits, in somewhat ungrammatical language, as follows: \u201cEnhances Sex Drive, Maximum Performance, Instantly Boost Testosterone Levels, Rapid Blood Flow, Ultimate Stamina, Higher Volume of Ejaculate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Defendants contend, however, that their website advertising also included the following disclaimer<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">The information on this -website reflects the opinion of our staff and manufacturers and should not be interpreted as medical advice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">The descriptions and statements accompanying these products and vitamin supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA. These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. They are for use by healthy adults only. Consult your physician before beginning any bodybuilding or fitness program. Keep all products out of the reach of children. <em>By placing your order with STG Investors, LLC</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> you are agreeing that any and all litigation will take place </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>in the state of Nevada.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Plaintiff alleges that defendants portrayed Erection MD in their ads as \u201cthe most advanced sexual enhancement product.\u201d On the other hand, defendants\u2019 counsel asserted in his April 1, 2010 letter to plaintiff that the ads specifically cautioned purchasers that \u201cresults may vary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">After seeing the advertising, plaintiff bought a sixty-pill bottle of Erection MD over the internet on March 3, 2010, for the quoted price of $59.99, plus $6.99 for shipping. According to plaintiff, Erection MD was the first product displayed on defendants\u2019 website and it appeared near a box that could be clicked to \u201cADD TO SHOPPING CART.\u201d According to plaintiff, upon clicking that box, he was transferred to a checkout webpage. On that page, his credit card and shipping information were requested, both of which plaintiff provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The Erection MD pills ordered by plaintiff were delivered to him on March 11, 2010. Plaintiff does not contend that he ingested any of the pills. Four days after receiving the shipment of the product, plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit in the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">The complaint pleads five counts alleging violations of the CFA, along with one count of common-law fraud. In particular, plaintiff alleges that defendants\u2019 representations, in connection with the advertising and sale of Erection MD and its supposed efficacy, lack a \u201cvalid factual, clinical and/or scientific basis.\u201d According to the complaint, no such valid scientific evidence or clinical testing exists to substantiate defendants\u2019 promises and representations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Plaintiff alleges that he and the other members of the proposed class \u201csaw, read, and/or heard defendant[s\u2019] advertisements, promises and representations\u201d about Erection MD before purchasing the supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Plaintiff asserts that defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentations about Erection MD violate <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13.-45A-9.2, a regulation promulgated by the Division of Consumer Affairs. The regulation essentially requires an advertiser to substantiate with written proof any claim it makes concerning \u201cthe safety, performance, availability, efficiency, quality or price of the advertised merchandise,\u201d and to keep such written proof on file for at least ninety days after the effective date of the advertisement. <em>Id. </em>at - 9.2(a)(10). Plaintiff contends that defendants cannot possess such written substantiation, and that their failure to have it comprises a <em>per se </em>violation of the CFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Plaintiff further alleges that the defendants\u2019 unsubstantiated claims about Erection MD constitute deception, misrepresentation, unconscionable trade practices, and false promises. He claims that such conduct proximately caused damage to him and other purchasers of the product, because they \u201creceived something less than, and different from, what they reasonably expected in view of defendant^\u2019] representations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In his common-law fraud count, plaintiff similarly alleges that defendants \u201cdeliberately and knowingly\u201d engaged in false representations, upon which plaintiff and others justifiably relied, causing them damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">By way of remedy, plaintiff seeks for himself and the other class members compensatory and treble damages under the CFA, plus interest and counsel fees. On the common-law fraud count, plaintiff seeks compensatory relief, plus punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">In lieu of filing an answer to the complaint, defendants moved to dismiss it on two separate grounds. First, defendants argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>plaintiff cannot sue them in New Jersey because the forum selection clause in their website disclaimer only permits their dissatisfied customers to file suit against them in the state of Nevada. Second, defendants contended that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, because plaintiff cannot show that his purchase of Erection MD resulted in an \u201cascertainable loss\u201d or other damages to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Plaintiff opposed both aspects of the dismissal motion. He argued that the forum selection clause was unenforceable because it was essentially hidden within defendants\u2019 website and was not reasonably conspicuous to him and other consumers. Plaintiff asserted that he did not agree to be bound by defendants\u2019 forum limitation, and that, in the absence of such mutual assent, the provision is not binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">With respect to the issues of damages and ascertainable loss, plaintiff maintained that his complaint sufficed, at least at the pleadings stage, to allege such losses. He argued that it is thereby premature to dismiss the complaint under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) prior to discovery and the anticipated service of expert reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Upon considering the parties\u2019 motion papers and oral argument, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 application on both grounds and dismissed the complaint. In an oral opinion, the court found that New Jersey lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case because the forum selection clause was sufficiently prominent on defendants\u2019 website to be enforceable. The court perceived no fraud or overreaching by defendants with respect to the presentation of the clause. It concluded that plaintiff \u201cmade a conscious decision to order the product thereby manifesting both an agreement to purchase the product at the price offered and an acceptance of all relevant terms including that all litigation would be in Nevada.\u201d The court also rejected plaintiffs legal argument that a forum selection clause in an internet transaction is not enforceable unless the purchaser specifically clicks an \u201cI agree\u201d icon associat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ed with the clause. The opinion did not expressly address plaintiffs argument that the clause had been \u201csubmerged\u201d in the website in a manner that reduced the likelihood that it would be visible on a purchaser\u2019s computer screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The trial judge further agreed with defendants that the complaint did not adequately specify an ascertainable loss or other damage resulting from plaintiffs transaction. The judge ruled that plaintiffs claim of damage was \u201cspeculative and conjectural.\u201d Among other things, the judge noted that plaintiff had not claimed that he had used the product, nor had he demanded his money back. The judge found \u201cnothing in the complaint to show or even allege that the product was not worth that which [plaintiff] paid for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">As part of his analysis, the trial judge found significant that plaintiff is \u201can experienced attorney\u201d and a \u201crepeat litigator in the field of Consumer Fraud Act claims,\u201d citing the fact that plaintiff had filed several other CFA eases arising out of internet purchases. Given that background, the judge ruled that plaintiff \u201cis not an unsophisticated buyer who was victimized\u201d and he is \u201cnot the type of person that the Consumer Fraud Act was designed to protect.\u201d In this vein, the judge further observed that plaintiff is barred as a matter of law from serving simultaneously as a representative plaintiff in a class action and as counsel to the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The judge additionally found that plaintiffs claim of common-law fraud was insufficiently pled. The judge reiterated that plaintiff \u201ccannot prove that he suffered any damages as the result of his purchase of Erection MD.\u201d Furthermore, the judge found that the complaint \u201cfails to plead specific facts that if proven would show the defendants\u2019] representations were false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The trial court consequently entered an order on May 21, 2010, dismissing plaintiffs complaint in its entirety, with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Plaintiff now appeals. He first argues that the trial court erred in enforcing the forum selection clause, maintaining that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>record does not support any inference that he had reasonable notice of the clause or agreed to it. Second, plaintiff contests the court\u2019s finding that his complaint was deficient. Plaintiff further contends that the trial court\u2019s finding of the absence of provable damages was premature, representing that he is prepared to establish such losses through an expert that he has retained for this case. Lastly, plaintiff contends that his status as an attorney and his past experience as a class action plaintiff should not deprive him of standing to sue defendants. He asserts that the court\u2019s observations about his prospective dual role as a representative plaintiff and as class counsel are premature, since no motion for class certification had yet been filed, and that, in any event, there is no <em>per se </em>rule of law or ethics prohibiting him from undertaking such a dual role.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">We examine <em>de novo </em>the two primary questions of law posed here concerning: (1) the enforceability of defendants\u2019 forum selection clause, and (2) the legal sufficiency of plaintiffs complaint. <em>See Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Manalapan Twp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Consumers are increasingly purchasing products and services over the internet. As those internet transactions have become more prevalent, so too have legal disputes proliferated over the contractual rights created in cyberspace between buyers and sellers. The present case exemplifies such a modern-day dispute, raising the question of whether the presentation of the forum selection clause on defendants\u2019 website suffices, as a matter of law, to bind internet purchasers of defendants\u2019 merchandise. To resolve that issue in this contemporary setting, we consult basic and long-standing principles of law and jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>A court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a case if it is brought in an ineligible forum. <em>Peper v. Princeton Univ. Bd. of Trs., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>55, 65, 389 A.2d 465 (1978). In particular, a plaintiff cannot file suit in a court if he or she has entered into an enforceable agreement to bring such claims in another forum. <em>Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>585, 593-94, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1522, 1527, 113 L.Ed.2d 622, 632 (1991) (holding that the plaintiffs, cruise ship passengers who had sued the cruise line in the state of Washington, were bound by a forum selection provision in their written travel agreement requiring them to bring suit in Florida).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The question of whether or not a forum selection clause drafted by a seller is binding upon a purchaser turns upon fundamental precepts of contract law. A contract term is generally binding if the contract has been mutually agreed upon by the parties, is supported by valid consideration, and does not violate codified standards or offend public policy. <em>See W. Caldwell v. Caldwell, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>9, 24-26, 138 A.2d 402 (1958). For mutual assent to exist, there must have been a meeting of the minds of the parties. <em>See Pop\u2019s Cones, Inc. v. Resorts Int'l Hotel, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 467-68, 704 A.2d 1321 (App.Div.1998). This signifies that each party to the contract must have been fairly informed of the contract\u2019s terms before entering into the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">At times, for reasons of convenience, cost, or other business advantage, a seller may choose to designate within a sales contract an exclusive forum where any disputes arising out of the transaction are to be litigated. The courts of our State have generally enforced such forum selection clauses, where: (1) they are not the product of fraud or undue bargaining power, (2) they would not violate public policy, and (3) their enforcement would not seriously inconvenience the parties at trial. <em>Caspi v. Microsoft Network, L.L.C., </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>118, 122, 732 A.2d 528 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>199, 743 A.2d 851 (1999); <em>Wilfred MacDonald, Inc. v. Cushman, Inc., </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>58, 63-64, 606 A.2d 407 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>17, 611 A.2d 655 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>In applying these standards of enforceability, a critical consideration is whether or not the plaintiff was provided with fair notice of the forum selection clause. \u201cIf a forum selection clause is clear in its purport and has been presented to the party to be bound in a <em>fair and forthright </em>fashion, no consumer fraud policies or principles have been violated.\u201d <em>Caspi, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 124, 732 A.2d 528 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We applied in <em>Caspi </em>the \u201cfair and forthright\u201d standard of notice to a forum selection clause that had been included within a contract between an internet service provider and its subscribers. The clause specified that the agreement was governed by the laws of the State of Washington, and that the subscribers consented to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of King County, Washington, in all disputes arising out of their membership. <em>Id. </em>at 121, 732 A.2d 528. The forum provision was contained in a membership agreement that \u201cappear[ed] on the [subscriber\u2019s] computer screen in a scrollable window next to blocks providing the choices T Agree\u2019 and T Don\u2019t Agree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122, 732 A.2d 528. The prospective member\u2019s registration could proceed \u201conly after the potential subscriber has had the opportunity to view and has assented to the membership agreement, including [the defendants\u2019] forum selection clause.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Given the manner in which the forum selection clause was displayed in <em>Caspi, </em>and the manner in which the subscribers\u2019 consent to the contract terms was requested and obtained, we concluded, on those particular facts, that the clause was valid and enforceable. <em>Id. </em>at 125-26, 732 A.2d 528. We agreed with the trial court that, \u201cin the absence of a better showing than has been made, plaintiffs must be seen to have had adequate notice of the forum selection clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 732 A.2d 528. In particular, we noted that there was \u201cnothing extraordinary about the size or placement of the forum selection clause text.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 732 A.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The forum selection clause in <em>Caspi </em>which appeared as the first item in the last paragraph of the electronic document, was pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>sented \u201cin exactly the same format as most other provisions of the contract.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although a few of the other contract provisions appeared in upper case typeface, presumably for emphasis, we were not troubled by the fact that the forum selection clause was in lower case typeface because most of the provisions were likewise in lower case. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Applying a standard of \u201creasonable notice,\u201d we concluded in <em>Caspi </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">We discern nothing about <em>the style or mode of presentation, or the placement </em>of the provision, that can be taken as a basis for concluding that the forum selection clause was proffered <em>unfairly, or with a design to conceal or de-emphasize its provisions. </em>To conclude that plaintiffs are not bound by that clause would be equivalent to holding that they were bound by no other clause either, since all provisions were <em>identically presented.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 125-26, 732 A.2d 528 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Consequently, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the action because it had been brought in the wrong forum. <em>Id. </em>at 126, 732 A.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">An instructive contrast to the internet forum selection clause at issue in <em>Caspi </em>was an online arbitration clause invalidated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Specht v. Netscape Commc\u2019ns Corp., </em>306 F.3d 17 (2d Cir.N.Y.2002). The plaintiffs in <em>Specht </em>sued the defendant, an internet service provider, after they had downloaded a program from the defendant\u2019s website. The website transmitted, allegedly without the plaintiffs\u2019 awareness, information about their internet usage back to the provider. <em>Id. </em>at 21. The defendant moved to compel arbitration, relying upon a mandatory arbitration clause contained within the parties\u2019 online licensing agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 25. Significantly, the arbitration clause was located well below an icon inviting subscribers to download the free program by clicking the icon. <em>Id. </em>at 23. If, instead of clicking the download icon, the subscribers had scrolled further down the webpage, they would have encountered language requesting them to review and agree to the terms of the licensing agreement before downloading and using the software. <em>Ibid. </em>Those licensing terms, including the arbitration clause, appear on a separate webpage once the subscriber clicks the hyper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>link, and therefore were not readily visible to the subscribers. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. Moreover, once the plaintiffs activated the download, the terms of the license were not displayed again while the software was running, nor at any later point. <em>Id. </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In an opinion by Circuit Judge (now Justice) Sotomayor, the Second Circuit held in <em>Specht </em>that the arbitration clause was unenforceable because the plaintiffs had not been provided with reasonable notice of its existence. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32. Applying California state law, which, like our State, requires such reasonable notice as a predicate to enforceability, the Second Circuit concluded that the arbitration clause lacked the plaintiffs\u2019 knowing assent. <em>Ibid. </em>The court was unpersuaded that \u201ca reasonably prudent [person] in these circumstances would have known of the existence of [the] license terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. Instead, the plaintiffs in <em>Specht </em>\u201cwere responding to an offer that did not carry an immediately visible notice of the existence of license terms or require unambiguous manifestation of assent to those terms.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As Judge Sotomayor aptly wrote, <em>\u201c[rjeasonably conspicuous notice </em>of the existence of contract terms and <em>unambiguous manifestation of assent </em>to those terms by consumers are <em>essential </em>if electronic bargaining is to have integrity and credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The court in <em>Specht </em>found particular significance in the fact that the contractual provision that the defendant had sought to enforce appeared in what is commonly termed as a \u201csubmerged\u201d portion of their webpage. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32. The submerged provision would not be seen by the consumer on his or her computer screen unless he or she scrolled further down the webpage, beyond the material that initially filled the screen, to a point where the provision would be displayed. <em>Ibid. </em>The clause was otherwise hidden from view. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument in <em>Specht </em>that the subscribers were bound by the clause because they could have been aware that \u201can unexplored portion of the ... webpage remained below the download button[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32. That possibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>ty, the court noted, \u201cdoes not mean that they <em>reasonably </em>should have concluded that this [unexplored] portion contained a notice of license terms.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). The court likewise was unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that subscribers had as much time as they needed to scroll down the multiple screens on the webpage. <em>Ibid. </em>The court noted in this regard that \u201cthere is no reason to assume that viewers will scroll down to subsequent screens simply because screens are there.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Numerous cases after <em>Caspi </em>and <em>Specht </em>have similarly applied these principles of reasonable notice when assessing the validity of forum selection clauses or other boilerplate contractual language contained in internet websites. <em>See, e.g., Feldman v. Google, Inc., </em>513 F.Supp.2d 229, 238 (E.D.Pa.2007) (upholding a forum selection clause included in an internet agreement after plaintiff clicked his assent to all of the terms of that agreement); <em>Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc., </em>126 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>238, 248 (S.D.N.Y.2000) (enforcing contract terms that were \u201cclearly posted\u201d on plaintiffs website, terms that defendant admittedly was aware of when it proceeded to use plaintiffs program), <em>aff'd, </em>356 F.3d 393 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Major v. McCallister, </em>302 S.W.3d 227, 230 (Mo.Ct.App.2009) (enforcing a forum selection clause that was \u201cimmediately visible\u201d and which corresponded to a blue hyperlink appearing next to the button that plaintiff selected on her computer screen). Some of these internet transaction cases involve mechanisms to create a \u201celiekwrap\u201d agreement, in which the consumer manifests his or her assent by clicking an icon displayed on the screen. <em>See, e.g., Feldman, supra, </em>513 F.Supp.2d at 236. Others involve a \u201cbrowsewrap\u201d agreement, in which the consumer does not click an icon to manifest acceptance but instead is presented with prominent language on his or her screen that the \u201cuse of the [web]site constitutes acceptance of its terms of service.\u201d <em>Major, supra, </em>302 S.W.3d at 230 (citing <em>United States v. Drew, </em>259 <em>F.R.D. </em>449, 462 n. 22 (C.D.Cal.2009)); <em>see Feldman, supra, </em>513 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 236 n. 1 (distinguishing \u201celiekwrap\u201d and \u201cbrowsewrap\u201d agreements).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>We therefore assess the forum selection clause in the present case under these fundamental standards of reasonable notice. We make that assessment <em>de novo </em>for, as <em>Caspi </em>instructs, \u201c[t]he issue of reasonable notice regarding a forum selection clause is a question of law for the court to determine.\u201d <em>Caspi supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 126, 732 A.2d 528. Applying this legal standard to the present record on the jurisdictional issue,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we part company with the trial court, and conclude that defendants structured their website in a manner that failed to afford potential purchasers with reasonable notice of the forum selection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Defendants provide nothing to contradict plaintiffs contention that the forum selection clause would not be visible on an Erection MD purchaser\u2019s computer screen unless he or she scrolled down to a submerged portion of the webpage where the disclaimer containing the clause appeared. Nor do defendants rebut plaintiffs contention that if a purchaser selected one of their products (such as Erection MD) advertised on the site, by clicking that item and adding it to his or her electronic \u201cshopping cart,\u201d the webpage would skip ahead to new pages that do not contain the disclaimer.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In sum, the forum selection clause was unreasonably masked from the view of the prospective purchasers because of its circuitous mode of presentation. The relative size of the disclaimer\u2019s type face is irrelevant, because the website was designed in a manner that makes it unlikely that consumers would ever see it at all on their computer screen. Consequently, the website here is dissimilar to the one in <em>Caspi </em>and similar to the one in <em>Specht.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">As we noted in <em>Caspi, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 126, 732 A.2d 528, a forum selection clause cannot be \u201cproffered unfairly, or with a design to conceal or de-emphasize its provisions.\u201d The record does not support the trial court\u2019s finding that the disclaimer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>forum selection clause were \u201cprominently displayed.\u201d Consequently, we reverse that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">We need not reach plaintiffs argument that defendants were required, as a matter of law, to include a specific feature near the disclaimer asking purchasers to \u201cclick\u201d or otherwise manifest then-assent to its terms. We recognize that case law is divided on whether such \u201cclickwrap\u201d features are needed to make a contractual provision in an internet transaction enforceable. <em>See generally </em>J. Brian Beckham, <em>Forum Selection Clauses in Clickwrap Agreements, </em>14 <em>U. Balt. Intell. Prop. L.J. </em>151 (2006); Kevin W. Grierson, Annotation, <em>Enforceability of </em>\u201cClickwrap\u201d <em>or \u201cShrinkwrap\u201d Agreements Common in Computer Software, Hardware, and Internet Transactions, </em>106 A.L.R.5th 309 (2003), and the cases cited therein. Instead, we resolve the jurisdictional issue in the present case based upon more fundamental grounds: the absence of reasonable notice to consumers, and the manifestly unfair manner in which defendants\u2019 website was structured.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We therefore hold that the forum selection clause in this ease was presumptively unenforceable. We do not resolve whether that presumption can be overcome if defendants establish on remand that Hoffman had actually read the forum selection clause before purchasing the product. <em>See, e.g., Register.com, supra, </em>126 <em>F.Supp.</em>2d at 248 (finding the user\u2019s actual awareness of the website provision fatal to his argument against its enforcement). At oral argument before us, Hoffman represented that he had, in fact, not seen the clause until after he bought the dietary supplement. Even so, Hoffman acknowledged that the credibility of his assertion of prior ignorance could be tested in an evidential hearing. The legal implications of such actual notice, if proven, in the absence of a clickwrap or an \u201cI agree\u201d feature, are left for the trial court to evaluate in the first instance, should defendants choose to pursue that subsidiary issue on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">We therefore vacate the trial court\u2019s determination and remand the jurisdictional issue. On remand, the court may conduct an evidential hearing to develop the record further concerning actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>notice, upon the request of defendants. Absent such a request, jurisdiction in the Superior Court shall be maintained.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">[At the direction of the court, the published version of this opinion omits Part 11(B), which relates to issues other than the enforceability of the forum selection clause. <em>See R. </em>1:36-3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The trial court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint is reversed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-10\"> <em>See, e.g., Hoffman v.
