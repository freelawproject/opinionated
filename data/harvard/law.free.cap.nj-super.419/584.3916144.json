When near the truck, he was approached by two men, later identified as Dante Gittens and defendant. Gittens asked Kocher for a ride \u201cacross the bridge,\u201d which Kocher refused to provide. As Kocher attempted to enter his truck, Gittens pinned him against the truck and demanded money. Kocher attempted to flee, but was tackled. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>A fight ensued, and Kocher was stabbed eight times. Kocher believed that more than one individual participated in the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Kocher was unable to identify either of his assailants. However, an eye witness, John Ashwell, an off-duty corrections officer acting as a chauffeur for customers in the bar, witnessed the assault. When Ashwell approached, yelling at the attackers, they ran off. Ashwell testified at trial that both men were attempting to reach Kocher\u2019s wallet, and both were throwing punches. However, he saw only one knife. Ashwell called 9-1-1, and shortly thereafter, the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In a subsequent search of the area, the police found defendant lying on his stomach near the house that was next door to that of his grandparents, where he lived. His jacket and blood-stained gloves were found in nearby yards. DNA tests disclosed the blood on the gloves to be that of Gittens and Kocher. Both defendant and Gittens were identified by Ashwell as the perpetrators of the assault and attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">In a statement to the police, defendant admitted to participating in a conspiracy to rob and to possession of a knife. Both admissions were denied at trial. Rather, defendant testified that, on the evening of the robbery, he had walked to a nearby bar, Club Risque, to play pool. There, he met up with Gittens. As the evening progressed, Gittens gave his last twenty dollars to a woman in return for a lap dance, but when the music did not last as long as he expected, he became aggravated and knocked something off the bar\u2019s counter. Gittens was asked to leave, and defendant followed shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">As the two men walked toward the Playhouse parking lot, Gittens complained that he did not have money to get home. Defendant could not offer Gittens a bed at his grandparents\u2019 house and, because he did not have his bank card, he was unable to offer him cash. Gittens proposed robbery. As the two men crossed the Playhouse parking lot, they observed Kocher, and Gittens asked him for a ride. Defendant determined to leave, and as he did, he heard \u201csome racket.\u201d He turned, and observed Kocher attacking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Gittens. Because Kocher was assaulting defendant\u2019s friend, defendant ran back to try to break up the fight. Eventually, defendant shoved Kocher, causing him to fall, and defendant and Gittens ran. As defendant approached the road where he lived, defendant was spotted by the police, who gave chase and eventually apprehended him in the neighbor\u2019s yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Although defendant admitted in his statement to the police that he had a knife, at trial he testified that he had left the knife at his grandparents\u2019 house, where it remained either in the sink or the dishwasher. At trial, defendant said he did not know whether Gittens had a knife, although he had told the police that Gittens possessed one that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The jury did not accept defendant\u2019s version of the events, finding him guilty as we have specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">At trial, Burlington City Detective James Barnes, a twenty-three year veteran of the city police force, testified that, at police headquarters, he tested defendant\u2019s clothes for the presence of blood using a phenolphthalein test, and that the result was positive. When asked to explain the phenolphthalein test to the jury, Barnes responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">It\u2019s a test that\u2019s used to determine whether there\u2019s blood on clothes. It\u2019s a very simple test. It\u2019s\u2014you just like pat and it comes back positive for blood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">When asked to describe how the test is performed, Barnes stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1D\">It\u2019s like a swab, a little swab. And you put it in your hand and you would touch the areas where you think blood is at, and it comes back positive. It\u2019s\u2014for lack of a better word, it\u2019s idiot-proof. It\u2019s\u2014you read the directions on the box. That\u2019s how you follow it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Barnes testified further that the swab turned pink to indicate a positive result, whereas the swab was otherwise white. The test, he stated, was designed to detect blood, not just human blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Barnes testified that this was the first occasion on which he had used the test, and that he did so after defendant denied being present at the scene of the assault and attempted robbery. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>a positive result was obtained, Barnes informed the sergeant who was interrogating defendant. The sergeant responded that the police should take defendant\u2019s clothes. However, no one did so, because no replacement clothes were available for defendant\u2019s use and the police \u201c[c]ouldn\u2019t send him to jail naked.\u201d Additionally, the police did not retain the positive swab, but instead, Barnes threw it away as used up. As a consequence, no confirmatory testing was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">On cross-examination, Barnes testified that he did not know the accuracy of the test, or whether it could also give a positive result when tested on tomatoes, potatoes, cucumbers, horseradish, fruit extracts, some metallic substances, or peroxide-like substances. Barnes testified further that he was not certain how the test worked, and when asked whether he knew the chemical basis for the test, Barnes responded: \u201cIf I knew that I wouldn\u2019t be a detective.\u201d According to Barnes, his department, as a matter of routine, performs no further confirmatory tests to determine whether or not a clothing stain is actually blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">On appeal, defendant claims that the judge committed plain error in permitting the introduction of evidence of the phenolphthalein test result without establishing its reliability, preserving the test swab and the sampled clothing for confirmatory testing, and establishing that the testing method used by Barnes was correct. Defendant further contends that the error was not harmless, because evidence of blood on defendant\u2019s clothes supported the State\u2019s theory that defendant was an active participant in the assault and attempted robbery, and cast doubt on defendant\u2019s claim that he was a nonparticipant in the alleged criminal conduct, and intervened in the fight between Kocher and Gittens only to protect his friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The State admits that \u201cNew Jersey ease law is silent as to the reliability of the phenolphthalein test for the presence of blood.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>However, it argues that other jurisdictions have determined that the test, which is presumptive only, can be admitted, with the presumptive nature of the result affecting only the weight of the evidence, and it argues erroneously that the Supreme Court of Washington has found the results of the phenolphthalein test reliable under state evidence rules and <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 <em>F. </em>1013 (D.C.Cir.1923). <em>See State v. Stenson, </em>132 <em>Wash.2d </em>668, 940 P.2d 1239 (1997),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>cert. denied, </em>523 <em>U.S. </em>1008, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 140 L.Ed.2d 323 (1998). Turning to the matter on appeal, the State argues that any foundational deficiencies in the introduction of the scientific evidence in this case were cured by defense counsel\u2019s effective cross-examination of Detective Barnes. Further, the State contends that the test for the presence of blood played only a minor role in the case against defendant, and thus its admission did not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We do not agree with the State\u2019s position that the results of the phenolphthalein test as offered by Barnes were admissible. As described by the Office of Forensic Science of the New Jersey State Police, the phenolphthalein test, also known as the KastleMeyer (KM) test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>See also </em>R.E. Gaensslen, <em>Sourcebook in Forensic Serology, Immunology, and Biochemistry </em>at 103-05 (National Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice, 1989 ed.) (detailing the history of the test).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>is a presumptive test for blood. Three reagents (ethanol, KM reagent [phenolphthalinj, and hydrogen peroxide) are applied, in turn, to the suspected bloodstain. If blood is present, a pink color change will occur within seconds. This is not a conclusive test, however, as other materials could give a false positive result.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Without doubt, the phenolphthalein test conducted on defendant\u2019s clothing in this ease was a \u201cscientific test.\u201d In <em>State v. Chun, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>54, 943 A.2d 114, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>158, 172 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008), the Court summarized the principles of law governing admissibility of scientific test results in criminal trials, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">Admissibility of scientific test results in a criminal trial is permitted only when those tests are shown to be generally accepted, within the relevant scientific community, to be reliable. <em>See State v. Harvey, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>117, 169-70 [699 A.2d 596] (1997) (citing <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 <em>F. </em>1013, 1014 (D.C.Cir.1923)); <em>Romano [v. Kimmelman</em>], 96 <em>N.J. </em>[66,] 80 [474 A.2d 1 (1984)]; <em>[State v.] Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>[146], 170-71 [199 A.2d 809 (1964)]. That is to say, the test must have a \u201csufficient scientific basis to produce uniform and reasonably reliable results and will contribute materially to the ascertainment of the truth.\u201d <em>State v. Hurd, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>525, 536 [432 A.2d 86] (1981) (quoting <em>State v. Cary, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>343, 352 [230 A.2d 384] (1967))....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">Proof of general acceptance does not mean that there must be complete agreement in the scientific community about the techniques, methodology, or procedures that underlie the scientific evidence. <em>See Romano, supra, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 80 [474 A.2d 1]----Neither \u201ccomplete agreement over the accuracy of the test [nor] the exclusion of the possibility of error\u201d is required. <em>Harvey, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 171 [699 A.2d 596].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">Nevertheless, before we can conclude that scientific test results are admissible in evidence, the proponent of the scientific device must bear its burden to \u201cclearly establish\u201d that the device or the test meets the standard of general acceptance as we have defined it. <em>Id. </em>at 170 [699 A.2d 596]; <em>see State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 209-11 [478 A.2d 364] (1984); <em>State v. Cavallo, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>508, 521 [443 A.2d 1020] (1982).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apo\"><em>[Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 91-92, 943 A.2d 114.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">In the present case, there was no evidence presented that the phenolphthalein test utilized by Detective Barnes was generally accepted in the scientific community to be reliable. The prosecutor offered no expert testimony on the issue of general acceptance and thus the reliability of the evidence, and defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>did not stipulate to that fact. As the Court stated in <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 478 A.2d 364 (1984), \u201cthere are three ways a proponent of scientific evidence can prove ... general acceptance and thereby ... reliability: (1) by expert testimony as to the general acceptance, among those in the profession, of the premises on which the proffered expert witness based his or her analysis; (2) by authoritative scientific and legal writings indicating that the scientific community accepts the premises underlying the proffered testimony; and (3) by judicial opinions that indicate the expert\u2019s premises have gained general acceptance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210, 478 A.2d 364 (citing <em>State v. Cavallo, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>508, 521, 443 A.2d 1020 (1982)). None of these methods was used in this case. Further, the testimony of Barnes himself, a lay witness, did not establish reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We note, as did the State, that the results of phenolphthalein tests have been recognized by courts of other jurisdictions as admissible, presumptive evidence of the presence of blood, and that in those cases, the presumptive nature of the test has been found to affect the weight, not <em>the </em>admissibility of the evidence. <em>See, e.g., Stenson, supra, </em>940 P.2d at 1263 (collecting cases); <em>see also State v. Taylor, </em>298 S.W.3d 482 (Mo.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>3323, 176 L.Ed.2d 1226 (2010); <em>Wilkes v. State, </em>917 N.E.2d 675 (Ind.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>414, 178 L.Ed.2d 321 (2010); <em>Commonwealth v. Hetzel, </em>822 A.2d 747 (Pa.Super.), <em>appeal denied, 576 Pa. </em>711, 839 A.2d <em>351 </em>(2003). <em>Contra see Young v. State, </em>316 <em>Ark. </em>225, 871 S.W.2d 373 (1994) (luminol test for blood); <em>State v. Moody, </em>214 <em>Conn. </em>616, 573 A.2d 716 (1990) (unspecified presumptive test for blood). <em>See also </em>Amy P. Bunk and Guy A. Talia, <em>Admissibility of Results of Presumptive Tests Indicating Presence of Blood on Object, </em>82 A.L.R.5th 67 (2000). However, even if we were to accept the decisions finding the results of phenolphthalein tests to be sufficiently reliable to warrant admission into evidence as dispositive of that issue, the conditions for admissibility recognized in them would not be met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>In those cases that have recognized the admissibility of the test results as presumptive evidence of the presence of blood without further confirmatory testing, the limitations of the test and the possibility of false positive results have been fully explained to the jury. In that regard, juries have been informed that the phenolphthalein test can, in addition to manifesting a reaction to blood, give a positive reaction to potatoes, rust, bleach, and nickel, <em>Taylor, supra, </em>298 S.W.3d at 500; that the presence of a vegetable substance, such as red beets can create a false positive, <em>Hetzel, supra, </em>822 A.2d at 761; and that \u201ca host of environmental materials having nothing to do with blood can trigger a positive reaction.\u201d <em>Stenson, supra, </em>940 P.2d at 1264. <em>See also Sourcebook in Forensic Serology, supra, </em>at 103 (noting that saliva, pus, malt extract, vegetable extracts and the salts of heavy metals could give false positive results). In all such decisions, the admissibility of the presumptive evidence was expressly conditioned on the existence of expert testimony as to the possibility of a false positive.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In contrast, in the present case, defense counsel asked Barnes on cross-examination if he knew whether the phenolphthalein test was 100 percent accurate, and Barnes responded that he did not know. Barnes was also unable to confirm one way or another whether contact with enumerated substances other than blood could result in a false positive. Thus, the testimony found crucial in cases permitting the introduction of evidence of the results of a non-eonfirmed phenolphthalein test was not offered here. Rather, the jury was left with the clear impression that the test was conclusive, not presumptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Further, we recognize that other courts have observed that \u201cperforming the test improperly could cause a false positive.\u201d <em>Hetzel, supra, </em>822 A.2d at 761. No expert established at the trial of the present matter the manner in which the phenolphthalein test should be performed, concluded that the test performed by Barnes had, in fact, been done as directed, or established what the consequences would have been if improperly conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>As a consequence of the foregoing, we conclude that the introduction into evidence of the result of the phenolphthalein test was erroneous. Contrary to the State\u2019s position, we are satisfied that the error was clearly capable of producing an unjust result, <em>Rule </em>2:10-2, and could have \u201cled the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 273 A.2d 1 (1971). As we previously recounted, the independent witness, Ashwell, testified that both defendant and Gittens participated in the assault on Kocher. In contrast, defendant testified that his involvement was limited to pushing Kocher to the ground and extricating his friend. The presence of blood on defendant\u2019s gloves would be consistent with defendant\u2019s version of events, since he would have used his hands in breaking up the fight. The presence of blood on his clothing suggests a greater involvement in the affray on defendant\u2019s part. Thus, evidence confirming the existence of blood on defendant\u2019s clothing substantially undercut the weight of defendant\u2019s testimony, thereby increasing the credibility of Ashwell\u2019s contrary version of what had occurred. In these circumstances, we conclude that a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In light of the foregoing, we decline to consider defendant\u2019s additional arguments, except to note that the defense of use of force in the protection of others was not available to defendant, and therefore he was not entitled to a jury instruction on that defense. Because, even under defendant\u2019s view of the events, he understood that Gittens intended to rob Kocher, it cannot be said that defendant \u201creasonably believed both that the person he sought to aid was unlawfully attacked and that the force used was necessary to protect that person from the attack.\u201d <em>State v. Bryant, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>27, 35, 671 A.2d 1058 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>589, 677 A.2d 761 (1996) (citing <em>State v.
