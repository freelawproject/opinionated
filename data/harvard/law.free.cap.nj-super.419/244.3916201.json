(Avaya), and M. Foster Werner, Jr. (Werner), appeal from a judgment in favor of plaintiff Nicholas Saffos in the amount of $5,633,707.37, inclusive of prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. Plaintiff cross-appeals from a $6,285,000 reduction in the amount of the punitive-damage award. We affirm in all respects save the quantum of punitive damages; the attorney-fee lodestar, which we modify; and the award of a contingency-fee enhancement, which we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Plaintiff, born in 1954, began working for AT &amp; T in 1983 in the corporate real estate department. AT &amp; T created Lucent Technologies (Lucent) to take over the business of Bell Laboratories. In 1995 or 1996, plaintiff transferred to Lucent\u2019s real estate department. Avaya was created in 2000 to take over the Business Communications unit of Lucent. Plaintiff then moved into Ava-ya\u2019s Global Real Estate (AGRE) group as a Business Relationship Manager with an annual salary of $83,000. AGRE worked to provide suitable real estate for Avaya\u2019s divisions and global affiliates, and to control real estate costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">On May 20, 2002, Werner was hired as AGRE\u2019s director. AGRE had about twenty-four employees at that time. At trial, Werner claimed that AGRE had hired him to improve its reputation, performance, and profitability and testified that he was to reduce costs. He decided to hire people that he personally knew or people recommended by acquaintances he knew and respected.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Upon arriving in Basking Ridge, Werner began reorganizing the office and restructuring AGRE. He changed the names of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>titles and asked off-site employees to relocate to New Jersey. He also began eliminating AGRE employees who had been holdovers from Lucent and AT &amp; T. First, Werner placed Lee Gruhin, age forty and a twelve-year veteran of Avaya and its predecessors, on a one-month performance improvement plan (PIP), after which he was terminated on August 1, 2002, for \u201cunsatisfactory performance\u201d despite always having had solidly good prior performance reviews.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gruhin was replaced by Mark Kennedy, age forty-four, who transferred into AGRE from Avaya\u2019s finance department approximately six months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Werner next fired four employees under a Forced Management Plan (FMP), including Nancy Glenn, age forty-seven, and Steve Sarasin, age forty-three. An FMP supposedly eliminates positions to create cost savings. Glenn, who was a twenty-one-year veteran of Avaya and its predecessors, had always received exceptional performance evaluations and IPF scores.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She was working in Colorado and offered to relocate to New Jersey at her own expense, but Werner refused, advising her that there was no money for moving.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">When Glenn saw an internal posting of her job on Avaya\u2019s system, she complained to the Human Resources Department (HR), but they told her she did not have a case and to \u201chave a good life.\u201d On September 29, 2002, while still on Avaya\u2019s payroll, she sent an email describing Werner\u2019s actions to Amar Pai, Werner\u2019s supervisor, the Vice President of Finance Operations and Corporate Controller. Glenn never received a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Despite having ostensibly eliminated four positions with the FMP, Werner soon replaced Glenn and Sarasin with Eileen Grip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>po, age thirty-three, and Nina Caputo, age thirty-four. When Caputo was hired, Werner authorized payment of her relocation expenses, unlike Glenn.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In or about January 2003, Werner told Robert Goeller, age forty-one and a Lease Administrator, to develop a PIP to make \u201cmajor improvements\u201d to his performance based on an evaluation dated November 2002. He then fired him on February 28, 2003, for unsatisfactory performance and replaced him with Michele Costa, age twenty-eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Grippo, who replaced Glenn, testified that Werner created a divisive environment at AGRE. The department was divided into two \u201ccamps,\u201d the older employees in one group and the younger employees in a totally separate, \u201cfavored\u201d group. \u201cIt was clear as day.\u201d She explained that Werner insulted the older employees behind their backs but was charming and flattering to the younger ones, frequently asked the younger group to join him for lunch, and had them accompany him to corporate meetings, all to the exclusion of the older group.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Werner especially \u201cabused\u201d Susan Bemarducci, age fifty-one, his administrative assistant. When Grippo complained about the different camps to Werner, he started ignoring her. Consequently, she soon resigned, because \u201c[i]t was not a pleasant place to come to work\u201d and Werner \u201cabused people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">In Werner\u2019s deposition, read to the jury, he testified that Grippo left AGRE because she was unhappy working with plaintiff due to plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccomplete lack of oral and written communication skills.\u201d Grippo flatly denied this at trial, saying, \u201cNot true.\u201d Grippo also testified that plaintiff, who had been doing the work.of two or three people before she arrived, \u201cseemed to do his job really well.\u201d Although he had a \u201cquirky type of communication\u201d style and \u201ctalked slow[ly] and deliberately],\u201d he \u201cserved his clients very well\u201d and \u201chad a good rapport with them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Tom Cotter and Mike Ahnell, outside contractors who worked for United Systems Integrators (USI) at AGRE\u2019s offices, both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>testified about Werner\u2019s favored treatment of his younger, mostly female, new hires. Werner frequently yelled at Bernarducci and often brought her to tears. The office \u201cwas Mnd of a hostile atmosphere.\u201d If you were not part of Werner\u2019s \u201clittle inner circle\u201d comprised of the new younger people he had hired, you \u201cwere clearly on the outside.\u201d Everyone seemed \u201ca bit frightened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Plaintiff had received more-than-favorable performance reviews in the past. Cotter testified that plaintiff had been \u201can excellent employee,\u201d was \u201cwell organized,\u201d and all of his clients were happy. One of plaintiffs \u201cstrengths\u201d was his communication skills. Ahnell from USI had also worked with plaintiff and found him to be \u201ccompetent\u201d and \u201cable to address the needs of the job.\u201d Ahnell never had any problems with plaintiffs communication skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Cotter and Ahnell testified that Werner was very critical of Bernarducci\u2019s skills, saying that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t even do a simple business letter.\u201d Werner moved Bernarducci to a new position, Business Analyst II, and then ignored her requests for guidance on her new responsibilities. Werner soon put her on a PIP and then terminated her employment for poor performance shortly thereafter. Bernarducci testified that her complaints to HR about how she was being treated were ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Courtney McGough, age thirty-three, replaced Bernarducci as Werner\u2019s assistant. She was hired in December 2002 as a \u201cReal Estate Coordinator\u201d but was quickly promoted to a Business Relationship Manager after Grippo resigned. Werner then filled McGough\u2019s former position with Kerri Hollick, age twenty-eight, and later with Jennifer DeSilva, age twenty-two.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Werner soon began examining plaintiffs work. In fact, when Werner first arrived at Avaya in 2002, Werner gave plaintiff a \u201cfairly favorable\u201d evaluation and a raise. Despite that 2002 evaluation, in 2003 Werner suddenly found plaintiff to be verbose with a meandering style of communication that was confusing to colleagues and clients. He complained that plaintiff \u201cused big words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>that weren\u2019t necessary\u201d in business, such as \u201ctrenchant,\u201d \u201csalient,\u201d \u201cvanquished,\u201d \u201ctransmuting,\u201d and \u201cfathom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Werner complained that plaintiff failed to tell him about business problems in a timely fashion and refused to get proper approvals before sending documents to clients. For example, in early September 2002, plaintiff failed to notify him that Avaya was in danger of having a substantial penalty assessed against it because one of its clients in Mexico City had not signed a lease renewal. However, plaintiff testified that he had received the required lease extensions before he left work; thus, there was no risk of any penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Werner also complained that plaintiff emailed internal work-product documents to clients before they were approved and told clients that they could explore other sites on their own. Werner said that these actions violated \u201cpolicies\u201d that he had established, but admitted he had never documented the alleged \u201cpolicies.\u201d Werner also claimed that he was told by plaintiffs coworkers that clients were unhappy with plaintiffs work.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Based on the foregoing \u201cconcerns,\u201d Werner placed plaintiff on a PIP on August 26, 2003. He told plaintiff that he had problems with \u201chis writing style, which was not a normal business writing style,\u201d and his attitude was inappropriate. He gave plaintiff one month to improve and said he needed to devise his own improvement plan. Plaintiff repeatedly asked Werner for guidance, but Werner ignored his request to see the work product of a \u201cmore favorably reviewed associate\u201d for comparison. Consequently, plaintiff was forced to write his own plan, using what he thought were criticisms from his review and adding weekly steps he would take to correct them.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">At their first PIP meeting, Werner found plaintiffs plan to be \u201cincomplete,\u201d although he made no other criticisms of plaintiffs performance. Werner claimed that plaintiff was not taking the PIP seriously. As a result, Werner gave plaintiff several job openings to explore. Werner terminated plaintiffs employment on September 26, 2003. Plaintiff was forty-nine years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Werner replaced plaintiff with Carol Puleo Clark, age thirty-five, who had very little real estate experience. Thereafter, Werner fired John Cook,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> age forty-seven, and Prahans Amin, age thirty-three, for \u201cpoor performance.\u201d Werner replaced Cook with Simon Ford, age thirty-four.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">For each employment action, Werner consulted Ann Marie Judice Bane, his HR liaison. Bane testified that part of her job was \u201ccoaching\u201d managers on how to terminate employees and minimize the risk of a lawsuit. Werner said that she \u201cguided\u201d him through the termination process for each employee. For example, Bane told Werner that he could not fire plaintiff under an FMP because they wanted someone new to fill his position. Instead, she told Werner to put plaintiff on a PIP. When Bane raised a concern that Werner was hiring new people who had little or no real estate experience, Werner told her that he knew what he was doing after thirty years in the industry. Bane admitted that Avaya did not use PIPs as standard personnel procedures; they were \u201cmore of a Lucent Technologies process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Werner admitted that he had failed to institute a PIP for Billy Karras, age thirty-three, after Karras indisputably violated AGRE\u2019s written code of conduct and accounting control policy. Instead, he gave Karras a \u201cwarning\u201d and never fired him. Werner also had given Grippo, age thirty-three, a warning after she met with a client without Werner\u2019s prior approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In July 2004, Werner\u2019s supervisor, Pai, fired him at age fifty-five for poor performance and then replaced him with Andrew Fellouris, age forty. Werner filed an age-discrimination claim against Avaya, which it settled before trial in this matter. The judge permitted the jury to hear testimony about this settlement because it was relevant to Werner\u2019s credibility but failed to give the jury a limiting instruction on its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Although Pai, Werner\u2019s supervisor, had been aware of Werner\u2019s actions and eventually fired him, Pai said that he \u201ctrusted [his] evaluation of his people and his team.\u201d He claimed that he never instructed Werner to fire older people or hire younger ones, and he never heard anyone say that Werner had a bias against older employees (despite the email Glenn sent to him in September 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In excerpts from Werner\u2019s deposition that were read to the jury, he testified that he believed that Pai was concerned that age was a detriment at Avaya and preferred younger workers. In his own discrimination suit, Werner stated that Pai engaged in a general pattern of firing older workers and hiring younger ones.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">[At the direction of the court and for the sake of brevity, four paragraphs in Section I have been omitted from the published version of the opinion.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The jury was presented with a chart demonstrating that the average age of AGRE\u2019s workforce after two years of Werner\u2019s leadership was ten years younger than it had been before he arrived. In all, nine employees were terminated, and eight were hired as replacements.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">The jury returned a verdict in plaintiffs favor, awarding him $250,000 for his emotional distress; $325,500 for back pay; and $167,500 for front pay. On June 17, 2007, the judge found sufficient facts for the jury to consider punitive damages. The parties stipulated Avaya\u2019s value at $4 billion, and the jury awarded $10,000,000 for punitive damages. First, the judge entered an order of judgment on the jury\u2019s compensatory damages award and ordered defendants to pay $93,278.37 for prejudgment interest on the awards for emotional damages and lost back pay. Second, the judge considered defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or for a new trial and remitted the punitive-damage award to $3,715,000 (five times the compensatory award). He subsequently awarded $843,638 for attorneys\u2019 fees; $210,909 as a twenty-five percent fee enhancement; and $27,882 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>for costs, bringing the total judgment to $5,633,707.37. Defendants appealed these rulings, and plaintiff cross-appealed the remittitur of the punitive-damage award. The parties have raised the following issues for our consideration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">[For the sake of brevity, we have here redacted the discussion of a number of issues respecting liability and compensatory damages raised by defendants that we have decided in a separate opinion. Additionally, we summarize the remaining issues as follows: Defendants assert that (a) the remitted punitive-damage award was unjustified because plaintiff failed to show that Avaya\u2019s conduct was \u201cespecially egregious\u201d; (b) the remitted award is unconstitutionally excessive since Avaya\u2019s conduct was not reprehensible; (c) the judge erred in allowing punitive damages in excess of the compensatory award; and (d) the award greatly exceeded comparable civil penalties. Last, they argue that (a) the attorney-fee award should be barred because the retainer agreement violated the <em>Rules of Professional Conduct </em>(R.P.C.); (b) the lodestar was excessive; and (c) the fee enhancement was likewise excessive.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Plaintiff disputes each of the issues raised by defendants and contends on his cross-appeal that the punitive damages awarded by the jury did not contravene New Jersey\u2019s Punitive Damages Act (PDA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.9 to -5.17, because the Legislature excepted punitive-damage awards for violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -49, from the PDA cap. Further, he argues that the punitive-damage award conformed to the requirement of the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Our appellate review is limited by well-settled, controlling principles. <em>Sebring </em>Assocs. <em>v. Coyle, </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>414, 424, 790 A.2d 225 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>355, 798 A.2d 1269 (2002). \u201cWe are not to review the record from the point of view of how we would have decided the matter if we were the court of first instance.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). \u201cFindings by the trial judge are considered binding on appeal when supported by adequate, substantial and credible evidence.\u201d <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v.

Comm.0 of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">[At the direction of the court and for the sake of brevity, the last paragraph of Section II and the entire Section III have been omitted from the published version of the opinion.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">We next consider the issues respecting the award of punitive damages in this case. Defendants contend that the judge erred by refusing to vacate the jury\u2019s punitive-damage award or, alternatively, by failing to remit that amount to a sum equal to the compensatory damages, that is, $742,500. In his cross-appeal, plaintiff seeks reinstatement of the jury\u2019s $10 million award on the ground that it was constitutional and fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">In his written decision on punitive damages, the judge concluded that the jury had sufficient evidence to find that plaintiff \u201cwas the victim of a scheme carried out by ... Werner and ordered [by Pai] or [in which he] at least acquiesced.\u201d This \u201cscheme\u201d was directed at plaintiff and \u201cat a number of older employees who were fire[d] pretextuf ]ally and replaced by younger employees.\u201d Eight people went into \u201cremediation\u201d and \u201cwere terminated [and] replaced largely by younger employees.\u201d He further found that \u201c[m]ost of the employees terminated were long-term employees. All had good records of past performance prior to Werner coming on the scene, and were then subjected] to a hostile work environment created by ... Werner focused against the older employees while he openly favored new hires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The judge found defendants\u2019 conduct \u201creprehensible],\u201d concluding that \u201cthe facts justify a finding that the scheme to replace older employees with younger employees was put into place by Avaya to create a new approach to management of the eompany[,] which was apparently in serious financial condition when these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>acts occurred.\u201d Indeed, the evidence demonstrated to the judge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">the management of Avaya ... [was] keenly aware of the mandated public policy that termination should not be made on the basis of age. Therefore, Werner with the aid of the Human Eesources person, [Bane,] and with the tacit approval, at least, of ... Pai, created a scheme to create a recent record of poor performance, put [plaintiff] and others through a remediation process so that [Avaya] could claim some compliance with the policy against age discrimination and then terminated the employees shortly thereafter, replacing them largely by younger persons. The facts certainly justify a finding that this was a carefully orchestrated scheme in which the defendants were aware of their potential liability and tried to mask it by the process described and to create a hostile environment for those persons wh[o] were not part of the defendants\u2019 new team. The facts would certainly justify a finding therefore that defendants were aware of New Jersey\u2019s strong policy, as expressed in the LAD against any type of discrimination, and that there was a concerted effort to engage in that practice and tried to mask the wrongful acts by implementing a scheme to rid themselves of older employees in defiance of those policies. Thus, it would appear that the acts were perpetrated not only against [plaintiff], but on a division-wide basis with full knowledge of the requirements imposed by the LAD.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In addition, \u201c[t]he effects on ... plaintiff appear to have been devastating.\u201d The judge found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">After some 20 years with the company or its predecessors without a single negative review, except by Werner, [plaintiff] was subjected to the treatment described and terminated without pension or benefits at the age of 49. The evidence justified a finding that [plaintiff] was deeply affected by it both during the time he was on the job and the period that followed thereafter and suffered substantial emotional distress, not only in being terminated from the job that he had held for so long, but by his inability to be able to find comparable employment____[P]Iaintiff described in detail his efforts and lack of success in obtaining suitable employment. He finally secured a franchise start-up business by means of personal savings and loans[,] and it was projected that some time in the near future, he would be able to achieve comparable compensation in his business. It would appear then that between the damage done to plaintiff in this case [and] comparable employees from Avaya ... and the attempt by ... defendants to mask their discrimination by a sham compliance with non-discriminatory standards that something more than some financial harm to ... plaintiff was done under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">With respect to \u201cthe impact that punitive damages would have on ... defendants,\u201d the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">It was stipulated during the course of the trial that Avaya is a corporation worth approximately $4[ ] billion dollars. There was some argument that based on recent yearly reports that the true value was close to something like $7[ ] billion dollars. Considering the worth of the corporation, consideration has to be given to the impact that a fine would have on ... defendants and [e]nsure [their] future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>compliance with non-discriminatory standards. A token punitive damages award would simply be viewed as the cost of doing business and would be unlikely to deter ... defendants from engaging in these practices in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Finally, the judge concluded that, \u201c[bjased on the guidelines set forth in [Gore<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] and in <em>Baker</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and by our punitive damage statutory] scheme,\u201d a punitive-damage award of five times the compensatory-damage award \u201cwould be appropriate under the circumstance\u201d; thus, he remitted the $10,000,000 award to $3,715,000. \u201cThis award would then represent on the one hand a significant message to [Avaya], but would not offend ... defendants\u2019] right to due process. A multiplier of 13.46 is excessive even considering the pervasive discrimination and the worth of [Avaya].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">In New Jersey, an award of punitive damages in a LAD action is governed initially by that act. <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-3.

We have instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether: the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. <em>Id. </em>at 576-577[, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1599-1600, 134 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 826-27]. The existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect. It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant\u2019s culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence. <em>Id. </em>at 575[, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1599, 134 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 826].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>[Campbell, supra, </em>538 <em>U.S. </em>at 419, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1521, <em>155 L.Ed.2d </em>at 602.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Our PDA requires courts to consider similar factors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Here, defendants\u2019 conduct was reprehensible. Although the harm was economic, Avaya disregarded the mental health of defendant and other older workers<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> when Werner, with his supervisor\u2019s acquiescence, mounted a deliberate, systematic campaign to terminate the employment of the division\u2019s older employees, including plaintiff, under the pretext of poor performance, and then covered up his unlawful age discrimination, with advice of management, by using a sham PIP procedure, which Avaya did not officially employ, and which was never instituted when younger employees undeniably violated similar company policies, despite a letter to Pai complaining of this conduct. Werner further created a hostile work environment by excluding older workers from meetings and lunches. Plaintiff was certainly financially vulnerable as the termination of his employment wrecked havoc with his standard of living and his financial security. Werner\u2019s conduct and Avaya\u2019s indifference to it involved repeated actions and not mere accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u201c[E]vidence that a defendant has repeatedly engaged in prohibited conduct while knowing or suspecting that it was unlawful would provide relevant support for an argument that strong medicine is required to cure the defendant\u2019s disrespect for the law.\u201d <em>Gore, supra, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>at 576-77, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1599, 134 L.Ed.2d at 827 (citation omitted). Additionally, their conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>violated long-established and clear statutory mandates under the LAD. Thus, under <em>Campbell, Gore, </em>and <em>Baker, </em>defendants\u2019 actions were reprehensible, despite the absence of physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Next, we must consider the disparity between the actual or potential harm to plaintiff and the punitive-damage award. <em>Campbell, supra, </em>538 <em>U.S. </em>at 418, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1520, 155 L.Ed.2d at 601. \u25a0 The actual harm here was one-fifth the modified punitive-damage award. Defendants urge that such damages may not exceed a one-to-one ratio. Plaintiff contends that such a ratio is not mandated by <em>Campbell </em>and a higher ratio is permitted by the PDA and the LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The Supreme Court \u201cha[s] been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1524, 155 L.Ed.2d at 605 (citations omitted). However, the Court observed that, \u201cin practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1524, 155 L.Ed.2d at 605-06 (noting four-to-one ratio \u201cmight be close to the line of constitutional impropriety\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, \u201c[w]hen compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1524, 155 L.Ed.2d at 606.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u201c[T]he measure of punishment [must be] both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>general damages recovered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1524, 155 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 606. In making that determination, we must recognize that emotional distress damages often contain a punitive element. <em>Id. </em>at 426, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1525, 155 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 606-07. We are satisfied that is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Plaintiff did not suffer any physical harm from the emotional distress he endured nor did he require psychiatric or psychological treatment; yet recovery for such damages is permitted under the LAD. <em>Tarr v. Ciasulli, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>70, 82, 853 A.2d 921 (2004). However, where physical harm and treatment is absent, the risk of a punitive aspect in the damages for emotional distress is greater. As such, we are satisfied that they should have been excluded from the ratio of compensatory to punitive damages, leaving a compensatory-damage base of $493,000. Nonetheless, we are satisfied that the five-to-one ratio here was appropriate based on the conduct we have already discussed and because Werner\u2019s conduct targeted a class of workers, not just plaintiff, and Werner and Avaya displayed a complete disregard of the LAD. This is within the \u201cnormative punishment\u201d of the PDA\u2019s fixed proportional ratio. <em>Baker, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 231, 736 A.2d 462. A one-to-one ratio yielding a $493,000 punitive-damage award would not be sufficient in the future to deter such conduct by Avaya and its managers given the level of defendants\u2019 knowingly unlawful conduct. This is so because punitive damages are \u201caimed at deterrence and retribution,\u201d <em>Campbell, supra, </em>538 <em>U.S. </em>at 416, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1519, 155 L.Ed.2d at 600 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Last, we consider the difference between the punitive damages awarded and the civil penalties authorized by the LAD. <em>Id. </em>at 418, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1520, 155 L.Ed.2d at 601. We recognize that such penalties are not great; however, this is not an isolated act of discrimination but one that was part of a department-wide scheme. We find this comparison not particularly helpful in determining the propriety of the amount of punitive damages. As such, the judgment shall be amended to reduce punitive damages to $2,465,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We next consider defendants\u2019 contention that the judge erred in awarding counsel fees to plaintiff.

Additionally, <em>R.P.C. </em>1.5(a) commands that \u201c[a] lawyer\u2019s fee shall be reasonable.\u201d Under the LAD, a fee-shifting statute, <em>Pinto v.

This is \u201cthe most significant element in the award of a reasonable fee,\u201d and the judge must \u201cevaluate carefully and critically the aggregate hours and specific hourly rates advanced by counsel for the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 661 A.2d 1202. \u201cTrial court[]s should not accept passively the submissions of counsel to support the lodestar amount[J\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Hours not reasonably expended should be excluded. <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Rode v.

They urge such a provision violated <em>R.P.C. </em>1.2(a), which provides, \u201cA lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decision whether to settle a matter.\u201d They claim that plaintiff\u2019s counsel should not be allowed to profit from actions that were contrary to public policy and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The retainer agreement at issue provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">Because we are taking a substantial risk in this litigation and waiving our customary retainer and recognizing that sometimes counsel fees may exceed the value of the case to the litigant, you agree not to accept any settlement figure which would not adequately compensate the Law Firm for the time we have put into the case. In other words, any settlement accepted by you must be approved by the Law Firm as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">There were very few settlement offers.

They cite ... extensive case law standing for the proposition that it is the client and not the attorney who makes the decision as to whether to settle or not.

The Supreme Court of New Jersey has determined that counsel fees to be awarded to a party are determined independently of the rules of fee agreement. <em>Szczepanski v. Newcomb [Med.

Plaintiff certainly could not be expected to bid against such a paltry offer given the extent of plaintiff\u2019s loss and legal fees, and not even considering punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Defendants rely on <em>Heher v. Smith, Stratton, Wise, Heher &amp; Brennan, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>213, 785 A.2d 907 (2001), and <em>Jacob v. Norris, McLaughlin &amp; Marcus, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>10, 34-35, 607 A.2d 142 (1992), to support their position that plaintiff was not entitled to any award of counsel fees in light of the offending language in the retainer agreement. In <em>Heher, </em>our Supreme Court stated that the defendant was \u201cnot permitted to have \u2018the benefits of a covenant that is against public policy and unenforceable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Heher, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 221, 785 A.2d 907 (quoting <em>Jacob, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 35, 607 A.2d 142). However, that action was a partnership-agreement dispute arising from the plaintiffs withdrawal from the firm and the effect to be given a restrictive-covenant provision, <em>id. </em>at 216, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>785 A.2d 907, not a LAD case involving a dispute over fees. <em>Jacob, </em>too, involved a law firm\u2019s partnership agreement containing a restrictive covenant. <em>Jacob, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 14, 607 A.2d 142. We do not find either case instructive here, although we certainly do not disagree with the general proposition that public policy may trump contractual provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The issue here is whether defendants may assert the public policy embodied in <em>R.P.C. </em>1.2(a) to avoid their own statutory obligation to pay attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiff. The Court in <em>Szczepanski </em>made it clear that \u201cthe reasonable counsel fee payable to the prevailing party under fee-shifting statutes is determined independently of the provisions of the fee agreement between that party and his or her counsel.\u201d <em>Szczepanski, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 358, 661 A.2d 1232. Thus, an unenforceable provision in the retainer agreement does not prevent the award of counsel fees pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1 and does not control the fee award that a judge may grant in his or her discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 358-59, 661 A.2d 1232. We thus reject defendants\u2019 argument that the settlement-veto provision in the retainer agreement required denial of plaintiff\u2019s application for counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">We next consider defendants\u2019 argument that the lodestar was excessive because it included hours plaintiffs counsel spent litigating unsuccessful motions and claims wholly distinct from the grounds on which plaintiff prevailed, specifically: (1) plaintiffs unsuccessful motion to disqualify defendants\u2019 counsel, which cost $21,537.50, and (2) plaintiffs dismissed gender-discrimination claim, a claim for which counsel never specified the actual time spent.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">In calculating the lodestar, our Supreme Court has directed judges to exclude hours that (1) are \u201cexcessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary,\u201d or (2) were spent litigating claims \u201cthat were distinct in all respects from claims on which the party did succeed.\u201d <em>Rendine, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 335, 661 A.2d 1202 (cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>tions and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c \u2018[N]o compensation is due for nonproductive time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Copeland v. Marshall, </em>641 F.2d 880, 891 (D.C.Cir.1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Here, the judge found that the hourly rates presented in plaintiffs fee application were appropriate. He then reduced the aggregate hours by the time counsel spent conferencing in the office, nonproductive time. He found that, overall, \u201cdefendants\u2019 unwillingness to provide the necessary discovery in this case\u201d caused many of the problems in the case, which obviously increased plaintiffs counsel fees, and that no reduction was appropriate in this respect. As to the gender discrimination claim, the judge found that \u201cthe predicate facts for age and gender discrimination are virtually identical\u201d and thus not subject to exclusion under <em>Rendine, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 335, 661 A.2d 1202, for time spent litigating distinct claims. Finally, he also rejected defendants\u2019 claim that time spent on unsuccessful motions should be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">We find no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s determination that the lodestar should not be reduced for any time spent on plaintiffs gender discrimination claim. In the context of a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees in an action under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1988, our Supreme Court in <em>Singer v. State, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>487, 489-90, 472 A.2d 138, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>832, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>121, 83 L.Ed.2d 64 (1984), has observed that \u201cif a plaintiffs unsuccessful claims are related to the successful claims, either by a \u2018common core of facts\u2019 or \u2018related legal theories,\u2019 the court must consider the significance of the overall relief obtained to determine whether those hours devoted to the unsuccessful claims should be compensated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 472 A.2d 138 (citation omitted); <em>see also Kluczyk v. Tropicana Prods. Inc., </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>479, 498-500, 847 A.2d 23 (App.Div.2004) (refusing to reduce counsel fees where the plaintiff prevailed on his retaliatory discharge claim but not on his sexual harassment claim due to the overlapping evidence of the claims). We agree with the trial judge that there should be no reduction for time spent litigating the gender discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>However, we come to a different conclusion with respect to the time spent by plaintiffs counsel in moving to disqualify defendants\u2019 attorney. That was not productive time as it did not in any way advance plaintiffs cause. <em>See Rendine, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 335, 661 A.2d 1202. As such, the lodestar must be reduced by $21,537.50 to $822,100.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Last, defendants argue that the twenty-five-percent fee enhancement of $210,909 must be vacated or reduced. First, they urge that the judge mistakenly concluded that an enhancement must be awarded in every case. Second, plaintiffs counsel had mitigated all risks of nonpayment since the retainer agreement included the settlement-veto provision and also gave counsel one-third of the total damages award, making the fee enhancement inappropriate on the facts submitted to the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The retainer agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">(4) If your ease is won or settled, our fee will consist of the higher of the two following figures:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">a. 33-1/3% ... of the total combined recovery of damages, including statutory attorney\u2019s fees. This is in addition to the $5,000 paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">b. Compensation for all time expended at our full hourly rate of $375.00 at the time of final settlement or verdict, plus an enhancement of 100% to compensate us for the risk we are taking. (This applies where defendant pays the fee.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">In deciding the issue before us, we are cognizant of the recent decision by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Perdue v. Kenny </em>A.,-U.S.-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>1662, 176 L.Ed.2d 494 (2010), concerning fee enhancements under federal fee-shifting statutes. There, the Court reaffirmed earlier decisions that fee enhancements are only</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-13\">permitted in extraordinary circumstances____[T]here is a strong presumption that the lodestar is sufficient; factors subsumed in the lodestar calculation cannot be used as a ground for increasing an award above the lodestar; and a party seeking fees has the burden of identifying a factor that the lodestar does not adequately take into account and proving with specificity that an enhanced fee is justified. <em>[Id. </em>at-, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1669, 176 L.Ed.2d at 501-02.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>However, <em>Rendine, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 333-45, 661 A.2d 1202, governs our determination of the issue before us because the New Jersey Supreme Court \u201cwr[o]te on a relatively clean slate in addressing the issue of contingency enhancement of lodestar fees under the LAD.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333, 661 A.2d 1202 (\u201cAlthough we often have incorporated the reasoning of federal cases construing analogous federal statutes in our interpretation of the LAD, we have not been reluctant to depart from federal precedent when we determined it to be inappropriate.\u201d (citation omitted)). The Court observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">Our review of the extraordinary volume of federal litigation on the question of contingency enhancements in determining a reasonable fee under federal fee-shifting statutes demonstrates the need for a clear rule, one that can readily and definitively be applied by trial courts, a rule that will end, not perpetuate, litigation of the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 334, 661 A.2d 1202.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Thus, we are not bound by <em>Perdue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In LAD cases, trial courts should consider the risk of nonpayment in all contingent-fee cases when calculating a fee enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 337, 661 A.2d 1202. Specifically, a trial court should take into account: whether the attorney took the case on a contingency basis; whether the attorney was able to mitigate the actual risk of nonpayment in any way; whether other economic risks were aggravated by the contingency of payment; whether the plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits; and whether the legal risk associated with taking the case served as an economic disincentive, independent of that created by the contingent nature of the fee arrangement. <em>Id. </em>at 338\u201441, 661 A.2d 1202; <em>see also Furst v. Einstein Moomjy, Inc., </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>1, 23, 860 A.2d 435 (2004) (observing that a court should \u201cconsider the result achieved, the risks involved, and the relative likelihood of success in the undertaking\u201d (citation omitted)). Additionally, where the \u201clikelihood of success is unusually strong, a court may properly consider the inherent strength of the prevailing party\u2019s claim in determining the amount of the contingency enhancement.\u201d <em>Rendine, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 341, 661 A.2d 1202 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>After noting that contingency enhancements that double the lodestar represented \u201cthe high end of attorney fee awards under fee-shifting statutes,\u201d <em>'id. </em>at 342, 661 A.2d 1202, the Court \u201cconclude[d] that contingency enhancements in fee-shifting cases ordinarily should range between five and fifty-percent of the lodestar fee, with the enhancement in typical contingency cases ranging between twenty and thirty-five percent of the lodestar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343, 661 A.2d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In his written decision, the judge said that \u201cplaintiffs in contingency cases are presumptively entitled to a contingency enhancement.\u201d That conclusion was incorrect. The <em>Rendirte </em>Court only held that courts should consider the issue of whether a fee enhancement was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 337, 661 A.2d 1202. The Court did not mandate fee enhancements in every LAD contingency case. <em>Gallo v. Salesian Soc\u2019y, Inc., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>616, 660, 676 A.2d 580 (App.Div.1996) (\u201cNowhere does the <em>[Rendine </em>] Court say that a fee enhancement multiplier must be awarded in every case.\u201d). Thus, the judge erred by concluding that an enhancement must be awarded in every contingency fee lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">After erring in this fashion, the judge then considered the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">It should be noted that the award by the jury in this matter was substantial and took into consideration almost every loss alleged by ... plaintiff. Certainly there were risks inherent with the trial of this case. However, if the defense had prevailed on their after-acquired evidence defense or failure to mitigate, the plaintiffs compensatory damages would have been substantially reduced. The Court should also consider whether the result achieved is significant and of public interest. Proving age discrimination by a major corporation is certainly significant. The issue of age discrimination or the factual issues which drove this case were not unique!,] and the law was largely settled. Based on that analysis, the Court finds that a 25% enhancement of the lodestar fee is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">These findings, too, lost sight of the issue to be resolved in this ease. Was a fee enhancement appropriate in this case in light of the fee provided by the retainer agreement? We do not doubt that the economic risks of taking the case were aggravated by the contingency of payment and by the agreement\u2019s requirement that plaintiff, who was already in great debt as a result of his termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>nation, had to pay all litigation costs even if he lost. In fact, the risk was very high that plaintiff would not have been able to pay the litigation costs, given the size of the record, the length of discovery and trial, and plaintiffs other debts. In <em>DePalma v. Building Inspection Underwriters, </em>350 <em>N.J.Super. </em>195, 220, 794 A.2d 848 (App.Div.2002), we explained that \u201cthe risk of losing constitutes an economic disincentive to representing plaintiffs on a contingent basis in employment-related cases, and employees who lose their jobs generally cannot afford representation on any other basis.\u201d We also recognize that, since plaintiff had not been a very highly paid employee, counsel could not have anticipated a large award when they agreed to represent plaintiff. Thus, there was a risk of nonpayment given the nature of plaintiffs claim and the low likelihood of reimbursement for costs incurred. These considerations may be compelling where an attorney may be unable to mitigate his or her risk. <em>Rendine, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 340, 661 A.2d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Nevertheless, counsel here provided for their own \u201cfee enhancement\u201d by obtaining plaintiffs agreement to a contingency fee of one-third of any recovery obtained by plaintiff or a fee enhancement of one-hundred percent, whichever was higher. In this ease, the lodestar, all compensatory damages, prejudgment interest, and punitive damages as modified by this opinion, equal $4,123,378.87 of which counsel are entitled to either one-third, or $1,374,459.62, rather than merely the amount of the lodestar or the lodestar doubled. This yields a fee-enhancement of at least $552,359.12 in excess of the lodestar, an amount equivalent to sixty-seven percent of the lodestar, or double the lodestar. In such a case, an additional fee enhancement was inappropriate and should not have been awarded at all. We express no opinion respecting the enforceability of the fee enhancement provided in the retainer agreement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">[At the direction of the court and for the sake of brevity, Section VI has been omitted from the published version of the opinion.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Affirmed in part, modified in part, reversed in part, and remanded for entry of a judgment in conformity with our decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\"> Gruhin received Individual Performance Factor (IPF) scores of 110 in March 2001 and 110 in September 2001, which placed him in the \"effective\" range.
