(defendant) did not abuse or neglect his ten-month old son, J.H. (hereafter James, a fictitious name), by placing him on a twin bed without rails late at night with a sleeping ten-year old child, A.T. (hereafter Anna, a fictitious name).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a consequence of what defendant concedes was his negligence, James was found by Anna early the next morning on the floor and against a hot radiator, incurring severe burns to his right cheek, left arm, and skull. Defendant argued, and the trial judge agreed, that his conduct did not meet the gross negligence standard applied in actions seeking a determination of abuse or neglect pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(e). <em>See G.S. v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>161, 178, 723 A.2d 612 (1999). We granted leave to appeal and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">On October 28, 2010, a hearing took place for the purpose of determining whether defendant abused or neglected James within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.21(c). The Division presented the testimony of two Division caseworkers and other evidence that revealed the following basic facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">On March 30, 2010, after going out to dinner, defendant, Victoria, and other family members, including James, returned to Victoria\u2019s apartment at approximately 11:00 p.m. The other ehil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>dren were put to bed and James was left in his ear seat, which was carried into and left in a bedroom with the door slightly ajar.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Defendant and Victoria remained up, sitting on a couch in the living room; according to Victoria, she and defendant \u201ctalked and flirted ... kissing and stuff life that.\u201d At approximately 2:00 a.m., when James began to cry, defendant carried him\u2014still in the car seat\u2014to the living room. Later, defendant took James out of the car seat and placed him on a bed in the bedroom with Anna, who was asleep. The twin bed had no rails, and Anna was not awakened nor told James was in the bed with her. After placing James on the bed, defendant closed the door and returned to the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Sometime after 6:00 a.m., Anna awoke and told defendant and Victoria there was \u201csomething[ ] wrong with the baby,\u201d who she found on the floor against a hot radiator. James was taken to the hospital to be treated for his burns; the third-degree burn to James\u2019s head was described as being \u201call the way down to his skull.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Defendant neither testified nor called any witnesses, leaving these facts undisputed. The Family judge concluded that although defendant was negligent, he was not grossly negligent, and he did not act with reckless or wanton disregard for the child\u2019s safety. The judge recognized that defendant \u201cexercised very poor judgment, putting the child on the bed with nothing to prevent the child from falling off the bed, other than a blanket.\u201d He observed that a child of this age should be in a bed with \u201clittle bumpers and little railings and things\u201d to prevent the child from falling but concluded that the act of placing the ten-month old James on a bed without such safety precautions was \u201cnot gross and willful conduct, and [was] certainly not conduct that implies a person has acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others.\u201d Instead, in the judge\u2019s view, this was merely \u201ccommon ordinary negligence\u201d falling short of the statutory definition of an \u201cabused or neglected child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>On October 28, 2010, an order was entered that memorialized the judge\u2019s determination. On November 17, 2010, the Division, joined by the Law Guardian, moved for reconsideration based on the fact that defendant had pled guilty to fourth-degree child neglect, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 and -3, on October 12, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">A judgment of conviction in the criminal matter was entered on December 13, 2010, and the Family judge heard argument on the motion for reconsideration the next day. The judge determined that reconsideration was inappropriate because the guilty plea was something the Division should have been aware of at the time of the fact finding hearing. He also concluded that the statements made by defendant when entering the guilty plea were consistent with the facts adduced at the fact finding hearing in this action and that the guilty plea was not a concession of gross negligence. We granted the Division\u2019s motion for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We agree that the judge\u2019s view of the timeliness of the Division\u2019s presentation of the judgment of conviction, by way of its motion for reconsideration, was somewhat parsimonious considering a child\u2019s well-being was involved. We need not, however, consider that point further. The matter rightfully turns on the conclusion to be drawn from the undisputed facts established at the fact finding hearing that were not contradicted when defendant pled guilty to a criminal offense arising from the same conduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">So viewed, we start by rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that the judge\u2019s findings are entitled to our deference. The facts presented by the Division were undisputed, and the judge\u2019s deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>mination that defendant was negligent but not grossly negligent is a conclusion of law to which we are not required to defer. <em>See Manalapan Realty v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995) (holding that \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference\u201d); see <em>also Estate of Hanges v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>369, 382-83, 997 A.2d 954 (2010); <em>City of Atlantic City v. Trapos, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>447, 463, 992 A.2d 762 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In this matter, the Division was required to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that James was an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d within the meaning of N.J.S.A 9:6-8.21(e) that, in part, is defined as a child whose parent or guardian inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical injury \u201cby other than accidental means\u201d due to the parent or guardian\u2019s failure \u201cto exercise a minimum degree of care.\u201d The <em>G.S. </em>Court determined that the former quoted phrase refers to the circumstances preceding the accident and held that \u201c[wjhere an action is deliberate, and the actor can or should foresee that his conduct is likely to result in injury, as a matter of law, that injury is caused by \u2018other than accidental means.\u2019 \u201d 157 <em>N.J. </em>at 175, 723 A.2d 612. As the Court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\u201c[I]f an intentional act produces an unintended result!.,J\u201d the injury is not accidental. A parent or guardian can commit child abuse even though the resulting injury is not intended. DYFS and the courts must examine the circumstances leading up to the injury to determine whether it was caused by accidental means. The intent of the parent or guardian is irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\"><em>[Ibid.; see also N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. P.W.R., </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>17, 32, 11 A.3d 844 (2011); <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. M.C., III, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>328, 344, 990 A.2d 1097 (2010).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The undisputed facts demonstrate that defendant\u2019s actions in placing James, a ten-month old child, on a twin bed without railings, next to an operating radiator, and with another sleeping child were deliberate, and the events that followed\u2014although not intended by defendant\u2014were not brought about by accidental means.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Of course, as the <em>G.S. </em>Court recognized, not every physical injury caused \u201cby other than accidental means\u201d falls within the parameters of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c). In considering what it means to fail \u201cto exercise a minimum degree of care,\u201d the Court rejected both the Division\u2019s argument that \u201csimple negligence\u201d would suffice and the defendant\u2019s argument that \u201ca willful or purposeful intent\u201d is required. 157 <em>N.J. </em>at 177, 728 A.2d 612. Instead, the Court held that the phrase \u201cwas chosen to capture a middle standard\u201d and \u201crefers to conduct that is grossly or wantonly negligent, but not necessarily intentional,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 177-78, 723 A.2d 612, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">Conduct is considered willful or wanton if done with the knowledge that injury is likely to, or probably will, result. Because risks that are recklessly incurred are not considered unforeseen perils or accidents in the eyes of the law, actions taken with reckless disregard for the consequences also may be wanton or willful. So long as the act or omission that causes injury is done intentionally, whether the actor actually recognizes the highly dangerous character of her [or his] conduct is irrelevant. Knowledge will be imputed to the actor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 178, 723 A.2d 612 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Whether a child is \u201cabused or neglected\u201d is quite frequently \u201cfact sensitive.\u201d <em>P.W.R., supra, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>at 33, 11 A.3d 844. But the facts, as we have already noted, were not disputed. The simple question is whether defendant\u2019s deliberate actions in placing James in the precipitous position revealed by the record represented a reckless disregard for their consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Whether a particular event is to be classified as merely negligent or grossly negligent defies \u201cmathematical precision.\u201d <em>G.S., supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 723 A.2d 612. The Court, however, provided this useful guide: \u201cWhere an ordinary reasonable person would understand that a situation poses dangerous risks and acts without regard for the potentially serious consequences, the law holds him responsible for the injuries he causes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 723 A.2d 612. Certainly, it is a truth universally acknowledged that leaving an infant unattended in a filled bathtub constitutes gross negligence. In contrast, we have found that a mother was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>grossly negligent when she permitted her four- and six-year old children to walk from a playground to \u201ca home that was within [her] view\u201d so one child could change his wet clothes from a water fight and the other could use the bathroom. <em>N.J. Dept. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. J.L., </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>159, 161, 168, 980 A.2d 488 (App.Div.2009). Although the mother had instructed the children to leave the door ajar, the door closed and \u201c[b]ecause the front inside door knob was equipped with a child-proof cover,\u201d the children were unable to open it; they panicked, and the older child telephoned 9-1-1. <em>Id. </em>at 161-62, 980 A.2d 488. We concluded the mother was not grossly negligent and, in fact, recognized that the circumstances revealed the older child \u201cwas well trained by his parents to deal with the crisis that he perceived to exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 980 A.2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">This case, like <em>G.S., </em>presents circumstances somewhere between the extremes of an unattended infant in a filled bathtub and the facts in <em>J.L. </em>In <em>G.S., </em>a child\u2019s caregiver\u2014a worker at a facility for the mentally retarded\u2014upon opening a bottle of medicine prescribed for the child \u201cwas unsure how much she was supposed to administer.\u201d 157 <em>N.J. </em>at 182, 723 A.2d 612. Rather than calling the child\u2019s mother or a pharmacy for clarification, the caregiver administered the entire bottle of medication, <em>ibid., </em>a dosage seventy-eight times the prescribed amount, <em>id. </em>at 166, 723 A.2d 612. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">That conduct clearly rises to the level of wanton or willful. Intelligent adults understand the grave dangers associated with prescription medication. As a medication administrator, G.S. should have been particularly sensitive to the dire consequences that could result from over-medicating a child. Even though she did not intend harm to befall [the child], she utterly disregarded the substantial probability that harm would result from her actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 183, 723 A.2d 612.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">In determining where the case at hand may be found on the continuum suggested by these examples, we reject the conclusion reached by the trial judge that defendant was merely negligent and not grossly negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Defendant intentionally placed James on a twin bed without rails and closed the door behind him. There is some evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the record to suggest that defendant positioned blankets on the bed<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as a means of preventing the child from falling either through the child\u2019s own actions or as a result of the inadvertent actions of another sleeping child. An ordinary reasonable person would understand that leaving the child in these circumstances, behind a closed door, posed a grave risk. If anything, defendant\u2019s alleged unsuccessful attempt to create a blanket buffer between the child and the bed\u2019s edge demonstrates he recognized the inherent danger to the ten-month old child in sleeping on a bed without rails near a radiator.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that \u201can ordinary reasonable person\u201d would understand the perilous situation in which the child was placed, and for that reason, defendant\u2019s conduct amounted to gross negligence and supports the Division and Law Guardian\u2019s contention that the child was abused or neglected within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The order under review is reversed and the matter remanded for the entry of an order in conformity with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\"> A.R. is the mother of James; she is not a party to this action. Defendant and V.H. (hereafter Victoria, a fictitious name) are the parents of one child, N.H., who is eight years old. Victoria is also the mother of Anna.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\"> Defendant\u2019s statements at the plea hearing do not conflict with the Division\u2019s proofs. During the very brief hearing, defendant acknowledged he placed the child on a bed \u201cwithout a safety rail,\u201d \"should have foreseen that something could have happened\" to the child, and did not \u201ckeep an appropriate eye [on the child] to prevent\u201d him from falling off the bed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b574-5\"> As noted earlier, defendant did not testify and, thus, provided no explanation. The fact that he may have placed blankets on the bed so James would not fall comes from the police report admitted in evidence at the fact finding hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b574-6\"> The record supports the contention that, although this was not defendant\u2019s apartment, he was aware of the presence of the radiator. The record is not clear as to whether he understood the radiator was hot, but the judge's findings suggest that he thought it was reasonable to assume\u2014due to the time of year\u2014 that defendant should have known the heat in the apartment was on. Although it was the hot radiator that caused the child\u2019s injuries, obvious danger lurked in the potential for the child to roll off the bed. That the radiator was hot and caused the serious injuries suffered by the child only enhanced the inherently dangerous undertaking.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
