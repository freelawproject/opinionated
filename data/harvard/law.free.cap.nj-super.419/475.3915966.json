Bianchi, </em>Morris County Prosecutor, attorney for appellant <em>(Paula Jordao, </em>Assistant Prosecutor, on the brief).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-12\"><em>Joel M. Harris, </em>attorney for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b504-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b504-14\">SKILLMAN, J.A.D. (retired and temporarily assigned on recall).</author>\n<p id=\"b504-15\">The primary issue presented by this appeal is whether the offense of tampering with physical evidence, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:28-6(1), is \u201can offense involving dishonesty,\u201d which requires the forfeiture of public office or employment under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-16\">Defendant was indicted for possession of heroin, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-10(a)(l); conspiracy to possess heroin, in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2; hindering his own apprehension, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-3(b)(l); and tampering with physical evidence, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:28-6(1). Defendant entered into a plea bargain under which he agreed to plead guilty to the tampering with physical evidence charge, and the State agreed to dismiss the other charges. The parties also agreed to submit the issue of whether tampering with physical evidence is \u201can offense involving dishonesty,\u201d which required defendant to forfeit his employment with the Morristown Department of Public Works, for determination by the trial court. In providing a factual basis for his plea, defendant admitted that when he was approached by the police, he swallowed heroin he had just purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The trial court sentenced defendant to three years of probation. The court also determined that tampering with physical evidence is not \u201can offense involving dishonesty\u201d and therefore defendant was not required to forfeit his public employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The State appeals from the part of defendant\u2019s sentence that denied the State\u2019s application for the forfeiture of defendant\u2019s public employment. Defendant moved to dismiss the State\u2019s appeal on the ground that the State has no right to appeal from a sentence for a fourth-degree offense. We reserved decision on the motion pending consideration of the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">We now conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision denying the State\u2019s application for the forfeiture of defendant\u2019s public employment is appealable. We also conclude that tampering with physical evidence is \u201can offense involving dishonesty\u201d that requires forfeiture of public employment under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The Code of Criminal Justice confers a right upon the State to appeal a sentence only under limited circumstances, which do not include a probationary sentence for a fourth-degree offense. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(f)(2); <em>State v. Veney, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>458, 460-61, 743 A.2d 888 (App.Div.2000). Therefore, the State could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>not have appealed from the part of defendant\u2019s sentence that imposed a probationary rather than a custodial sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">However, a forfeiture of public employment is a \u201ccollateral\u201d rather than a \u201cpenal\u201d consequence of a criminal conviction. <em>Flagg v. Essex Cnty. Prosecutor, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>561, 575, 796 A.2d 182 (2002). Therefore, the general limitations upon the State\u2019s right to appeal from criminal convictions do not apply to this mandatory collateral consequence of a qualifying conviction. <em>State v. Ercolano, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236, 243, 762 A.2d 259 (App.Div.2000), <em>certif. denied, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>635, 772 A.2d 937 (2001). In fact, if a trial court fails to impose this collateral consequence at the time of sentencing, it may subsequently order forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s public employment upon application of the prosecutor or one of the other public officials listed in N.J.S.A 2C:51-2(g). <em>See id. </em>at 243-44, 762 A.2d 259. And although the Code does not contain express authorization for an appeal by the State from a trial court\u2019s denial of a prosecutor\u2019s application for a mandatory forfeiture of public employment, our courts have entertained such appeals as appeals from illegal sentences. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 243, 762 A.2d 259; <em>Flagg v. Essex Cnty. Prosecutor, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>506, 765 A.2d 278 (App.Div.2001), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>561, 796 A.2d 182 (2002); <em>see also State v. Parolin, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 13-14, 770 A.2d 1204 (App.Div.2001) (noting that \u201cthe State may appeal an illegal sentence without express authorization in the criminal code or rules of court\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>223, 793 A.2d 638 (2002). Therefore, we deny defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The forfeiture of \u201cany public office, position, or employment\u201d is a collateral consequence of a conviction for \u201can offense involving or touching such office, position or employment,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a)(2), or for \u201can offense involving dishonesty or of a crime of the third degree or above,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(a)(l). It is undisputed that defendant\u2019s offense did not \u201cinvolv[e] or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>touch[ ]\u201d his employment and thus did not require forfeiture under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(a)(2). Moreover, tampering with physical evidence is an offense of the fourth degree, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-6(1), and thus defendant\u2019s conviction for that offense did not require forfeiture under the second part of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a)(l). The question is whether tampering with physical evidence is \u201can offense involving dishonesty,\u201d which requires forfeiture under the first part of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The offense of tampering with physical evidence is proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:28-6(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">A person commits a crime of the fourth degree if, believing that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">(1) Alters, destroys, conceals or removes any article, object, record, document or other thing of physical substance with purpose to impair its verity or availability in such proceeding or investigation[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">To be found guilty of this offense, a person must be found to have not simply hidden criminal contraband or evidence but to have engaged in conduct that resulted in \u201cthe permanent alteration, loss or destruction of the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Mendez, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>201, 212, 814 A.2d 1043 (2002). Moreover, the person\u2019s purpose in engaging in such conduct must have been \u201cto impair [the physical evidence\u2019s] verity or availability in [an official] proceeding or investigation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:28-6(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">We have previously recognized that \u201can offense involving dishonesty\u201d within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a)(l) includes an offense involving the obstruction of a police investigation or criminal proceeding. In <em>State v. Musto, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106, 456 A.2d 114 (App.Div.1983), we affirmed a Law Division decision which stated that \u201cperjury and false swearing ... constitute offenses involving dishonesty since they reveal an intent to ... deceive.\u201d <em>State v. Musto, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>264, 282, 454 A.2d 449 (Law Div.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">The same is true of the offense of fabricating physical evidence proscribed by the second subsection of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:28-6, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>A person commits a crime of the fourth degree if, believing that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">(2) Makes, devises, prepares, presents, offers or uses any article, object, record, document or other thing of physical substance knowing it to be false and with purpose to mislead a public servant who is engaged in such proceeding or investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>20:28-6(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">This offense, which prohibits the fabrication of false evidence to deceive a public official, is clearly \u201can offense involving dishonesty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Although it may be less self-evident, we reach the same conclusion with respect to the offense of tampering with physical evidence proscribed by the first subsection of <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:28-6, which prohibits the alteration, destruction, concealment or removal of genuine evidence for the purpose of denying investigators access to that evidence, because both offenses involve deceptive conduct designed to obstruct the administration of justice. Indeed, when a tampering offense involves the \u201calteration\u201d rather than the \u201cdestruction\u201d of physical evidence, it is very similar to the fabricating offense proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:28-6(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">This conclusion is supported by <em>Bolus v. Fisher, </em>785 A.2d 174, 178 (Pa.Commw.Ct.2001), <em>aff'd </em>568 <em>Pa. </em>600, 798 A.2d 1277 (2002), in which the court concluded that \u201ctampering with physical evidence is an attempt to obstruct justice and inherently involves dishonesty.\u201d <em>See also Altobello v. Borden Confectionary Prods., Inc., </em>872 F.2d 215, 217 (7th Cir.1989) (holding that a misdemeanor conviction for tampering with an electric meter was a crime of dishonesty under <em>Rule </em>609(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which allows impeachment of a witness based on a conviction for such a crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">We reject defendant\u2019s suggestion that we should consider the alleged mitigating circumstances of his particular offense in determining whether it mandated the forfeiture of his public employment. \u201cA conviction [for an offense involving dishonesty] will trigger the penalty [of forfeiture of public employment] re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>gardless of any mitigating circumstances offered by a defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Lee, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>313, 317, 609 A.2d 513 (App.Div.1992). Therefore, we conclude that defendant\u2019s conviction for tampering with physical evidence, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-6(1), was \u201can offense involving dishonesty\u201d within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the part of the judgment of conviction that denies the State\u2019s application for the forfeiture of defendant\u2019s public employment and remand for entry of an amended judgment of conviction that includes such forfeiture.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
