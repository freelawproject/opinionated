Sometime prior to 1960, it began to make and install metal structures to be used to enclose heating and/or air-conditioning units around the perimeter of buildings. The structures are commonly called enclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The other plaintiff, Modulaire Components Corporation, hereinafter called Modulaire, is a corporation which was organized by Triangle in February, 1962, to handle the sale and installation of Triangle\u2019s enclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The defendant Leonard R. Phillips is an engineer of wide experience in sheet metal work who was employed by Triangle from July 15, 1960, to June 19, 1963, as a heating, air-conditioning and ventilating engineer, and, when Modulaire was organized, he served as its vice-president from February, 1962, to June, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The defendant Renzel L. Byus was employed as a salesman by Triangle from January to December, 1962, and as a salesman for Modulaire from December, 1962, to March, 1963, when he became sales manager of Modulaire and continued in that capacity until October, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The other individual defendants are persons who joined with Phillips, after he left Triangle and Modulaire, to form the defendant corporation, Phillips Air Devices, Inc., in August, 1963, hereinafter called Air Devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Triangle and Modulaire brought this action, claiming that Phillips, in violation of his express agreement with the plaintiffs and in violation of his confidential and fiduciary relation with them, disclosed to Air Devices and the defendants who joined him in forming that corporation secret and confidential information concerning the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>business which those defendants proposed to use to the plaintiffs\u2019 disadvantage; that Phillips and those defendants conspired to appropriate, unlawfully, the plaintiffs\u2019 secret and confidential improvements and advances on their enclosures; that Phillips and those defendants induced Byus to leave the plaintiffs and join Air Devices and that he, in concert with the others, is using confidential information which he obtained while he was in the plaintiffs\u2019 employ to their damage; and that, in soliciting competing business, the defendants have wilfully and fraudulently misrepresented Air Devices\u2019 product and operations in an improper attempt to interfere with the plaintiffs\u2019 business.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to restrain the actions complained of, as well as damages, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, and any other appropriate equitable relief. The trial court found in the defendants\u2019 favor on the conspiracy issue but rendered judgment for the plaintiffs on the other three counts. It enjoined Phillips, Byus, Air Devices and their officers, servants, agents and employees from certain specified activities until August 29, 1965, and awarded the plaintiffs exemplary damages in the form of $12,500 attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">At the start of the trial, the plaintiffs filed, over the defendants\u2019 objection, a substituted complaint which included a claim for reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees which had not been included in the original complaint. There is no dispute that, by it, the plaintiffs sought to recover exemplary damages. A motion to expunge the claim on the ground that the parties had agreed that no new issue was to be injected by the substituted complaint was denied by the court, and that denial is made one ground of appeal. The award of exemplary damages is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>major issue on the appeal, however, and we shall deal with it on a substantive basis as the parties have done rather than from the procedural aspect of the ruling on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The defendants have made a massive attack on the finding, much of which has been abandoned, but an examination of the still substantial portions which are pursued discloses that no corrections which would be of advantage to the defendants can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The enclosures produced by Triangle in 1960 were mainly assembled and welded at the factory. This procedure necessitated the transportation of heavy and bulky units to the jobsite and resulted in a lack of flexibility in installation and adjustment to job conditions. These enclosures had no secret features which were novel to the trade. Triangle\u2019s president wished, however, to develop methods of fabricating enclosures with standardized parts and contacted Phillips pursuant to that objective. Following the discussion, Phillips was engaged to develop such a line of products for Triangle under a written contract, which provided that all matters concerning the development, improvement, advancement and extension of methods, processes, designs, plans, ideas and inventions were to be deemed trade secrets and to be held confidential and secret by Phillips and not disclosed by him during or after his employment and that any disclosure by Phillips would entitle Triangle to injunctive relief. The pertinent provisions appear in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>After extensive experimentation during the first quarter of 1961, Phillips designed what is called the Modulaire enclosure. This was a new type of enclosure, distinguished by a series of interchangeable parts, which could be sent unassembled to the field for easy installation on the job and for easy adjustment to irregularities of job conditions. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>design was unique, not known or used by others, secret and entitled to protection. It permitted Triangle to develop and adopt techniques for mass production. On October 17, 1961, Phillips applied for a patent on the Modulaire enclosure and assigned the patent application to Triangle. Triangle spent more than a year, and over a half million dollars, in solving problems of tooling and manufacturing, cost analysis, packaging, installation methods and price lists for the new enclosure, and production was commenced in March or April, 1962. Phillips was in general charge of the program and had full knowledge of all of Triangle\u2019s methods of design, as well as its practices concerning manufacturing, costs, pricing and bidding.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Byus, who, as already stated, was employed by both Triangle and Modulaire, had acquired full knowledge of the plaintiffs\u2019 costs, pricing, discounting and bidding procedures. As sales manager for Modulaire, he kept a record of Modulaire\u2019s standard pricing methods and another record of prospective jobs known to Modulaire. After he left Modulaire, the latter record could not be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">On June- 19, 1963, Phillips resigned from both Triangle and Modulaire, expressing dissatisfaction with his status in the two companies. On that date he agreed in writing that the improvements, advances and extensions on the enclosure designs on which he had been working belonged to Triangle; that he would sign, and assign to Triangle, all applications for patents on those items and cooperate in prosecuting them at Triangle\u2019s expense; and that, in consideration of a general release given by Triangle and Modulaire, he would not thereafter dislose any of their trade secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">When he left the plaintiffs, Phillips was negotiat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>ing with the defendants Jacob M. Silver, Emanuel M. Silver and Phillip Klein to start a manufacturing business, and, on or about August 7, 1963, they caused Air Devices to be incorporated. Soon thereafter, those defendants decided to produce enclosures without investigating whether, by that course, Phillips would violate his obligations to the plaintiffs or whether the enclosures they proposed to produce differed from the Modulaire enclosure. Phillips designed an enclosure for Air Devices which was an attempted modification of the Modulaire enclosure but contained features proprietary to, and not substantially different from, Modulaire. Knowledge of Triangle\u2019s production and design secrets were necessary in order to produce the essential features of this enclosure. The defendants actually produced no enclosures but were prepared to make them based on and using the Modulaire idea and the plaintiffs\u2019 secrets of design and production.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">On October 12, 1963, Byus left his employment with Modulaire and on October 14, 1963, went to work for Air Devices. He immediately began to bid on projects for Air Devices which he had previously bid on for Modulaire, or with which he had become familiar while he was employed by Modulaire. On some of these projects, Phillips had been instrumental in having the architect incorporate specifications for Modulaire enclosures or features in the plans. At the time of the trial, however, Air Devices had succeeded in obtaining only two small contracts to supply enclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The defendants produced and circulated a brochure to prospective purchasers which is substantially a copy of the plaintiffs\u2019 brochure and which bears a distorted copy of the plaintiffs\u2019 union label <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>although the defendants had neither a union contract nor the right to use the plaintiffs\u2019 union label. They solicited work from contractors with whom Triangle had also bid, representing, in substance, that Phillips had left the plaintiffs and joined Air Devices, which was staffed by former key personnel of Modulaire and which had developed a new, different and improved enclosure design. They bid on ten construction projects, using secret and confidential bidding data developed by the plaintiffs, and, after September, 1963, Modulaire lost eight of its sales representatives, some of whom became selling agents for Air Devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The Modulaire enclosure was unique, and its methods of design, tooling, manufacture and installation were trade secrets and confidential material belonging to Triangle and unknown to its competitors and of which Phillips had complete knowledge. Phillips disclosed to Air Devices and to the other defendants the secret and confidential information concerning the plaintiffs\u2019 business in violation of his agreement and of his confidential relationship with the plaintiffs, and the defendants have appropriated these trade secrets and confidential information. Phillips, Byus and Air Devices wilfully used confidential information concerning the plaintiffs\u2019 price list and bidding procedures and wilfully and deliberately misrepresented to actual and potential customers that Air Devices\u2019 proposed product was an improved Modulaire enclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The court concluded that the plaintiffs were severely damaged as a result of the defendants\u2019 actions but that they had failed to prove their monetary damages with sufficient particularity. It concluded, however, that the plaintiffs were entitled to injunctive relief in certain particulars. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>injunction which was granted, however, expired by its terms on August 29, 1965. The court also concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to exemplary or punitive damages on the third and fourth counts of the complaint and awarded the plaintiffs the reasonable value of the services of their attorneys which was found to be $12,500. The basis on which these damages were computed is not disputed, the issue being only as to whether the plaintiffs were entitled to any judgment for exemplary or punitive damages. The defendants have appealed, claiming that the court erred both in granting injunctive relief and in awarding punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">It is apparent from the facts which have been related that the foundation of the plaintiffs\u2019 case is that Phillips, by a breach of his express contract, and Byus, by a violation of the confidential relationship implicit in his employment by the plaintiffs, have, after the termination of their employment, utilized, in collaboration with the other defendants, confidential information acquired while they were in the plaintiffs\u2019 employ in order to compete with the plaintiffs. The basic principles applicable to the case are so clearly set forth, with supporting authority, in <em>Town &amp; Country House &amp; Homes Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>150 Conn. 314, 189 A.2d 390, as to require no detailed repetition here. Both Phillips and Byus, from the very fact of entering into employment with the plaintiffs, obligated themselves \u201cto exercise the utmost good faith, loyalty and honesty toward . . . [their] principal or employer\u201d. Id., 317. And, regardless of the existence of any express agreement touching the subject sueh as Phillips had made, they could not use a trade secret acquired in the course of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>employment for their own benefit to the detriment of the plaintiffs. Id., 319; <em>Allen Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Loika, </em>145 Conn. 509, 514, 144 A.2d 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The trade secrets involved in the present case fall roughly into two classes, namely, the design of the Modulaire enclosure with its manufacturing and installation procedures, and the financial details of its costs, pricing and bidding. The court found that both classes were fully known to Phillips and that the second was known to Byus. That the items in the first class are trade secrets which Phillips was bound not to disclose is clearly established as between him and the plaintiffs by his own express agreements with them. Those in the second class fully meet the definition of trade secrets set forth in <em>Town &amp; Country House &amp; Home Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 318, so that neither Phillips nor Byus was privileged to disclose them. The trial court concluded that Phillips and Byus did disclose them and granted injunctive relief against Phillips, Byus and Air Devices. This action was proper. Since the particular restrictions imposed by the injunction have long since terminated, it is unnecessary, as this case is presented, to consider the defendants\u2019 attack on the scope of the injunction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Eastern </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>Electric Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>142 Conn. 742, 743, 115 A.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">There remains for consideration the correctness of the court\u2019s action in awarding punitive or exemplary damages in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees. As in the case of the injunctive relief, this portion of the judgment is only against Phillips, Byus and Air Devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The basis for the award of damages is, as in the equity phase of the case, the breach by Phillips and Byus of their contract obligations, express or implied. Punitive damages are not ordinarily recoverable for breach of contract. Restatement, 1 Contracts \u00a7 342; 5 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1077; McCormick, Damages \u00a7 81. This is so because, as lucidly reasoned by Professor Corbin in the passage cited, punitive or exemplary damages are assessed by way of punishment, and the motivating basis does not usually arise as a result of the ordinary private contract relationship. The few classes of cases in which such damages have been allowed contain elements which bring them within the field of tort. It is, of course, settled law that, in certain cases of tort, punitive or exemplary damages may properly be awarded. In Connecticut, however, recovery is limited to an amount which will serve to compensate the plaintiff to the extent of his expenses of litigation less taxable costs. <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>148 Conn. 666, 673, 174 A.2d 122. We have said that punitive damages are allowable in a libel action where malice is established; <em>Proto </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corporation, </em>136 Conn. 557, 571, 72 A.2d 820; in a wanton and malicious assault and battery; <em>Shupack </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>79 Conn. 298, 303, 64 A. 740; <em>Maisenbacker </em>v. <em>Society Concordia, </em>71 Conn. 369, 378, 42 A. 67; and where a wanton and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>wilful injury is proved. <em>Linsley </em>v. <em>Bushnell, </em>15 Conn. 225, 236; see also <em>Beecher </em>v. <em>Derby Bridge S Ferry Co., </em>24 Conn. 491, 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The court concluded that the defendants\u2019 conduct was wilful, as indeed it had to he if they were to embark on a program of competition with the plaintiffs. Neither the third nor the fourth count of the substituted complaint, under which punitive damages were awarded, contains, however, any allegation of a motivating intent or design, actual or constructive, on the part of the defendants to harm the plaintiffs by their conduct. <em>Sharkey </em>v. <em>Skilton, </em>83 Conn. 503, 507, 77 A. 950. Furthermore, the record does not disclose the existence of that \u201cmalicious or wanton misconduct\u201d which would justify an award of exemplary or punitive damages. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>36 Conn. 182, 185; <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>48 Conn. 460, 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The flavor of the basic requirement to justify an award of punitive or exemplary damages has been repeatedly described in terms of wanton and malicious injury, evil motive and violence. <em>Milwaukee &amp; St. P. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Arms, </em>91 U.S. 489, 493, 23 L. Ed. 374; <em>Denver &amp; R. G. Ry. </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>122 U.S. 597, 610, 7 S. Ct. 1286, 30 L. Ed. 1146; <em>Lake Shore &amp; M. S. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Prentice, </em>147 U.S. 101, 107, 13 S. Ct. 261, 37 L. Ed. 97; <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>53 N.H. 342. The Restatement declares that punitive damages may be awarded only for \u201coutrageous conduct, that is, for acts done with a bad motive or with a reckless indifference to the interests of others.\u201d Restatement, 4 Torts \u00a7 908, comment (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">On the record, the court erred in awarding punitive or exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">There is error only as to the portion of the judgment awarding punitive damages, the judgment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment as on file except for the award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In this opinion King, C.
