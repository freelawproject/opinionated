General Statutes \u00a7 46-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The case had been referred to a state referee, who, after a hearing, submitted a report and, at the parties\u2019 request, a finding of subordinate facts. The referee concluded that the defendant\u2019s conduct toward the plaintiff constituted intolerable cruelty. On the plaintiff\u2019s motion, after a hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>defendant\u2019s exceptions to the report, the court accepted the report and granted the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">When the defendant filed his appeal, he requested the court to make a finding. A finding by the court was inappropriate. <em>Dion </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>128 Conn. 416, 417, 23 A.2d 314. We have repeatedly pointed out that in cases where the court hears no evidence it should not make a finding. See, e.g., <em>Wilusz </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>152 Conn. 352, 354, 206 A.2d 841; <em>Gulf Oil Corporation </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>144 Conn. 61, 64, 127 A.2d 48. In the present case, the court erroneously complied with the defendant\u2019s request and made an extensive \u201cfinding,\u201d apparently based on a reading of the transcript of the evidence taken at the referee\u2019s hearing. The errors which the defendant assigns are directed to matters contained in the inappropriate and improper finding. The errors which are assigned in no way challenge the court\u2019s exercise of its function under Practice Book \u00a7 363, and therefore no issues are properly presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
