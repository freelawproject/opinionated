This was based upon the trial judge\u2019s finding that the proponent, in admittedly preparing the decedent\u2019s last will and testament, engaged in the unlawful practice of law. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:170-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Included in the estate were shares of stock in Marmac Oil, a corporation in which Margow and her deceased husband were majority shareholders and which was managed by Peiffer. Margow\u2019s will, dated June 3, 1975 contained the following two clauses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">SEVENTH: I hereby authorize my Executrix herein named to sell, exchange, mortgage and lease any and all of my estate, real and person [sic], in her discretion, at such time and in such manner and on such terms and conditions as she may deem best; to make, execute and deliver any and all papers necessary and proper for the sale, exchange, transfer, conveyance, mortgage and lease thereof, and to do any and all acts in her discretion expedient or necessary to the full execution of this, my Last Will and Testament.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">EIGHTH: I hereby direct that should any vote or other action be required in connection with any stock which I may own at the time of my death, that then and in that event my Executrix herein named shall vote such stock or take such other action with respect thereto as directed by my nephew, DONALD PEIEEER, aforesaid, such action to be only in favor of my said nephew, and not otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Prior to the June 3, 1975 will Margow had executed wills in January 1975, 1974, 1973 and in 1967. Her residuary estate was left outright to Peiffer in the January 1975, 1973 and 1967 wills and was left in trust to him in the 1974 will.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The evidence shows that Kabot, who had been a legal secretary for many years, first met Margow in the early 1960s when Kabot\u2019s employer was involved in the administration of Margow\u2019s husband\u2019s estate. Throughout 1973 and 1974 Margow\u2019s health deteriorated, during which time she and Kabot developed a friendly relationship. In late 1974 Margow expressed her dissatisfaction with lawyers and asked Kabot to make a new will for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Kabot typed a will according to Margow\u2019s wishes. Kabot allegedly refused a bequest and agreed to become Margow\u2019s executrix. When Kabot offered to serve without commission, Margow allegedly violently objected. Kabot presided at the execution of this will on January 16, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In late spring 1975 Margow asked Kabot to change her will so that Peiffer\u2019s interest in Marmac Oil would be fully protected. Thus Kabot prepared the will in question which was substantially the same as the January 1975 will except for the addition of clause Eighth, above. It was executed under Kabot\u2019s supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Kabot offered this will for probate two days after Margow\u2019s death. Some time later she and Peiffer had a discussion in which she suggested that the minority interest in Marmac be bought out. It was then that Peiffer became \"scared\u201d and filed a caveat against the probate of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Prior to trial Kabot filed a motion to dismiss the caveat on the grounds that Peiffer lacked standing. Although we are not sure of the judge\u2019s reasons he obviously found that Peiffer had standing and the order denying the motion was signed December 2, 1975. After a trial the judge found that there was no evidence of undue influence on Kabot\u2019s part, and that although Kabot engaged in the unlawful practice of law by drafting the will it was nevertheless valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>On appeal Kabot essentially contends that (1) there was no sufficient evidence in the record to support the judge\u2019s apparent finding that Peiffer had standing to maintain the caveat, (2) there was no sufficient evidence in the record to support the judge\u2019s finding that she engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, and (3) even assuming that she did engage in the unlawful practice of law, she should not have been denied letters testamentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"> A contestant must demonstrate that he has been aggrieved by the judgment of probate. <em>In re Myer\u2019s Will, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>228, 235 (1955); <em>In re Holibaugh, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>229, 232 (1955); <em>In re Hand\u2019s Will, </em>95 <em>N. J. Super. </em>182, 187 (App. Div. 1967), certif. den. 50 <em>N. J. </em>286 (1967); <em>In re Coleman, </em>27 <em>N. J. Super. </em>532, 535-536 (App. Div. 1953). On the face of the instant will Peiffer receives the same as under the January 1975, 1973 and 1967 wills and more than under the 1974 will. He was not aggrieved by the judgment of probate in this respect. <em>In re Hand\u2019s Will, supra </em>95 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Further, clause Eighth of the instant will is fully consistent with clause Eleventh and Peiffer\u2019s interest in Marmae Oil is fully protected by clause Eighth. Although clause Seventh authorizes the executrix to \u201csell, exchange, mortgage and lease any and all of * * * [the] estate,\u201d clause Eighth absolutely prohibits her from voting or taking any action with respect to decedent\u2019s stock, without the direction of Peiffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Peiffer would not have standing as next of kin as expressed in <em>In re Lent, </em>142 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>21 (E. &amp; A. 1948). Assuming the invalidity of all decedent\u2019s wills, Peiffer would not be entitled to an intestate share because his mother, decedent\u2019s sister, was still alive. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>3A :4-4. We hold that there was a lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the judge\u2019s apparent finding that Peiffer had standing to maintain the caveat.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">We believe that there was sufficient credible evidence in the record to support the judge\u2019s finding that Kabot en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>gaged in the unlawful practice of law by drafting decedent\u2019s will and that that action violated <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:170-78 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:170-80; <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N. J. </em>146, 162 (1964); <em>In re Baker, </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>321 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Although Kabot committed a disorderly persons offense, we do not think that her actions should bar her as executrix. As noted in <em>Holcomb v. Coryell, </em>12 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>289 (E. &amp; A. 1857):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">* * <em>* </em>[tbe executor] is the creature and representative of tbe testator * * *; that a testator has a right to repose confidence in whom he will, and that if he selects as his representative an irresponsible, insolvent person, in the absence of fraud or misconduct, or breach of trust, to require such executor to give security, and thereby to remove him from office, and defeat the will of the testator, is an exercise of power not vested in the court, and a violation of the rights of the executor. [At 296]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">See also, 6 <em>N. J. Practice (Clapp, Wills and Administration), </em>\u00a7 690 at 253 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Aside from being Margow\u2019s \u201ccreature and representative,\u201d we note that Kabot\u2019s actions were not so flagrant to be tantamount to fraud or undue influence. Compare <em>In re Baker, supra. </em>Indeed she was not even a beneficiary under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">We therefore reverse that portion of the judgment that denied letters testamentary to Kabot and awarded letters of administration with the will annexed to Peiffer and remand the matter to the County Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
