J. S. A. </em>55:13A-1 <em>et seq.; </em>and (2) to register their buildings with the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Appellants sought an administrative determination as to whether, under the named statute, the Department had jurisdiction over their private school dormitories. As used in the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law, the terms \u201chotel\u201d and \u201cunit of dwelling space\u201d and \u201cmultiple dwelling,\u201d are defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">The term \u201chotel\u201d shall mean any building, including hut not limited to any related structure, accessory building, and land appurtenant thereto, and any part thereof, which contains 10 or more units of dwelling space or has sleeping facilities for 25 or more persons and is kept, used, maintained, advertised as, or held out to be, a place where sleeping or dwelling accommodations are available to transient or permanent guests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">This definition shall also mean and include any motor hotel, motel, or established guesthouse which is commonly regarded as a motor hotel, motel, or established guesthouse, as the case may be, in the community in which it is located; provided, that this definition shall not be construed to include any building or structure defined as a multiple dwelling in this act, registered as a multiple dwelling with the Commissioner of Community Affairs as hereinafter provided, and occupied or intended to he occupied as such. [N. <em>J. S. A. </em>55 :13A-3 (j)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">The term \u201cunit of dwelling space\u201d or the term \u201cdwelling unit\u201d shall mean any room or rooms, or suite or apartment thereof, whether furnished or unfurnished, which is occupied, or intended, arranged or designed to be occupied, for sleeping or dwelling purposes by one or more persons, including but not limited to the owner thereof, or any of his servants, agents or employees, and shall include all privileges, services, furnishings, furniture, equipment, facilities and improvements connected with the use or occupancy thereof. [N. <em>J. S. A. </em>55 :13A-3(h) ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-12\">The term \u201cmultiple dwelling\u201d shall mean any building or structure of one or more stories and any land appurtenant thereto, and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>portion thereof, in which three or more units of dwelling space are occupied, or are intended to be occupied by three or more persons who live independently of each other, provided, that this definition shall not be construed to include any building or structure defined as a hotel in this act, or, registered as a hotel with the Commissioner of Community Affairs as hereinafter provided, or occupied or intended to be occupied exclusively as such. [IV. <em>J. S. A. </em>55:13A-3 (k) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Regulations promulgated by the Commission of the Department of Community Affairs (Commissioner)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> also define the term \u201chotel.\u201d Thus <em>N. J. A. C. 5:10 </em>\u2014 2.2 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">\u201cHotel\u201d means any building, including but not limited to any related structures, accessory buildings, and land appurtenant thereto, and any part thereof, which: contains ten or more units of dwelling space; or has sleeping facilities for 25 or more persons. This definition shall not be construed to include buildings which are multiple dwellings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">And <em>N. J. A. G. </em>5:10-3.4, designating \u201cUse group classifications\u201d for all hotels or multiple dwellings, or portions thereof, provides, in pertinent part, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">(e) <em>Residential buildings, group L.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">All buildings and structures or parts thereof shall be classified in the residential use group, in which families or households live or in which sleeping accommodations are provided for individuals with or without dining facilities:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">1. <em>Hotels and lodging houses, group L </em>\u2014 l.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">Such structures shall include all buildings arranged with either ten rooms used for sleeping purposes or with facilities for sleeping 25 people including hotels, motels, lodging houses, boarding houses, fraternity houses and dormitories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">The hearing examiner who conducted the Department hearing on the requests for an administrative determination made findings and conclusions and recommended to the Commissioner that the three appellant schools \u201cbe ordered to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>mit the Department to inspect their dormitories as 'multiple dwellings/ \u201d and that they \u201cbe ordered to register their buildings with the Department and pay the required fee.\u201d The Commissioner modified the first part of \u201cthe recommended decision and order of [the] hearing examiner,\u201d by providing that the schools \u201cbe ordered to permit the Department to inspect their dormitories as 'hotels\u2019 rather than 'multiple dwellings/\u201d and adopted the recommended decision and order as thus modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"> Erom our review of the record submitted on this appeal we are entirely satisfied that the Commissioner\u2019s determination is \u201csupported by substantial credible evidence on the whole record, allowing for agency expertise and evaluation of the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Parkview Village </em>Asso. <em>v. Collingswood, </em>62 <em>N. J. </em>21, 34 (1972). We discern no reason or justification for disturbing it. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N. J. </em>146, 162 (1964). The Commissioner\u2019s announced conclusion is sound. It is obviously designed to effectuate the essential purpose and intent of the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law. See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>55:13A-2; <em>Rumson Country Club v. Community Affairs Comm\u2019r, </em>134 <em>N. J. Super. </em>54 (App. Div.), certif. den. 68 <em>N. J. </em>482 (1975). Appellants\u2019 dormitories come within the definition of the term \u201chotel\u201d as defined by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>55:13A-3(j). Considering the remedial nature of the legislation, we are convinced that the term \u201cguests\u201d as used in that section of the legislation was clearly intended to mean and include persons occupying rooms or units for dwelling or sleeping purposes in establishments that provide such facilities on a regular basis. See <em>Baird v. Bradley, </em>109 <em>Cal. App. </em>2d 365, 210 <em>P. </em>2d 1016, 1018 (D. Ct. App. 1952). As we stated in <em>Rumson Country Club, supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">The State\u2019s interest in protecting the health and welfare of its residents by assuring the provision for \u201cdecent, standard and safe units of dwelling space\u201d is equally applicable to private as well as public units.

Super, </em>at 60]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>We find the Department regulations which are included in the provisions of <em>N.
