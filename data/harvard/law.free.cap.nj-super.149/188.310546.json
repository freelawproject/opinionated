A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag-\">Defendant Karl E. Mey appeals from an order supplementing a judgment of divorce. The principal issue is the eligibility for equitable distribution of corpus which became available to defendant husband during marriage as a beneficiary under a testamentary trust created before the marriage. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:34-23. A secondary issue is, assuming said corpus is eligible, whether the trial judge erred in the manner of distributing the assets between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">Defendant was the beneficiary of a testamentary trust created under the will of his grandfather, who died in 1960 when defendant was 12 years old. The corpus of the trust was a farm consisting of approximately 47 acres on which defendant, his mother and his brother and sister resided. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Defendant\u2019s mother was designated as trustee. Under the terms of the will the property or the proceeds of the sale thereof was to be held in four separate trusts for the benefit of each of the three children, all of whom were then minors, and their mother. Discretion was given to the trustee to invade the corpus in order to make advances for the care, support, maintenance and education of the beneficiaries. She was also directed to accumulate the income for herself, individually and as guardian of her children, and to apply so much of it as might be necessary for the same purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The will further provided that as each child attained the age of 31 the accumulated income from such child\u2019s share of the trust would be paid over, and such child would then continue to receive the income until attaining the age of 35, at which time such child\u2019s share of the principal would be distributed to him or her. However, if any child should die before attaining the age of 35, his or her share was to be distributed <em>per stirpes </em>to such issue as might then be living, or, if none was living, should be divided equally among the beneficiaries of the other trusts. Upon distribution to the youngest child, the mother would then be entitled to take the share of the trust estate assigned to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Shortly before his marriage defendant had become 31 and had been paid approximately $40,000 in accumulated income. He continued to receive income from his share of the trust until he reached the age of 35 in October 1973, at which time he was married. Prior to that time he was not entitled to receive his share of the corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The parties were married on November 16, 1968. They had no children. On September 34, 1974 plaintiff wife filed a complaint for divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty. The divorce judgment, which included a distribution of marital assets, was entered on March 35, 1975. Subsequently on July 8, 1975, an order was entered vacating \u201c[a]ll elements of the judgment heretofore entered in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>matter * * * with the exception of the dissolution of the marriage and the award of counsel fees <em>* </em>* *,\u2019\u2019 giving exclusive possession of the former marital residence to plaintiff and further ordering that following discovery the parties were to be afforded a plenary hearing as to the issue of equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">After the hearing pursuant to said order the judge determined that the corpus received by defendant was eligible for equitable distribution. He held that the control date for equitable distribution is \u201cthe date that the person is entitled to receive whatever is left to him.\u201d Defendant appeals from the order, which, reflecting the trial judge\u2019s views, required defendant to pay to plaintiff the sum of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The principal issue is novel. The \u201cequitable distribution\u201d statute is comparatively new and the law construing it is still developing. The pertinent language of the last paragraph of the statute is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\"><em>\u25a0&gt; </em>* <em>r </em>[qqhe court may make such award or awards to the parties, in addition to alimony and maintenance, to effectuate an equitable distribution of the property, both real and personal, <em>which was legally and henefiicially acquired hy them or either of them, (baring the marriage. </em>[Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Defendant contends that, contrary to the trial judge\u2019s determination, he acquired the property, that is, the subject proceeds of the corpus, before his marriage. The acquisition, he says, occurred when his grandfather died and his trust estate came into being; that from that time he became entitled to, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cacquired,\u201d an \u201cinterest\u201d in the estate which was merely held for him until he reached age 25, at which time he \u201chappened to be married.\u201d He relies particularly on <em>Painter v. Painter, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>196 (1974), wherein Justice Mountain, speaking for the court, said (at 217) that <em>\u201call </em>property, regardless of its source, in which a spouse acquires an interest during the marriage shall be eligible for distribution * *</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Thus, he argues that it follows that in a case such as the instant one, where defendant\u2019s interest in the corpus vested upon his ancestor\u2019s death, he acquired that interest before he was married and therefore it was exempt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">As we view <em>Painter, </em>the quoted phrase was written in the context of a discussion of whether any spousal assets were to be excluded by reason of their source, <em>i. e., </em>earned as against gift or other sources. That part of the discussion concentrated on the meaning of the word \u201cacquired.\u201d It did not include the meaning of the phrase \u201clegally and beneficially\u201d in connection with the word \u201cacquired.\u201d Justice Mountain expressed the court\u2019s realization that the \u201cgeneral governing rules\u201d set forth in the opinion would not provide all the answers to the myriad of problems which could be anticipated. So \u201c[i]ndividual problems must be solved, as they arise, within the context of particular eases.\u201d <em>Painter, supra, </em>n. 7 at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">As will be noted, other cases following <em>Painter </em>were concerned with the meaning of \u201clegally and beneficially.\u201d We find that generally their interpretations accord with our own view of the meaning and intent of that phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">It is settled that the concept of vesting of property interests is \u201cclearly in no way relevant to the question of effecting an equitable distribution * * <em>Stern v. Stern, </em>66 <em>N. J. </em>340, 348 (1975). The court, however, intimated that not all \u201cfuture interests may qualify as 'property\u2019 within the meaning of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:3A-23.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349. This constituted a recognition by the court that not all \u201cproperty\u201d was eligible. The court\u2019s language suggests to us that what property was eligible depended purely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>whether it qualified as such within the phrase \u201clegally and beneficially acquired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We cannot treat \u201clegally and beneficially\u201d as surplusage. If it were, eoncededly all property, regardless of whether it was legally and beneficially acquired, would be considered as \u201cacquired\u201d when a spouse became entitled to an interest \u2014 as is contended here by defendant. \u201cProperty\u201d projects broad forms of ownership. As stated by defendant, \u201cit is obvious that many different forms of ownership are included [within the meaning of the word], such as absolute ownership, beneficial ownership, defeasible ownership, joint ownership, ownership subject to a reversion, <em>etc.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>1 :l-2 states that the enumerated words and phrases thereunder, when used in any statute,</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">[u]nless it be otherwise expressly provided or there is something in the subject or context repugnant to such construction * <em>* </em>!! shall have the meaning herein given to them.</p>\n<p id=\"Aee\"><em>:',i I'r </em># H* ii* \u2756</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\"><em>Personal property. </em>\u201cPersonal property\u201d includes goods and chattels, rights and credits, moneys and effects, evidences of debt, choses in action and all written instruments by which any right to, interest in, or lien cr encumbrance upon, property or any debt or financial obligation is created, acknowledged, evidenced, transferred, discharged or defeated, in whole or in part, and everything except real property as herein defined which may be the subject of ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"AkB\">*\u00ab'*\u00ab\u2022****</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\"><em>Real estate; real property. </em>The words \u201creal estate\u201d and \u201creal property,\u201d include lands, tenements and hereditaments and all rights thereto and interests therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">But we must give effect to the phrase \u201clegally and beneficially.\u201d <em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary </em>(1971) defines \u201clegal\u201d as \u201cconforming to or permitted by law.\u201d It defines \u201cbeneficial\u201d as \u201creceiving or entitling one to have or receive in one\u2019s own right and for one\u2019s benefit an advantage, use or benefit * * In the sense of these definitions we regard the phrase \u201clegally and beneficially,\u201d as did the trial judge, to mean that the spouse acquires the property within the intention of <em>N. J. S. A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>2A :34-23 when he or she acquires a title which carries with it the effective power to control or use or enjoy. <em>Cf. Packard-Bamberger, etc. v. Oakland Boro. Council, </em>87 <em>N. J. Super. </em>92 (App. Div. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">We perceive no cogency in defendant\u2019s further argument that before the marriage date defendant might have sold his interest for an actuarially discounted price, \u201cin which [event] the issue at hand would never have arisen since no distribution would have been made to the husband during the marriage.\u201d'We are not called upon to deal with that situation. That he might have sold his interest is not equivalent to a right to use or enjoy the trust corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><em>Gauger v. Gauger, </em>132 <em>N. J. Super. </em>89 (Ch. Div. 1975), aff\u2019d 138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>366 (App. Div. 1976), eertif. granted 70 <em>N. J. </em>524 (1976), contrary to defendant\u2019s belief, does not provide a \u201cmost compelling analogy\u201d for his view. It provides additional support for the trial judge\u2019s ruling. That case held that real estate acquired as joint tenants by the husband and his mother in 1941, before the former\u2019s marriage, was not eligible for distribution under the statute although the mother died during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The principal theme of defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Gauger </em>furnishes such analogy is that it demonstrates that although the husband\u2019s \u201cfuture interest in his mother\u2019s joint interest could have been defeated, <em>inter alia, </em>by his prior death * * nevertheless the court held that he had acquired the property before the marriage. This argument overlooks the real basis for the decision, which is that the husband\u2019s right to the beneficial use of the jointly held property commenced with the grant to him and his mother, not with the death of his mother. <em>Babbitt v. Day, </em>41 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>392 (Ch. 1886); 48 <em>C.J.S. Joint Tenancy </em>\u00a7 7 at 930. The Appellate Division, in affirming, said: \u201cThe trial judge found for defendant since he concluded that defendant acquired his <em>entire </em>interest in the realty in 1941.\u201d 138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 367 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>In <em>Pellegrino v. Pellegrino, </em>134 <em>N. J. Super. </em>512 (App. Div. 1975), the husband\u2019s contributive share in a pension fund was held to be eligible for allocation under the statute, since it was refundable to him \u201cshould he resign or be dismissed prior to qualifying for a benefit.\u201d He had the legal right to resign and to enjoy the use of the fund. <em>Tucker v. Tucker, </em>121 <em>N. J. Super. </em>539 (Ch. Div. 1972), was held to be factually inapposite because \u201c[t]here the husband made no contributions to the private employer\u2019s incentive compensation and pension plan and consequently <em>had no right of withdrawal before retirement.\u201d </em>134 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 516. (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><em>White v. While, </em>136 <em>N. J. Super. </em>552 (App. Div. 1975), held that the husband\u2019s interest in a pension plan to which he \u201cmade no contribution * * * and consequently had no right of withdrawal\u201d was not eligible. The plan in that case gave the husband the right to receive retirement income in the future, contingent upon either (1) becoming totally and permanently disabled, or (2) voluntarily terminating his employment (having attained the age of 40 and completed at least ten years of service), receiving a pension starting as early as age 55, or (3) retiring between the ages of 55 and 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\"><em>Blitt v. Blitt, </em>139 <em>N. J. Super. </em>213 (Ch. Div. 1976), involved a husband\u2019s noncontributory pension and profit-sharing plans, but considered as one plan by the court. The judge hold that one-half of the full contribution to the plan which was made by the .husband\u2019s employer was eligible, \u201chad vested\u201d <em>(i. e., </em>that \u201cdefendant had an absolute right to $24,500 as of the date the complaint was filed\u201d), and \u201c[t]his plan, despite its noncontributory aspect, \u2022 is quite similar to the plan considered in <em>Pellegrino v. Pellegrino, supra, </em>which specified that \u201cThese moneys are returnable to the member should he resign or be dismissed prior to qualifying for a benefit.\u2019 \u201d At 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">We agree with the statement of the court. in <em>Blitt v. BUM, </em>in commenting upon the <em>Pellegrino </em>decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>* * * Henee, it is quite clear that the propriety of subjecting the proceeds of the plan to distribution was based not on the source of the contribution but rather the nature of the interest and defendant\u2019s control over it. * * [139 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 218 emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><em>Kruger v. Kruger, </em>139 <em>N. J. Super. </em>413 (App. Div. 1976), held retirement and disability benefits which the husband \u201chas become irrevocably entitled to receive for the balance of his life constitute assets subject to equitable distribution to the extent that his entitlement thereto is based upon military service rendered during the existence of the marriage.\u201d At 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Likewise, stock options to which a husband was entitled as a corporate executive were held eligible for distribution on the basis that the stock options represent property which \u201calthough not cash in hand, is not subject to a contingency, has reasonably discernible value and awaits but the owner to take actual possession.\u201d <em>Callahan v. Callahan, </em>142 <em>N. J. Super. 325, 328 </em>(Ch. Div. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Neither <em>DiTolvo v. DiTolvo, </em>131 <em>N. J. Super. </em>72 (App. Div. 1974), nor <em>Hughes v. Hughes, </em>132 <em>N. J. Super. 559 </em>(Ch. Div. 1975), supports a different view. <em>DiTolvo </em>held that the proceeds of a husband's personal injury-negligence cause of action which arose during the marriage was subject to distribution. <em>Hughes </em>held similarly as to a worker's compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The holdings in <em>DiTolvo </em>and <em>Hughes </em>were premised upon the accrual of the right to recovery during coverture and are consistent with a determination that in each case the causes of action are property legally and beneficially acquired during the marriage. Contrary to the situation in the case at bar, where defendant had no control over the corpus until he attained age 25, which was during the marriage, the husbands in <em>DiTolvo </em>and <em>Hughes </em>did have such control. The delay or passage of time in enforcing the claims is of no moment; such delay is mechanical, not caused by the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>of the claim but by unrelated considerations. Ideally, personal injury claims, workers\u2019 compensation claims, contractual claims and all other asserted rights should be resolved without delay. But pragmatically the volume of work in our courts, required time for discovery, availability of attorneys, etc., do not permit of such speedy dispositions. Similarly, the liquidation of a partnership interest as in <em>Stern v. Stern, supra, </em>would also require delay for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">We conclude that defendant\u2019s share in the corpus of his grandfather\u2019s estate was not legally and beneficially acquired until he attained the age of 25. Since he was at that time married, the proceeds were eligible for equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We turn now to the secondary issue \u2022 \u2014 \u2022 whether the trial judge erred in the manner of distributing the assets. The judge directed that the division of the net assets amounting to $28,000 be $20,000 to plaintiff and the balance to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We have carefully reviewed the record and find that there was sufficient credible evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s findings and that the guidelines enunciated in <em>Painter v. Painter, supra, </em>were reasonably followed. <em>State v. Johnson, 42 N. J. </em>146 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The judgment from which the appeal was taken is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">We agree that the testamentary gift was vested and in equity would be considered as a direct bequest to him as a <em>cestui que trust. Wendell v. Hazel Wood Cemetery, </em>7 <em>N. J. Super. </em>117 (App. Div. 1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b221-9\">Matthews, P. J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A_\">(concurring). I agree substantially with Judge Horn\u2019s opinion and concur that the judgment below should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">I think that the major source of difficulty each of us had in resolving this appeal is the somewhat sweeping language found in <em>Painter v. Painter, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>196 (1974) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">We therefore hold the legislative intent to be that <em>all </em>property, regardless of its source, in which a spouse acquires an interest during the marriage shall be eligible for distribution in the event of divorce, [at 217]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>I do not believe that this paragraph should be read as literally as Judge Seidman apparently does, nor quite as freely as does Judge Horn.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">I do not believe that anyone can dispute that plaintiff's interest in the trust <em>res </em>in question was \u201cvested,\u201d <em>Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Rowland, </em>99 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>72 (Ch. 1926), subject to defeasance by his death prior to attaining the age of 25. See, generally, 6 <em>N. J. Practice Clapp, Wills and Administration, </em>\u00a7 579; 2A <em>Powell on Real Property, </em>\u00b6 332. The fact of vesting, however, is of no real consequence in resolving the issue presented. Indeed, contingent interests where the contingency goes to the event rather than the identity of the taker may be described as vested in the sense that it is transmissible or assignable. <em>Van Dyke\u2019s adm\u2019r. v. Vanderpool\u2019s adm\u2019r., </em>14 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>198 (Ch. 1862); <em>Kahn v. Rockhill, </em>132 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>188 (Ch. 1942); <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46:3-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In my view, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A :34-23 cannot be read to require that every interest in property acquired during a marriage by a party thereto is subject to equitable distribution. To so read the statute would be to ignore the words \u201clegally and beneficially\u201d used therein. Eor example, if a spouse should qualify as a trustee of a trust during his or her marriage, the legal interest held by the spouse in the corpus would not be subject to equitable distribution in the event of divorce; yet the spouse does have an \u201cinterest\u201d in the property constituting the corpus. Again, assume that a spouse is named beneficiary of a trust to receive the income in such amounts as the trustee shall in his sole discretion deem necessary for the - beneficiary's support; the availability of that beneficial interest for equitable distribution would be at best, highly doubtful. Compare <em>Gardner v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>76 <em>N. H. </em>481, 84 <em>A. </em>935 (Sup. Ct. 1912), with <em>Eaton v. Eaton, </em>82 <em>N. H. </em>216, 132 <em>A. </em>10 (Sup. Ct. 1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">While I am not unmindful of the fact that there is no surer way to misread a statute than to read it literally, I cannot read the words \u201clegally and beneficially\u201d other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>in the eonjunethe<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 certainly not in the factual context presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Defendant here was given a \u201cvested\u201d interest in his share of the farm trust on the death of his grandfather, the testator-settlor. He cannot, however, in my view, be said to have \u201cacquired\u201d the principal or corpus of the trust then. His acquisition of the corpus or principal came about when he became the legal <em>and </em>beneficial owner \u2014 on his twenty-fifth birthday; on that day he became entitled to the distribution of the corpus or principal by virtue of the elimination of the condition of defeasance \u2014 survival to age 25. Whereas at the time of his grandfather\u2019s death (and under these facts, prior to his marriage to plaintiff) he had only the beneficial interest in the trust corpus or principal, the legal interest then being in his mother as trustee. What he <em>acquired </em>at the time of his grandfather\u2019s death was a limited right to the income earned on the trust corpus or principal which became absolute at age 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Contrary to the assumption of our dissenting brother, we do not conclude that an interest which is merely beneficially owned or an interest which one may have in property but which is not subject to present enjoyment is not subject to valuation in considering the allocation of assets for purposes of equitable distribution. The resolution of valuation in such cases will invariably involve the remoteness of the interest, as the <em>Rinehart, Ilix </em>and <em>Loeb </em>cases, which he cites, point out. We are here concerned with when an interest in certain property was legally and beneficially <em>acquired.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Again, in <em>Pellegrino v. Pellegrino, </em>134 <em>N. J. Super. </em>512 (App. Div. 1975); <em>Blitt v. Blitt, </em>139 <em>N. J. Super. </em>213 (Ch. Div. 1976), and <em>White v. White, </em>136 <em>N. J. Super. </em>552 (App. Div. 3975), the question presented involved contributions or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the absence thereof to a pension plan and not the ultimate benefits which would be acquired on retirement. <em>Callahan v. Callahan, </em>142 <em>N. J. Super. </em>325 (Ch. Div. 1976), involved the present value of unexercised options to purchase stock which had a present value and which were acquired by the husband. It did not, however, involve the shares that might be <em>acquired </em>in the future by the exercise of the options. Finally, both <em>Di Tolvo v. Di Tolvo, </em>131 <em>N. J. Super. </em>72 (App. Div. 1974), and <em>Hughes v. Hughes, </em>132 <em>N. J. Super. </em>559 (Ch. Div. 1975), involved causes of action (personal injury and worker\u2019s compensation) which had been acquired by the husbands there involved by virtue of tortious injury to each. What remained in each case was the valuation of each claim not its existence.

The issue involved appears to be one of first impression not only in this State but also in other jurisdictions whose matrimonial statutes provide for the distribution of marital property in the event of a divorce. It is the eligibility for equitable distribution of the corpus of a testamentary trust of which defendant husband was the beneficiary, where the trust was created prior to the marriage and terminated during the marriage but before the filing of the divorce complaint. The trial judge held that it was eligible for distribution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>included the corpus, or balance thereof, among the assets available for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">My colleagues agree with the result reached and have accordingly voted to affirm the judgment under review. I come to an opposite conclusion for reasons which follow and am therefore constrained to dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The underlying facts are fully set forth in the majority opinion and require no repetition.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The thrust of defendant\u2019s argument is that since the \u201cbeneficial interest in the trust herein was clearly property with value in which the beneficiary-future husband \u2018acquired an interest\u2019 prior to marriage,\u201d the corpus, though received by him after the marriage, was not eligible for distribution. He reasons in reverse that if he had been married at the inception of the trust and divorced thereafter but prior to the age of 25, his trust interest would have been distributable as an interest acquired during the marriage. The conclusion reached is that in this ease \u201cthe husband\u2019s expectancy \u2014 the absolute right to the trust property at age twenty-five \u2014 accrued prior to the marriage and was clearly more certain than a mere chose in action requiring litigation and adjudication or settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that defendant could not have exercised control over or gained access to the corpus prior to age 25, and that the nature of his interest in the trust was not such that he could be considered to have \u201cacquired\u201d ownership of it for the purpose of equitable distribution. This view is the one that the trial judge seems to have adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Based upon their concept of the statute in question, my colleagues conclude that defendant\u2019s \u201cshare in the corpus\u201d of his grandfather\u2019s estate was not \u201clegally and beneficially acquired\u201d until he attained the age of 25, at which time the marriage still subsisted. My position is that defendant acquired the property prior to the marriage within the meaning of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:34-23, hence, it was not subject to distribution as an incident to the divorce proceedings. The gulf which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>separates us is the interpretation to be given to that clause of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:34r-23, particularly the emphasized portion, which, in pertinent part, empowers the court in all actions for divorce \u201cto effectuate an equitable distribution of the property, both real and personal, <em>which was legally and beneficially acquired </em>by them or either of them during the marriage.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The dearth of helpful precedents elsewhere is no doubt largely attributable to wide variations in statutory provisions in the divorce laws of the several states, ranging from no distribution at all of marital property, as in New York, to the distribution of all property, whether acquired before or after the marriage, as in Kansas. At these extremes it is evident that the problem confronting us here would not arise. Nor would it arise in those states having community property systems, for there property owned by each spouse before marriage remains separate, and while that acquired during the marriage becomes community property, constitutional and statutory provisions exclude' any gift, inheritance, devise or bequest received by one spouse alone during the marriage, <em>de Funiak, Principles of Community Property, </em>\u00a7 69 at 171-174; <em>Baxter, Marital Property, </em>\u00a7 11:1 at 173. The Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act, thus far adopted in whole or in part by only a bare handful of states, provides for the division, in \u201cjust proportions\u201d based upon enumerated factors, ,of marital property, which is defined as property acquired by either spouse subsequent to the marriage, but excluding, among other things, property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or descent. 9 <em>Uniform Laws </em>Annotated <em>(Matrimonial, Family and Health Laws), </em>490 (1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>As indicated, onr statute limits the distribution of property in divorce actions to that which was acquired by either or both spouses during the marriage. It is unique, however, in its use of the words \u201clegally and beneficially\u201d in relation to the property so acquired. Those words do not appear, so far as I have been able to ascertain, in any other statutory provision for the distribution of marital property in divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">There is no legislative history to aid us in construing our statute. The Divorce Law Study Commission, in its <em>Final Report to the Governor and the Legislature, </em>dated May 11, 1970, left for future study by \u201ca fully funded, fully authorized entity\u201d a number of problems, among which was the question of the \u201cfair allocation of property upon termination of a marriage by divorce.\u201d <em>Report, </em>at 13-14. The bill to revise the divorce laws, as originally introduced, did not include any provision respecting marital property. The only reference to the matter occurred during the public hearing on the bill before the Assembly Judiciary Committee, when the New Jersey Commissioner on the Uniform Laws recommended that the uniform statute on divorce be adopted. The inclusion of a provision for the equitable distribution of marital property seems to have come about as the result of a Senate amendment, without further explanation. See <em>Painter v. Painter, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>196, 207, 217 (1974). See also Comment, \u201cPainter v. Painter: Equitable Distribution of Marital Assets Upon Divorce,\u201d 48 <em>Temple L. Q. </em>397 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Underlying the statutory scheme, however, is the recognition that each spouse contributes something \u201cto the establishment of the marital estate even though one or the other may actually acquire the particular property,\u201d and therefore, in the event of divorce, \u201ceach spouse should receive his or her fair share of what has been accumulated during the marriage.\u201d <em>Chalmers v. Chalmers, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>186, 194 (1974). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>But property owned by either spouse at the time of the marriage, as well as subsequent increments in value (unless contributed to by the other spouse or for which the husband and wife are jointly responsible), will not qualify as an asset eligible for distribution, nor will the \u201cincome or other usufruct derived from such property,\u201d or any asset \u201cfor which the original property may be exchanged or into which it, or the proceeds of its sale, may be traceable.\u201d <em>Painter v. Painter, supra </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>at 214 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">It is readily evident that the key words to be considered are \u201cproperty,\u201d \u201cacquired\u201d and \u201clegally and beneficially,\u201d as they are used in the context of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">As for \u201cproperty,\u201d <em>Pavnter, </em>without further defining the word, held the legislative intent to be that <em>all </em>property, regardless of its source, in which a spouse <em>acquired an interest </em>during the marriage, should be eligible for distribution in the event of a divorce. 65 <em>N.J. </em>at 217. A definition of \u201cproperty\u201d is found in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>1:1 \u2014 2, which states that the enumerated words and phrases thereunder, when used in any statute, \u201c[ujnless it be otherwise expressly provided or there is something in the subject or context repugnant to such construction * * * shall have the meaning herein given to them\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\"><em>Personal property. </em>\u201cPersonal property\u201d includes goods and chatels, rights and credits, moneys and effects, evidences of debt, choses in action and all written instruments by which any right to, interest in, or lien or encumbrance upon, property or any debt or financial obligation is created, acknowledged, evidenced, transferred, discharged or defeated, in whole or in part, and everything except real property as herein defined which may be the subject of ownership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">$ 4* $ *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\"><em>Real estate; real property. </em>The words \u201creal estate\u201d and \u201creal property,\u201d include lands, tenements and hereditaments and all rights thereto and interests therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">We find nothing in the language of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:34\u2014 23 that is inimical to these all-embracing definitions of property, real and personal. <em>Painter </em>is clearly in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The word \u201cacquired\u201d was considered in <em>Painter, </em>though in a particular setting. There the issue was whether the legislative intent was to limit marital property eligible for equitable distribution to that which was \u201cattained by the individual by his own efforts,\u201d as the statute had been construed by the trial judge, thus excluding gifts and inheritances. The Supreme Court held that the Legislature used the word in a more comprehensive sense to include not only property title to which was the direct or indirect result of an expenditure of effort on the part of a spouse, but also assets title to which was received by gift or inheritance, or in any other way. 65 <em>N. J. </em>at 215. The court said, further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">Had the former, more restrictive meaning been intended, we believe that some confining language would have been employed to manifest this purpose. It is certainly a commonplace to say that property has been acquired by gift or that an asset has been acquired by inheritance. In fact the thought is probably most often expressed in this fashion. We think the word should be given this more inclusive meaning in the statute, absent any indication to the contrary, [at 215]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Thus far, it seems evident from <em>Painter </em>that \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201cacquired\u201d are to be construed expansively. While the words \u201clegally and beneficially,\u201d as used in the statute, have not yet been defined in any reported case, no rational ground has been demonstrated for treating them restrictively. My colleagues extract from a standard dictionary a definition of \u201clegal\u201d as \u201cconforming to or permitted by law,\u201d and, of \u201cbeneficial,\u201d as \u201creceiving or entitling one to have or receive in one\u2019s own right and for one\u2019s own benefit an advantage, use or benefit * * It is hazardous to define words in a statute by selective recourse to a dictionary. No doubt the above is one meaning of \u201clegal,\u201d but the sense there is in contradistinction to \u201cunlawful\u201d or \u201cillicit,\u201d concepts which have nothing to do with the subject-matter of the statute. The definition of \u201cbeneficial\u201d is, however, closer to the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The point is that the words \u201clegally and beneficially\u201d are used in tandem with the words \u201cproperty acquired.\u201d There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>is a long-standing maxim of statutory construction that the meaning of words may be indicated and controlled by those with which they are associated. <em>Germann v. </em>Matriss, 55 <em>N. J. </em>193, 220 <em>(1970); Boileau v. De </em>Cecco, 125 <em>N. J. Super. </em>263, 267 (App. Div. 1973), aff\u2019d 65 <em>N. J. </em>234 (1974). Furthermore, referential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent. <em>State v. </em>Wean, 86 <em>N. J. Super. </em>283, 288 (App. Div. 1965); <em>State v. </em>Congdon, 76 <em>N. J. Super. </em>493, 502 (App. Div. 1962); 2A Sutherland, <em>Statutory Construction </em>(4 ed. 1973), \u00a7 47.33 at 159. Clearly, then, the words \u201clegally and beneficially\u201d must relate to, and thus be construed in the context of, property and its acquisition. We know from <em>Painter </em>that <em>all </em>property in which a spouse acquired <em>an interest </em>during the marriage should be eligible for equitable distribution. The converse must follow logically, namely, that any property in which a spouse acquired an interest prior to the marriage is not eligible for equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">I agree with my colleagues that \u201clegally and benefically\u201d cannot be treated as surplusage. But this adds no support to their interpretation of the words as meaning that \u201cthe spouse acquires the property within the intention of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:34-n23 when he or she acquires a title which carries with it the effective power to control or use or 'enjoy.\u201d The statute refers neither to title nor to effective control, nor does it require that the property be reducible to immediate possession. It deals with property acquired by a spouse, and property, by definition, includes all interests therein without distinction, and regardless of their characterization either as legal or beneficial. Why property must have the further attribute of \u201ceffective power to control\u201d or be reducible to immediate possession in order to qualify for distribution in matrimonial eases .is not explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">It is well to heed the dictum in <em>Stern v. </em>Stern, 66 <em>N. J. </em>340, 348 (1975),, which cautioned -us to be wary of the term \u201cvested interest,\u201d in the context of equitable distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tion of property under the divorce statute, as a relic of feudal days which, though playing an important part in the development of the law of future interests, was not relevant to the question of equitable distribution. True, <em>Stern </em>left for another day the \u201cimportant and possibly difficult\u201d question as to what <em>future interests </em>may qualify as property within the meaning of the divorce statute (an issue not involved here), but it emphasized that the statute made no reference to the <em>vesting </em>of an interest in property (nor, indeed, to title to property), but merely required that property, to be available for equitable distribution, had to be acquired during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">I find no suggestion in <em>Stern </em>that a fixed, present interest in property, such as the one under review, should not be eligible for equitable distribution simply because the owner may not have had the power of \u201ceffective control\u201d over it or cannot immediately reduce it to possession. Nor do I discern jn the court\u2019s intimation that not all \u201cfuture interests may qualify as \u2018property\u2019 \u201d within the intendment of the statute, any recognition by the court that not all \u201cproperty\u201d is eligible for equitable distribution. Eather, I sense in the foregoing no more than a postponement for later consideration of the issue of whether certain \u201cfuture interests\u201d may not be property at all, insofar as the divorce statute is concerned. Beyond this, there is nothing in <em>Stern </em>which even remotely supports the majority's concept that the language therein \u201csuggests to us that what property was eligible depended purely on whether it qualified as such within the phrase \u2018legally and beneficially acquired.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">That which I perceive to be the intendment of the dictum in <em>Stern </em>is illustrated by several cases in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In <em>Marriage of </em>Rinehart, 552 <em>P. </em>2d 1346 (Or. App. Ct. 1976), the husband contended, among other things, that in making provision for the division of property in the divorce decree, the court erred in assigning a value to his one-half interest in his mother\u2019s home, which was sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ject to her life estate. He argued that as his mother was still alive and he could not therefore presently enjoy the home it was of little or no value. The court disagreed, holding that the remainder interest was a valuable asset, despite the fact that the placing of an exact value on it might be difficult. A comparable result was reached in <em>Marriage of Hix, </em>27 <em>Or. App. </em>197, 555 P. 2d 811 (Ore. App. Ct. 1976), where the asset involved was a one-sixth interest in a ranch which the husband had inherited during the marriage, subject to his father\u2019s life estate, and from which the husband would receive no income during his father\u2019s lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">On the other side of the coin is <em>Loeb v. Loeb, </em>261 <em>Ind. </em>193, 301 <em>N. E. </em>2d 349 (Ind. Sup. Ct. 1973), which involved an <em>inter vivos </em>trust established for the benefit of the grantor\u2019s three children, one of whom was defendant husband. The trust instrument provided for the payment of the income to the grantor for life, and upon her death the principal and accumulated income would be divided equally among the children; provided, however, that if any child predeceased the grantor, that child\u2019s share could be distributed to the survivors. The mother was still alive at the time of the divorce proceedings. On these facts, the court held that the husband\u2019s interest was not includible in the property settlement award because he had no present interest of any value, his future interest being contingent upon his surviving his mother. See also, <em>Storm v. Storm, </em>470 P. 2d 367 (Wyo. Sup. Ct. 1970); <em>DeRevere v. DeRevere, </em>5 <em>Wash. App. </em>446, 488 P. 2d 763 (App. Ct. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">I advert to my recurring theme that as long as the claimed asset is property as defined in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>1 :l-2, it matters not whether the interest was acquired \u201clegally\u201d or \u201cbeneficially.\u201d I do not read those words in the conjunctive, nor is there any compelling reason to do so. The decisive factor is whether the interest was a fixed, present one acquired during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The majority expresses the further view that cases following <em>Painter </em>were concerned with the meaning of \u201clegally and beneficially\u201d and \u201cgenerally their interpretations accord with one view of the meaning and intent of that phrase.\u201d I have reviewed carefully the cases cited and, with one exception, find them completely devoid of any consideration or discussion of that phrase. I do not extrapolate anything from them inconsistent with my concept thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">In <em>Pellegrino v. Pellegrino, </em>134 <em>N. J. Super. </em>512, 515 (App. Div. 1975), defendant husband, a municipal fireman, had the absolute right to the repayment of his contributions into a pension fund in the event of resignation, dismissal or death prior to retirement. This court held that since he had \u201ca present fixed right to the future enjoyment of the contributions paid by him, even though the date of that enjoyment be uncertain,\u201d the amount contributed by him from his earnings during the marriage (up until the date of filing the divorce complaint) was property acquired during the marriage and subject to equitable distribution. A like result was reached in <em>Blitt v. Blitt, </em>139 <em>N. J. Super. </em>213 (Ch. Div. 1976), where defendant husband had an absolute right to 50% of his employer\u2019s contributions to a pension plan on his behalf (defendant making no contributions of his own), the money being returnable to the member upon his resignation or dismissal prior to qualifying for a benefit. As in <em>Pellegrino, </em>it was held that the por Lion of the pension plan acquired during marriage should be subject to equitable distribution and additionally, that the postponement of enjoyment was to be considered in determining the manner in, and the time at which, that portion of the plan would be divided. <em>Cf. Kruger v. Kruger, </em>139 <em>N. J. Super. </em>413 (App. Div. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Neither <em>Pellegrino </em>nor <em>Blitt </em>turned on any definition of property \u201clegally and beneficially\u201d acquired. Each recognized the existence of a present fixed right to the pension fund, with only its enjoyment postponed. In <em>Pellegrino </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>particularly, emphasis was placed on the construction of the word \u201cacquired\u201d in a \u201ccomprehensive sense.\u201d The fact that the fireman in that case had an absolute right to the repayment of his contributions in the event of the termination of employment by resignation or discharge prior to retirement, was significant on the issue of equitable distribution, not from the standpoint of control or right to immediate possession of the funds, but to distinguish that type of pension plan from the one involved in <em>Tucker v. Tucker, </em>121 <em>N. J. Super. </em>539 (Ch. Div. 1972), where the employee made no contributions to the plan and had no right of withdrawal before retirement. See also, <em>White v. White, </em>136 <em>N. J. Super. </em>552 (App. Div. 1975), where this court stressed that whatever right plaintiff might have to future retirement benefits, where there was no right to prior withdrawal of funds, it did not constitute <em>property </em>acquired during the marriage and was not subject to equitable distribution. It is noteworthy in <em>Blitt </em>that, although the method of repayment, whether in a lump sum or over a period of years, was within the sole discretion of the company\u2019s pension committee, such control, the court said, \u201cdoes not lead to the conclusion that property has not been 'acquired\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d 139 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In <em>Callahan v. Callahan, </em>142 <em>N. J. Super. </em>325 (Ch. Div. 1976), involving stock options, defendant husband contended that a stock option did not constitute property subject to equitable distribution since, he argued, it was not an asset but merely a right to acquire an asset in the future, and, moreover, was not transferable otherwise than by will or pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution. Furthermore, the options would terminate if the employee left the company without its consent within three years from the date on which the option was granted. Despite these restrictions, which bore significantly on the employee\u2019s \u201ceffective power to control,\u201d the court held (at 328) that the asset represented property which, \u201calthough not cash in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>hand, is not subject to a contingency, has a reasonably discernible value and awaits but the owner to take actual possession.\u201d Nothing was said therein respecting acquisition o\u00a3 the property \u201clegally and beneficially.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">A <em>chose in action </em>was the disputed item in <em>Di Tolva v. Di Tolvo, </em>131 <em>N. J. Super. </em>72 (App. Div. 1974). The husband had sustained injuries in an automobile accident while the parties were married. Prior to the filing of the divorce complaint both spouses instituted a negligence action against the claimed tortfeasors. Included were not only the husband\u2019s claims but also those of the wife for loss of her husband\u2019s services and consortium. The suit was settled after the entry of the judgment of divorce for $7500, of which an amount which came to 6J^% thereof was allocated for the <em>per quod </em>claim. The divorce judgment had, among other things, awarded the wife 20% of the prospective recovery in the negligence action. This court held in substance that, taking the \u201cexpansive view\u201d in <em>Painter </em>of property acquired during the marriage, together with the general statutory definition of \u201cpersonal property\u201d in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>1 :l-2 which included choses in action, the cause of action for personal injuries and consequential damages by reason of an accident occurring during the marriage was personal property acquired and owned by the injured person, and also by the spouse to the extent of the latter\u2019s interest. We said, further (at 78-80), in ihese circumstances the judge granting the divorce may make an equitable allocation of any future recovery on the entire <em>chose in action, </em>the manner of distribution being left to his discretion. It did not matter that a recoveiy might not come to fruition.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">See <em>Hughes v. Hughes, </em>132 <em>N. J. Super. 559 </em>(Ch. Div. 1975), for a comparable treatment of a spouse\u2019s unliquidated claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits as a <em>chose in action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Pew things are more uncertain than the outcome of a lawsuit, especially in the tort field. Unless and until a court or jury determines the issue of liability favorably to the claimant and fixes the amount of the damages, the <em>chose in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number><em>action </em>is just that and no more. To say that the litigant in such case has \u201ccontrol\u201d of the corpus of the claim is realistically unsound. It is deserving of emphasis to note again that in none of tire cited cases did the court speak of or even inferentially consider whether the asset had been acquired \u201clegally and beneficially.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Mention should be made of <em>Gauger v. Gauger, </em>132 <em>N. J. Super. </em>89 (Ch. Div. 1975), aff'd 138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>366 (1976), certif. granted 70 <em>N. J. </em>524 (1976), in which one finds for the first time specific reference to the phrase \u201clegal and beneficial acquisition.\u201d The issue was the availability for equitable distribution of a parcel of real property acquired in 1941 by defendant husband and his mother as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Plaintiff and defendant were married in 1946, the mother died in 1972, and the divorce complaint was filed in 1973. The trial judge held that defendant acquired ownership of the realty upon the original grant and not upon the death of his mother, and thus the subject realty, not having been acquired during coverture, was not subject to possible equitable distribution. This court affirmed o. b., rejecting the contention on appeal that the death of the mother resulted in the \u201clegal and beneficial acquisition\u201d of property by defendant during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">I turn now to an examination of the nature of the estate or interest created by a testamentary trust such as the one here involved, in order to determine the property rights derived therefrom.

It is elementary, moreover, that an express trust is a fiduciary relation in which the trustee holds property interests for the benefit of another, and every property interest susceptible of ownership may be the subject-matter of a trust. <em>Bogert, Trusts and Trustees </em>(2 ed. 1965), \u00a7\u00a7 111 and 112. The trust estate is commonly called the corpus or principal, as distinguished from the income thereof. The trustee is the legal owner of the property held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>by him. <em>Moran v. Joyce, </em>125 <em>N. J. L. </em>558, 562 (Sup. Ct. 1941). The beneficiary, or <em>cestui que trust, </em>has an equitable estate in the corpus, where the income is directed to be paid to the beneficiary until the payment of the principal at a future date. <em>Strawbridge v. Strawbridge, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>125, 130 (Ch. Div. 1955). In such ease the gift will be deemed vested immediately on the death of the testator, in the sense that the interest of the beneficiary is a present one, as distinguished from a future interest. <em>Gifford, adm\u2019r. v. Thorn, </em>9 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>702, 708 (E. &amp; A., 1855); <em>Forbringer v. Romano, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>175, 182 (App. Div. 1950); <em>Bardfeld v. Bardfeld, </em>23 <em>N. J. Super. </em>248, 252-253 (Ch. Div. 1952); <em>Potter v. Watkins, </em>99 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>538, 541-542 (Ch. 1926); <em>Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Rowland, </em>99 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>72, 74 (Ch. 1926); <em>Dusenberry v. Johnson, </em>59 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>336, 338 (Ch. 1900). See 6 <em>N. J. Practice (Clapp, Wills and Administration), </em>\u00a7 579 at 103 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">It has long been the law of this State that a gift to a trustee is regarded in equity as a gift to the <em>cestui que trust, </em>as if it had been made directly. <em>Forbringer v. Romano, supra, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at <em>183; Wendell v. Hazel Wood Cemetery, </em>7 <em>N. J. Super. </em>117, 123 (App. Div. 1950); <em>Skovborg v. Smith, </em>8 <em>N. J. Super. </em>424, 426 (Ch. Div. 1950); <em>Byrne v. Byrne, </em>123 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>6, 17 (Ch. 1938); <em>Traverso v. Traverso, </em>99 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>514, 519 (Ch. 1926); <em>Neilson v. Bishop, </em>45 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>473, 476 (Ch. 1889). <em>Of. Lippincoit v. Pancoast, </em>47 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>21, 26 (Ch. 1890). The present interest of a <em>cestui </em>is nonetheless fixed, even where, as here, there is a gift over if the beneficiary does not attain the stipulated age for the payment of the corpus. In such ease, where it clearly appears that the intention of the testator was to make a gift with the time of payment postponed until the attainment of the designated age, the gift is subject only to divestment in the event of failure to reach such age. <em>Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Potter, </em>8 <em>N. J. Super. </em>533, 537 (Ch. Div. 1950) : <em>Neilson v. Bishop, supra </em>45 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>at 476. The uncertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>event is said to mark the time of payment, not the time of taking title. 6 <em>N. J. Practice (Clapp, Wills and Administration), </em>\u00a7 579 at 103-104 (1962). While the interest may cease entirely upon the happening of a condition subsequent, it is still a present and fixed interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">It should be emphasized at this point that whatever may have been the nature of defendant\u2019s interest in the trust established for his benefit, prior to his attaining the age of 21 years, <em>i. e., </em>whether it was a future or present one, there is no doubt that upon his reaching that age his interest was a present one, since he was then, if not earlier, entitled to the immediate beneficial enjoyment of the proceeds of the trust, namely, the income thereof. See <em>Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Egenolf Day Nursery Ass\u2019n., </em>64 <em>N. J. Super. </em>445, 453 (Ch. Div. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The nature of the beneficiary\u2019s interest is aptly and concisely stated in <em>Restatement, Trusts </em>2d, \u00a7 130 at 282:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">Except as stated in \u00a7 131 [not pertinent here],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">(a) if the trust property is personal property, the interest of the beneficiary is personal property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">(b) if the trust property is real property, the interest of the beneficiary is real property * * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The trial judge\u2019s concept, shared by the majority, was that the \"control date\u201d for determining eligibility for equitable distribution in a situation such as this was \"the date that the person is entitled to receive whatever is left to him.\u201d In light of the foregoing, I can perceive of no sound reason why this should be so. As I have explained at considerable length, defendant\u2019s beneficial interest in the corpus of the trust was property, not diminished in any way by his inability to reduce the corpus to immediate possession. That property was acquired before the marriage. Only the enjojunent of the corpus came to fruition during the marriage. I therefore hold that the trust corpus here was not eligible for equitable distribution except to the extent that it may have increased in value during the marriage by reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of the efforts of the other spouse or those for which both were jointly responsible. <em>Painter v. Painter, supra, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>at 214; <em>cf. Scherzer v. Scherzer, </em>136 <em>N. J. Super. </em>397, 401 (App. Div. 1975), eertif. den. 69 <em>N. J. </em>391 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">I would reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-5\">It is noteworthy that the Uniform Act has now been revised so as to provide, as an Alternative A (Alternative B relating only to community property, for use in states having that system), for the equitable apportionment of all property and assets belonging to either spouse <em>however and whenever acquired, </em>in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the factors set forth therein.
