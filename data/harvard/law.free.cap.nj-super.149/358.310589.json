Defendants had applied for the summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff, a Pennsylvania corporation, had failed to comply with <em>N. J. S. A. </em>14A:13-15, part of the Corporation Business Activities Reporting Act, <em>L. </em>1973, c. 171, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>14A:13-14 <em>et seq., </em>effective June 7, 1973. The motion was heard on a stipulation of facts and oral argument. The facts as stipulated between these parties are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">(1) Defendants appeared, personally, at the office of the plaintiff in Morrisville, Pennsylvania at which time they executed the note, photocopy of which is annexed to the complaint, in accordance with the Consumer Discount Company Law of that state and received the consideration described in the note in the form of a check made payable to the defendants drawn on a Morrisville, Pennsylvania bank which they endorsed payable to \u201cLottery Publications.\u201d No part of the consideration or the interest described in the note had been paid to the plaintiff by the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">(2) Plaintiff is a Pennsylvania corporation and does not have, nor has it applied for, a Certificate of Authority to transact business in this state as a foreign corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">(3) Plaintiff has not filed \u201cNotice of Business Activities Report\u201d as described in N. J. S. A. 14A :13-15/20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">(4) All loan transactions made by the plaintiff are consumated [sic] by execution of note and delivery of consideration in the State of Pennsylvania.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-11\">(5) The present loan portfolio of the plaintiff totals approximately $500,000 of which 25%, or $125,000, represents accounts receivable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>from debtors residing now, or in the past, in the State of New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">(6) Plaintiff does not maintain any offices or places of business in New Jersey. Plaintiff does use the U. S. mails and the telephone to advise debtors residing in New Jersey of delinquencies in an effort to collect past due accounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In esssence, defendants contended that since plaintiff had not filed \u201ca notice of business activities report\u201d (notice) as required by <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>14A:13-15, it was barred from maintaining its suit in this State by the terms of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>14A:13-20. On this appeal plaintiff argues that since it \u201cis factually engaged in interstate commerce; has no minimal presence in New Jersey; and since the loan of money at a price is in fact a sale of tangible personal property, tho imposition of an income tax by this state is an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce.\u201d We find no merit in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Plaintiff misconceives the nature and scope of the Corporation Business Activities Report Act. That legislation provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">Every foreign corporation which during any calendar or fiscal accounting year ending after December 31, 1973, carried on any activity or owned or maintained any property in this State, unless specifically exempted under section 3 of this act, shall be required to file a notice of business activities report, as hereinafter provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">Activities or property maintenance in this State which require corporations to file this report are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\"><em>a d&gt; </em>* a- * s * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">e. receiving payments from persons residing in this State, or businesses located in this State, aggregating in excess of $25,000 regardless of any other connections with this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-12\">f. the derivation of income from any source or sources within this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-13\">it &gt;&gt; * it $ * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-14\"><em>IN. J. S. A. </em>14A :13-15]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-15\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-16\">No foreign corporation carrying on any activity or owning or maintaining any property in this State which has not obtained a certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>cate of authority to do business in this State and disclaims liability for the corporation business tax and the corporation income tax shall maintain any action or proceeding in any State or Federal court in New Jersey, until such corporation shall have filed a timely notice of business activities report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">* *\u2022:* <em>Jr </em>* * sfc *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">[A. <em>J. S. A. </em>14A :13-20(a) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The statute is not a taxing measure. It is essentially an information gathering measure. Its clear purpose is to enable the Division of Taxation to obtain pertinent data from any foreign corporation which carries on an activity or owns or maintains property in this State but which has not obtained a certificate of authority to do business in New Jersey, to the end that a proper determination may be made as to whether such corporation is subject to any State tax. The legislation stems from a recommendation contained in the <em>Report of the New Jersey Tax Policy Committee </em>(February 23, 1972), Part V at 33, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">\u2022j, * * jf. js important, in order to safeguard the State\u2019s revenues and reduce unfair tax-free competition with businesses that pay taxes to this State, that the Legislature adopt a more effective technique for discovering foreign corporations that may be taxable, but that are now paying no taxes, and would otherwise escape the broadened jurisdiction of the proposed second tier tax.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To seek to accomplish that objective, we propose that a statutory provision be adopted requiring certain non-qualified foreign corporations to file with the Division of Taxation a Notice of Business Activities. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">We discern no constitutional infirmity in either the notice requirement of the Act or the sanctions imposed therein for failure to file. These are entirely reasonable means de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>signed to achieve an essential state purpose \u2014 the strengthening of the enforcement of its tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Neither do we discern any conflict, as suggested by plaintiff, between 73 <em>Stat. </em>555, 15 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 381(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the subject legislation. The limited purposes of the federal statute, see <em>Heublein v. South Carolina Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>409 <em>U. S. </em>275, 279, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>483, 34 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 472, 477 (1972) and <em>Report of the New Jersey Tax Policy Committee, supra </em>at 21-22, do not encompass any prohibition upon a state from inquiring into a corporation\u2019s activities to determine whether those activities are taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The order for summary judgment under review is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Corporation Income Tax Act (1972), <em>L. </em>1973, c. 170, <em>N.
