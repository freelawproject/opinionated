Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was acquitted of one count of rape with a foreign object by force. The trial court reduced the offenses to violations of section 288, subdivision (a) (lewd and lascivious act upon a child without force), and sentenced appellant to state prison for a term of 12 years. Plyler appeals from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Appellant was convicted of the molestation of two young girls, Cecilia S. and Tina G., whom he had befriended and photographed regularly. A professional photographer, he had met both girls on the street and photographed them with their parents\u2019 permission. Appellant met Cecilia (nine years old), Tina (eight years old) and their friend Dawn L. (ten years old) in 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">\n<em>Admissibility of Tape Recordings of Appellant\u2019s Telephone Conversations With Tina</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">Appellant contends the tape recording of his telephone conversation with Tina on January 21, 1989, was inadmissible under the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution and under sections 2600-2601. He further contends the court erred in concluding that portions of the tape of a January 20, 1989, telephone conversation as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>January 21, 1989, telephone conversation could be used for impeachment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">A. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Appellant was arrested on January 13, 1989, for the molestation of Cecilia. Appellant initially agreed to answer questions after he had been advised of his constitutional rights. When the questioning began to focus upon his relationship with Cecilia, he asserted his right to counsel. Later that day, appellant telephoned Shirley Woolworth, Tina\u2019s grandmother, to ask her to advise his friend, Jobie, that he was in jail. About 2 a.m. on January 14th, appellant called collect from the jail in Monterey to find out whether Woolworth had contacted Jobie. Woolworth advised appellant that he could reach Jobie at her place of work. Appellant called Woolworth again at 8:40 a.m. on the 15th to learn whether the police had contacted Tina. Plyler said repeatedly, \u201cThey will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Appellant was assigned a deputy public defender at his arraignment on January 17,1989. Woolworth telephoned Detective Anderson on the 17th to advise him of appellant\u2019s telephone calls. Anderson went to Woolworth\u2019s home on the 19th and, with her permission, attached a tape recorder to the telephone. He instructed Woolworth and Tina to activate the recorder for all incoming calls and to turn off the machine when the call was personal. Anderson also told Tina that when appellant called, \u201cnot to be nervous, to be herself, and attempt to get Mr. Plyler to discuss the acts of molest upon her and Cecilia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">1. <em>First Tape: January 20, 1989</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">On January 20, Detective Anderson instructed the officer in charge of the county jail in Monterey to give the following message to appellant: \u201c[Cjall Shirley, collect. That was it. That was the exact message.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Appellant testified that he was asleep in the medical module of the county jail under heart medication when a deputy opened his cell and told him he was to call Shirley Woolworth. The deputy was holding a white cordless phone. Appellant reached for it but the deputy withdrew his hand and said, \u201c \u2018This is my private phone. Those [indicating toward the day room] are your private phones.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant placed the collect call and talked to Woolworth. After they talked for a while Woolworth said, \u201c \u2018Well, Tina\u2019s here. Let me put her on.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>During the first recorded conversation, Tina made numerous statements attempting to elicit incriminating statements from appellant. When Tina indicated she \u201chad to get off the phone,\u201d she concluded the conversation with: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Call me again tomorrow. Call back here. I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">2. <em>Second Tape: January 21, 1989</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Appellant called Shirley again the following day and, after conversing with her, asked her to put Tina on. During this conversation, appellant made various admissions as to his behavior with Tina, including statements that he felt guilt, shame and remorse. He wanted to discuss a woman who had been \u201cinvolved\u201d with her brother, and the way they dealt with it was to forget about it and to act like it never happened. He stated they worked it out together. During the entire conversation on the 21st, Tina asked no questions and made no statements which could be construed as attempting to elicit a response from appellant. Her remarks were limited to \u201cuhhum.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here,\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d and \u201cO.K.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">3. <em>Trial Court Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Before trial, appellant moved to exclude both jail tapes on Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment grounds. The court ruled that the tape recording of the first conversation (January 20th) was inadmissible because it was elicited in violation of appellant\u2019s rights under the Fifth Amendment as construed in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974], The court had previously denied motions to suppress under the Fourth Amendment. It reiterated its ruling when it ruled that the second conversation (Jan. 21st) was admissible under the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. For purposes of impeachment, however, both tapes were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The court reasoned that Tina was acting as a police agent and that on the first tape she tried to deliberately elicit incriminating statements from the appellant, warranting suppression of the first tape on Fifth Amendment grounds. The court distinguished the second tape, finding there was no interrogation. At trial, the second jail tape was played for the jury in the presentation of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. Toward the end of the trial before the defense rested, the trial court returned to the issue of the use of the tapes for impeachment and reaffirmed its prior rulings. Appellant advised the court that but for the court\u2019s ruling, he would have testified in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>B. <em>Fourth Amendment and De Lancie (\u00a7\u00a7 2600-2601)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">1. <em>Fourth Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">As summarized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hammons </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1710 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 317]: \u201cOrdinarily, an arrested person being detained before his or her arraignment does not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy, such that surreptitious monitoring and recording of incriminating statements by him or her violates the Fourth Amendment. <em>(Donaldson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 24, 27-30 . . . ; <em>North </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 301, 308 . . . ; <em>id., </em>at pp. 317-318 (dis. opn. of Sullivan, J.); <em>Ahmad A. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 528, 535 . . . ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Elwood </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1365, 1372 . . . .) However, such an expectation of privacy can arise, under circumstances where the arrested person and a person with whom he was conversing \u2018were lulled into believing their conversation would be confidential.\u2019 <em>(North </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 311.)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1715.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Appellant contends he was \u201clulled\u201d into such expectation of privacy by the deputy\u2019s telling him to use the other phones to make his call to Wool worth, and because a deputy had once answered his question whether the phone calls were recorded in the negative. We disagree. The trial court in finding no Fourth Amendment violation inferentially found no such \u201clulling\u201d and no reasonable expectation of privacy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court was free to disbelieve appellant\u2019s self-serving statements as to what he was told on a prior occasion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Moreover, had appellant been told the phone calls were not recorded at the jail, this would provide no assurance that his call was not monitored <em>by the recipient, </em>as was the case here. (See, e.g., <em>Hoffa </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 385 U.S. 293 [17 L.Ed.2d 374, 87 S.Ct. 408]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 29, 52 [222 Cal.Rptr. 127, 711 P.2d 423]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 349 [105 Cal.Rptr. 138, 503 P.2d 594] [upholding against Fourth Amendment challenges the admissibility of tape recordings of conversations surreptitiously made by associates of the defendant who were acting at the direction of law enforcement officers].)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>2. <em>De Lancie and Sections 2600-2601</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Appellant contends that recording his call to Tina constituted a violation of his right to privacy under sections 2600 and 2601, as applied in <em>De Lancie </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 865 [183 Cal.Rptr. 866, 647 P.2d 142],</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u201cSection 2600 provides that a person sentenced to imprisonment in a state prison may, during any period of confinement, be deprived of such rights, and only such rights as necessary to provide for the reasonable security of the institution and the reasonable protection of the public. Rights protected include the right to privacy. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u201cDe <em>Lancie </em>was a civil action for injunctive relief, prompted by disclosures at a trial revealing that personnel at the San Mateo County jail were routinely monitoring conversations between visitors and pretrial detainees. The Supreme Court in De <em>Lancie </em>held that allegations charging such monitoring was conducted for purposes other than institutional security stated a cause of action for violation of sections 2600 and 2601. (De <em>Lancie </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 865, 877.) \u2018That holding necessarily implied that secret monitoring of conversations between detainees and visitors, \u201cundertaken for the purpose of gathering evidence for use in criminal proceedings, rather than to maintain the security of the jail\u201d <em>(id.), </em>was unlawful.\u2019 <em>(Donaldson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 24, 35 . . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Elwood </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1365, 1369 [245 Cal.Rptr. 585].)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">No case cited to us applies <em>De Lancie </em>in a context such as this, where the person recording the call was a <em>party </em>to the call and we refuse to apply it so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Were we to conclude that <em>De Lancie </em>was violated by the surreptitious recording of a phone conversation by one of the parties thereto at police direction, we would not conclude the court erred in refusing to suppress the second recording. \u201cDe <em>Lancie </em>relied solely upon state grounds and on sections 2600 and 2601 in its analysis. [Citation.] M] However, in <em>Donaldson, </em>the Supreme Court explained that \u201cPermitting state officials to listen in on such [confidential or intimate] conversations for reasons unrelated to jail security\u2014indeed without any reason at all\u2014offends the fundamental right of privacy guaranteed by the California Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1.)\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 35.) Consequently, even though <em>De Lancie\u2019s </em>holding did not turn upon whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in a custodial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>setting, it presupposes that monitoring in violation of sections 2600 and 2601, \u2018without any reason at all,\u2019 violates the fundamental right of privacy guaranteed by the California Constitution.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Elwood, supra, </em>at pp. 1370-1371.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">However, \u201cProposition 8 (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (d)) precludes exclusion of evidence as a remedy for violations of search and seizure provisions of the federal or state Constitution except to the extent that exclusion remains federally compelled. <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 886-887 . . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Elwood, supra, </em>at p. 1372.) In other words, \u201cin the absence of express statutory authority therefor courts may not exclude evidence seized in violation of either the state or federal Constitution unless exclusion is compelled by the federal Constitution.\u201d <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 888 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631 [694 P.2d 744].) Numerous cases considering the issue have held that \u201c[w]hile <em>De Lancie </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>established the right of pretrial detainees to a reasonable expectation of privacy even within the confines of jail, the statute does not provide for exclusion of evidence in the event law enforcement fails to honor that expectation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Carrera </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 291, 326 . . . ; <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 34; <em>People </em>v. <em>Elwood </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1365, 1371 . . . .) Since exclusion is not otherwise federally compelled, it may not be judicially invoked in the wake of Proposition 8. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCaslin </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 1, 6-7 . . . ; <em>People </em>v. <em>West </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 326, 330-331 [216 Cal.Rptr. 195].)\u201d <em>(Ahmad A. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 528, 536 [263 Cal.Rptr. 747]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Von Villas </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 175, 219-220 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 112].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">C. <em>Fifth Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Appellant argues that both tapes were the product of \u201cofficial intimidation\u201d through the \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d by Tina as an agent of the police. Clearly, appellant\u2019s statements to Tina were not the product of \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda. (Illinois </em>v. <em>Perkins </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 292, 297 [110 L.Ed.2d 243, 251, 110 S.Ct. 2394]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1127, 1539-1540 [245 Cal.Rptr. 635, 751 P.2d 901].) <em>Miranda </em>was designed to protect and preserve an accused\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination during incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere. <em>(Miranda </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 445 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 707].) In <em>Perkins, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a conversation between an incarcerated suspect and an undercover agent posing as a fellow inmate did not implicate the concerns underlying <em>Miranda. </em>\u201cIt is the premise of <em>Miranda </em>that the danger of coercion results from the interaction of custody and official interrogation. . . . When the suspect has no reason to think that the listeners have official power over him, it should not be assumed that his words are motivated by the reaction he expects from his listeners.\u201d <em>(Illinois </em>v. <em>Perkins, supra, </em>496 U.S. 292, 297 [110 L.Ed.2d 243, 251].) \u201cQuestioning by captors, who appear to control the suspect\u2019s fate, may create mutually reinforcing pressures that the Court has assumed will weaken the suspect\u2019s will, but where a suspect does not know that he is conversing with a government agent, these pressures do not exist.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 297 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 251].)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u201cA similar result has been reached by our highest court. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1127 . . . , the court found that <em>Miranda </em>\u2018has never been applied to conversations between an inmate and an undercover agent.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1141-1142.) The reason why <em>Miranda </em>has no application to this type of conversation is because <em>\u2018Miranda </em>warnings serve to dispel the coercive effect of <em>police custodial </em>questioning\u2019 <em>(id., </em>at p. 1142, italics in original) . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guilmette </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1534, 1540 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 750].)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Despite appellant\u2019s protestations that his phone call to Tina amounted to \u201cofficial intimidation\u201d and a custodial interrogation, one would be hard-pressed to characterize appellant\u2019s phone conversations with Tina as \u201cpolice custodial\u201d interrogation as defined in <em>Miranda </em>and as construed by subsequent decisions. Even if appellant had been \u201cforced\u201d to place the call, he did not know Tina was working with the police. Under <em>Perkins, </em>absent such knowledge there is no reason to assume he might feel coerced and no Fifth Amendment violation occurred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">D. <em>Sixth Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Appellant contends that admission of the second tape and the court\u2019s willingness to allow the first tape to be used for impeachment violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">As recently summarized by the California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705]: \u201cThe Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Amendment provides that \u2018In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u201cIn <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) 377 U.S. 201 . . . , and its progeny, the United States Supreme Court held that \u2018the government\u2019\u2014 whether federal or state\u2014\u2018may not use an undercover agent to circumvent the Sixth Amendment right to counsel once\u2019 that right has attached. <em>(Illinois </em>v. <em>Perkins </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 292, 299 . . . .) After attachment, \u2018the Sixth Amendment prevents the government from interfering with the accused\u2019s right to counsel.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 299 \u201e . . .) Before attachment, by contrast, the constitutional provision is not implicated. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 299-300 . . . .)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u201cThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel \u2018does not attach until a prosecution is commenced, that is, \u201c \u2018at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\u2014whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 <em>(McNeil </em>v. <em>Wisconsin </em>(1991) 501.U.S. 171, _ [115 L.Ed.2d 158, 166-167, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 2207], [citations].) It is not enough, for example, that the defendant has become the focus of the underlying criminal investigation. (1 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure (1984) \u00a7 6.4(e), p. 466; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 561 .. . .)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u201cThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel, the United States Supreme Court has recently declared, is \u2018offense specific.\u2019 <em>(McNeil </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, supra, </em>501 U.S. 171 at p. _ [115 L.Ed.2d at p. 166, 111 S.Ct. at p. 2207].) That is to say, it attaches to offenses as to which adversary judicial criminal proceedings have been initiated\u2014and to such offenses alone. <em>(Id., </em>at p. _ [115 L.Ed.2d at pp. 166-167, 111 S.Ct. at p. 2207.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clair, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 657.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Where the right to counsel has attached and one acting at the government\u2019s request \u201cdeliberately elicits incriminating statements from a represented defendant,\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Catelli </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1434, 1442 [278 Cal.Rptr. 452]) \u201cthe \u2018incriminating statements pertaining to pending charges are inadmissible at the trial of those charges, . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThis is true even if the incriminating information is obtained during the state\u2019s investigation of other, uncharged crimes. <em>(Maine </em>v. <em>Moulton, supra, </em>474 U.S. at p. 180 . . . .)\u201d <em>(Ibid)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">At the time of the recordings, counsel had been appointed to represent appellant at his arraignment for the charges relating to Cecilia. On appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the recordings, the trial court determined that at the time of the recordings, appellant\u2019s right to counsel had attached for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>offenses relating to Cecilia. However, no right to counsel had attached as to the offenses against Tina. No charges were pending as to her at that time. Hence, the second tape (January 21st), which contained no references at all to Cecilia was admissible in its entirety. The first tape (January 20th), which contained references to Cecilia and the pending charges was admissible only after expungment of all such references. The first tape had been excluded from the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief on Fifth Amendment grounds, but was admissible for impeachment upon expungement of all references to the offenses against Cecilia. Because appellant did not testify, only the first tape was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">It is true that \u201cthe \u2018precise boundaries\u2019 of the \u2018 \u201coffense-specific\u201d limitation\u2019 have yet to be *flesh[ed] out.\u2019 <em>(McNeil </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p._[115 L.Ed.2d at p. 174, 111 S.Ct. at p. 2214] (dis. opn. of Stevens, J.).)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clair, supra, </em>2 Cal,4th at p. 658.) Nevertheless, we have concluded the trial court correctly determined that at the time of the recordings, no attachment of the Sixth Amendment right had occurred with respect to the subsequently charged offenses involving Tina. In this case, the <em>charged </em>offenses against Cecilia did not involve Tina.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They occurred at separate times and places. Neither girl was present during the charged offenses in which the other was the victim. We are confident that the offenses involving Cecilia did not embrace the offenses against Tina for purposes of attachment of the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Appellant argues that because he had been charged with offenses directed toward Cecilia on January 17th, he was an \u201caccused\u201d; the offenses perpetrated upon Tina were \u201crelated\u201d; consequently, the right to counsel had attached as to all offenses. We disagree. The \u201cclosely related\u201d doctrine (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 54 [150 Cal.Rptr. 34]; <em>In re Michael B. </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 790 [178 Cal.Rptr. 291]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sharp </em>(1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 13 [197 Cal.Rptr. 436]) has been thoroughly undermined by the \u201coffense-specific\u201d doctrine enunciated by the United States Supreme Court. Indeed, <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 629, recognized that \u201c[t]hose cases are significantly helpful to [the appellant\u2019s] position only to the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>they support the proposition that the Sixth Amendment right is not \u2018offense-specific.\u2019 To that extent, however, they are no longer vital.\u201d <em>(Id.., </em>at p. 658, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Smith, J., and Benson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for by the Supreme Court was denied November 23, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-16\"> All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ao\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 535.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Appellant took the deputy\u2019s statement that he was supposed to call Woolworth as an order, for early in his incarceration he learned that \u201cwhen a deputy told you to do something, you do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>it or get in trouble.\u201d Appellant recounted how he had gotten into trouble for failing to stand in a particular place to which a deputy had directed him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Appellant claims the trial court found he was \u201clulled\u201d into an expectation of privacy. This is not so. The trial court specifically found no Fourth Amendment violation for the second tape. Its suppression of the first tape rested on its finding that Tina, acting at the police\u2019s behest, \u201cinterrogated\u201d appellant, eliciting information from him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b236-9\"><em>Hammons </em>held that where the police \u201cmake an express representation that a conversation will be private, they create a legitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy and the surreptitious monitoring and recording of that conversation is violative of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1717.) However, in <em>Hammons, </em>the deputy testified he had led appellant and another inmate to believe their conversation would be private and the Attorney General conceded the police lulled them into believing there would be a private conversation. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1715.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b237-10\">To apply <em>De Lancie </em>in such circumstances could result in a situation where a crime victim could not request the police to monitor harassing phone calls from the perpetrator, if such tapes were intended to be used as evidence at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Appellant does not claim on appeal and did not claim below that the recording of these conversations violated federal or state statutes other than those discussed above.

In <em>People </em>v. <em>Murtha </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1112 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 324], we recognized an exception to these statutes for conversations recorded by a party to the conversation. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 1121.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b239-10\">It appears then that the trial court erred in suppressing the <em>first tape on </em>Fifth Amendment grounds. As to the second tape, the court correctly determined that appellant initiated the call and that Tina did not interrogate him. She asked no questions and made no comments or statements designed to elicit any information or admissions from appellant. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Guilmette, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 1534, 1540.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Had appellant been charged with the 1981 molestation of both girls, the question of attachment would be more complicated.

Certainly the evidence relating to the charges was cross-admissible under Evidence Code section 1101.
