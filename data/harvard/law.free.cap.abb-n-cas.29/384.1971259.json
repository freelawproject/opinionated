The injunction sought <em>pendente lite </em>is precisely the same as the injunction prayed for in the complaint. The plaintiff thus asks us on motion to give him the equivalent of final judgment upon a trial of the action. It is plain that if his charges of illegality are sustained upon the trial, the tax-payers will lose nothing by the.proposed sale. If, on the other hand, they are not sustained, the defendant corporation will lose all that it has thus far attained by the proceeding in question, and will be compelled to proceed <em>de </em>novo,</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">These considerations are conclusive against the present application. For it is entirely clear that such a case of illegal official action as would justify the sweeping injunction asked, has not been made out. It would not be just, however, to stop here. The merits were fully'argued and the parties are entitled to some expression of opinion with regard to the various objections made by the plaintiff to the procedure in question. These objections will therefore be briefly considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The consent of the Board of Aldermen was not, in my judgment, vitiated by the fact that a committee of the board, to whom the petition of the defendant corporation had been referred, was alone present at the time and place specified in the notice for the first consideration of the matter. There is nothing in the Railroad Act requiring the full board to sit for the purposes of a public hearing. It was usual and proper to depute the latter function to a committee, upon whose report the board could act advisedly. The consideration which the Act contemplates from the board was the consideration of a deliberative body, and its action was subject to the ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>veto power of the mayor with - respect to ordinances. The statutory -pre-requisites to the giving of such consent are, first, an application therefor in writing, and, second, before acting upon such application, the publications provided for in section 92 of the Railroad Law <em>(Laws of </em>1890, c. 565). \u25a0 The application in writing was here made and due public notice followed. Power to give the consent upon proper conditions, then became complete, and the board could thereafter exercise the power upon such consideration as it deemed suitable and sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">There is less force in the objection that the resolution of the board should have been published pursuant' to section 80 of the Consolidation Act. That provision is inapplicable to the consent of the local authorities required by the constitution and the law. This consent is in no just or legal sense an alienation or appropriation of the property of the City, and the objection on that head proceeds upon a misconception of the precise nature of the board\u2019s power and of its action - under the power. The section in question plainly refers to property owned by the City, and within its power of disposition. Here the city has the fee of the street, but such fee is in trust for street uses by the people of the State. The City cannot alien its title to the streets or dispose of its technical property therein. The franchise proceeds from the State, and the consent of the local authorities is simply to a form of street use.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The numerous objections made to the conditions imposed by the board are in the main answered by the proposition that the local authorities are not confined to the conditions required by the Railroad Act. These conditions <em>must </em>be imposed, but others may be added. The only limitation upon the power to affix further conditions is, that such conditions shall not contravene the statute nor relate to matters over which other bodies have complete control. This is another way of saying that the conditions must be reasonable and lawful. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>board had a right to give or to withhold its consent. It could lawfully say that it would give its consent to a road to be operated in a particular manner. That was not an attempt to exercise power as to the motor. It simply left the applicant to procure, as best it might, the means called for by the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">So as to the condition requiring the deposit of $1,000, ooo, subject to draft for the construction of the railroad. The court cannot condemn this condition as unreasonable. On the contrary, it seems to be a prudent requirement to insure the activity in the construction of the road and to prevent sham bids in the interest of those who may be inimical to the extension. The criticism upon the form of the resolution in this particular is somewhat superficial. The condition does not in reality require the completion of the road before the expiration of the statutory period of three years. It merely provides that if the road is not completed within two years, so much of the deposit as may then be unexpended shall be forfeited. That is but one way of requiring the expenditure of the entire deposit within the two years ; and as the extension will cost at least $2,000,000, it was not unreasonable in this manner to compel the expenditure of one-half of that sum within two-thirds of the statutory period. Such is the real meaning and effect of the condition and all that is contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The only condition which cal\u00eds for further consideration is that with regard to the division of the single fare. No definite opinion need now be expressed on that head. The question was argued with great ability on both sides, and the conclusion I have arrived at is that the alleged illegality in that regard is by no means so clear as to justify the practical destruction, by a preliminary injunction, of the entire procedure looking to the sale of the franchise. I do not, however, mean to intimate an impression against this condition, but merely to say that, because of the ground I have had to go over, and the limited time afforded me for reflection, my mind is not sufficiently clear with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>regard to it to assert its lawfulness as decidedly as I have with regard to the other conditions.</p>\n<summary id=\"b441-6\">Motion for an injunction pending an action.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b441-7\">Action by Samuel Abraham, a property owner, against Theodore W.

And in case of failure on the part of any successful bidder at said sale to make such deposit at the time of such sale, a re-sale shall be immediately made upon the terms and conditions herein provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">In accordance with the provisions of the aforesaid resolutions and in compliance with the requirements of the statute, I hereby give notice</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">A. That no bid will be received at said sale, except \u201c from a duly incorporated railroad corporation of this State, organized to construct, maintain and operate a street railroad in the city, for which such consent may be given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">B. That no bid will be received from such corporation unless it shall have \u201c at least five days prior to the day fixed for such sale, or five days prior to the day to which such sale shall have been duly adjourned, filed with the comptroller of the city a bond in writing and under seal, with two sureties to be approved by such comptroller, conditipned that if such right, franchise and privilege shall be sold to such corporation, to pay to the City of New York, the sum of fifty thousand dollars as liquidated damages and not by way of penalty in the event of the failure of such bidder to fulfill the terms of sale, comply with the provisions of the law pertinent thereto, and construct, complete and operate its railroad according to the plan or plans and upon the route and routes fixed for its construction within the time designated by law for the construction and completion of its railroad, and also conditioned to pay to the Houston West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad Co., if it shall not be the successful bidder, the necessary expenses incurred by such corporation prior to the sale, pursuant to the requirement and direction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the local authorities, within twenty days after such sale and upon the certificate of the comptroller or other officer conducting the same as to the sum or amount to be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">C. One of the conditions of said sale, as fixed by said resolutions, requires that the successful bidder at said sale shall deposit with me at the time of said sale the'sum of one million dollars to the order of the Mayor of the city, and if said deposit is not made by the successful bidder at the time of said sale, I give notice that I shall thereupon cancel the said bid for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of sale, and shall forthwith re-sell the aforesaid consent and license, and shall declare forfeited the aforesaid bond of fifty thousand dollars for failure to fulfill the terms of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">D. In view of the failure of the city heretofore in many cases to secure the benefits expected from the sales of street railroad franchises, by reason of purchasers at said sales failing to construct and operate the roads upon various pretexts, I call attention to the fact that the Common Council of the city has required as a condition of its consent in this case, that the purchaser at said sale shall, s.o far as said deposit of one million dollars is concerned, assume all responsibility of obtaining consents of property owners, and constructing and putting in operation the said railroad within two years from the date of sale', and has specifically provided that \u201c if at the expiration of two years from the time of said sale said road shall not have been constructed and be in operation, the said fund then on deposit shall be forfeited to said cityand on the part of the city notice is hereby given that no excuse for failure to construct and put the said road in operation within two years will be accepted or be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">E. In addition to the percentage bid by it on the sale, the purchaser will be liable to pay annually into the City Treasury for the first five years three per cent., thereafter five per cent., of its gross receipts, as required by section 95 of the General Railroad Law, calculated upon the basis provided for extensions in said law; and no bid will be accepted unless it be of a percentage additional to the said percentage provided for by said law. And said sale is upon the further condition that all provisions of law applicable to said railroad shall be by the purchaser, at said sale, duly complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Dated New York, Dec. 6, 1892.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">\u2022Theo.
