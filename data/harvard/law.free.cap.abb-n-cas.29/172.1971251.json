R. LAWRENCE, one of the justices of the Supreme Court, upon application made to him at his chambers in the City of New York, in behalf of the relator, a duly qualified elector of the 7th election district of the 2nd assembly district of that city, made an order requiring the inspectors in that election district to show cause before him at the court house in said city at 3 o\u2019clock P. M. of that day, why a writ of peremptory mandamus should not be issued commanding and requiring them to permit the relator to take the disability oath provided in the election law, and upon taking the oath to permit him to retire with a person of his selection to one of the booths and compartments provided in said election district, for the purpose of preparing his ballot, and to accept, receive, and deposit the ballot when prepared, etc. The affidavit upon which the application was made set out certain facts which, in the opinion of the learned justice, entitled the relator to this relief. The order to show cause was served on Donovan and the other inspectors within the time limited by the order, but they did not appear on its return, and thereupon, due proof of the service of the order having been made, and of other facts, the justice issued a peremptory writ following the order to show cause and commanding the inspectors to do and permit the things therein stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The peremptory writ was served on the inspectors before the closing of the polls and there is evidence tending to show that they refused to obey it. Subsequently application was made to the court at Special Term to punish the inspector for contempt in disobeying the writ and the proceedings resulted in an order adjudging the defendant Donovan guilty of contempt and imposing upon him a fine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>of $250 and ten days imprisonment, as a punishment for his misconduct. The order was affirmed on appeal to the General Term and the present appeal is from the order of affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The order made by the Special Term is challenged on the ground that Mr. Justice LAWRENCE sitting at chambers, and not as a court, had no jurisdiction to issue the mandamus for the disobedience of which the order, punishing the defendant forcontempt was made. If this point is well taken it disposes of the case, and the orders of the .Special and General Terms must be reversed ; for it is a clear proposition that an order made by a court or judge in a proceeding of which the tribunal or officer had no jurisdiction and which is not merely irregular or erroneous, is not a lawful mandate, and disobedience thereto cannot be punished as a contempt <em>(Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 8 ; <em>Eng. &amp; Am. Ency. of Law, </em>Vol. 3, p. 788, and cases cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The power to issue the writ of mandamus was at common law lodged exclusively in the court of King\u2019s Bench because of the general superintendence it exercised over all inferior jurisdictions, and unless conferred by statute, could be exercised by no other court in the realm. It was one of the prerogative writs, and if any trace is to be found of an attempt by any other court to exercise the jurisdiction in the absence of a special statute conferring the authority, it was in the nature of a usurpation (Audley <em>v. </em>May, <em>Poph. </em>176 ; 2 <em>Blk. Com. </em>110; <em>Moses on Mand. </em>16; People <em>ex rel. </em>Ryan <em>v. </em>Green, 58 <em>N. Y. </em>296). The jurisdiction resided in the court and not in the individual judges, and the writ was issued in term and not in vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In colonial times the supreme court of the Colony of New York, by the ordinances of 1699 and 1704, was invested with \u2022 all the powers of the courts of King\u2019s Bench, common pleas and exchequer in England, and by the Revised Statutes (2 <em>R. S. </em>[3d. ed.] p. 259, \u00a7 1) the supreme court of the State was declared to be vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>with all the powers and jurisdiction which belonged to the supreme court of the Colony of New York, with certain exceptions not now material to be noticed. The same statutes regulated proceedings by mandamus, and while they do not expressly limit the power to issue the writ to the supreme court, or prohibit its being issued by a judge out of court, they assume that the power' inheres alone in this supreme jurisdiction is to be exercised by the court as such (2 <em>Rev. St. </em>608, tit. Writs of Mandamus and Prohibition).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The statute of 1873, chapter 239, has been construed as conferring upon certain other courts the power to issue the writ (People <em>ex. rel. </em>Ryan <em>v. </em>Green, <em>supra), </em>and it may be conceded that the Legislature could authorize the writ to be issued by a judge in vacation, although it is difficult to see how such a jurisdiction could be conveniently exercised in view of the fact that the proceeding by mandamus is substantially an action which may involve pleadings, issues, trial and final judgment upon the right, unless the power of the judge acting in chambers and not .as a court should be restricted to issuing the writ returnable before the court, as is the procedure in some of the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The power of the judge to issue the writ involved in the present appeal is placed on section 770 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which declares that \u201c in the first judicial district a motion which elsewhere must be made in court may be made to a judge out of court, except for a new trial on the merits.\u201d The argument is that an application for a writ of mandamus is under the Code a motion, and that the writ when issued is an order, and that although elsewhere it can only be issued on application to the court, and not by a judge out of court, nevertheless in the first district, under the section quoted, the motion may be made before, and the writ may be issued by, a judge at chambers. It is to be observed that section 770 of the Code .of Civil Procedure, is substantially a re-enactment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>of section 401 of the Code of Procedure. But the former code expressly excepted mandamus proceedings from its operation (\u00a7 471), and under that code a judge out of court in the first district had no power in mandamus proceedings other or greater than was possessed by any other judge in any other part of the State. It seems to be clear that under the former code a judge out of court could not have issued a mandamus, as that power by practice and the general understanding could be exercised only by a court, and could not be exercised by a judge out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">It remains to consider whether the Code of Civil Procedure has enlarged the power of a judge in the first district so as to enable him to issue a mandamus out of term or when not sitting as a court. Prior to the enactment of the Code of Civil Procedure, the writs of <em>habeas </em>corpus, mandamus, prohibition, etc., were regulated by statutes and the practice of the courts. In the Code of Civil Procedure these statutes and the practice thereunder were brought together and codified under the title \u201c Special proceedings instituted by State writ,\u201d and the writs above enumerated were denominated State writs. The several writs are treated of in separate articles and the procedure .is regulated with great detail. The respective articles define how and when and by what authority writs to which they severally relate may be issued. The power to issue writs of <em>habeas corpus </em>was for obvious reasons conferred upon both the supreme court at Special or General Term, and upon judges out of court, and judicial officers authorized to perform the duties of a judge (\u00a72017). But the articles relating to writs of mandamus expressly confines the power to issue the writ of a court at Special or General Term. Section 2068 is as follows: \u201c Except where special provision is made therefor in this article, a writ of mandamus can be granted only at a Special Term of the court. In the supreme court, the Special Term .must be one held within the judicial district embracing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>county wherein an issue of fact founded upon an alternative writ is triable as prescribed in this article.\u201d The following section (2069) prescribes in what cases the writ may or shall be granted at General Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Section 2069 contains the only provision in the article which permits any tribunal other than the Special Term to grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The right of a judge out of court to grant the writ seems to be necessarily excluded by the language of section 2086, since there is \u201c no other provision in the article \u201d conferring upon a judge out of court the authority. Even if an application for a writ of mandamus is a motion within section 768 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is taken out of the operation of section 770 by the peremptory and unequivocal language of section 2068. In the article relating to writs of prohibition are sections limiting the power to issue those writs to the court at Special or General Term, substantially as in the case of mandamus. It is difficult to suppose that the power to issue the extraordinary writ of prohibition was intended to be vested in a judge out of court, under the language of section 770, and yet this result would follow if the construction placed by the courts below upon the power of a judge to issue a mandamus is correct; the language of the statute in both cases being substantially the same. We find it impossible to avoid the conclusion that a judge at chambers in the City of New York, or elsewhere within the State, has no jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The right of a voter to vote may be lost unless this power shall be conferred. Under the statute no court can be open within the State on the day of any general election to transact any business, except for the purpose of receiving a verdict or discharging a jury and for the exercise by a single magistrate of certain jurisdiction in criminal cases (\u00a7 5, tit. I, c. 130, <em>L. </em>1842, as amended by section 2, c. 240, <em>L. </em>1847). The voter who is refused the right to vote can resort to no court for relief until after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>his right is lost, as no court can entertain his application on election day. If an enlarged jurisdiction in these cases is expedient, the remedy is with the legislature. Voters outside of New York can have no relief by mandamus issued on the day of election, and we think the voters of that city under the arrangement of the statutes are in the same situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Our conclusion requires a reversal of the orders of the Special and General Terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">All the judges concurred, except Gray, J., dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">N.

Beyond those days legal proceedings are left untrammeled and courts may be opened and litigation may be continued on any other day.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In People <em>ex rel. </em>Fulton <em>v. </em>Supervisors of Oswego, 50 <em>Hun, </em>105, (holding that a writ of mandamus maybe served on Saturday afternoon) the court say: \u201cThe statute <em>(L. </em>1887, c. 289, amending <em>L. </em>1875, c. 27, as amended by <em>L. </em>1881, c. 30) which makes Saturday afternoon a half-holiday provides: \u201c The days and half days aforesaid shall be considered as the first day of the week commonly called Sunday and as public holidays for all purposes whatsoever as regards the transaction of business in the public offices of this State, or counties of this State . . . This provision is a limited one, it relates only to the transaction of business in the public offices of the State and counties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">S. P., People <em>v. </em>Kearney, 47 <em>Hun, </em>129, holding that a court is not a public office within the meaning of the statute, and that they may lawfully sit on Saturday afternoons.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">\u2014 <em>on election day.] </em>King <em>v. </em>Platt, 37 <em>N. Y. </em>155 ; S. C., more fully, 3 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>434; 35 <em>How. Pr. </em>23. A sale by a referee in foreclosure is not void because it was made upon an election day. Such sale is not business of a court within the statute prohibiting such business on election day.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The court say: \u201c The object of the law referred to was undoubtedly to remove all obstacles which might necessarily interfere with the free exercise of the elective franchise. If the ordinary business of the courts was permitted on election days, the attendance of witnesses and jurors could be compelled by compulsory process, and in that way they could be forcibly kept from the polls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Redfield <em>v. </em>Florence, 2 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>339. A law <em>(L. </em>1853, p. 414) \u2014providing for the submission of amendments to the charter of a city to the vote of the electors thereof\u2014does not establish a special election within the meaning of the sixth chapter of the R. S., and there is no objection to the holding of a court and the trial of an action on the day designated for taking such vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Bierce <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>411. A judgment by default, based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>upon service of summons upon an elector on election day is irregular and will be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">S. P., Meeks <em>v. </em>Noxon, 1 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>280 ; Vanderpoel <em>v. </em>Wright, 1 <em>Cow. </em>209.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Rice <em>v. </em>Mead, 22 <em>How. Pr. </em>445. The mere entry of a judgment by a justice of the peace on a general election day in a cause previously tried is not within the statutory prohibition forbidding the opening of courts on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The court say, in distinguishing between Sunday and election day -: \u201c That day [Sunday] was regarded <em>dies non juridicus </em>before our legislature ever passed any statute making it such. It is clear that a judgment rendered on Sunday is void. And no one can doubt that the legislature prohibited the doing of such an act on Sunday; for the presumption is irresistible that they intended that day should not be unnecessarily polluted by courts. But the legislature could not have had any such intention in prohibiting courts from being opened or transacting any business on days that general elections are held......The only motive the legislature could have had in enacting the statute under consideration was to close the courts on general election days so that no elector should be hindered or kept from voting by them, unless guilty of an offense, or of threatening to commit one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Sunday.] Allen <em>v. </em>Godfrey, 44 <em>N. Y. </em>433. Judgment may be entered in a justice\u2019s court on Monday upon a verdict rendered on Sunday notwithstanding a justice of the peace is required by statute in all cases where a verdict is rendered to forthwith render judgment and enter the same in his docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">Field <em>v. </em>Park, 20 <em>Johns. </em>140. Service of notice of motion on Sunday is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">Van Vechten <em>v. </em>Paddock, 12 <em>Johns. </em>178. <em>Held, </em>that process can not be <em>issued </em>on Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">The court say: \u201c The statute (2 <em>N. R. L. </em>194; 1 <em>R. S. </em>675) prohibiting the service of process on Sunday does not literally extend to this case. Nor was it necessary that it should ; for according to my understanding of the law on the subject, no process can be legally issued on Sunday. The same principles of policy, as well as of religion and morality, would interdict the issuing as well as the service of process on Sunday. And had not common law made it illegal, it is most likely that the statute would have also extended to this case. It is a maxim of the law that Sunday is <em>dies non juridicus, </em>and usage and the history of the law show that the courts cannot sit on Sunday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Hoghtaling v. Osborn, 15 <em>Johns. </em>118. It is proper to receive a verdict, but illegal to enter a judgment on Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Butler v. Kelsey, 15 <em>Johns. </em>177. A writ of inquiry of damages upon default cannot be executed on Sunday; nor can the jury declare their verdict on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The court say: \u201c The writ was executed on Sunday, within the meaning of the statute. There was no necessity for taking the inquisition on Sund'ay, as the cause might have been adjourned over until Monday. It is not like the case of a trial at a circuit where a verdict is sometimes taken on Sunday morning because the jury must otherwise be kept together during Sunday.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Rob v. Moffat, 3 <em>Johns. </em>257. Where a writ was served on Sunday and the sheriff returned <em>cepi corpus, </em>on which the plaintiff proceeded and obtained judgment by default and execution, the court ordered all the proceedings to be set aside with costs on condition that no action should be brought against the sheriff for false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">[Decided under act for suppressing immorality, Sess. 36, c. 24, \u00a7 5, 2 <em>R. L. </em>193, which forbade service on Sunday of any writ, process, warrant, etc.]</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Pulling v. People, 8 <em>Barb. </em>384. Where a cause pending before a court of special sessions was submitted to the jury at 2 o'clock Sunday morning and the jury rendered their verdict at 3 o\u2019clock, held that the conviction was erroneous and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Wood v. City of Brooklyn, 14 <em>Barb. </em>425. An arrest can not be made on Sunday for a violation of a municipal ordinance as to the sale of intoxicating liquor. So held under 1 <em>R. S. </em>675, \u00a7 69, prohibiting on Sunday the service of process or warrant or other proceedings of any court or officer of justice, except in cases of breach of the peace or for the apprehension of persons charged with crimes and misdemeanors or for the disturbance of religious meetings or for the violation of the Sunday laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">Merritt v. Earle, 31 <em>Barb. </em>38 ; aff\u2019d in 29 N. <em>Y. </em>115. The court say : \u201c It must be remembered that all prohibitions of ordinary busi- \u25a0 ness on Sunday with us, comes from the statute. At common law judicial proceedings only were prohibited on Sunday, which is said in the books to be <em>dies 71071 juridims. </em>Even this is not strictly on the grounds of morality or of the Christian religion as recognized by the common law, nor was it the original practice of the Christian church. It was introduced, like many other doctrines and practices, some of which are perhaps less commendable, into popular Christianity and thence into common law and usage by the influence Of the clergy. It was well known to lawyers, at least, that until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>year 500 the Christian courts were open and legal business transacted in the ordinary way on Sundays as on other days. In the year 517, a canon was made forbidding this practice, which canon was subsequently confirmed by imperial constitution. It was received with other parts of the law by the Saxon kings of England, and afterwardsratified by William the Conqueror and Henry the II. Thus it comes that judicial proceedings on Sunday are void at common law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Story <em>v. </em>Elliot, 8 <em>Cow. </em>27. An award by arbitrators isa judicial act and, therefore, if made and published on Sunday, it is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Isaacs <em>v. </em>Beth Homedash Soc., 1 <em>Hilt. </em>469. An award of arbitrators drawn up and signed on Sunday, but dated and delivered on the following day, is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Wright <em>v. </em>Jeffrey, 5 <em>Cow. </em>15. Where the <em>capias ad respondendum </em>was returnable on Sunday, <em>held, </em>that putting in special bail although without knowledge of the defect, was a waiver of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Gould <em>v. </em>Spencer, 5 <em>Paige, </em>541. Where a complainant made-his subpoena returnable Sunday and afterwards took out an attachment thereon against defendant for not appearing, the court set. .aside the attachment as irregular.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Hastings <em>v. </em>Farmer, 4 <em>N. Y. </em>293, 296. <em>It seems </em>that where process in a civil action is served on Sunday or election day that a, judgment rendered in such action will be void and that it is not .necessary for the defendant so served to plead the objection in order to render it available on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">[Compare S. C. in court below, reported as Hastings <em>v. </em>Ellis, 3 <em>Barb. </em>492.]</p>\n<p id=\"A01\"><em>Saturday kept as </em>Sunday.] Maxson <em>v. </em>Annas, 1 <em>Den. </em>204. The act in relation to the Seventh-day Baptists <em>(Stat. </em>1830, p. 335), which-prohibits the service and execution of all writs, process, warrants, orders, judgments, etc., on Saturday upon any person who keeps, that day as the Sabbath, and declares that such service shall be void,, does not affect a judgment rendered against such person on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">Marks <em>v. </em>Wilson, 11 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>87. Under <em>L. </em>1847, c. 349, exempting persons keeping the seventh day holy from performing certain duties thereon; and declaring any person guilty of a misdemeanor who should knowingly or maliciously cause any process issued from a justice court in a civil suit to be served on such <em>day\u2014Held,. </em>that a judgment in summary proceedings to recover real property was not void because the process was served on Saturday upon a person keeping that day holy, where there is nothing to show that, the service on that day was knowingly and maliciously made upon defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\"><em>Old rule in </em>chancery.] Wheeler <em>v. </em>Bartlett, 1 <em>Edw. </em>323. Under 2 <em>Laws </em>1813, p. 342\u2014providing that it shall not be lawful \u201cfor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>any officer or minister of justice \u201d to serve any civil process on election <em>day,\u2014Held, </em>that service of writs of subpoena and injunction was not forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">[The following note is appended to the report of this case : \u201c By the ancient practice of the English court of chancery great license was allowed in the service of the subpoena: * The service is good \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">says Gilbert in his <em>Forum. Romanum, </em>\u2018 in the night or on Sunday, if it be before the time of the return ; for this being only process of notice, and not to arrest the parties, it can create no disturbance though it be served in the night or on Sunday.\u2019]</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\"><em>Declaration not process.] </em>Corlies <em>v. </em>Holmes, 20 <em>Wend. </em>681. The-service, on election day, of a declaration in a suit, commenced by the filing and service of a declaration, is not a violation of the statute forbidding the service of civil process on an elector during-the time appointed for the election of State and county officers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
