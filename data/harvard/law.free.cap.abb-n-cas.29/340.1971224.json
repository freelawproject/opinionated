Wolfe, died in the City of New York, leaving a last will and testament, which was duly admitted to probate, -and letters testamentary issued thereon on May 31 of that year. By this will certain legacies were left to appellants. On June 20, 1887, the executors of said Wolfe petitioned \u2022the surrogate for the appointment of an appraiser, in \u2022order that the amoumt of the tax upon the various \"legacies of the decedent might be ascertained and declared <em>-.so </em>far as said petitioners were bound to pay the same. Of this application neither the comptroller nor the district \u2022attorney had any notice. On June 23, 1887, said executors filed a supplemental petition, stating that the .said order of June did not prescribe the notice to be given of such appointment to the parties interested, and praying that an order be made fixing a reasonable time for such notice to parties interested. Thereupon, on the following \u2022day, an order was made prescribing notice to several persons, not including the comptroller or district attorney. Thereafter the appraiser appointed by the surrogate proceeded to appraise the property of the decedent, subject to the tax imposed by chapter 483 of the Laws of 1885, and in August, 1887, made and filed his report, in which the .sole reference to the two gifts or legacies above set forth, is as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u201c Amount to be paid to institutions which are free of tax, viz.: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 6th section, $200,000; Rector, Wardens, etc., Grace Church, codicil, $350,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">On August 27, 1887, an order was made by the surrogate confirming said report in all things and assessing the taxes upon various legacies and gifts given by said decedent under her said will, under the provisions of said act. And it was further ordered that nothing therein contained should be construed as an adjudication as to the liability to taxation of property of said estate, whether thereinbefore mentioned or not, except so far as the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>was thereinbefore assessed for such taxation, and that all questions as to the liability to taxation and the value for' that purpose of property not therein assessed were reserved for further consideration upon September 15, 1887, at eleven o\u2019clock in the forenoon, which time and place were-thereby assigned fora hearing upon the following question, viz.: Why the property disposed of in the 5th, 6th, 12th, 17th and 18th clauses of the will of said Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, and in the codicil to said will, should not be valued and assessed under said act; these clauses including the provisions contained in the will and codicil for the appellants. On September 3, 1887, a copy of the appraiser\u2019s report and of said order of August 27 was-mailed by the attorneys for the executors to various persons, including the comptroller of the City of New York, and on September 6 a copy of said order of August 27 was-served upon the comptroller by an assistant of the surrogate, and on October 29, 1887, the surrogate made an order reciting the previous order of August 27, and the-hearing upon the questions reserved thereunder on September 15, and thereby adjudged among other things, that the legacies to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the legacy to Grace Church, were each of them exempt from taxation under said act. No copy of this order was served upon the comptroller or the district attorney. After the making and entry of said order or decree of the surrogate, dated October 29, 1887, the executors of said decedent, relying upon said decree, and in good faith, paid and delivered to the appellants said gifts and legacies given to them under said will and codicil. On March 19, 1889, the court of appeals decided that a religious society like Grace Church was not exempt from the tax in question.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In June, 1890, by chap. 553 of the Laws of 1890, an act was passed exempting religious, educational and other societies from the provisions of the Collateral Inheritance Tax acts. Subsequently, in June, 1890, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>court of appeals decided that, as there was no legislative-intention shown in the act of 1890, above referred to, that it should have a retroactive effect, its operation was only-prospective.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> On October 15, 1890, the petition herein was filed by the district attorney, who states that he has. been notified in writing of the refusal or neglect of the executors to pay the tax as above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The answer of the appellants pleaded the decision of the surrogate upon the final order entered upon October 29, 1887, that more than two years had elapsed since said legacy had been paid, and that the jurisdiction of the-surrogate in respect to the same had ceased, and claimed exemption under the law of 1890 above referred to. The-matter was referred by the surrogate to a referee, who reported the facts. Exceptions were filed to the referee\u2019s-report, which were overruled by the surrogate, who adopted the conclusion of the referee that the appellants were liable to the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"AM3\">An amendment to the act of 1885 was passed on March. 19, 1892, which, after amending section 1 of the original act, also added to that section the following words:. \u201c Provided further that any property heretofore devised or bequeathed, or which may hereafter be devised or bequeathed to any person who is a bishop, &lt;5r to any religious, corporation, shall be exempted from, and not subject to, the provisions of this act.\u201d On April 30, 1892, chapter 399, the act of 1885 was remodeled, section 2 of the last mentioned act containing a similar exemption of any property heretofore or hereafter devised or bequeathed to any person who is a bishop, or to any religious corporation. By the 25th section of said last mentioned act, it is provided that the provisions of this act, so far as they are substantially the same as those of laws existing on April 30, 1892, shall be construed as a continuation of such laws, modified or amended according to the language employed in this act,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>.and not as new enactments. A petition was filed upon the part of the appellants for leave to set up this legislation as a further answer to the proceedings, which application was denied, the surrogate holding that the provisions of the act of 1892 did not exempt the appellants from liability to the tax. Orders were thereupon entered in conformity to the decision, and the appeals now before the court were taken therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">There are two questions involved in the consideration of these appeals. The first is whether the proceedings before the surrogate, by which he decided that the appellants were not liable to the tax, made the question <em>res adjudicata. </em>The discussion of counsel in respect to this point was largely addressed to the question as to whether the comptroller was bound by the decision of the surrogate without having received notice. It seems to us that in respect of notice, by section 13 of chapter 483 of the Laws of 1885, it is entirely discretionary with the surrogate as to what notice shall be given and to whom; and that such proceedings maybe initiated either upon the application of .any interested party, or upon the surrogate\u2019s own motion. The section provides for the appointment of an appraiser upon the application of any interested party, or upon the motion of the surrogate, whenever occasion shall require, whose duty it shall be forthwith to give such notice by mail, to such persons as the surrogate may by order direct, \u25a0of the time and place he will appraise such property, and at such time and place the appraiser shall appraise the same and make a report, and upon the receipt of the report, the surrogate shall forthwith assess and fix the then cash value, and shall immediately give notice thereof by mail to .all parties known to be interested therein, and that any person or persons dissatisfied with said appraisal or assessment, may appeal therefrom to the surrogate of the proper \u25a0county, within sixty days after the making and filing of such assessment. It is clear that in all these proceedings there is no obligation to give notice- to any person until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>after the surrogate has made the assessment, and then notice by mail shall be given to all parties interested therein. And it would seem that it was this portion of the act, which it was attempted to comply with, by serving the order which the surrogate made upon the coming in of the appraiser\u2019s report, in this case upon the comptroller. The comptroller was not a person interested in the estate. His interests were not to be affected by any action which the surrogate might take. It was a question as to the right of the State ; and the legislature could provide that the surrogate should go on and assess this tax without any notice to any State official. And that is what the legislature seems to have done, and therefore if the surrogate had jurisdiction to determine in the proceeding mentioned, the question of exemption, the determination mentioned was binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">But, upon an examination of the act, we fail to find any authority upon the part of the surrogate to determine the question that a party is not liable to taxation, except, perhaps, in a proceeding initiated by the district attorney. The surrogate has the power, upon the application of an interested party, or upon his own motion, to appoint an appraiser for the purpose of assessing the tax. But nothing is said in respect to any power upon the part of the surrogate to adjudicate as to what is liable to tax and what is exempt. It may be claimed that the power to assess implies the power to declare the property exempt, especially .in view of the provisions of section 15 of the act of 1885, which provides that \u201cthe surrogate\u2019s court in the county of which the decedent was a resident at the time of his death, shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions in relation to the tax arising under the provisions of said act.\u201d But this provision evidently was not intended to give the surrogate the right, in any way that he might see fit, to determine all questions in relation to the tax, but simply that, in the manner prescribed by the act, he should have authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>to determine all questions relative to the tax. The \u2022scheme of the act preceding this general grant of power related only to appraisement of property, and did not furnish any machinery for determining the question of exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">By the 16th and 17th sections, however, a method is provided for the determination of this question. Section 17 provides that whenever the treasurer or comptroller \u25a0of any county shall have reason to believe that any tax is due, and unpaid under this act, after the refusal or neglect of the persons interested in the property liable to said tax to pay the same, he shall notify the district attorney of the proper county in writing of such failure to pay such tax, and the district attorney so notified if he have probable cause to believe a tax is due and unpaid shall prosecute the proceeding in the surrogate\u2019s court in the proper county as provided in section 16 for the enforcement and collection of such tax. And section 16 declares, that if it shall appear to the surrogate\u2019s court, that any tax accruing under this act has not been paid according to law, it shall issue a citation citing the persons interested in the property liable to the tax, to appear before the court, on a day certain not more than three months after the date of such citation, and show cause why such tax should not be paid. In this proceeding the question of exemption or non-exemption can be determined. But until such proceeding is taken, the act does not seem to provide any manner in which the issue of exemption from taxation can be presented for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">It may be said that this imposing the burden upon executors of being called upon to pay legacies, and upon estates of being liable to additional interest, because of noncompliance with the law, although they are absolutely unable to compel a determination of their liability to pay, which is unreasonable. But this branch of the legislation is no more incongruous, remarkable and unreasonable than many other provisions of the acts relative to collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>inheritance tax ; they becoming more remarkable the more the question is legislated upon. As for example, in the , act of 1892, it is provided that any property heretofore or hereafter devised or beq\u00fceathed to any person who is a bishop, or to any religious society, shall be exempt, whereas a legacy to a child of the testator is made the subject of a tax, it seeming to have been the opinion of the legislature that a bishop or religious corporation has greater \u2022claims upon testators than their own children\u2014a piece of legislation the parallel of which it would be difficult to find .among legislative enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">If the surrogate had no jurisdiction to pass upon the question of exemption, then it is clear that his adjudication was no protection to the parties acting thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The next question presented is: Has the subsequent legislation relieved the appellants from the payment of the tax in question ? The learned surrogate was of the \u2022opinion that it had not, and attention is called to the decision of our court of last resort in the Matter of Miller (110 N. <em>Y. </em>216). In that case the surrogate says: \u201c The testatrix died in September, 1886. On March 24, 1887, an order was entered confirming the appraisement and .assessing the tax. The tax was not paid. In August, 1887, the legatee asked that the order be vacated, on the .ground that he was an adopted child and that by the act passed June 25, 1887, he was exempt. He contended that the act of 1887 not only made any proceeding for its \u2022collection impossible, but that it related back to the passage of the act of 1885, and, in effect, nullified the proceeding which led to the order, and annulled the order itself.\u201d The court said in the case cited : \u201c This construction would \u25a0render void not only the order in question, which was valid when made, but all other similar proceedings, although regular when taken, and would, as said in Ely <em>v. </em>Holton (15 N. <em>Y. </em>595), lead to the grossest absurdities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">No legislative intention to that effect is discoverable in the act of 1887. The order was complete and perfect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the moment it was made, subject to modification or reversal on appeal, but every st&amp;p had been taken which depended for its force upon the original act. So far as the order is concerned, and the rights and the liabilities of the parties thereunder, it was a transaction complete and closed before the passage of the amendatory act, and being-in that condition we properly apply the words quoted in Butler <em>v. </em>Palmer (1 Hill, 324, 355). \u201c The law itself may be disannulled by the author, but the right acquired by virtue of that law, whilst in force, must still remain.\u201d The surrogate then continues : \u201c While it is not necessary to determine at this time the effect of this amendment, so far as it concerns the estates of decedents dying prior to its-passage, wherein proceedings for the assessment of the tax have not been instituted or completed, it is difficult to see how, in view of the decision in the Matter of Miller, the court can hold otherwise than that the act has only a prospective effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">And this view of the learned surrogate, it seems to us,, must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In the case of Key <em>v. </em>Goodwin (4 <em>Moore &amp; Payn, </em>341) Lord Chief Justice TlNDAL laid down the rule as follows : <em>\u201c </em>The effect of the repeal of a statute is to obliterate it (the statute repealed) as completely from the record of the parliament as if it had never passed, and it must be considered as a law that never existed, except for the purpose of these'actions or suits which were commenced, persecuted and completed while it was an existing law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Applying these principles to the case at bar, it would seem that the assessment in question having been entirely completed so far as the surrogate was concerned prior to the enactment of the exemption clauses, the appellants, cannot gain any benefit therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">It would seem, therefore, that the decree of the surrogate should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">O\u2019Brien, J., concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> Catlin <em>v. </em>Trinity Church, 113 <em>N.

In my judgment the State was not concluded by the order originally made by the surrogate exempting these corporations from the tax. The tax is to be paid \u201c to the comptroller for the use of the State but that does not authorize this official to bind the State, except by the result of an independent proceeding, such as is provided for in section 17 of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Nor could the surrogate conclude the State by acting upon his own motion, or by a decision in proceedings (instituted under section 13 of the act) to fix the value of taxable estates. ' The \u201c persons interested \u201d in that proceeding are those whose estates were assessible. Its sole object is to correctly assess and fix the cash value of these estates, that is, (to quote the act) \u201c of all estates, annuities and life estates or terms of years growing out of \u201d the main estate of the decedent. The persons interested in having a fair appraisal are entitled to notice, and they alone can appeal to the surrogate from his own action in assessing and fixing the cash value of their estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Provision for such appeal is made in favor of any person or persons dissatisfied with the appraisement or assessment, but no provision is made for an appeal by whoever may be dissatisfied with non-appraisement or non-assessment, because of supposed exemption\u2014a clear implication that an adjudication under this section alone, of the question of liability, was not contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Section 15 of the act is, however, invoked in aid of the jurisdiction. That section does confer upon the surrogate jurisdiction to \u201c hear and determine all questions in relation to the tax arising under the provisions of the act. But this is surely subject to the ordinary rules which govern all hearings and determinations. It is not jurisdiction to hear and determine <em>ex parte, </em>or without notice to the person to be affected by the judgment. Here the State had no notice. An order, it is true, was served upon the comptroller, but this order was not one upon which the jurisdiction to hear and determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>question of exemption could properly be exercised. Even if it were such an order, however, and even if its service upon the comptroller would have been service upon the State, it was not such an original process or mandate as the law contemplates. The papers upon which it was founded were not served, and the order, on its face and standing alone, conveyed no clear idea that the question of liability of these particular corporations was to be considered at the time and place specified. The comptroller was not directed to show cause against the exemption. There was simply a statement in the order that the question whether the property disposed of in certain clauses of the will should not be valued and assessed, was reserved for further consideration on a particular day assigned for a hearing. The indorsement upon the order, too, was misleading. It simply informed the comptroller that .the paper was a certified copy of a decree \u201c confirming appraiser\u2019s report and fixing tax, etc., in estate of Catherine L. Wolfe, filed herein^ August 27, 1887.\u201d There was nothing in this to call the comptroller\u2019s attention to the question reserved. So far, therefore, as the comptroller was concerned, the proceeding was without notice, and as against the State, the judgment amounted to nothing more than <em>ex parte </em>instructions to the executors, which the surrogate was not authorized to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Upon the second point I think the corporations are concluded by the decretal order of February 29, 1892. The present proceeding was under section 17, for the enforcement and collection of the tax, and it was ended by this decretal order, which directed payment of a specific sum. The right of the State to the tax thereupon became vested, and this right was not divested by the subsequent passage {in March and April, 1892) of exemption acts. This proceeding- was therefore completed under existing laws granting no exemption. The vested rights thereby acquired were not affected by the subsequent appeal to the surrogate under section 13.</p>\n<summary id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Appeal by District Attorney from so much of the \u25a0decree of New York Surrogate Court as exempted the executors from personal liability for the collateral inheritance tax assessed by the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b405-6\"><em>Benj.

The surrogate might, upon the appeal taken by these corporations, under this section, have reduced the amount directed to be paid, but he could not, after a final order \u2022decreeing non-exemption and directing the enforcement of the tax assessed, treat the main question of liability to taxation as <em>res nova. </em>The proceedings were therefore complete when the exemption acts of 1892 were passed, \u25a0and the State then had a judgment for the tax, which was not impaired by these acts, even if the amount directed to be paid might have been reduced upon the subsequent .appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>III.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae_\">The facts involved in this appeal are the same as those in the case decided herewith, in which the question of the liability of Grace Church and the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the tax has been discussed and disposed of, and, therefore, it is not necessary,, in this opinion, to repeat what has already been said therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">In the decree holding the said institutions liable for the tax, the learned surrogate also held that the executors, of the decedent were not personally liable for the amount of the tax due upon the legacies to said legatees, nor for the costs and disbursements herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The theory upon which the decision is based, was that the executors had acted in good faith, relying upon the decree of the surrogate\u2019s court in paying over the legacies-in question, without retaining the amount of the tax. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>if the view which we have arrived at upon the appeal relative to the liability of these institutions for the tax, is correct, then we do not see how the executors can escape the liability imposed by statute. If the surrogate has no jurisdiction in the proceeding to entertain the question which he did of the exemption of these institutions from the Inheritance Tax, then it is difficult to see how such decree could be a protection to anybody for anything done in pursuance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">If the surrogate had no jurisdiction, he had no power to make a decree which would be of any effect whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">If the question related merely to a matter of regularity in proceeding of which the surrogate had jurisdiction, then, perhaps, the conclusion at which he arrived might have been upheld. But where no jurisdiction of the subject matter, viz., of the question of exemption of these corporations from the tax, has been obtained by the surrogate, his adjudication upon that subject is absolutely null and void. Therefore, as we have held that the surrogate had no jurisdiction in the proceeding to determine this question of exemption, it necessarily follows that the liabilities of parties remained precisely the same as though no such proceedings had been instituted. We think, therefore, that this portion of the decree with reference to the personal liability of the executors was wrong, and should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">As to the question of costs and disbursements of the proceedings, that was a matter within the discretion of the surrogate, and he had a right to make the. adjudication as to them which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The decree should, therefore, be modified in the respect named and affirmed as modified without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">O\u2019Brien and Barrett, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>NOTE ON THE DUTY OF AND LIABILITY OF EXECUTOR, ETC., UNDER THE COLLATERAL INHERITANCE TAX ACT.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The cases thus far decided on this question, several of which are overruled by the case in the text, are as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Matter of Vassar, 127 N. <em>Y. </em>1. In holding that the increase or interest of decedent\u2019s estate not to be subject to the collateral inheritance tax, the court say: that the provisions of the collateral tax law \u201c are inconsistent with the claim that the tax is not to be assessed until the final accounting of the executors, and then is to be assessed upon the interest that has been collected upon the funds in. their hands. This would not only deprive the legatees of the right to avail themselves of the discount of five per cent., but would subject them to the liability of being taxed upon interests thereafter accruing. The better and more reasonable construction of the statute is, that the property of which the person died seized or possessed is subject to the tax ; that the increase or interest thereafter obtained by the executors, is property of which the testator was. not seized or possessed at the time of his death ; that the property should be appraised and the tax assessed as soon after death as. practicable, and the tax should then became immediately due and payable, that the provisions for charging interest thereon, in case it is not paid, is in lieu of any increase or interest that maybe derived from the estate by the executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Estate of Mrs. Astor (N.

An executor or administrator at any time after qualifying, <em>may apply for the appointment of an appraiser </em>and have the question, whether legacies or other interest passing under the will, or by intestacy, are liable to collateral inheritance tax, and if so, the amount, in order that he may pay the-tax without delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Matter of Farley (N.

A <em>motion </em>by an executor to have the surrogate determine whether a devise or bequest is within the exemptions of the collateral inheritance tax law, will not be entertained; the only method by which a decision of such a question can be obtained is by the district, attorney instituting proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Matter of Arnett, 49 <em>Hun, </em>599. In proceedings before a surrogate for the settlement of an estate of a decedent, the People of the State is a proper party to the proceedings as a \u201c creditor or person interested in the proceedings, because of its claim to receive the col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>lateral inheritance tax therefrom; and although no authority is conferred by the statute as to the collateral inheritance tax upon the district attorney to appear in such proceedings for the people, yet if he does so appear, his authority will be presumed as in the case of any other attorney appearing in a court of record, and by such appearance the people will be regarded as having become a party, especially where, upon appeal from such proceedings, the attorney general appears and adopts the action of the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Frazer <em>v. </em>People (Kings County Surr.

An executor can not be charged with \u201crefusal or neglect\u201d in paying the collateral inheritance tax so as to be held liable for costs in proceedings instituted by the district attorney to collect the tax, if he has caused the property to be appraised in time to enable him to pay the tax before the expiration of eighteen months after the death of the testator, and he actually pays the tax before the expiration of such time.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The court say: \u201c It is primarily the duty of the executor to apply for such appraisement, so that he may ascertain and pay the tax. The power given to the surrogate, of his own motion to cause appraisement to be made, and to fix the tax, was not intended to relieve the personal representatives from their duty in the matter.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Matter of Vanderbilt (N.

Where an executor has paid the collateral inheritance tax under an order of the surrogate, which is reversed upon appeal, he can not obtain restitution from the comptroller of N. Y. City by motion made under Code Civ.

The imposition and collection of the collateral inheritance tax, are simply incidents in the final settlement and adjustment of the estates of deceased per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>sons in surrogate\u2019s courts, and one not so foreign to the jurisdiction generally exercised by such courts, as to make the collateral inheritance tax law unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Estate of Vanderbilt (N.

Overruled on other grounds in Matter of Vassar, 127 <em>N. Y. </em>1. The imposition and collection of the collateral inheritance tax being simply incidents to the final settlement and adjustment of estates, the surrogate has the same power to compel the payment of the tax by the executor, as he has to compel the payment of a legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">S.

J., says : \u201d The executor was bound to pay the tax without approvement, if the facts were admitted. Whether an approval was made depended on extrinsic facts. If the gift of money was made by deceased to the executor, and he was outside the degree of kin not subject to tax, his duty was to pay the money due the State without further order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">Matter of Prout (N. Y. Surr. Ct. 1888), 19 <em>State Rep. </em>318; S. C., 3 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>831. Under the collateral tax act the surrogate has power to enforce the payment of the tax by such proceedings as are provided for the enforcement of decrees of the surrogate\u2019s court. The payment of the tax by persons interested, other than administrators, executors, etc., can only be enforced by punishment for contempt under Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 2555, after execution against their property has been issued. Executors and administrators, however, may be punished without execution having been issued.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
