Through various mesne conveyances, each of which, with an unimportant exception, was made subject to the party wall agreement, Arkenburgh\u2019s lot came into the ownership of one Stein, who began to build upon the land, and made use of the party wall.

They argue that it was not competent for the court to grant this relief inasmuch as the issue tendered by the pleadings was the plaintiffs\u2019 right to an injunction. I think, however, that, with all the facts before the court, upon a demand for its. equitable intervention, it had jurisdiction to administer such equitable remedies as the merits of the case justified. It was a most familiar principle of chancery procedure that where the court in equity obtained jurisdiction for the purpose of injunction and was in full possession of the merits, it would retain the suit in order to complete justice between the parties and that principle seems quite applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">It was clear that relief by way of injunction was not proper to be granted, with such an agreement as the basis, for any intervention by the court; but it was equally clear that if the agreement was valid and constituted a charge upon the defendants\u2019 premises, its obligation might be enforced in this particular way. Either the agreement was a common law obligation, personally enforceable by ordinary action, or it was an instrument which impressed with a lien the lands affected. In either case the right to-use the wall was absolutely granted, and the obligation to-pay the value of the one-half upon the premises adjacent to those of the builder of the wall, when it was availed of,, if not personally assumed by the adjacent property owner,was enforceable against his land.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">It could not be error, and it was not inequitable, for the court to give to the agreement a proper and legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>effect and one which would accomplish exact justice between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">This ground of appeal, therefore, need not embarrass us in upholding the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Then, I think the objection that the agreement appears to have been executed by but one of the parties to it and, therefore, is invalid, as lacking mutuality, is without force. The instrument, which the plaintiffs produced on the trial in support of their case, though reciting its making by both parties and their desire to authorize either .to erect a party wall, was executed by Arkenburgh, the defendant\u2019s predecessor in the title. We may suppose that the agreement was interchangeably executed and delivered ; but whether the supposition be warranted, or not, the proof of a contract between Arkenburgh and Pinkney did not fail. The question is whether the plaintiffs had proved their case by making out an agreement between their and the defendants\u2019 predecessors in interest for the erection of a wall partly on the land of each; and not whether, for the plaintiffs\u2019 inability to show an actual execution by their predecessor of the instrument evidencing the agreement, they should be precluded from any recovery. I think the proofs supply any such alleged defect in the case. The wall called for by the agreement was erected by plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor in title and there was thus a performance which only the executed contract could have authorized. It was acquiesced in and, in the chain of defendants\u2019 title, the conveyances were made subject to the agreement. There was, therefore, in the existence of such facts, a sufficient proof of the making of this agreement. I do not think it lies in the defendants\u2019 mouths, as the parties sought to be charged with this agreement and standing upon Arkenburgh\u2019s title, to make the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Another objection is that the defendants are not bound by this agreement, inasmuch as there was no reference to it in the conveyance to them. I think the objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>tion is utterly without merits. Their grantor, Stein, took subject to the agreement and commenced to erect a house, using the wall for the purpose. The respective rights and obligations of the parties became fixed then. If the agreement constituted a charge upon the defendants\u2019 lands, I think it quite immaterial whether the conveyance of the title to them expressed their subjection to the agreement, or not. The fact could not be changed, and the plaintiffs could not be deprived of any rights which \u2022they may have derived through such an agreement, by an omission in the deed to the adjacent owner; and of this agreement the defendants had constructive notice from its public record, if they did not have actual notice. The defendants took the land and the building in the course of erection upon it.by Stein, subject to a.lien for the payment of half the value of the party wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">But, and this seems the more important question in the case, the appellants insist that the covenants in the party wall agreement were not covenants which ran with the land, for the reasons that no interest in the land was granted, and that there was no privity of estate between Pinkney and Arkenburgh.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">If this agreement was the ordinary one between adjoining landowners for the erection and use of a party wall on their lands, such as it was in the cases of Cole <em>v. </em>Hughes (54 <em>N. Y. </em>444) and Scott <em>v. </em>McMillan (76 <em>Id. </em>144), I think we should have to agree with the appellants\u2019 argument. But this agreement is dissimilar, in the -respect that it was expressly agreed that the covenants of the agreement should run with the land. In Cole <em>v. </em>Hughes, upon the authority of which Scott <em>v. </em>McMillan was decided, it was held of the agreement there, that it created a mere privity of contract and not of estate ; and did not impose a burden upon the land, merely because the agreement had relation to land. Both of the cases referred to were actions at law for the recovery of the \u2022value of one-half the wall and they failed, for the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\"that the grantees of the premises, whose former owner .had covenanted for himself, his .heirs and assigns, were -not liable upon the covenant. We do not interfere, in the least degree, with the well settled doctrine of these \u25a0cases, if we give to the present contract a construction -which imposed the burden of its covenants upon the land it concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The question whether \u00e1 contract having relation to \"lands is personal; or whether it constitutes a charge upon \"the lands, obviously must be determined by a consideration of the expressed intentions of the parties and of the \u25a0existence of any interest in the land raised by force of :its covenants. Words of grant are not essential to create\" \"the interest and a covenant may be construed as a grant. Such a construction has been given, where the convenant -related to a right of way over land (Holme <em>v. </em>Seller, 3 <em>Lev. </em>305).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In Hart <em>v. </em>Lyon (90 <em>N. Y. </em>663), the contract for the party wall was held unenforceable against a purchaser -at a sale in foreclosure, for being merely a personal obligation ; but the covenant that the expense of repairing, \u2022or rebuilding, the party wall should be borne equally by \"the parties, \u201c their respective heirs and assigns,\u201d was -regarded as a covenant running with the land. The \u25a0court so held in that case, because, as they, say, \u201c it is \u2022evident that it was the plain import of the instrument that the portion which bound the heirs and assigns should be construed as perpetual and as running with the land.\u201d \"Without any other reference to, or discussion \u25a0 of the many cases, which bear upon the subject of the nature of the obligation of a contract, in its connection with land, I think we may rest upon the rule that where the covenant concerns land and is one which is capable of being annexed -to the estate, and it appears that it is the intention of the parties as expressed in the instrument, then it shall be -construed as running with and charging the land there^after.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>In the present case, such an intention is evident from the express provisions of the agreement, and I think the effect of the contract clearly was to grant, or to create, an interest in the premises described.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">I see no ground for sustaining this appeal, and the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">All the judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Note on Mutuality of Signature, particularly in transactions within the'Statute of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The inconvenience of the ancient system of interchangable execution upon indentures, has led to the practice of all careful conveyancers, to take if practicable the signature of both parties to a bilateral contract, and, if each party is-to have a copy, cause each copy to be signed by both.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The signature by one, however, of an instrument accepted and acted on by the other, makes a valid contract,, unless some statute requires more. Spaulding <em>v. </em>Hallenbeck, 35 N. <em>Y. </em>204.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The principal exceptions to the general rule are those which arise under the Statute of Frauds contained in our Revised Statutes. The precise scope and effect of the technical rules as to the necessity of mutuality of signature,, and the cases in which signature of the plaintiff is essential and signature by defendant not enough, will more clearly appear by reading the provisions of the statute in connection with the Reviser\u2019s notes. The Revisers proposed to-render the statute more strict in this respect, and the Legislature did not concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The common law doctrine of the necessity of mutuality is indicated in L\u2019Amoreux <em>v. </em>Gould, 7 <em>N. Y. </em>349.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">Compare Bailey <em>v. </em>Ogden, 3 <em>Johns. </em>399, and Marie <em>v. </em>Garrison, 83 <em>N. Y. </em>14; Butler <em>v. </em>Thomson, 92 <em>U. S. </em>412.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">The reason why the want of mutuality is no objection under the statute of frauds, is that the party omits to take-the proper evidence at his own peril.

The provision has, however, been inserted by the Revisers in another chapter, to which, if proper to be declared at all, it properly belongs. The limitation also of \u25a0the rent on leases for three years is omitted, as in this \u2022country entirely useless, and making the validity of the lease depend on a fact in many cases difficult to be ascertained. The person making the lease is surely a safe judge of the rent to be reserved. Powers relating to lands have been included, in conformity to the' construction which the statute has always received. By the. 12th section declarations \u25a0of trusts must be signed by the party declaring them, but \u00ab0 reason is perceived why trusts may not be declared, as well as lands conveyed, by an agent acting under a power in writing.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Oral authority to the agent is not enough.

Under that section it has been held, among: other things :</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u201c 1. That a letter or other writing, though written subsequently to the making of the agreement, is sufficient to-take the case out of the statute. This has led to many refinements and distinctions. By omitting the words \u2018 <em>note- or memorandum thereof\u2019 </em>and requiring the contract to be-reduced to writing, the language is made more precise, and-, the door closed to the introduction of similar exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u201c 2. That the literal act of * <em>signing \u2019 </em>is not necessary,, although the statute speaks <em>o\u00ed signing.\u2019 </em>After setting out with this principle, the courts found themselves perfectly at Jarge as to what should be considered a signing. To prevent difficulties of this sort hereafter, the revisers propose to-require that these agreements shall be <em>subscribed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">\u201c 3. That it is sufficient, as against the party sought to-be charged, if the instrument be signed by him ; and accordingly the courts of equity will decree a specific performance of an agreement to sell lands, against the persom who holds the written engagement of the other party signed by him alone, though the latter may be wholly remediless.. Many of the ablest judges in England and in this country-have regretted this rule of construction. (See the remark of Chancellor Kent in 14 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>489.) The Revisers., have proposed in the above section what seems to them a sound rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">\u201c 4. That the <em>consideration </em>of the agreement be in writing.
