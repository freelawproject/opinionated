The property in controversy is a farm in the town of Coeymans, concededly worth $20,000. Peter W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Ten Eyck is th.e common source of title. The plaintiffs claim under a deed prior in date; the defendant, Catharine Witbeck, under a deed prior in registry. The plaintiff\u2019s conveyance is declared by statute to be void as against the defendant, providing she was a purchaser in good faith and for a valuable consideration. In the sense that she had no notice of the existence of the prior deed, the <em>bona fides </em>of her purchase is not disputed. The issue is therefore narrowed to the question whether she was a purchaser for a valuable consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The deed was executed July 7, 1877. The grantor was her father, and it recited a consideration of \u00a710 and the annual payment to the father during his lifetime of the entire net proceeds of the farm, and of one-third of such proceeds to his wife during her lifetime, if she survived him, and of one-third thereof to another daughter for the same period, and of one-half of such proceeds to her after the death of both parents. The grantee was given power to sell the property after the mother\u2019s \"death, and, if sold, the use of one-half of the proceeds of sale should be paid to the sister during her life; but the principal should be managed and controlled by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">It was proved that $10 in money was actually paid by her to her father at the time of the execution of the deed. Peter Ten Eyck\u2019s family then consisted of his wife and two daughters, who lived with him upon the farm, except the defendant, Mrs. Witbeck, who lived with her husband upon another farm in the same town. Immediate possession was not taken by her under her deed, but her father, with the rest of the family, continued to reside upon the farm, and, by himself and tenants, to manage and control it until his death, in 1883, after which it was in the same manner occupied by the mother and unmarried daughter until the death of the mother in 1885. In September, 1871, Ten Eyck, through an intermediate grantee, conveyed this property to his wife, who, in January, 1883, conveyed it to the plaintiffs. The defendant\u2019s deed was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>recorded December 5, 1879, but Mrs. Ten Eyck\u2019s deed, nnder which the plaintiffs claim, was not recorded until February 21, 1883. After Mrs. Ten Eyck\u2019s death the defendant took possession, and the plaintiffs brought this \u2022action in ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The defendant challenged the validity, of the plaintiff\u2019s title upon the ground of the mental incompetency of Mr. Ten Eyck, and the undue influence of his wife over him when the deed to her was executed, and of its alleged nondelivery, as well as the non-delivery of the deed from Mrs. Ten Eyck to the plaintiffs ; and upon the further ground that Mrs. Ten Eyck\u2019s deed was void as to the defendant under the recording act.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The trial court held that the defendant was not a purchaser for a valuable consideration, and was not, therefore, within the protection of the statute ; but submitted to the jury the question whether the deeds under which plaintiffs claimed had ever been delivered, and whether Peter W. Ten Eyck was of sound mind, and free from undue influence, when he executed the conveyance to his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The verdict was for the defendant, and the General Term intimate very plainly that, in their opinion, it was not supported by the evidence, and that they would have set it aside were it not for the decision of the General Term in the fifth department in the case of Hendy <em>v. </em>Smith (49 <em>Hun, </em>510; 2 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>535), which holds that a grantee for a consideration of one dollar paid is a purchaser for a valuable consideration, as the terms are used in the recording act. They felt constrained to regard this authority as controlling, and to hold, as matter of law, that the defendant had a superior title because of the prior record of her deed, and that the verdict and judgment were therefore right. The order of affirmance states that, but for the recording acts, the judgment appealed from would have been reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">From the relationship of the parties, the recitals in the defendant\u2019s deed, and the circumstances attending its exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>cution, as disclosed by the evidence, it is, we think, apparent that she cannot be regarded as a purchaser for a valuable consideration, so as to avoid the effect of the plaintiff\u2019s prior conveyance. While every legal mode of acquisition of real property, except by descent, is denominated in law a \u201c purchase,\u201d and the person who thus acquires it is a purchaser, it is evident that the word is used in this statute in a much more limited sense. It is there applied only to such grants of real estate as are obtained for money, or some other valuable consideration. It denotes a buyer of property, and has reference to one \u25a0of the actors in a transaction of bargain and sale, which is presumably controlled by commercial considerations. We think it would be a perversion of language to say that a father, who had conveyed to a daughter property of the value of $20,000 for no greater sum than $10 paid, had sold the property to his child, or that she had bought it of him. The transfer would be recognized by the popular, as well as the judicial, mind, as possessing all the \u25a0essential qualities of a gift. It has been frequently so held. In Hayes <em>v. </em>Kershow (1 <em>Sandf. Ch. </em>265) the consideration recited in the deed was one dollar paid, and love and affection, and the vice-chancellor said that this nominal sum was not such a valuable consideration as would support a bargain and sale. In Duvoll <em>v. </em>Wilson (9 <em>Barb. </em>487), the conveyance was to the grandchildren of the grantor, and recited a consideratio.n of five dollars paid; and it was held that it was not sufficient to support a covenant to stand seized. In Morris <em>v. </em>Ward (36 <em>N. Y. </em>587), the conveyance was to a granddaughter, and recited a consideration of one dollar paid and natural love and affection ; and this court held that it was an advancement, and not a sale, and that the grantee took as donee, and not as purchaser; and that it was competent, when the whole instrument shows the money consideration to have been intended as nominal merely, to give effect to :such proof, and to the intention which it indicates. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>true that in these cases it was assumed or conceded that, the nominal money consideration expressed had not been actually paid, but we do not understand that any emphasis was placed upon that fact. The decision in each case seems to have been put upon the ground that the nominal was not the real consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In the case before us every feature of the transaction is indicative of a gift. The grantor was eighty-two years of age, and the grantee was his eldest daughter. He was-evidently conscious that the end of his life was near, and desired to make some final disposition of his real property for the benefit of his family through the medium of this-daughter, in whom, for the time being, he seems to have had especial confidence. If in the full possession of his-mental faculties, he must have known that he had previously conveyed the property to his wife. Apparently there was a struggle between the different members of his household for the possession and control of the farm, which destroyed that quietude and repose so grateful to-old age. He may have thought that in this way he-could appease both factions, trusting that each might remain in ignorance of the <em>status </em>of the other until he-died, when the result of the complications which he had created would be a matter of indifference to him. But we need not speculate as to his motives. We must deal with the fact of the execution of the later deed as we find it on the record, and the extent and quality of its-consideration as shown by the proofs. It is plain that the real consideration which the grantor had in mind when he made the conveyance was not the receipt of an insignificant sum of money, but the provision which he was thereby making for the benefit of the different persons who composed his family, and all of whom had just claims upon his bounty. By its terms no one in fact would <em>enjoy </em>the use of the property until after his death,, for he reserved to himself the entire net rents and profits-\u25a0during his lifetime. The instrument was therefore most. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>emphatically of the character, and intended to take the place,of the usual testamentary distribution of a decedent\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">So far as the cases of Webster <em>v. </em>Van Steenbergh (46 <em>Barb. </em>211) and Hendy <em>v. </em>Smith <em>(supra) </em>hold a contrary doctrine, they do not have our approval. On the other hand, the cases of Fullenwider <em>v. </em>Roberts (4 <em>Dev. &amp; B. </em>278); Worthy <em>v. </em>Caddell (76 <em>N. C. </em>82 ;) Upton <em>v. </em>Basset <em>(Cro. Eliz. </em>445); Doe <em>v. </em>Routledge <em>(Cowper, </em>705); and Metcalfe <em>v. </em>Pulvertoft (1 <em>Ves. &amp; B. </em>180),\u2014so far as they hold that a purely nominal consideration is insufficient to protect the subsequent purchaser, are in harmony with the views we have expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We deem it unnecessary to undertake to determine here what degree of adequacy of price is required to uphold a subsequent deed, first recorded. Upon this branch of the case we have no occasion to go further- than to hold that a small sum, inserted and paid, perhaps because of a popular belief that some slight money consideration is necessary to render the deed valid, will not, of itself, satisfy the terms of the statute, where it appears upon the face of the conveyance or by other competent evidence that it was not the actual consideration. Where the subsequent conveyance is a mortgage, and only part of the consideration paid, there can be but little difficulty in properly adjusting the equities of the parties, for the mortgagee can then be considered as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser <em>pro tanto, </em>and the mortgage enforced to the extent to which he has parted with value upon the faith of it (Merritt <em>v. </em>Northern Railroad Co., 12 <em>Barb. </em>605 ; Pickett <em>v. </em>Barron, 29 <em>Id. </em>505; Williams <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 <em>Hill, </em>301; Stalker <em>v. </em>McDonald, 6 <em>Hill, </em>96; Peabody <em>v. </em>Fenton, 3 <em>Barb. Ch. </em>451). But in case of a deed having a mixed consideration\u2014that is, partly valuable and partly good-such a rule would be difficult of application, if not impracticable; and no case has been cited where the question has arisen in that form. There is an <em>obiter </em>remark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>by Judge Hand, in Merritt <em>v. </em>Northern Railroad Co., that such a grantee may be considered a purchaser for value as to the entire title. The point, however, is not involved in a case like the present, where the money consideration is purely nominal, or infinitesimal in amount, when compared with the value of the property granted, and is shown not to have been the real inducement of the grant. It \"is proper to observe here that the good faith of a purchaser may be seriously impaired, if not destroyed, by the inadequacy of the price at which the property is offered by a person claiming to be its owner. If the sum which the seller is willing to take is grossly disproportionate to the value of the thing which is the subject of the negotiation, it is strong proof of a defective title, and sufficient to put a prudent man upon inquiry ; and, if the buyer neglects to diligently prosecute such inquiry, he may not be awarded the standing of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. It may be said that this rule would not hold good where the relation of parent and . child exists, because of the natural and laudable desire of the former to share his worldly possessions with the latter, which is merely equivalent to saying that the actual consideration in such cases is not a pecuniary one.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">It is strenuously urged by counsel that the considerations expressed in defendant\u2019s deed, other than money, are sufficient to invest her with the title of a purchaser for value. It is not important to determine how these provisions should be construed; whether as reservations out of the property granted, or as creating a trust for the benefit of the grantor and others, or as implied covenants on the part of the grantee to annually account for the net income of the property iq the manner specified. Unquestionably, as between the parties, the defendant, by the acceptance of the deed, became bound to observe its conditions, and to render to the beneficiaries named their respective shares of the net rents and profits of the farm. But this was simply an obligation to account for the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\u2022of the property, which was the subject of the grant; and, while it might be a good consideration for the conveyance, it was in no respect a valuable consideration, as that term has been judicially defined. If for any cause the grant fltself becomes nugatory, the covenant ceases to be operative. In order to give effect to the promise, effect must be given to the deed; and if the defendant is deprived of .the land she is relieved from the obligation which she assumed on the faith of the grant (Dunning <em>v. </em>Leavitt, 85 <em>N. Y. </em>30; Rice <em>v. </em>Goddard, 14 <em>Pick. </em>293).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">There is a wide distinction between a good and a valuable consideration when the latter term is used in the statutes defining the rights of a subsequent purchaser. Blood, love and affection, future support, a precedent indebtedness, and the like, are, either of them, sufficient as a consideration between the parties ; but neither is potential enough to override the prior equities of others in the property conveyed. The phrase \u201c a purchaser in good faith and fora valuable consideration,\u201d is not peculiar to the recording act, but is one of frequent occurrence in the statutes. It can be found inthe chapters on trusts <em>(4. Rev. St. </em>8th ed. p. 2437, \u00a7\u00a7 5 r, 54, on powers ; <em>Id. </em>p. 2451, \u00a7 132) ; on conveyances <em>(Id. </em>p. 2452, \u00a7 144) ; and on frauds <em>(Id. </em>p. 2593, \u00a7 5). It is an expression which has been borrowed from the language of courts of equity, and should be interpreted in the sense in which it is there understood. As pointed out by Chancellor Walworth in Dickerson <em>v. </em>Tillinghast (4 <em>Paige, </em>215), it has a curious and instructive history in connection with its introduction into the recording act. The English registry law made the prior unrecorded deed wholly void as against the subsequent grantee, without reference to the question of notice or the payment of value. Immediately the court of chancery, with characteristic diligence, sought to relieve the earlier grantee from the hardship which the enforcement of the letter of the law might inflict, and, while respecting the command of the statute, which made his deed void at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>law, it invested him with an equitable title, which it declared should prevail over the legal title of the subsequent purchaser, if it appeared that he had notice of its existence, or did not part with value at the time of the purchase. This rule of judicial construction was incorporated by the legislature into the <em>lex scnpta </em>in almost the identical words in which it had been phrased by courts of equity. A valuable consideration has been defined by writers upon equity jurisprudence as something \u201cwhich the law esteems as an equivalent given for the grant, and it is therefore founded on motives of justice \u201d (1 <em>Story Eq.Jur. </em>10th ed. \u00a7 354). If the subsequent grantee does not give up any security or divest himself of any right, or place himself in a worse situation than he would have-been if he had received notice of the prior equitable title- or lien previous to his purchase, he will not be permitted to retain the legal title to the injury of' the prior grantee. Or, as it was tersely stated by Allen, J., in Weaver v. Barden (49 <em>N. Y. </em>291) a purchaser fora valuable consideration is a purchaser \u201c for value paid.\u201d This limited application of the term is entirely consistent with the purpose of the recording act, which was declared by the chancellor in Dickerson' <em>v. </em>Tillinghast to be the protection of those \u201c who should part with their money, property, securities, or other valuable rights, upon the faith of a conveyance or mqrtgage of real estate, supposing they were getting a good title thereto, or a legal or a specific lien thereon, without notice, or having any reason to believe that there was any previous mortgage or conveyance which could defeat such title or lien.\u201d If the rejection of the later conveyance will leave the grantee in the same position with respect to his property rights as he occupied before its execution and acceptance, he cannot be permitted to aid, however innocently, the fraudulent grantor in his effort to defeat a prior conveyance by him of the same lands. Where the grantee parts with nothing of substantial val\u00fae, he must be satisfied if he receives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>nothing, because his grantor had nothing which he could honestly convey. The considerations other than money, upon which the defendant relies, when submitted to this equitable test, fall far short of satisfying its requirements. If her deed is adjudged void, she has not lost or sacrificed anything which she possessed when it was executed, nor become encumbered with any promise or obligation which will result in a future loss or sacrifice.

Action at law by the vendee to recover back earnest money paid and for damages by reason of the breach of a contract for the assignment of a lease. Plaintiff sought to rescind on the ground that the defendant had recently derived his title from a third person by an assignment expressed to be in the consideration of \u201cone dollar and other good and valuable consideration\u201d and that such third person had in the meanwhile failed and assigned for the benefit of creditors.

In an action for specific performance the rule is stated, that equity will not interfere and decree a specific performance unless the plaintiff establishes to the satisfaction of the court that his title is a marketable title...... In an action at law, however, the plaintiff seeking to recover either damages for the failure to perform the contract, or the amount paid on the contract, is bound to show that the defendant has broken the contract, and that he (the plaintiff) has tendered performance or was able to perform the contract on his part.

In an action to recover back a payment made in the purchase price \"of real property, together with the expense incurred in examining the title, brought on the ground of the failure of defendants to give good title, it was shown that a prior owner, under whom the defendant claimed, had been one of two trustees to whom a mortgage on the property was given ; that it had been assigned by the trustees to him individually and that he brought an action to foreclose it and became the purchaser at the <em>sale.\u2014Held, </em>that the title obtained in this way is presumptively voidable at the instance of the beneficiaries of the trust, and any person taking the title from him takes it with notice of the fact that the mortgage was held by him in trust and defendant failing to show that in fact this trust created no defect, the title was not marketable.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The court say': \u201c It was competent, however, for the defendants to show that in fact this trust created no defect.
