The answer of the defendant, among other things, denied the title of plaintiff, and claimed an estate in fee in the premises by reason of its ancient charters; and demanded judgment that plaintiff\u2019s complaint be dismissed, and that defendant have judgment against plaintiff for the possession of the premises, and declaring defendant\u2019s title thereto. Upon the trial of the action, defendant obtained judgment in its favor; and subsequently, upon plaintiff\u2019s motion, such judgment was vacated pursuant to the .provisions of sections 1525 and 1646 of the Code of Civil Procedure, on the payment of all costs by plaintiff.

The intent of Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 757, is not to compel a devisee to litigate the title to real property against his will, but to enable a plaintiff to. enforce a claim against the executor or administrator of a deceased defendant, or to enable defendant to relieve himself of a burden in like manner (Citing Holsman <em>v. </em>St. John, 90 <em>N. Y. </em>461 ; Green v. Martine, 1 <em>Civ. Pro. </em>R. 129).</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-7\">II. The court has discretion to deny the right of substitution where there has been unreasonable delay (citing Coit <em>v. </em>Campbell, 82 <em>N.

Where a sole plaintiff dies and the cause of action survives or continues, the defendant is entitled as a matter of right to an order compelling the action to be continued by his representative or successor in interest (citing Holsman <em>v. </em>St. John, 90 <em>N.

On plaintiff\u2019s motion the judgment entered for the defendants was vacated, pursuant to certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, and a new trial was ordered ; the plaintiff paying all the costs in the judgment. Thereafter, and before the action was brought to trial, he died, and the defendants then applied for and obtained an order substituting Eugene Higgins, as the plaintiff\u2019s successor in interest, as plaintiff in the action, and directing him to prosecute the action pursuant to the provisions of the order which had vacated the previous judgment and had ordered a new trial of the issues. The General Term have affirmed this order, and upon the further appeal to this court of Eugene Higgins, the substituted plaintiff, it is argued that section 757 of the Code did not cover the case of a devisee, nor intend that he should be compelled to litigate the title to real property against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">We think the court has not erred in granting the defendants\u2019 application. Under the plaintiff\u2019s will, Eugene Higgins was the devisee of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the property affected, and by section 757 of the Code, the court was authorized, upon a motion, to compel the action to be continued by the successor in interest of the deceased plaintiff. The words, \u201c successor in interest,\u201d which are used in the section, refer obviously, to such a case as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In Coit <em>v. </em>Campbell (82 <em>N. Y. </em>509-516) an action' to reach certain lands, the title to which was in defendant,, Palmer, a motion by plaintiff was denied, which sought to' have the executors of Palmer, deceased, substituted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>parties to the action in his stead. -In the opinion of this court it was said, and with reference to the language of this section: \u201c There is nothing to show that Palmer\u2019s executors are his successors in interest in this litigation. It does not appear that he devised the land in question, to his executors, or that they have any interest in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">We have no doubt that Eugene Higgins was such a successor to the plaintiff\u2019s interest as was intended to be provided for in the Code, and there is nothing to show that he had renounced his interest as devisee under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">It may be further observed that there appears to be much reason in support of the order. The defendants had recovered a judgment upon issues which presented for determination, on the one side, the plaintiff\u2019s claim to the possession of the land, and on the other side, the defendants\u2019 claim to an estate in fee. The judgment having been vacated, and that determination thus lost to the defendants, they should not be deprived of the new trial which was ordered as to the issues presented. If it is of advantage to them that the title should be determined in-this action, they have a reasonable, as well as a clear right to demand its continuation by the person who has succeeded to and represents the plaintiff\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The order should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">All the judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
