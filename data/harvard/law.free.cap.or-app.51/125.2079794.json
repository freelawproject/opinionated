Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 86 S Ct 1602, 16 L Ed 2d 694 10 ALR3d 974 (1966). We allow the petition, modify our opinion, and adhere to the opinion as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The state points out that the testimony of defendant\u2019s probation officer (Mohr), which we quoted at 49 Or App 1038 and which is to the effect that Mohr would have asked the defendant to remain had the defendant sought to leave the scene of the interrogation, was given at defendant\u2019s probation revocation hearing (CA 18187 and 18188) and not at the pretrial suppression hearing in connection with the criminal charge (CA 18189). The state also points out that Mohr\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing was to the opposite effect. The state\u2019s two factual points are correct, and the state is also correct in contending that only the testimony at the pretrial suppression hearing is relevant to whether defendant\u2019s statements should have been suppressed as evidence at the criminal trial, the subject of this petition. Our earlier opinion is modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">However, we reject the state\u2019s argument that the difference in Mohr\u2019s testimony requires a different conclusion on the issue of whether defendant, as a reasonable person, would have reasonably believed he was free to leave the interrogation scene voluntarily. <em>State v. Paz, </em>31 Or App 851, 860, 572 P2d 1036 (1977), <em>rev den </em>(1978). We adhere to our opinion that, under the totality of circumstances described at 49 Or App 1038, \"a reasonable person in defendant's circumstances would reasonably have concluded that he was not free to leave.\u201d 49 Or App at 1038-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The state now contends that we have expanded the scope of custodial interrogation as analyzed in <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 US 492, 97 S Ct 711, 50 L Ed 714 (1977). We have not. In so contending, the state ignores the distinction between our denying suppression of evidence, derived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>from defendant\u2019s interrogation, in the probation revocation hearing (CA 18187 and 18188, to which the pending petition does not relate) and the suppression of the same evidence in the criminal proceeding (CA 18189). Unlike <em>Mathiason, </em>the defendant here did not voluntarily go any place to be interrogated by a police officer; he went to his probation officer\u2019s office on the latter\u2019s instruction, which, as a probationer, he was required to do or be in violation of his obligation to cooperate with his probation officer. Mr. Mohr testified at the suppression hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">\"Q. When you went to pick up Mr. Fields at his residence on the morning of the 11th, did you give him any kind of a choice to come with you or not? Did you say to him, 'Let\u2019s go down to my office to fill out your monthly report,\u2019 or did you say Would you mind coming down,\u2019 or how did you put it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">\"A. I cannot remember the specific wording of how I presented it to him. I do remember basically that I had said that I was going to have him come down to the office and fill out a monthly report, and then I wanted to talk to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Defendant was not asked to come to the office to talk to the police officer; he was confronted by the police after he arrived at the probation office and had completed the monthly report Mohr asked him to complete in connection with his probation. What the state really seeks here is an extension of <em>Mathiason </em>to permit a defendant\u2019s \"voluntary\u201d meeting with his probation officer to be converted into a voluntary submission to interrogation by the police arranged <em>sub rosa </em>between the probation officer and the police. We decline to do so. Candor between the probation officer and the probationer should be a two-way street.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">We granted the petition for reconsideration to correct our factual error in quoting the testimony of Mohr at the revocation hearing. The fact that Mohr\u2019s testimony at the pretrial suppression hearing differed from the testimony he gave at the revocation hearing, and which we quoted in our opinion, does not alter our analysis or our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Petition for reconsideration allowed; former opinion adhered to as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
