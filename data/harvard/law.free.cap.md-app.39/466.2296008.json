J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ana\">delivered the opinion of the Court. Moore, J., concurs and filed a concurring opinion at page 471 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">These cases, consolidated on appeal by order of this Court, arise from the September 9,1977, orders of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Sullivan, J.) that the appellants, The Augusta Building and Loan Association, Inc. (Augusta) and Vermont Federal Savings and Loan Association (Vermont) comply with the subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>served upon the respective appellants on March 11 and 9, 1977, by the State of Maryland Commission on Human Relations (the Commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">From the sparse record before us, we glean that on August 5, 1976, four (4) members of the Commission<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> executed near-duplicate complaints against Augusta and Vermont. In pertinent part, the complaints charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">\u201cThe ... [appellants are] subject to the jurisdiction of the Maryland Commission on Human Relations. Acting in accordance with Section 12 (b) of Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>49B of the Annotated Code of Maryland, the Commission finds there is evidence to support an allegation that the ... [appellants utilize] standards, terms, or conditions, with regard to hiring, recruitment; job assignment and promotional policies, which have a disparate effect on Blacks and women.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">The Commission, therefore, has reason to believe that the ... [appellants have] engaged in unlawful employment practices which have resulted in the exclusion of minority group persons because of their race and sex in violation of Article 49B of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The complaints, accompanied by letters dated October 1,1976, were received by the appellants \u201c[o]n or about October 6, 1976... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">As we have noted, the Commission served each of the appellants with a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>\u201c[i]n accordance with the authority contained in Article 49B, Section 14 (d) of the Annotated Code of Maryland,\u201d commanding the production of any and all records, documents, requisitions, memoranda and other writings pertaining to the employment practices of the appellants for the period of January 1,1976, to December 31, 1976. Augusta and Vermont refused to produce the subpoenaed materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The Commission, seemingly of the belief that \u201c[s]ince authority is the oldest means of persuasion known to man, it is also the most universally effective,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 14 (d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed in the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>petitions \u201cFor Order Directing Production of Documents\u201d against Augusta and Vermont. Separate hearings were held on each case on September 7, 1977. Two (2) days later, the court ordered Augusta and Vermont to \u201cproduce all documents and things specified in the\u201d subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>at the Commission\u2019s offices within fifteen (15) days of the court\u2019s order. Dissatisfied by Judge Sullivan\u2019s decision, Augusta and Vermont have brought their cause to this Court. They shall, however, fare no better than they did in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The appellants present four (4) questions which variously attack the statutory authority of the Commission to issue subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>on the basis of allegedly defective complaints and supposedly prior to the conducting of properly authorized preliminary investigations. Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 12 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">All the appellants\u2019 questions and supporting arguments were sunk on the shoals of <em>Banach v. State of Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, 271 </em>Md. 502, 512-13 (1976), where the Court, speaking through Judge Levine, held \u201cthat the Human Relations Commission possesses statutory authority to issue a subpoena duces tecum <em>in connection with a preliminary investigation </em>under Art. 49B, \u00a7 12 (b).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The same day that <em>Banach </em>was filed, the Court handed down its opinion in <em>Soley v. State of Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, 277 </em>Md. 521 (1976). In <em>Soley, </em>the Court reiterated \u201cthat the commission possesses statutory authority to issue a subpoena duces tecum <em>while conducting a preliminary investigation </em>under Art. 49B, \u00a7 12 (b).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>(Emphasis supplied.) 277 Md. at 524. Furthermore, the Court extended its <em>Banach </em>holding to encompass Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 13(a) by flatly declaring, \u201cWe hold . . . that the Human Relations Commission possesses statutory authority to issue a subpoena duces tecum during an investigation. . . .\u201d 277 Md. at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">It is patent from <em>Banach </em>and <em>Soley, </em>as well as the language of Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 12 (b), that the authorization by the Commission\u2019s chairman or vice-chairman of a preliminary investigation, not the subsequent filing of a Commission complaint, is the <em>sine qua non </em>for the issuance of a valid subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>Any alleged defects in the complaints in this case, which were filed after the initiation of the preliminary investigations, are irrelevant to the validity of the properly executed subpoenas <em>duces tecum. </em>The \u201ccontention that the subpoena power is limited to the post-complaint investigation and hearing stages finds no support in the language of\u201d Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 14 (d) which empowers the Commission to issue subpoenas. <em>Banach v. State of Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In addition to their assault upon the allegedly defective Commission complaints, Augusta and Vermont question whether the Commission may \u201cvalidly issue and compel compliance with a subpoena duces tecum prior to conducting a properly authorized preliminary investigation as required by \u00a7 12 (b) of Article 49B of the Annotated Code of Maryland?\u201d The appellants put the cart before the horse. It is apparent from <em>Banach </em>and <em>Soley </em>that the conduct or completion of the preliminary investigation is not a condition precedent for the issuance of Commission subpoenas. The preliminary investigation need only be authorized by the Coipmission chairman or vice-chairman under Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 12 (b) in order for valid subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>to issue. Although the Commission enjoys considerable discretion in authorizing the issuance of subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>pursuant to a properly authorized preliminary investigation, \u201c[t]hat the Legislature may validly confer upon administrative agencies such as the Human Relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Commission the power to compel production of information for purposes of preliminary investigation is well settled.\u201d <em>Banach r. State of Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Augusta and Vermont have failed to produce so much as a single gossamer of evidence that preliminary investigations were not authorized or conducted by the Commission. Indeed, the Commission\u2019s complaints and sworn petitions filed in the circuit court alleging the Commission\u2019s receipt of reliable information and the conduct of preliminary investigations of Augusta and Vermont evidences that preliminary investigations were approved and executed. Moreover, Judge Sullivan, in the Vermont hearing, found as a fact that a preliminary investigation had been conducted. We are unable to conclude from the record that Judge Sullivan\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">As to the Augusta hearing, the question of the authorization and conduct of a preliminary investigation was not plainly raised or decided in the hearing court. The matter is not properly preserved for our review. Md. Rule 1085. Even if the matter were considered to have been implicitly decided by the court, we would be unable to state, on the basis of the record before us, that the court was clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-12\">.
