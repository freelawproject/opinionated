This would hardly displease the parties whose concern must be more with our conclusions than with why we arrived at them; however, we also write in a shadow portending review. While our reasons may be of sparse educational benefit to bench or bar generally, the Court of Appeals quite properly is concerned not only with why we have reached the result, but how it is we were able to consider the State\u2019s appeal at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">The case concerns a wiretap authorization to intercept communications relating to drug and gambling transactions, signed by Judge William B. Bowie on October 27,1976, from which later flowed affidavits which, in turn, gave rise to search warrants issued on November 19, 1976. Based upon evidence thereby seized, indictments were returned against appellees by the Prince George\u2019s County Grand Jury on March 23, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">A proliferation of motions were filed by the appellees, including a motion to suppress the evidence, which was denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>by Judge Howard S. Chasanow on August 18,1977.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that hearing, appellant apparently raised an issue of the interpretive scope of Judge Bowie\u2019s wiretap authorization. Judge Chasanow declined at that juncture to rule on the issue,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but suggested that the State might consider a petition, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517 (5), (Md. Code, Cts. Art., \u00a7 10-407 (e)), for authorization to use those conversations \u201cif\u201d, as explained by the State, \u201cthey were not covered by the original order\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Generally, \u00a7 2517 (and Cts. Art., \u00a7 10-407) provides,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> among other things, when and how wire and oral communications interceptions may be authorized and, if properly intercepted, when, where and how the communications may be disclosed. <em>(Kg., </em>in any court or grand jury proceeding.) Subsection (5) of that section provides that when officers intercept communications relating to offenses <em>other </em>than those provided for in the authorization order, such <em>ultra vires </em>evidence so obtained may still be disclosed in a judicial proceeding, but only when approved on subsequent application to a court, which \u201capplication shall be made as soon as practicable\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Turning now to the facts of the instant case, we find the State\u2019s \u00a7 2517 (5) petition, heard before Judge Bowie, succinctly set forth the chronology of significant events.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">\u201c1. On October 27, 1976 the Honorable William Bowie signed an Order under Miscellaneous No. 745 which authorized the interception of telephonic communications over the telephone number 449-4447 relating to the crimes of illegal sports bookmaking and narcotics and conspiracy to commit same.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">2. That said Order was executed between October 28, 1976 and November 18, 1976 during which time conversations were intercepted relating to violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>of the controlled dangerous substances laws relating to Marihuana and Phencyclidine, violations of the gambling laws (Article 27, Sections 237-242) and conspiracy to commit said offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">3. That on August 16-18, 1977 before the Honorable Howard Chasanow, a motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of that wiretap was heard, and said Motion to Suppress was denied. During that hearing, however, Judge Chasanow indicated that the State should consider filing an application to the issuing judge to authorize the use at trial of .conversations relating to violation of the controlled dangerous substances laws other than just narcotics (to wit: Marihuana and Phencyclidine) and violations of the gambling laws other'than just illegal sports betting.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Before reaching the question whether the <em>post prolem suscitatam </em>application was timely sought, Judge Bowie recognized <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that he had to decide whether his original order to intercept was intended to comprehend conversations of <em>any </em>drug related offenses, including marijuana and phencyclidine, or whether the parenthetically descriptive term \u201cnarcotics\" which followed the generic description of \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances\" in his order (and the supporting affidavit) modified that which it described, <em>i.e., </em>in the nature of an <em>ejusdem generis </em>interpretation. The same problem of scope arose in regard to conversations of gambling violations since the order and affidavit permitted interceptions of conversations relating to \u201cillegal sport betting\u201d, whereas conversations of other gambling activities were received. <em>(E.g., </em>numbers.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>After analyzing his order, which he described as \u201cinartfully drawn\u201d, Judge Bowie declared that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">\"... our view is that the nub of the order is illegal sports bookmaking and narcotics laws and would not under its precise terms include non-narcotic controlled dangerous substances, such as marijuana and PCP.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">He then decided that the \u00a7 2517 (5) (Cts. Art., \u00a7 10-407 (e)) petition filed on August 29, 1977, for permission to disclose the <em>ultra vires </em>interceptions which had been taken between October 28,1976 and November 18,1976, did not comply with the statutory prerequisite that such application be made \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d. Not only had nine and one-half months elapsed before permission was sought, but the information had already been disclosed to the grand jury and indictments rendered thereon. The State did not appeal from that denial of its application for an order of approval pursuant to Cts. Art., \u00a7 10-408 (i) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Appellees immediately filed a \u201cMotion to Suppress Evidence and to Dismiss Indictment\u201d, reciting all that had transpired, culminating in Judge Bowie\u2019s denial of the State\u2019s petition. They argued that because all of the evidence (even that seized under search warrant) had been derived from interception of conversations now judicially declared to be related to offenses other than those authorized to be intercepted (which could not now be disclosed in any proceeding), <em>all </em>such evidence \u201cmust\u201d be suppressed as to any further proceeding, and, since it had already been disclosed to the grand jury in the obtention of the indictments, the indictments should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">At the hearing upon this dual motion heard by Judge Chasanow, the State conceded that the indictments in question were based (or might have been based) upon conversations relating to the marijuana and PCP \u201cother offenses\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Judge Chasanow held that he was \u201cbound\u201d by Judge Bowie\u2019s ruling</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>\u201cthat any conversations with regard to PCP, marijuana and nonsports bookmaking, gambling, were not properly utilizable by the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Judge Chasanow then held that since Judge Bowie had ruled that disclosure would be statutorily proscribed, the prior admitted disclosure to the grand jury had been in violation of \u00a7 2517 and \u00a7 2515 of Title III (and its subsequently adopted State counterparts, Cts. Art., \u00a7 10-407 and \u00a7 10-405).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Presumably in hopes of avoiding obstacles which it has no desire to encounter, the State asks us to <em>dos \u00e1 </em>dos<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> from Judge Chasanow\u2019s dismissal (from which it appealed) to Judge Bowie\u2019s disclosure denial (which it did not appeal), taking Judge Bowie\u2019s suppression reasoning, and returning it by imputation to Judge Chasanow in order to obtain a review of discretion. Without so much as a backward glance, while attacking Judge Bowie\u2019s reasoning through the pattern of adoption by Judge Chasanow, the State asks us not to consider that the dismissal followed in the wake of the course the State sought originally to pursue by its petition, because it now believes such petition was unnecessary in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">While discouraging us from dancing to the State\u2019s tune, appellees suggest a somewhat awkward two-step of their own. They contend that there was a right of appeal by the State from its denial because the ruling was a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in a \u201cnoncriminal case\u201d, citing as authority several civil cases in which the State\u2019s right (and collateral duty) to appeal was discussed. However, appellees\u2019 argument is founded entirely upon the presupposition that because the petition was clerically numbered as \u201cMisc. No. 745\u201d, it was a separate and different proceeding from the criminal case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>The \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d designation is first applied to the State\u2019s petition for authorization to wiretap, and, since the case is still in its investigatory stage, a more formal criminal case designation is neither available nor appropriate. For obvious reasons of preliminary confidentiality (see then applicable Cts. Art., \u00a7 10-405, repealed Ch. 692, Acts of 1977), the case is entitled \u201cMiscellaneous #_versus Petition in the Matter of the Application of [the State\u2019s Attorney]\u201d. The investigatory stage is usually still prevalent at the time of a subsequently sought disclosure under \u00a7 2517 (5) (Md. Code, Cts. Art., \u00a7 10-407 (a)). The \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d designation is nothing more than a clerical procedure for keeping track of a non-public, preliminary, court-authorized criminal investigatory procedure which may, or may not, culminate in a criminal case, but can hardly be called a \u201cnon-criminal case\u201d. Here, however, the delay in seeking \u00a7 2517 (5) disclosure is emphasized by the interim indictment of appellees before permission was obtained to disclose that upon which the indictment had been obtained; as a result, a case which would have been in the investigatory stage under ordinary circumstances (and thus appropriately designated \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d), had already ripened into a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">The underlying premise of appellees, that the State had a right to appeal, is correct, however. Maryland\u2019s new wiretap law provides in Cts. Art. \u00a7 10-408 (i) (3) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">\u201cIn addition to any other right to appeal, the State shall have the right to appeal from the denial of an application for an order of approval, if the prosecuting attorney shall certify to the judge or other official denying the application that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the date the order was entered and shall be diligently prosecuted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">The effective date of the Act encompassing that section was July 1, 1977. Although the original wiretap approval in this case was prior thereto, and the interception of communications of other offenses was made prior thereto, the application for approval of its use was not filed until August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>29,1977, and denied by Judge Bowie thereafter. The State did not appeal that ruling within 30 days as it was statutorily entitled to do and is consequently bound by it. We will not review Judge Bowie\u2019s reasons denying the State\u2019s application for approval in what all parties agreed at argument to be in effect a criminal evidentiary suppression proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Judge Chasanow was thus faced with appellees\u2019 \u201cMotion to Suppress Evidence and to Dismiss Indictment\u201d, predicated upon Judge Bowie\u2019s ruling on the State\u2019s disclosure petition. Without considering the merits of that ruling, as we have noted, Judge Chasanow stated that Judge Bowie\u2019s ruling (that wiretap evidence was obtained in violation of the authorization), was binding upon him. Md. Rule 736.12., by Order of the Court of Appeals, became effective on July 1, 1977 as to all cases arising thereafter, but the Order added that the rule was also to be effective as to those cases pending \u201cinsofar as practicable\u201d. It decidedly endorses the position taken by Judge Chasanow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\u201cIf the court grants a motion to suppress evidence, the evidence shall be excluded and shall not be offered by the State at trial, except that suppressed evidence may be used in accordance with law for impeachment purposes. If the court denies a motion to suppress evidence, the ruling is binding at the trial unless the court, in the exercise of its discretion, grants a hearing <em>de novo </em>on a renewal of the motion. A pretrial ruling denying the motion to suppress is reviewable on a motion for a new trial or on appeal of a conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Furthermore, the rule tacitly implies that when evidence is suppressed, the State, unlike the defendant, has no judicial discretion available for a <em>de novo </em>renewal hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is clear therefore that Judge Chasanow was correct in acting upon the premise that he was bound by Judge Bowie\u2019s ruling on the suppression question.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>This left Judge Chasanow with but two questions before him. The first related to how much, if any, derivative evidence had been obtained by virtue of the wiretap violations which was required to be suppressed in future trials (\u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d); the second question was what sanction he should impose for the use of the violative evidence which had already been used before the grand jury to obtain the indictments. Since dismissal of the indictments was the sanction applied for, he faced that question first, and correctly so, because if dismissal was the proper sanction, there would be no imminent trials to warrant a derivative evidence determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">\u2014 the sanction of dismissal \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Relying on <em>Everhart v. State, </em>274 Md. 459, the State argues that illegally obtained evidence may be considered by a grand jury (see <em>Bartram v. State, </em>280 Md. 616), and thus illegally obtained wiretap evidence should not be precluded from its consideration. The State adds further that \u201cno need, for prior judicial approval for Grand Jury use of wiretap evidence of unspecified offenses, is mandated by federal law.\u201d Therefore, dismissal of the indictment so obtained was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Perhaps the State reads 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> differently, but we consider that section as an absolute bar against the use of such evidence before a grand jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">\u201c <em>Whene ver any </em>wire or oral <em>communication has been intercepted, no part o\u00ed the contents o\u00ed such communication </em>and no evidence derived therefrom <em>maybe received in evidence in </em>any trial, hearing, or other <em>proceeding in or before any </em>court, <em>grand jury, </em>department, officer, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>thereof <em>if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">When the evidence of \u201coffenses other than those specified in the order of authorization\u201d was submitted to the grand jury without the prerequisite \u201csubsequent application\u201d required by \u00a7 2517 (5), it was done \u201cin violation of this chapter\u201d as proscribed by \u00a7 2515. That dismissal of the indictment obtained upon the disclosure to the grand jury of communications intercepted beyond authorized limits was the only reasonable sanction available is taught to us by example in <em>State v. Siegel, </em>266 Md. 256, as enforced by the federal authority relied on by Judge Chasanow, <em>United States v. Brodson, </em>528 P. 2d 214, and reinforced by <em>Gelbard v. United States, </em>408 U. S. 41. Notwithstanding such substantive and persuasive authority,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> common sense dictates that if we do not apply dismissal as a sanction here we will instruct the State sub silentio not to conform to Cts. Art., \u00a7 10-407 (or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517 (5)) for it if <em>does </em>apply for leave to disclose to the grand jury intercepted wiretap evidence of offenses other than those authorized, that permission might be denied them and, to proceed in the face of an express court order, would be audacious advocacy and judicially dangerous. On the other hand, if permission to disclose is <em>not </em>sought propitiously, as required, its use, while possibly improper, is not yet contemptuous, and an indictment obtained thereby would not be jeopardized since the only available sanction would be a judicial \u201ctsk-tsk\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">That the Court of Appeals in <em>Siegel </em>affirmed dismissal of an indictment as a sanction, while expressly indicating that it would not abide the slightest deviation from the prescribed path of electronic surveillance in pre-intercept and intercept conditions, <em>Poore v. State, </em>39 Md. App. 44 (1978), compels, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>rather than persuades, us that the sanction of dismissal chosen by Judge Chasanow was the proper route.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We find no reason to reverse Judge Chasanow\u2019s dismissal of the indictment which was predicated upon Judge Bowie\u2019s interpretation of his authorization for electronic surveillance. We decline appellees\u2019 invitation, however, to exercise our discretion under Rule 1085 and rule upon the derivative evidence question left undecided below.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Prince George\u2019s County.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">\n<em>APPENDIX</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A5J\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">\u201cWhenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part of the contents of such communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">18 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">\u201c\u00a7 2517.
