The parent-child relationship between the natural mother and the unknown father and the child was judicially terminated by decree of the Juvenile Court of Dallas County, Texas on February 6,1976. The petitioner, appellant here, is a 41-year old, divorced woman, the biological parent of one child, age 6, and adoptive parent of another child, age 5, both of whom are in her custody. The infant who is the subject of these proceedings has been in the custody of the petitioner since March 11,1976, when she was approximately six months old, pursuant to a \u201cPlacement Agreement\u201d with the Dallas County Child Welfare Unit of the State Department of Public Welfare and Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, Inc., a licensed child-placing agency in the District of Columbia, intervenors herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The fundamental issue in the case was succinctly phrased by the chancellor who stated in the course of a comprehensive written opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\u201cRespondent Dallas County Child Welfare Unit, pursuant to the Texas court decree of July 1976, has full parental rights and control over Deborah. The consent of that agency to the adoption is requisite and no adoption can be decreed without such consent unless the Court should find that the consent is being withheld contrary to the best interests of the child. (Article 16, Section 74, Annotated Code of Maryland, 1957 Ed., 1973 Repl. Vol.). As the record discloses, respondent Dallas County has declined to consent to this adoption. Based on all of the testimony and other evidence in this case, the Court finds that respondent Dallas County Child Welfare Unit\u2019s refusal to consent has been properly withheld and is not contrary to the best interests of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">It is appellant\u2019s position that the lower court was clearly erroneous in \u201ccertain factual findings,\u201d that it \u201ccommitted several errors as a matter of law,\u201d and that its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>\u201cshowed a clear abuse of discretion in several instances.\u201d We find these contentions without merit and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The \u201cDecree of Termination\u201d in proceedings relating to \u201cBaby Girl, born September 10, 1975,\u201d before the Juvenile Court of Dallas County, Texas, appointed the Director of the Dallas County Child Welfare Unit as \u201cmanaging conservator\u201d of the child, with the following \u201crights, privileges, duties and powers\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u201c(1) the right to have physical possession of the child and to establish its legal domicile;</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u201c(2) the duty of care, control, protection, moral and religious training, and reasonable discipline of the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\u201c(3) the duty to provide the child with clothing, food, shelter, and education;</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">\u201c(4) the power to consent to marriage, to enlistment in the armed forces of the United States, and to medical, psychiatric and surgical treatment; .</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">\u201c(5) the power to represent the child in legal action and to make other decisions of substantial legal significance concerning the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">\u201c(6) the power to receive and give receipt for periodic payments for the support of the child and to hold or disburse these funds for the benefit of the child; and</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">\u201c(7) <em>the power to consent to the adoption of the child and to make any other decision concerning the child that a parent could make\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">Appellant, Barbara Adams Bernhardt, and her then husband, Norman Bernhardt, had made application in January 1973 with Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area for the placement of a child for adoption. They had been married in Belgrade, Yugoslavia on July 17, 1971 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>and had one child, David, born on January 15, 1972. As a result of the 1973 application, they received from Lutheran Social Services a black child, Daniel, who was born on May 23, 1973, and whom they adopted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Mr. and Mrs. Bernhardt again made application to Lutheran Social Services on May 28,1974. The infant, \u201cBaby Girl,\u201d then six months old, was placed with them on March 11, 1976, and named Deborah Annette by them. The Placement Agreement was executed by Barbara and Norman Bernhardt,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and extended not only to Lutheran Social Services as placement agent, but also to Dallas County Child Welfare as conservator. Under the Agreement, the Bernhardts assumed \u201ccomplete financial responsibility for the child\u2019s care with the intention of adoption.\u201d They also agreed not to \u201cbegin court proceedings for the adoption without the approval of Dallas County Child Welfare and Lutheran Social Services.\u201d It was expressly stipulated that such approval would not be forthcoming sooner than six months after placement and that \u201cthe agency has the right to remove the child at any time prior to adoption should the agency consider it to be in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">A social worker at Lutheran Social Services (and an appellee herein), Anita Greenberg, made a visit to the Bernhardt home in Takoma Park on May 11,1976 and found conditions satisfactory and the custodial care of Deborah proper. A month and one-half later, however, Miss Greenberg learned, in an interview with Norman Bernhardt, arranged at his request, that the couple had been having marital difficulties for a significant period of time and had, in fact, been separated for a number of months. His visit to Miss Greenberg had been recommended by Monica Friedman, a marriage counselor in the TESS Neighborhood Service Center in Silver Spring, whom the Bernhardts had consulted. Subsequently, on July 9,1976, Miss Greenberg called in Mrs. Bernhardt for an interview and thereafter reopened her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>investigation of the background of the Bernhardts and their suitability as adopting parents for Deborah. The Dallas County Child Welfare Unit was informed of her action.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">In late October 1976, Miss Greenberg sent a second report to Dallas, with the recommendation that Deborah be removed from the Bernhardt home. On November 21, 1976, the Program Director of the Dallas County Child Welfare Unit executed, under oath, a formal designation of Lutheran Social Services as agent to act \u201cIn the Interest of Deborah Annette Bernhardt, A Child.\u201d In it, the \u201cimmediate removal\u201d of the child from the Bernhardt home was requested \u201cin the best interest of the child and for the welfare of the child.\u201d It was also stated: \u201cThe Dallas County Child Welfare Unit has no intentions whatsoever to consent to the Adoption of this child by the Bernhardt family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">On December 2, 1976, the Bernhardts were summoned to Lutheran\u2019s office in Washington and informed of the decision to remove Deborah from them. When the child was not returned in the time specified, the Dallas County Child Welfare Unit and Lutheran Social Services filed, on December 6, 1976, a petition against Barbara and Norman Bernhardt, seeking custody of Deborah and other relief. On the same day, Barbara Bernhardt alone <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> retaliated by filing a petition against the Dallas County unit and Lutheran Social Services, seeking custody of Deborah and a separate petition for the adoption of Deborah. An <em>ex parte </em>order was then issued, enjoining the agencies from removing the child from the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The two custody actions were consolidated but hearings thereon were postponed pending the outcome of Mrs. Bernhardt\u2019s petition for adoption. At two days of hearings in the adoption case, appellant presented nine lay witnesses and four expert witnesses, all of whom testified that Deborah\u2019s best interests would be served by the adoption. The respondents offered the testimony of the social worker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>employed by Dallas County Child Welfare who had arranged the placement and had transported the infant from Texas, as well as that of the marriage counselor, Monica Friedman, and Miss Greenberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">As previously stated, Judge Fairbanks denied the petition but, upon motion for stay of execution, he ordered that Deborah be permitted to remain in Mrs. Bernhardt\u2019s custody pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">It is essential that this case be kept in true perspective, and that careful attention be directed to the precise issue before the chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">This is not simply a custody suit nor is it a contested adoption proceeding between adoptive and natural parents. Rather, it is a contested petition for adoption by an unmarried individual with whom a contractual placement has been made, and the respondents (opponents) include the \u201cmanaging conservator\u201d with the power, legislatively mandated and judicially decreed, to consent to the adoption of the child, and the social service agency charged with local supervision of the placement. Furthermore, this case must be viewed against the backdrop of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, Md. Ann. Code, Art. 16 \u00a7 208 <em>et seq. </em>(1957, 1973 Repl. Vol., 1977 Cum. Supp.),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the purpose and policy of which are specifically declared in these words in \u00a7 209:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\u201cIt is the purpose and policy of the party states to cooperate with each other in the interstate placement of children to the end that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>(a) Each child requiring placement shall receive the maximum opportunity to be placed in a suitable environment and with persons or institutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">(b) The appropriate authorities\u00bb! a state where a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with applicable requirements for the protection of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">(c) The proper authorities of the state from which the placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis of which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">(d) Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of children will be promoted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">It must also be recognized that the issue presented is not whether Mrs. Bernhardt is a fit and proper custodian of Deborah. More precisely, it is whether, in light of the requirements of Md. Ann. Code, Art. 16 \u00a7 74 (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) and Md. Rule D73, the required consent to the adoption by the Dallas County Child Welfare Unit was \u201cwithheld contrary to the best interests of the child.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Brendoff v. Titus, </em>22 Md. App. 412, 323 A. 2d 612 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Finally, it must be noted that the scope of our review of the trial court\u2019s determination of this central question is limited to whether the trial judge abused his discretion or whether his findings of fact were clearly erroneous. <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 372 A. 2d 231 (1977); <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 372 A. 2d 582 (1977); <em>Montgomery County Department of Social Services v. Sanders, </em>38 Md. App. 406, 418, 381 A. 2d 1154, 1162 (1978). The rule of the cited cases, applied therein to custody proceedings, is equally applicable to adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>cases. <em>See, e.g., Nutwell v. Prince George's County Department of Social Services, </em>21 Md. App. 100, 107, 318 A. 2d 563, 567 (1974). The observations in <em>Sanders </em>are also apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\">\u201cThe chancellor\u2019s findings of fact are to be given great weight since he has the parties before him and has \u2018the best opportunity to observe their temper, temperament and demeanor, and so decide what would be for the child\u2019s best interest....\u2019 There can be very little constructive or useful precedent on the subject of custody determinations, because each case must depend upon its unique fact pattern---This Court may not set aside the factual findings of the chancellor unless they are clearly erroneous,... and absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion, the decision of the trial judge in a custody case will not be reversed.\u201d 38 Md. App. at 418-19, 381 A. 2d at 1162. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">These guiding principles are to be applied to the instant case in the context of a record of documentary and testimonial evidence which reveals, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">1) Although the appellant and her husband had jointly applied for placement, they had been separated for at least five months when the placement was actually made.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">2) Neither the out-of-state nor the local agency was apprised of the marital difficulties between the Bernhardts by the appellant. On the contrary, there is evidence that she suppressed this information. Although the parties were separated at the time of a home visit following the placement, appellant told the social worker that Mr. Bernhardt was absent from the home because of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">3) In the 1973 and 1974 applications for child placement to Lutheran Social Services, appellant represented that she had not been previously married. In fact, she had been twice married (for 1 year and 6 years, respectively) and twice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>divorced. In each instance, the divorce had been granted to her then spouse on grounds of appellant\u2019s desertion. Under questioning by the court, appellant affirmed that the application form required disclosure of prior marriages and testified: \u201cI answered it falsely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">4) Sharp discrepancies existed in the records and testimony with respect to appellant\u2019s financial circumstances. Her applications to the agency in Washington represented that her husband\u2019s income was $8,000 per year. Tax returns for 1973 and 1974, however, disclosed taxable income of $3,255.92 and $1,994.15, respectively. Appellant\u2019s financial statement in her divorce action against Mr. Bernhardt showed a total net income of $18 per month but, in the proceedings below, appellant testified to income in excess of $1200, including compensation for babysitting in the sum of $420 per month, and ultimately stated that her income and that of her husband \u201cha[d] always been a big confused mess.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7Y\">Relevant evidence was also produced below in the form of recommendations from the Dallas County Child Welfare Unit and the Lutheran Social Services organization that the child not remain in Mrs. Bernhardt\u2019s custody. The representative of the Texas agency in his testimony below stated that he was the social worker who was in consultation with the child\u2019s biological mother, and that she desired the child to have a home with both a mother and a father; and that with regard to this child, he would not approve a single parent placement. The \u201cwithholding and calculated falsifying\u201d of information was also a primary concern ,of Dallas County. The agency perceived in appellant\u2019s conduct a disposition to use \u201cdeceptive methods to gain whatever goals there may be,\u201d and concluded that \u201cto bring a child into a family that is dissolving... and put further stress on that family and stress on the child\u201d would be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The recommendation to the Texas agency by Lutheran Social Services that the child be withdrawn was based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u201crepeated instances of deceit in contacts between the Bernhardts and the agency----\u201d It was felt that such behavior \u201cimplied unconcern for the children in the agency care and therefore for this child ... [whom] they had taken into their home for the purpose of adoption.\u201d The witness, Miss Greenberg, told the chancellor that this attitude indicated \u201ca level of morality not conducive to responsible parenting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The marriage consultant seen by appellant and her husband further disclosed that there had been both \u201cresentment and hostility\u201d in the marriage of the Bernhardts for a long period of time and, as stated in a report to the court below from Lutheran Social Services, \u201c[s]he described Mrs. Bernhardt as being extraordinarily manipulative and amoral----\u201d The marriage counselor cautioned the placement agency not to believe what Mrs. Bernhardt would relate about the family situation because she felt appellant \u201cwould do whatever she could to keep the child, Deborah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">In the chancellor's careful analysis of the evidence he concluded that the best interests of the child would be served by \u201cdenial of the adoption petition and the removal of the child from the home for placement in a better and healthier environment.\u201d On the basis of our review of the record, we cannot conclude that the chancellor\u2019s findings of fact were \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d or, indeed, that they were erroneous at all. Furthermore, we find no basis for appellant\u2019s contention that the chancellor committed any abuse of discretion in his resolution of the ultimate question, namely, whether the agency\u2019s consent was withheld contrary to the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Additional support for the chancellor\u2019s conclusion may be found in appellant\u2019s dishonoring the placement agreement, which she and her husband executed at the time the child, Deborah, was delivered to them. She expressly covenanted therein not to begin court proceedings for the adoption of the child without the prior approval of both agencies and affirmed her understanding that the agencies had the right to remove the child at any time prior to adoption should that be considered in the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The chancellor\u2019s conclusion is also buttressed by the fact that the placement of Deborah was made pursuant to the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, legislatively enacted by both Texas and Maryland. <em>See </em>Md. Ann. Code, Art. 16 \u00a7 208 <em>et seq. </em>(1957, 1973 Repl. Vol., 1977 Cum. Supp.) and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 695a-2 (Vernon, 1978 Supp.). Citizens of Maryland are, in our judgment, bound by the declared policy of the Compact and its provisions. No less is it an obligation of the courts of this jurisdiction to require that the provisions of the Compact be enforced and that the continuing jurisdiction of the \u201csending agency\u201d be recognized, Md. Ann. Code, Art. 16 \u00a7 212A (a), <em>supra, </em>to the end that cooperation in the interstate placement of children may be achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">We are aware, as was the chancellor, of the \u201cdistress\u201d to appellant and her young sons that may result from the court\u2019s action. Appellant is not, however, without fault, and although she may now, in the light of elapsed time and her care of Deborah, be the child\u2019s \u201cpsychological parent,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as the chancellor also recognized, we held subsequent to the proceedings below that this factor is not determinative. <em>Montgomery County Department of Social Services v. Sanders, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The finding of the lower court that the consent of the Dallas County Child Welfare Unit to Deborah\u2019s adoption by appellant was properly withheld is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed; appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-6\">. The Bernhardts and their natural child are Caucasian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\">. As indicated <em>infra, </em>the Bernhardts had been experiencing marital difficulties and, at the time of placement, were separated. They have since been divorced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">. The Bernhardts were then in matrimonial litigation, Barbara having filed suit for a divorce <em>a mensa </em>on July 23, 1976 on grounds of desertion. This was the subject of a supplemental bill for <em>a vinculo </em>relief, filed on December 30, 1976.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\">. This Compact is entered into by Maryland with all States legally joining in the Compact substantially in the form outlined in \u00a7 208. It applies between Texas and Maryland. <em>See </em>Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 695a-2 (Vernon, 1978 Supp.).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">It is to be noted that \u00a7 212A of the Compact provides that the \u201csending agency\u201d (here, the Dallas County Child Welfare Unit) shall \u201cretain jurisdiction over the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody, supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child which it would have had if the child had remained in tne sending agency\u2019s state, until the child is adopted____Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\">. Under Art. 16 \u00a7 74 (g) and Md. Rule D73, a written statement of consent by the Dallas County Child Welfare Unit was required; this was not submitted. Under the prefatory language of \u00a7 74 and the Rule, however, the court had authority to grant the petition if, after a hearing, it found such consent was withheld contrary to the best interests of the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b365-11\">. At the time of oral argument on this appeal, Mrs. Bernhardt had obtained a final decree of divorce <em>a vinculo. </em>Her former husband did not testify in the proceedings below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\">. To this statement, the court responded: \u201cThat does not give me a whole lot of confidence in how you are going to conduct your affairs in the future.\u201d In the chancellor\u2019s written opinion, ne concluded: \u201cEither the Bernhardts have been less than candid in disclosing their true financial picture or they 'are badly overextended.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">.
