J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A99\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The Constitution of the United States is not an antiquated historical document, something that pertained to our forefathers but of little or no current significance. It is the viable foundation upon which our country was built and still lives. Aside from its being the cornerstone of the nation, perhaps its greatest virtue is its malleability, the ingredient which permits the Constitution to be molded to conform to contemporary standards, rather than being a rigid ancient mandate out of step with the times. The then Governor of New York, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in a radio address on March 2,1930, observed that the \u201cConstitution has proved itself the most marvellously elastic compilation of rules of government ever written.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">In the instant case, we are asked by the appellant, James Chester Phipps, to declare that in the light of present societal standards the sentence of life imprisonment for the crime of rape in the first degree is a \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d debarred by the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">Disclaiming knowledge of violating Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 462 (first degree rape), 463 (second degree rape), 464 (first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>degree sexual offense), 464A (second degree sexual offense), 464B (third degree sexual offense), 464C (fourth degree sexual offense), 553 (sodomy), 337 (kidnapping), 486 (robbery), 341 (larceny of goods of the value of less than $100.00), and 467 (receiving stolen goods of the value of less than $100.00), and common law assault and battery, because of his alleged intoxication, the appellant entered an Alford<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plea in the Circuit Court for Harford County of guilty to the charge of first degree rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Judge Albert Close explained to Phipps, in almost laborious detail, the rights that are waived by such a plea, as well as the fact that the penalty that could be imposed for the crime was life imprisonment. After satisfying himself that there was a factual basis for the plea, Judge Close accepted it. The State then, as it had agreed to do in a plea bargain, <em>nolle prossed the </em>remaining ten (10) counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">After obtaining a pre-sentence investigation, the court, on March 18,1977, imposed a sentence of life imprisonment upon Phipps. The judge recommended that therapy for Phipps be provided by the Division of Correction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Within a week, Phipps wrote a letter to the trial judge in which he said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">\u201cPlease be informed of my right to recant my plea of Guilty to the charge of Rape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">My right\u2019s were infringed upon from the day of my arrest wich i can prove.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Judge Close treated the letter as a petition for post conviction review.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">A hearing on the matter was held before Judge Brodnax Cameron, Jr. Phipps set out thirteen (13) supposed errors, none of which had any substance, and his assigned counsel raised the additional issue of the constitutionality <em>vel non </em>of the imposition of a life sentence for the offense of first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>rape. Judge Cameron held that the punishment of life imprisonment for the crime of first degree rape is not unconstitutional, and he denied post conviction relief. We granted leave to appeal and transferred the case to the regular docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In this Court, Phipps reiterated his attack on the constitutionality of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 462 (b) as applied to himself. He wove into his argument a \u201cbut for\u201d contention which points out that absent certain highly relevant testimony the offense would have been that of second degree rape punishable by a maximum term of twenty (20) years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We shall deal first with the interlarded \u201cbut for.\u201d The record reveals that the victim said that Phipps demanded that she yield to his sexual advances, posed to her in rather explicit, earthy language. When she declined, he exclaimed, \u201cDon\u2019t make me hurt the baby \u2014 don\u2019t make me have to hurt the baby.\u201d His reference was to the three (3) year old daughter of the prosecutrix who clung to her breast while the prosecutrix was ravished by Phipps.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Section 462, concerned with first degree rape, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\u201c(a) <em>What constitutes. </em>\u2014 A person is guilty of rape in the first degree if the person engages in vaginal intercourse with another person by force against the will and without the consent of the other person and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">(1) With another person by force or threat of force against the will and without the consent of the other person and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">(iii) Threatens or places the victim in fear that the victim <em>or any person known to the victim </em>will be imminently subjected to death, suffocation, strangulation, disfigurement, <em>serious physical injury </em>____\u201d t<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>l (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The gravamen of the offense in the instant case is the very threat that Phipps would like to read out of the record so as to reduce the charge to second degree rape. The implied threat of Phipps to harm his victim\u2019s infant child is what caused her to submit to him and is the very element which placed the sexual attack within the ambit of Section 462 (a) (1) (iii). Moreover, the victim testified that to her the threat meant that Phipps was going to \u201cBeat us. Kill us. I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In <em>Crenshaw v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 361, 373, 283 A. 2d 423, 430 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>264 Md. 746 (1972), we held that a mother\u2019s instinct for the safety of her child together with her rapist\u2019s threats to harm the child if the victim did not surrender to his illicit sexual advances constituted force and coercion. <em>Crenshaw was, </em>decided under a prior statute relative to rape. What we said in <em>Crenshaw, </em>however, applies to the later Article 27, \u00a7 462 (a) (1) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The appellant\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d contention is the same as arguing that \u201cbut for\u201d the negative tone of the Ten Commandments all the acts therein condemned would be permissible. The fact remains that the acts forbidden by the Ten Commandments are not sanctioned. No amount of \u201csupposing\u201d or analyzing of hypothetical evidence will eradicate the positive testimony of the victim and reduce the offense to anything other than that to which the appellant pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Phipps\u2019s constitutional assault on the Maryland statute commences with the Eighth Amendment which proscribes \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d That prohibition is, of course, applicable to the States as well as to the federal government. <em>Coker v. Georgia, </em>433 U. S. 584, 97 S. Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977); <em>Robinson v. California, </em>370 U. S. 660, 82 S. Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962); <em>Bigley v. Warden, </em>16 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>App. 1, 294 A. 2d 141 (1972). A similar proscription is included in the Maryland Declaration of Rights, Articles 16 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 25.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The historical background of the phrase \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d was discussed by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U. S. 153, 169-71, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 2923-24, 49 L.Ed.2d 859, 872-73 (1976). The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\u201cThe phrase first appeared in the English Bill of Rights of 1689, which was drafted by Parliament at the accession of William and Mary. See Granucci, \u2018Nor Cruel and Unusual Punishments Inflicted: \u2019 The Original Meaning, 57 Calif. L. Rev. 839, 852-853 (1969). The English version appears to have been directed against punishments unauthorized by statute and beyond the jurisdiction of the sentencing court, as well as those disproportionate to the offense involved. <em>Id., </em>at 860. The American draftsmen, I<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>1 who adopted the English phrasing in drafting the Eighth Amendment, were primarily concerned, however, with proscribing \u2018tortures\u2019 and other \u2018barbarous\u2019 methods of punishment.\u2019 [s/c] <em>Id., </em>at 842. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">But the Court has not confined the prohibition embodied in the Eighth Amendment to \u2018barbarous\u2019 methods that were generally outlawed in the 18th century. Instead, the Amendment has been interpreted in a flexible and dynamic manner. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Court early recognized that \u2018a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth.\u2019 <em>Weems v. United States, </em>217 U. S. 349, 373 [30 S. Ct. 544, 551, 54 L. Ed. 793, 801] (1910). Thus the Clause forbidding \u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 punishments \u2018is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 378 [30 S. Ct. at 553, 54 L. Ed. at 803]. See also <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U. S., at 429-430 [92 S. Ct. at 2823-24, 33 L.Ed.2d at 459-60] (Powell, J., dissenting); <em>Trop v. Dulles, </em>356 U. S. 86, 100-101 [78 S. Ct. 590, 597-98, 2 L.Ed.2d 630, 642-43] (1958) (plurality opinion).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Subsequently, the Court, in <em>Coker v. Georgia, </em>433 U. S. at 592, 97 S. Ct. at 2865, 53 L.Ed.2d at 989, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">\u201c[T]he Eighth Amendment bars not only those punishments that are \u2018barbaric\u2019 but also those that are \u2018excessive\u2019 in relation to the crime committed. Under Gregg, a punishment is \u2018excessive\u2019 and unconstitutional if it (1) makes no measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment and hence is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering; or (2) is grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime. A punishment might fail the test on either ground.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">The Court, speaking through Mr. Justice White, went on to say that the evaluation of a sentence must be based on objective factors, rather than the subjective views of individual judges. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">Public attitudes, reflected by the legislative determination of punishment of a particular criminal offense, are also a material consideration in the court\u2019s function of ascertaining whether a punishment is condemned to crossing the River Styx into constitutionally mandated oblivion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-13\">\u201cTo this end, attention must be given to the public attitudes concerning a particular sentence \u2014 history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>and precedent, legislative attitudes, and the response of juries reflected in their sentencing decisions are to be consulted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 97 S. Ct. at 2866, 53 L.Ed.2d at 989.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The statute under attack in the case <em>sub judice </em>is but one part of the General Assembly\u2019s recognition of the existence of different degrees of rape with prescribed corresponding punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The validity of legislatively determined punishment is presumed, <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U. S. at 175, 96 S. Ct. at 2926, 49 L.Ed.2d at 876, and courts \u201cmay not require\u201d that \u201ca democratically elected legislature\u201d enact the least severe possible penalty as the sanction for a crime. As long as the punishment that is decreed conforms \u201cwith the basic concept of human dignity,\u201d 428 U. S. at 182, 96 S. Ct. at 2929, 49 L.Ed.2d at 880, and is neither \u201ccruelly inhumane [n]or disproportionate,\u201d 428 U. S. at 175, 96 S. Ct. at 2926, 49 L.Ed.2d at 876, to the offense, there is no violation of the Eighth Amendment, <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra, </em>nor of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, Articles 16 and 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">When the judgment of the people, handed down through their duly elected State Senators and Delegates in the form of a statute, is subjected to assault, a \u201cheavy burden\u201d is borne by the attacker. <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U. S. at 175, 96 S. Ct. at 2926, 49 L.Ed.2d at 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Mr. Justice Stewart penned in <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U. S. at 175-76, 96 S. Ct. at 2926, 49 L.Ed.2d at 876:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">\u201cThis is true in part because the constitutional test is intertwined with an assessment of contemporary standards and the legislative judgment weighs heavily in ascertaining such standards: \u2018[I]n a democratic society legislatures, not courts, are constituted to respond to the will and consequently the moral values of the people.\u2019 <em>Furman v. Georgia ... </em>[408 U. S. at 383, 92 S. Ct. at 2800-01, 33 L.Ed.2d at 432 (1972)] (Burger, C. J., dissenting). The deference we owe to the decisions of the state legislatures under our federal system, <em>id., </em>at 465-470 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>[92 S. Ct. at 2841-44, 33 L.Ed.2d at 480-83] (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), is enhanced where the specification of punishments is concerned, for \u2018these are peculiarly questions of legislative policy.\u2019 <em>Gore v. United States, </em>357 U. S. 386, 393 [78 S. Ct. 1280, 1284-85, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405, 1410] (1958). <em>Cf. Robinson v. California, </em>370 U. S., at 664-665 [82 S. Ct. at 1419-20, 8 L.Ed.2d at 758 (1962)]; <em>Trop v. Dulles, </em>356 U. S., at 103 [78 S. Ct. at 599, 2 L.Ed.2d at 643-44 (1958)] (plurality opinion); <em>In re Kemmler, </em>136 U. S., at 447 [10 S. Ct. at 938, 34 L. Ed. at 524 (1880)]. Caution is necessary lest this Court become, \u2018under the aegis of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, the ultimate arbiter of the standards of criminal responsibility ... throughout the country.\u2019 <em>Powell v. Texas, </em>392 U. S. 514, 533 [88 S. Ct. 2145, 2154-55, 20 L.Ed.2d 1245, 1267-68] (1968). A decision that a given punishment is impermissible under the Eighth Amendment cannot be reversed short of a constitutional amendment. The ability of the people to express their preference through the normal democratic processes, as well as through ballot referenda, is shut off. Revisions cannot be made in the light of further experience. See <em>Furman v. Georgia, supra, </em>at 461-462 [92 S. Ct. at 2839-40, 33 L.Ed.2d at 477-78] (Powell, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Phipps avers that he \u201cis serving an unconstitutional and excessive sentence based on the two-pronged test applied in <em>Coker \\v. Georgia, supra\\.\u201d </em>We have an entirely different view.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">We think that a sentence of life imprisonment for the crime, of first degree rape is a \u201creasonable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The life sentence may only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>be imposed when an accused has been found guilty of employing the most reprehensible of methods in carrying out the heinous offense of vaginal intercourse against his victim\u2019s will. Those most reprehensible methods include 1) the use of a dangerous or deadly weapon, or an article believed by the victim to be such a weapon; 2) serious physical injury which could result in the death of the victim; 3) threats of imminent injury to the victim or persons known (and obviously connected by a bond of affection) to the victim; and 4) when the accused is aided by another person in the rape of the victim. Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">When the basic elements of imminent peril to the life of the victim or her loved ones is removed or there is no third-person aider or abetter in the crime, it is reduced in seriousness and in punishment to a maximum of twenty (20) years imprisonment. Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The legislatively mandated penalty of confinement \u201cfor not more than the period of his natural life\u201d represents the will of the people of Maryland that its female citizens be protected in their persons from violation. Recognizing that mere words, printed in a Code of Criminal Laws, will not, in and of themselves, cause a cessation of rape any more than the Ten Commandments have halted sin, the General Assembly has determined that those who so violate the victim, also violate \u00a7 462. While \u201c \u2018[r]etribution is no longer the dominant objective of the criminal law,\u2019 <em>Williams v. New </em>York, 337 U.S. 241, 248 [69 S. Ct. 1079, 1084, 93 L. Ed. 1337, 1343] (1949),\u201d it is neither \u201ca forbidden objective nor one inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>our respect for the dignity of men.\u201d <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U. S. at 183, 96 S. Ct. at 2930, 49 L.Ed.2d at 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Paraphrasing Mr. Justice Stewart in <em>Gregg, </em>the General Assembly articulated the will of the people of Maryland that life imprisonment is the appropriate <em>peine forte et dure </em><footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for the grievous affront to its feminine populace.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">We hold that the imposition of a life sentence for a violation of Md.
