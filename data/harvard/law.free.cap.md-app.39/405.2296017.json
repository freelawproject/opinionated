Ed. 666 (1871), addressed to the courts, is that thou shalt not delve deeply into jurisdictional disputes among churches.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That precept is a direct outgrowth of the First Amendment\u2019s fiat that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof----\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S. Const, amend I. That language, as Thomas Jefferson viewed it, built \u201ca wall of separation between church and State.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201cwall of separation\u201d does not mean that courts hav\u00e9 been stripped of all power to inquire into disputes arising among church members. Indeed, \u201c[t]he state has a legitimate interest in keeping title and ownership in land settled and secure.\u201d Note, <em>Judicial Intervention in Church Property Disputes </em>\u2014 <em>Some Constitutional Considerations, </em>74 Yale L.J. 1113, 1130 (1965). The State\u2019s interest in the protection of its citizenry necessitates that it know \u201cat all times the owners of property within its borders,\u201d <em>Id., </em>so that in the event one is injured on that property, the owner may be readily located. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the State is cognizant of the words of Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639) that \u201c[t]he itch of disputing will prove the scab of churches,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and it affords the disputants a forum for \u201csome recourse other than the sword for settling their disputes.,..\u201d <em>Id.

The late Judge Robert L.

Where there was no provision in its corporate charter, deeds or religious constitution, if THE CALVARY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF BALTIMORE CITY voted to withdraw from THE PRESBYTARY OF BALTIMORE OF THE UNITED PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA to affiliate itself with another branch of the Presbyterian Church, The Presbyterian Church in America, did the right of possession and control of the local church property remain in CALVARY or could UNITED thereafter determine to dissolve CALVARY and seize CALVARY\u2019S property even though CALVARY remained Presbyterian in doctrine and affiliation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">2. Where the Appellant Church was incorporated in the year 1911, and thereafter acquired property in its name, under United States and Maryland Constitutions and stated circumstances, what was the legal effect of a subsequent legislative enactment calling for amendment of Appellants [s/c] Church\u2019s Charter without CALVARY\u2019S consent or notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>More ingeniously, the question before us is who owns the church property, Calvary or United?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\n<em>THE FACTS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">From the \u201cAgreed Statement of Facts,\u201d we learn that United is organized and functions pursuant to a constitution which consists of two (2) parts: <em>The Book of Confession </em>and. <em>The Book of Order. </em>It is the latter with which we are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The <em>Book of </em>Order<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is divided into three (3) main subdivisions: 1) \u201cThe Directory for the Worship of God\u201d; 2) \u201cThe Form of Government\u201d; and 3) \u201cThe Book of Church Discipline.\u201d The first and third subdivisions deal with \u201cquestions of discipline, or of faith, or ecclesiastical rule, custom or law.\u201d <em>Watson v. Jones, </em>80 U. S. at 727, 20 L. Ed. at 676. As such, we are precluded from inquiring into them by the constitutional barrier, erected by the First Amendment, between the church and the State.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We, therefore, turn our attention to <em>The Book of Order </em>subdivision entitled, \u201cThe Form of Government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">It is necessary to know that Calvary is one of the seventy-nine (79) United Presbyterian Churches located in Baltimore City and the counties of Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Frederick, Harford, Howard, and Washington. United is an association of Presbyterian churches governed by four (4) bodies styled as \u201cjudicatories.\u201d In ascending ord\u00e9r of authority, the four (4) are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">1) the <em>session </em>which is \u201ccharged with maintaining the spiritual government of the congregation,\u201d <em>The Book of Order, </em>\u201cThe Form of Government,\u201d Ch. XI \u00a7 41.06 (1967), and those matters appertaining thereto. The session has \u201cexclusive authority over the uses to which the church <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>buildings and properties may be put...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 41.07;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-4\">2) the <em>presbytery </em>\u201cconsists of all the ministers ... and at least one ruling elder commissioner from each church, within a certain district ... [composed of not less than] twelve churches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Ch. XII \u00a7 42.01. It \u201chas power to ... decide [all] appeals, complaints, and references,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 42.08, properly brought, \u201cand in cases in which the session cannot exercise its authority,\u201d <em>Id., </em>the presbytery may assume original jurisdiction. Of more direct importance to the instant case is the fact that the presbytery possesses the power \u201cto review and approve the records of church sessions, and to require their correction; to redress whatever they may have done contrary to order, and to take effectual care that they observe the Constitution of the Church ...\u201d <em>Id.;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">3) the <em>synod </em>is comprised \u201cof the ministers and ruling elders of not fewer than three presbyteries within a specific geographic region.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Ch.

It ... bear[s] the title of The General Assembly of the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Ch. XIV \u00a7 44.01. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The \u201cAgreed Statement of Facts\u201d contains the following background eventually leading to the matter\u2019s being before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">\u201cA particular church can be organized only by the authority of the presbytery. The organization of the CALVARY congregation was approved by the Presbytery on October 4,1910, and a corporation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>hold title to property for the congregation was formed on February 3,1911. Article VI of its charter provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">\u2018ARTICLE VI. The \u201cCalvary Presbyterian Church of Baltimore City\u201d shall forever remain a Presbyterian Church in doctrine, government, and worship in accordance with the standards of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of American (sic), that is to say, the Confession of Faith, and the Larger and Shorter Cathechisms <em>(sic), </em>and in ecclesiastical connection with the \u201cPresbytery of Baltimore,\u201d in accordance with its organization by said Presbytery, on the 4th day of October, in the year one thousand nine hundred and ten____\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">At the time CALVARY was incorporated, the Presbytery of Baltimore was part of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. At the 505th stated meeting of the Presbytery held on April 22 and 23, 1957, at which CALVARY\u2019S minister and one of its elders were present and voting, the Presbytery voted for the proposed plan of union with The United Presbyterian Church of North America. On May 28, 1958, The Presbyterian Church in the United States of America and The United Presbyterian Church of North America united to form the Church now known as THE UNITED PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (UNITED). At the Presbytery\u2019s 511th stated meeting held on June 10, 1958, at which representatives of CALVARY were present and voting, the Presbytery took official notice of the union and the Church\u2019s new name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">In 1913, the Presbyterian Association, an arm of the Presbytery, acquired title to unimproved land on the west side of Patuxent Street, now Linwood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Avenue, and bounded on the south by McElderry Street and to the north by the center of Logan Street, and sold and conveyed a portion to CALVARY in 1914. CALVARY borrowed Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000.00) from the Church Erection Fund of the General Assembly of The Presbyterian Church in the United States of America secured by a mortgage on the property. In 1930, The Presbyterian Association sold and conveyed the remainder of the land to CALVARY. CALVARY Church borrowed Four Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($4,500.00) from the Board of National Missions of The Presbyterian Church in the United States of America secured by a mortgage on the property. All loans and mortgages have been paid, and title to the real property remains in the name of CALVARY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">CALVARY has been a member of and subject to the jurisdiction of the Presbytery of Baltimore since its founding in 1911 and has, until the latter part of 1975 or early part of 1976, been a full voting participant in the affairs of the Presbytery. For the past 64 years, from 1911 through 1975, the CALVARY session regularly submitted its records to the Presbytery for review and approval in accordance with the <em>Form of Government....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">The first official record of any conflict between the members of the CALVARY session and the Presbytery appears in the minutes of the regular meeting of the session held June 11, 1975. The minutes relfect [s/e] the following entry:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u2018Because of recent developments a motion was made, seconded and approved to send a complaint to the Synod of the Piedmont.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">TO THE SYNOD OF THE PIEDMONT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">Rev. Charles F. Kukal and the Session of Calvary Presbyterian Church, complainant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>hereby complains to the Synod of the Piedmont, against the action of the Presbytery of Baltimore, made at the Deer Creek Harmony Church in Darlington, Maryland, on the 22nd day of May, 1975* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">Complainant says he has a right to complain because he is a minister enrolled as a member of the Presbytery of Baltimore, and as a session subject to and submitting to the jurisdiction of the Presbytery of Baltimore.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The CALVARY session met on December 17, 1975, and the minutes of that meeting contain the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u2018RECOMMENDATION: The following motion made, seconded and approved:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">The Session of Calvary Presbyterian Church recommends to the congregation that we, as a church, disassociate ourselves from the United Presbyterian Church, United States of America, and ecclesiastical connection with the Presbytery of Baltimore and seek affiliation with the Presbyterian Church in America.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">A special meeting of the CALVARY congregation was held on .December 28, 1975, the minutes of which reflect ... [the adoption of the recommendation].</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">In addition to UNITED, there are a number of other denominations using the word \u2018Presbyterian\u2019 in their names.... [There are two (2) large Presbyterian churches, United and the Presbyterian Church in the United States.] There are a number of smaller splinter denominations, one of which is the Presbyterian Church in America, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Appellants have joined. Because of their Presbyterian form of government, all of these churches have sessions governing the individual churches, presbyteries, synods and General Assemblies. However, though there may be local churches in the Baltimore area associated with some of these other Presbyterian Churches, none of them have a presbytery located in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">[The Calvary session issued its \u2018call to arms\u2019 on January 9, 1976. In a letter to the membership of Calvary, the session enumerated nine (9) specific items of discontent with United, and made clear that the nine (9) were \u2018not a complete list.\u2019 The session correctly prophesied that United would not sanction the \u2018dismissal of a congregation with its property.\u2019 The membership was informed that \u2018[a] legal fight to retain the property\u2019 would come about if Calvary disassociated itself with United.]</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">At the regular annual meeting of the congregation held on January 18, 1976, the CALVARY congregation reaffirmed its action of December 28, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The Presbytery at its regular monthly meeting on January 22, 1976, adopted the following resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u2018WHEREAS, the Presbytery of Baltimore is informed that the Calvary United Presbyterian Church at a congregational meeting on January 18,1976 did arbitrarily and illegally vote to disassociate itself from the UPCUSA and that it is affected by this and other possible disorders,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">Therefore, BE IT RESOLVED:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">A. That the Presbytery of Baltimore authorize an Administrative Commission for the purpose of investigating and formulating recommendations to the Presbytery of Baltimore with respect to possible disorders in the Calvary United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Presbyterian Church, and particularly to recommend to the Presbytery whether or not the Session should be dissolved and replaced by an Administrative Commission as described in Book of Order 41.15. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">E. That the Administrative Commission shall complete its investigation and submit its recommendations at an adjourned meeting of this Presbytery on Tuesday, February 3, 1976 at Faith Church in Baltimore at 4:00 P.M. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">G. That the Stated Clerk and the Moderator shall communicate promptly and directly to the members of the Calvary United Presbyterian Church this action taken by the Presbytery of Baltimore. * * * \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">The Administrative Commission investigated the alleged disorders, advised the Clerk and individual members of the Session of CALVARY, by a letter dated January 27, 1976, and sent to each of said members, both by registered and ordinary mail, that the Commission intended to recommend to the Presbytery at its meeting to be held on February 3, 1976 that Presbytery appoint a new Administrative Commission composed of ministers and ruling elders with the full power of a Session to take the place of the existing Session of CALVARY, after which the present Session of CALVARY would cease to act until such time as Presbytery should otherwise direct and further advising said Appellants that they would be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before said Presbytery at said meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">The Presbytery met on February 3, 1976, at 4:00 P.M., at the Faith Presbyterian Church, for the purpose of hearing and acting on the report of the Administrative Commission. The Commission presented its report and unanimously recommended that the Session of CALVARY be dissolved and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>new Administrative Commission assume the duties of said Session. No members of the CALVARY Session nor any other members of the congregation of CALVARY made known his presence, if in fact any were present, or raised any defenses to said recommendations and the Presbytery unanimously adopted the following resolution:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\">\u2018That the Session of the Calvary Presbyterian Church be dissolved effective February 3, 1976, and that the moderator appoint an Administrative Commission to assume the duties of the Calvary Session until such time as the Commission so appointed and charged recommends other actions to the Presbytery.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">The individuals named as Appellees in this action were appointed to be the Administrative Commission to assume all the duties and responsibilities of the CALVARY Session.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">Thereafter, by arrangement of legal counsel for both parties, the Administrative Commission met informally with members of the deposed session on March 24, 1976 at the Church. At this meeting, the leaders of the deposed session made it clear that the members of the deposed session and the Board of Trustees refused to recognize the authority of the Administrative Commission and the Presbytery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">Further offers by the Commission to meet with members of the deposed session were rejected and finally the Commission, acting in its capacity as Session of the CALVARY Church, called a meeting of the congregation on Sunday, October 17,1976, at the Church. When members of the Commission arrived at the Church, they were requested to leave the premises by Officers of the Baltimore City Police Department, who had been summoned to the premises by members of the deposed session.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>After issue was joined in the circuit court, United filed a motion for summary, judgment, under Md. Rule 610. Judge Sullivan granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\n<em>THE LAW.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Calvary asserts that the chancellor \u201cdelved deeply into the religious law and usage to arrive at his decision,\u201d citing the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan in <em>Maryland and Virginia Eldership of the Churches of God v. Church of God at Sharpsburg, Inc., </em>396 U. S. 367, 369, 90 S. Ct. 499, 500-01, 24 L.Ed.2d 582, 584 (1970) (concurring opinion). Justice Brennan wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">\u201cUnder <em>Watson </em>civil courts do not inquire whether the relevant church governing body has power under religious law to control the property in question. Such a determination, unlike the identification of the governing body, frequently necessitates the interpretation of ambiguous religious law and usage. To permit civil courts to probe deeply enough into the allocation of power within a church so as to decide where religious law places control over the use of church property would violate the First Amendment in much the same manner as civil determination of religious doctrine.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">We observe that Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s remarks were contained in a concurring opinion, not the opinion of the Court, and secondly, they are pure <em>dicta </em>as any reading of Judge Barnes\u2019s opinion in <em>The Maryland and Virginia Eldership of the Churches of God v. The Church of God at Sharpsburg, Inc., </em>254 Md. 162, 254 A. 2d 162 (1969), will reveal. Both <em>Sharpsburg </em>cases, 249 Md. 650, 241 A. 2d 691 (1968), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>393 U. S. 528, 89 S. Ct. 850, 21 L.Ed.2d 750 (1969), and 254 Md. 162, 254 A. 2d 162 (1969), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>396 U. S. 367, 90 S. Ct. 499, 24 L.Ed.2d 582 (1970), decided by the Court of Appeals made manifest that the Court was not passing upon \u201cany doctrinal or theological issue,\u201d 254 Md. at 173, 254 A. 2d at 169, but was deciding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>case upon \u201cneutral principles of law.\u201d <em>Id. See also Hayman v. St. Martin\u2019s Evangelical Lutheran Church, </em>227 Md. 338, 176 A. 2d 772 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">We do not read <em>Watson </em>as proscribing <em>all </em>inquiry by a court of church disputes, but only those dealing with \u201cquestions of discipline, or of faith, or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law....\u201d <em>Watson v. Jones, </em>80 U. S. at 727, 20 L. Ed. at 676. Were it otherwise, controversies such as in the case <em>subjudice </em>might never be resolved, and the title to the church property would be enmeshed in a quagmire from which extrication would be nearly impossible. Title to property cannot be allowed to drift about in an atmosphere of uncertainty. It must be vested in someone, <em>Georges Creek Coal and Iron Co. \u2019s Lessee v. Detmold, </em>1 Md. 225, 238 (1851), \u201cand in such force, that an injury to the possession can be redressed by an action at law.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Neither <em>Watson </em>nor the First Amendment condemn the courts\u2019 deciding ownership of church property, so long as the relevant inquiry is whether the question can be decided \u201con the basis of neutral principles of law which do not involve the resolution <em>by the court </em>of ecclesiastical issues,\u201d <em>Polen v. Cox, </em>259 Md. 25, 30, 267 A. 2d 201, 204 (1970), or doctrinal proprieties.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">We think Judge Finan stated it as well as it can be said when he wrote that \u201c[t]he standard [used by the courts] must be whether the parties by the acts and documents which have governed their relationship have made it possible for a civil court to resolve control of property without the court itself having to make ecclesiastical determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 267 A. 2d at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Applying the dictates of <em>Polen </em>to the instant case, we note that the corporate charter of Calvary provided in Article VI, quoted textually above, that Calvary \u201cshall remain forever a Presbyterian Church in ... government... in accordance with the standards of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of American (sic).\u201d On May 28,1958, the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America merged with The United Presbyterian Church of North America. By the union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>of the two (2) churches, there was formed the present The United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Calvary seeks refuge behind the conveyance to it in 1913, as a corporate body, of the real property heretofore described. Calvary earnestly contends that it, as a corporation, owns the property in its own name free and clear of United. We think that Calvary\u2019s reliance on the 1913 deed is akin to standing on quicksand. There are two (2) decisive factors that cause Calvary to fail to hold its position. First, Chapter XI \u00a7 41.08 of \u201cThe Form of Government\u201d by which Calvary agreed to be bound provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201c8. The church session shall have authority over all of the affairs and activities of the particular church, except such matters as may, by this Form of Government, be specifically accorded \u201cto ... a higher judicatory. The session may from time to time delegate administrative responsibilities in respect to the care and management of church properties and in respect to the financial affairs of the church either to the board of trustees or to the board of deacons or in part to one and in part to the other, subject always to the superior authority and direction of the session.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The session is the overseer of the church property subject, however, to a higher, judicatory, if \u201cThe Form of Government\u201d specifically accords that authority to the higher judicatory. Chapter XXXII \u00a7 62.11 of \u201cThe Form of Government\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\u201c11. Whenever hereafter a particular church is formally dissolved by the presbytery, or has become extinct by reason of the dispersal of its members, the abandonment of its work, or other cause, such property as it may have, both real and personal, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>be held, used, and applied for such uses, purposes, and trusts as the presbytery may direct, limit, and appoint, or such property may be sold or disposed of as the presbytery may direct, in conformity with the Constitution of the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Moreover, the Legislature has provided in Md. Corp. &amp; Ass\u2019ns. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-331 (a) (Cum. Supp. 1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\"><em>\u201cCertain charters deemed amended. </em>\u2014 To the extent not prohibited by the Constitution of the United States or of this State, the charter of each religious corporation subject to this part and incorporated before June 1, 1957, is deemed to be amended to conform to the constitution of the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America and its successors, as from time to time in effect.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Second, Judge Barnes, in <em>Sharpsburg </em>I pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">\u201c[T]here are three methods by which a hierarchical denomination may maintain control of local church property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">1. It may require reverter clauses in the deeds to the property of the local churches.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">2. It may provide in its constitution or by some other authoritative source for the reverting of the local church property to the hierarchical body upon withdrawal by a local congregation with an implied consent by the local church to this provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\">3. It may obtain from the ... [Legislature] an act providing for such a result.\u201d 249 Md. at 663, 241 A. 2d at 699.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">It may readily be seen that United has exercised two (2) of the three (3) methods of maintaining \u201ccontrol of local church property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Either of the two (2), in our view, would have been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>We think it apparent that Calvary holds title to its physical property for the benefit of United. \u201cThe Form of Government\u201d manifests that all church property is owned by United. When Calvary became associated with United\u2019s predecessor, which association continued with United, it did so with the clear understanding that the Calvary church buildings became and continue to be the property of United. Moreover, lest there be any lingering doubt, the Legislature has eradicated it by virtue of Md. Corp. &amp; Ass\u2019ns. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-331 (a) (Cum. Supp. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">We hold that Judge Sullivan did not delve into an area in which the courts are prohibited from entering; nor did he err in determining, on the basis of neutral principles, that control of the Calvary church property belongs to United.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\">. \u201c[W]henever the questions of discipline, or of faith, or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law have been decided by the highest of ...
