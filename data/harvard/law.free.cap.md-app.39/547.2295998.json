Scanlan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Effective Appellate Advocacy in the Court of Appeals of Maryland, </em>29 Md. L. Rev. 126, 127 (1969).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The case now before us must fall casualty to appellant\u2019s failure to comply with Md. Rules ch. 1100, \u201cSubtitle B. Administrative Agencies \u2014 Appeal From.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">This appeal arises directly from a complaint filed by Myles Farley, the principal of Stansbury Joppatowne, Inc., trading as Stansbury Photo &amp; Stereo (Stansbury) with the Insurance Commissioner, Maryland Department of Licensing and Regulation (Commissioner) against Ohio Casualty Insurance Company (Ohio). The focal point of the dispute is a disagreement as to which of two (2) endorsements, one providing coverage of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) and the other setting a monetary ceiling of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) applies to Stansbury\u2019s claim for recompense for losses incurred in an armed robbery. Ohio would agree to reimburse Stansbury to the extent of the lower limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>coverage only. Stansbury, however, contended that the higher limit endorsement applied to his claim, and, as we have indicated, he filed charges with the Commissioner under Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 55 (2) (iv), alleging that Ohio \u201cunreasonably refused or delayed payment to the Complainant of the amount due----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">The Commissioner, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 27, convened a hearing on December 11, 1975. Approximately two (2) months later, the Commissioner issued an order in which he found that Ohio was liable under the endorsement that set the higher limits. Ohio was held to be in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 55, as a result of unreasonably refusing or delaying payment to Stansbury. The Commissioner directed Ohio \u201cto ... pay unto the Complainant [Stansbury] restitution for the loss which occurred on or about April 26, 1975----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Ohio, on February 26, 1976, filed a notice of appeal in the Baltimore City Court, in accordance with Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 40 (1). Although the appeal was timely taken, Ohio overlooked the requirement of Md. Rule B2 e that a <em>petition </em>\u201csetting forth the action appealed from, the error committed by the agency in taking such action, and the relief sought...\u201d must be filed with the clerk of the court not later than ten (10) days after the filing of the order of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Within the time allowed for an answer, Md. Rule B9, but well after the ten (10) day period in which to file the petition had expired, the Commissioner moved pursuant to Md. Rule B5 to dismiss Ohio\u2019s appeal for non-compliance with Md. Rule B2 e.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">On the seventh day following the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss, Ohio responded by dual pleadings in the City court. It belatedly complied with Md. Rule B2 e by filing the required \u201cpetition\u201d alleging that the Commissioner\u2019s findings were not in accord with the factual evidence adduced at the administrative hearing. Ohio also answered the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss. In its response, Ohio sought to excuse its failure to obey Md. Rule B2 e by stating that \u201cif found to be in error as to procedure, [it] was misled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>by the statutory provision of Art. 48A, \u00a7 40, which appears to provide complete separate and distinct procedural guidelines for appeals from Orders of the Insurance Commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 40 (1) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cAn appeal from the Commissioner shall be taken only from an order on hearing or with respect to a matter as to which the Commissioner has refused a hearing. Any person who was a party to such hearing, or whose pecuniary interests are directly and immediately affected by any such order or refusal and who is aggrieved thereby may, within thirty (30) days after (i) the order has been mailed or delivered to the persons entitled to receive... [it] appeal from such order____The appeal shall be taken to the Baltimore City court, by filing written notice of appeal in such court and by filing a copy of such notice with the Commissioner____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The motion by the Commissioner to dismiss Ohio\u2019s appeal from the Commissioner\u2019s order was denied by a judge of the Supreme Bench. Subsequently, the matter was heard on its merits before Judge David Ross who affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s order. Ohio has now carried its \u201cgreat bundle of grief\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to this Court, where it urges us to banish its sorrow by reversing Judge Ross\u2019s order. The Commissioner, either not satisfied with having prevailed in the City court on the merits, or not to be outdone by Ohio, has also appealed. The Commissioner asserts that the hearing court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> erred in denying the motion to dismiss Ohio\u2019s appeal from the Commissioner\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">We shall consider the counter-appeal first in view of the fact that if the motion to dismiss was improperly denied, the City court lacked jurisdiction to hear the merits and Ohio\u2019s appeal, in its present posture, is not properly before us. The hearing judge ruled that Ohio had \u201ccomplied with [the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>statutory requirements\u201d relative to appeals from the Commissioner, and, accordingly, he denied the motion to dismiss. By so doing, the judge implicitly held that Md. Rules, Ch. 1100, Subtitle B, were not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Md. Rule B1 a provides that Subtitle B \u201cshall apply to the review of any final action of an administrative agency by a court where such review is specially authorized by statute____\u201d An administrative agency is defined by Md. Rule B1 b to mean, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cany ... commissioner ... whose action or decision is specifically subject to court review----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">If Ohio's appeal falls within the ambit of the B rules, it is subject to the clear mandate of Rule B2 e, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">\u201cThe appellant shall join with his order for appeal, or shall file with the clerk of the court, within ten days after filing the order, a petition setting forth the action appealed from, the error committed by the agency in taking such action, and the relief sought, and shall serve a copy thereof on the agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Failure to comply with Rule B2 e may result in dismissal of the appeal under Rule B5.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">\u201cIf the appellant shall fail to file his order for appeal within the time prescribed by Rule B4 (Time for Filing) or any order issued pursuant thereto, or shall fail to file his petition within the time prescribed by section e of Rule B2 (How Appeal Taken), the court <em>shall dismiss the appeal unless cause to the contrary be shown.\" </em>Md. Rule B5. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-12\"><em>See Renehan v. Public Service Comm. </em>231 Md. 59, 188 A. 2d 566 (1963); <em>Aberle v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>228 Md. 542, 180 A. 2d 836 (1962); <em>Merrimack Park v. County Board of Appeals, </em>228 Md. 184, 179 A. 2d 345 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">Ohio contends that it successfully proved \u201ccause\u201d for not complying with Md. Rule B2 e. \u201cCause,\u201d as used in Md. Rule B5, refers to \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Merrimack Park v. County Board of Appeals, supra; Madore v. Baltimore County, </em>34 Md. App. 340, 367 A. 2d 54 (1976). In <em>Madore, </em>this Court quoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>approvingly from <em>Lee v. Houston Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>530 S.W.2d 294, 296 (Tex. 1975) where it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">\u201c \u2018The test for ... [finding good cause] is that of ordinary prudence, that is, whether the claimant prosecuted his claim with that degree of diligence that an ordinarily prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.\u2019 \u201d 34 Md. App. at 345, 367 A. 2d at 57.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Ohio maintains that Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 40\u2019s \u201cprocedural mandates are presented in such language and detail as to lead to the conclusion that the following of the procedural requirements set down by the statute is altogether sufficient to perfect an appeal to the Baltimore City Court. The reason why a petition for appeal was not joined to the order of appeal... is that counsel for Ohio believed that the procedures outlined in Art. 48A, Sec. 40 were complete and accomplished what they purport to accomplish on their face, <em>i.e., </em>how to take an appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Ohio relies heavily upon the wording of what it terms a \u201cparticularly descriptive ... subtitle: \u2018(1) Decisions Appealable; how, and by whom appeal taken____\u2019 \u201d What Ohio ignores is that the \u201cparticularly descriptive... subtitle\u201d is not part of the law as enacted. <em>See </em>1976 Md. Laws Ch. 472, \u00a7 11; 1975 Md. Laws Ch. 221, \u00a7 1; 1974 Md. Laws Ch. 748; 1966 Md. Laws Ch. 412; 1963 Md. Laws Ch. 553; 1962 Md. Laws Ch. 36, \u00a7 32; 1945 Md. Laws Ch. 564, \u00a7 1. The \u201csubtitle\u201d quoted by Ohio is but the Editor\u2019s catchwords to indicate the content of the section and \u201cunless expressly provided,\u201d it is <em>not </em>part of the law. Md. Ann. Code art. 1, \u00a7 18 declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">\u201cThe captions or headlines of the several sections of this Code which are printed in bold type, and the captions or headlines of the several subsections of this Code which are printed in italics or otherwise, are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the sections and subsections. They are not to be deemed or taken as titles of the sections and subsections, or as any part thereof; and, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>expressly so provided, they shall not be so deemed or taken when any of such sections and subsections, including the captions or headlines, are amended or reenacted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><em>See Montgomery County v. Eli, </em>20 Md. App. 269, 315 A. 2d 136 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">That Ohio was misled, as it avers, by the \u201cparticularly descriptive ... subtitle\u201d is no excuse. The law is crystalline that section titles and subtitles are not part of the section or subsection unless expressly stated to be a part thereof. Md. Ann. Code art. 1, \u00a7 18. Thus, Ohio\u2019s reliance upon the descriptive subtitle is completely misplaced. Comparison of Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 40, and the B rules reveals that the provisions not only do not conflict, but are, in fact, harmonious. Absent section 40\u2019s authorization of appeal, the B rules would not apply because Md. Rule B1 a mandates that an appeal be \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d by statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning v. City of Rockville, </em>269 Md. 240, 305 A. 2d 122 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Ohio emphasizes a 1973 determination by the Attorney General that section 40 \u201cprovides procedural safeguards against unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious exercise of power by the Commissioner.\u201d 58 Attorney General\u2019s Opinions 92, 99 (1973). We agree that is precisely what section 40 in fact does. It authorizes an avenue of appeal. Section 40, however, is not autonomous and must be read in conjunction with Md. Rules B1 to B12. <em>See County Federal Savings and Loan Assoc, v. Equitable Savings and Loan Assoc., Inc., </em>261 Md. 246, 274 A. 2d 363 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Ohio further points out that the Rules Committee set forth a cross-reference annotation, following Md. Rule B1 a, listing certain statutes subject to the dictates of Md. Rules B1 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>B12. Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 40 is conspicuously absent therefrom. The Committee note makes clear, however, there exists a \u201csubstantial volume of statutory provisions dealing with the procedural aspects of appeals from State and local administrative agencies to the nisi prius courts. The Code of Public General Laws was examined page by page in an effort to discover all of these statutory provisions.\u201d The Committee\u2019s note makes manifest that while an effort was made to record as many applicable sections of the Code as possible, the \u201ccross-reference\u201d is by no means all-inclusive. The note acknowledges possible errors or omissions in compiling the affected provisions. The mere absence of Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 40 is no indication that it is exempt from the requirements of Rules B1 to B12.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Ohio\u2019s argument that \u201c[w]hether this court agrees or disagrees that Md. Ann. Code Article 48A, \u00a7 40 purports to provide the appeals procedure from the Insurance Commissioner, is not, necessarily, dispositive of this case,\u201d is only accurate if \u201cgood cause\u201d for nonadherence to Md. Rule B2 e is shown. Md. Rule B5. In our view, Ohio\u2019s mistaken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>belief that Article 48A, \u00a7 40 established procedures independent of the Maryland Rules of Procedure is not good cause. Ignorance of the law <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> cannot serve as an excuse for failure to file a petition of appeal. A reason or explanation of why a particular event occurred is not necessarily an acceptable excuse for the happening. That a lawyer was misled by the caption to a statute explains why he erred, but does not excuse the error any more than the captain who drives his ship upon the shoals is excused because he misread the chart.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Rule B5 mandates dismissal of an appeal where the appellant \u201cshall fail to file\u201d either the order or petition of appeal \u201cwithin the time prescribed\u201d by the Rules, \u201cunless cause to the contrary be shown.\u201d \u201cCause,\u201d we have already seen, means \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Merrimack Park v. County Board of Appeals, supra. </em>The cases relied on by Ohio to support its failure to file are inapposite to the ease <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Merrimack Park v. County Board of Appeals, supra, </em>good cause was found excusing appellant\u2019s omission of a petition of appeal because the appellant was informed by the Board\u2019s counsel that the Board would not require a petition so long as it was filed a few days before the date of hearing. The Court held that the action of the Board\u2019s counsel constituted cause within the meaning of the rule in that the Board\u2019s counsel \u201clulled\u201d appellant into the position where its appeal was dismissed. <em>Merrimack </em>differs markedly from Ohio\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">We do not quarrel with the proposition that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">\u201c[W]here there has been compliance with the substance of the requirements of statutes or rules by one party and the other party has not been prejudiced, technical irregularities cannot be made the basis for depriving persons of an opportunity to assert their legal rights____\u201d <em>McLay v. Maryland Assemblies, Inc., </em>269 Md. 465, 476-77, 306 A. 2d 524, 530 (1973) (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The above rule has served to save appeals from dismissal in cases such as <em>Border v. Grooms, </em>267 Md. 100, 297 A. 2d 81 (1972), where a good faith attempt to comply with Md. Rule B2 e was made. In <em>Grooms, </em>a petition of appeal was served on counsel for the Zoning Board instead of on the Board itself. Because the Zoning Board\u2019s attorney was found to be acting on the Board\u2019s behalf, the purpose of Md. Rule B2 e was deemed to be satisfied. <em>See Town of Somerset v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>245 Md. 52, 225 A. 2d 294 (1966), in which a motion to dismiss was denied where a petition was timely filed but failed to allege that appellants were the persons aggrieved. <em>See also Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Kines, </em>239 Md. 119, 210 A. 2d 367 (1965); <em>Irvine v. Montgomery County, </em>239 Md. 113, 210 A. 2d 359 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Chief Judge Murphy was careful in <em>Grooms </em>to distinguish those cases in which <em>no </em>proper petition of appeal was ever timely filed. The Court, in <em>Volk v. Pugatch, </em>262 Md. 80, 277 A. 2d 17 (1971), upheld the granting of a motion to dismiss where appellant neglected to file a petition of appeal or to transmit the record and testimony in accordance with Md. Rules B2 e and B7 a. Similarly, in <em>Salisbury Board of Zoning Appeals v. Bounds, </em>240 Md. 547, 214 A. 2d 810 (1965), the Court reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss where a petition of appeal was not filed until thirty (30) days past the deadline prescribed for such filing by Md. Rule B2 e. An appeal was also dismissed in <em>Warmack v. Bradley Club, Inc., </em>242 Md. 394, 219 A. 2d 12 (1966). There, the Court said that appellee\u2019s shopping for counsel did not justify a ten (10) day delay in filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The fact that the Commissioner, in the instant case, suffered no prejudice as a result of the delay is irrelevant. Rule B5 does not require a showing of prejudice to the adverse party as a prerequisite of the trial court\u2019s dismissing a late appeal. <em>Border v. Grooms, supra; Volk v. Pugatch, supra; Warmack v. Bradley Club, Inc., supra; Salisbury Board of Zoning Appeals v. Bounds, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Md. Rule B2 e and Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7 40 are to each other as flour is to bread. Without using flour you cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>make bread; without using the B Rules you cannot perfect an appeal from an administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The trial court is vested with far less discretion in applying Rule B5 than Ohio suggests. The rule plainly states that the trial court, in the absence of cause to the contrary, <em>\u201cshall\u201d </em>dismiss the appeal for non-compliance with Md. Rule B2 e. The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d indicates that very little elasticity is allowed. Nevertheless, Ohio asks us to read the rule as discretionary rather than as a command. The appellate courts of this State have consistently refused to construe the rule in such a fashion. <em>Cf. Jacober v. High Hill Realty, Inc., </em>22 Md. App. 115, 321 A. 2d 838 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>272 Md. 743 (1974), failure to file timely under Rule B7; <em>Goldman v. Tauber, </em>258 Md. 174, 176, 265 A. 2d 225, 226 (1970), failure to file timely under Md. Rule 825 b. <em>But see Toomey v. Gomeringer, 235 </em>Md. 456, 201 A. 2d 842 (1964), which alluded to a certain degree of flexibility inherent in Md. Rule B2 e. <em>Toomey, </em>however, has not been followed in later cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The courts have very little leverage in permitting untimely appeals. The most persuasive appeal, \u201cif filed late, may prove to be an expensive and professionally embarrassing exercise in futility____Thus, if... [the petition] for appeal is not filed within the allotted time, the appeal must be dismissed, since courts lack the power or discretion to allow an appeal which is not filed within the prescribed time.\u201d A. Scanlan, <em>Effective Appellate Advocacy in the Court of Appeals of Maryland, </em>29 Md. L. Rev. 126, 127-28 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">We think that Ohio\u2019s attempted appeal from the Insurance Commissioner should have been dismissed by the hearing judge. Contrary to the hearing judge\u2019s view, Ohio did not comply \u201cwith statutory requirements.\u201d It was not properly in court, and the case should not have been permitted to go forward on its merits as the court, by Ohio\u2019s mistake, had been ousted of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">For whatever solace it may be to Ohio, if the trial court had jurisdiction, and if the case were properly before us on its merits, we could not find that Judge Ross erred in affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Under Md. Ann. Code art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 55 (2) (iv) and 55A, the Commissioner may require that restitution be paid to a claimant where an insurer \u201cunreasonably refuses or delays payment to claimants of the amount due them.\u201d Implicitly, Judge Ross found that Ohio had, in fact, \u201cunreasonably ... [refused] payment to Stansbury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The fact finding by Judge Ross is subject to the clearly erroneous test. Md. Rule 1086. The facts are susceptible of two (2) different findings, <em>i.e., </em>Myles Farley, the owner of Stansbury, was acting at the time of the loss as a watchman for his wholly-owned corporation or that he was not. If Farley was found to be acting as a watchman, the higher policy limits apply. If he was acting in another capacity, the lower limits were applicable. In either event, we are not at liberty to substitute our judgment thereon for that of the trial judge, Md. Rule 1086, nor are we prepared to declare, in the face of those two (2) possible distinct findings that as a matter of law the lesser limitations of the policy are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">\n<em>Appeal is dismissed and case remanded to the Baltimore City Court with instructions to dismiss the appeal from the Insurance Commissioner.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-10\">.
