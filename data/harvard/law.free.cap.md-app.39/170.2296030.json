Coceo, M.D., and appellant Frank W. Baker, Jr., M.D., among others.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The subpoenas required them \u201cto appear\u201d and \u201cto present records of the [Hospital Review Committee] of St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital pertinent to the privileges and practice of [the Unnamed Physician] at St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital.\u201d The doctors refused to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, the Disciplinary Commission filed a petition for enforcement of its subpoenas. In an answer and motion to quash, the doctors asserted that the proceedings and records of the Hospital Review Committee were \u201cprivileged and confidential,\u201d \u201cneither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>discoverable nor admissible into evidence,\u201d and \u201cotherwise insulated and not available to the Commission.\u201d The Unnamed Physician intervened, asserting that art. 43, \u00a7 130 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is vague, contradictory and uncertain and that therefore enforcement of the subpoenas would violate due process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In determining whether to enforce the subpoenas, Judge H. Kemp MacDaniel considered only one of these contentions. Article 43, \u00a7 134A (d)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">\u201cThe proceedings, records, and files of a medical review committee are neither discoverable nor admissible into evidence <em>in any civil action </em>arising out of matters which are being reviewed and evaluated by the committee.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The trial judge decided that a disciplinary proceeding before the Disciplinary Commission is not a \u201ccivil action.\u201d On 5 May 1977, he entered an order enforcing the subpoenas. This appeal is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Maryland courts have recognized that disciplinary proceedings against a professional have the unique purpose of protecting the public from the results of a professional\u2019s improper conduct, incompetence or unscrupulous practices.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They have consistently differentiated such proceedings from civil and criminal proceedings. They have stated that such a proceeding is \u201cneither civil nor criminal in nature\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and, more specifically, is not an \u201caction at law\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or a \u201cprosecution\u201d or \u201csuit.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These courts have consistently declined to extend to judges, lawyers, and real estate brokers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>under investigation in professional disciplinary proceedings protections available to civil and criminal defendants in court proceedings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Courts in other states have similarly declined to extend such protections to physicians under investigation in disciplinary proceedings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">We see no difference between protecting the public from improper, unscrupulous or incompetent practices by judges, attorneys, and real estate brokers and the same type of practices by physicians. Nor are we persuaded by considerations of policy to extend to physician disciplinary proceedings, which protect the rights of the public, the same limitations on discovery applicable in civil proceedings, which enforce private rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We agree with the trial court that a disciplinary proceeding before the Disciplinary Commission is not a civil action. Accordingly, art. 43, \u00a7 134A (d) does not preclude the Disciplinary Commission from issuing a subpoena for the proceedings, records and files of the Hospital Review Committee.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We shall not, however, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">An appellate court must decide a case according to existing laws even though the trial court\u2019s judgment, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>correct when made, must be reversed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> An appellate court will apply a change in statutory law made after the trial court\u2019s judgment unless vested or accrued substantive rights would be disturbed or unless the Legislature shows a contrary intention.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">On 1 July 1977, eight weeks after the trial court\u2019s order of 5 May 1977, Md. Ann. Code, art. 43, \u00a7 130A<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> became effective. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">\u201c\u00a7 130A. Required reports to Commission by hospitals and courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201c(a) <em>Reports of denial, limitation or termination of staff privileges for unprofessional conduct; resignation while under formal accusation. </em>\u2014 (1) Each hospital and related institution shall report to the Commission each denial of a physician\u2019s application for staff privileges and each limitation, reduction, or termination of previously granted staff privileges if the action results from any of the causes listed in \u00a7 130 (h) of this article as unprofessional conduct, or any voluntary resignation of a physician while the physician is under formal accusation of activities listed in \u00a7 130 (h) of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">\u201c(2) The report shall be submitted within ten days after the hospital or related institution acts on the staff privileges and shall specify the reasons for the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u201c(3) In no event shall any minutes or notes taken in the course of determining the denial, limitation, reduction or termination of staff privileges be subject to review or discovery by any person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u201c(b) <em>Reports of convictions. </em>\u2014 Each court shall report to the Commission each conviction of a physician for any crime involving moral turpitude within ten days after the conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\">\u201c(c) <em>Subpoena power of Commission. </em>\u2014 The Commission may enforce this section by subpoena.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201c(d) <em>Immunity from civil action. </em>\u2014 A person who in good faith provides the information required under this section is immune from civil action for damages resulting from the provision of information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u201c(e) <em>Reports not subject to subpoena or discovery. </em>\u2014 A report made under this section is not subject to subpoena or discovery proceeding in any civil action except proceedings arising out of hearings and decisions of the Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Because this law affects procedural rather than substantive rights <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and because there is no contrary legislative intent, we shall apply this law.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Article 43, \u00a7 130A (a) (3) expressly precludes the \u201creview or discovery by any person\u201d of the \u201cminutes or notes\u201d of a hospital pertaining to a change in the status of the physician\u2019s staff privileges. We must first determine whether the Disciplinary Commission is a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 130A (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The word \u201cperson\u201d when used in a statute ordinarily does not include the State or State agencies. A State or State agency, however, may be included in the word \u201cperson\u201d if there is a manifest legislative intent that it be so included.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In determining this legislative intent, a court must read the words and provisions of a statute in context.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In addition, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>may </em>consider the legislative history, including committee reports,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and the purpose of the statute.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Finally, a court should reconcile and harmonize parts of a statute if possible.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The parts of art. 43, \u00a7 130A (a) are interrelated. Subsection (a) (1) requires that hospitals make certain reports to the Disciplinary Commission. Subsection (a) (2) specifies the time of filing and content of the required report. Thus, the context of subsection (a) (3) requires it to be read as describing material which shall neither be included in the report nor otherwise made available to the Disciplinary Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The legislative history of art. 43, \u00a7 130A (Senate Bill 263)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> shows that, as originally proposed, that Bill did not prohibit review or discovery of a hospital\u2019s minutes or notes concerning the status of a physician\u2019s staff privileges. A Senate Finance Committee Report, dated 28 February 1977, recommended, among other things, that the Bill be amended to include such a prohibition and that the Bill as amended be enacted. The report described the purpose of the proposed legislation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201cThe bill provides a means by which the Commission on Medical Discipline can learn of, and review each denial or reduction of a physician\u2019s staff privileges, and other occurrences of unprofessional conduct. <em>As amendedthe bill also safeguards the rights of the accused by denying discovery of pertinent notes regarding the investigation of a physician </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The Bill was enacted as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">This history establishes that the purpose of subsection (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>(3) is to protect an accused physician from the disclosure of certain materials. To accomplish that purpose fully, subsection (a) (3) must be read as excluding minutes or notes concerning the status of a physician\u2019s staff privileges from the material which a hospital is otherwise required to make available to the Disciplinary Commission, a body authorized to impose sanctions upon a physician for unprofessional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Thus the context, the legislative history, and the purpose of art. 43, \u00a7 130A (a) (3) establish a manifest legislative intent that the Disciplinary Commission be included in the word \u201cperson.\u201d We now consider the relation between that provision and other parts of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Article 43, \u00a7 130 (i) authorizes the Disciplinary Commission to issue subpoenas. It does not restrict the type of material which a hospital may be required to produce. Article 43, \u00a7 130A (c), also authorizes the Disciplinary Commission to issue subpoenas. Article 43, \u00a7 130A (a) (3), however, restricts the type of material which a hospital may be required to produce by excluding' \u201cminutes or notes.\u201d That section provides that \u201c[i]n no event\u201d shall those \u201cminutes or notes\u201d be made available to the Disciplinary Commission. Under these circumstances, in order to harmonize and reconcile these three provisions, art. 43, \u00a7 130A (a) (3) must be read as restricting the Disciplinary Commission\u2019s authority to compel the production of \u201cminutes or notes,\u201d not only under art. 43, \u00a7 130A (c), but also under art. 43, \u00a7 130 (i). Accordingly, the Disciplinary Commission cannot subpoena the Hospital Review Committee\u2019s minutes or notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The order of the trial court enforced the Disciplinary Commission\u2019s subpoenas which required the production of \u201crecords\u201d of the Hospital Review Committee concerning the status of staff privileges of the Unnamed Physician. There was no exclusion of \u201cminutes or notes.\u201d To this extent, these subpoenas are not in accordance with existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">As a matter of policy, agency subpoenas should be enforced to the extent they are in accordance with law.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>appropriate circumstances, trial courts may modify subpoenas issued by administrative agencies.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, we shall reverse the trial court\u2019s 5 May 1977 order and remand the case for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\n<em>Case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-11\">.
