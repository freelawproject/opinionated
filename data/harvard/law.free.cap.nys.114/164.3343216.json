The plaintiff was entitled to maintain a cross-action, and was not bound to interpose its claim as a cross-demand to the defendant\u2019s suit. Nat Fire Ins. Co. v. Hughes, 189 N. Y. 84, 88, 81 N. E. 562, 12 L. R. A (N. S.) 907 and cases cited. The defense of another action pending being unavailable, judgment was properly rendered for the plaintiff upon the facts in evidence, and the denial of the motion to stay the action, pending the determination of the action in the City Court, certainly presents no ground of prejudice to the defendant. Such a stay, necessarily extending beyond the statutory limitation of five days (Municipal Court Act [Raws 1902, p. 1489, c. 580] \u00a7 1, subd. 15), was beyond the power of the court to grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Judgment and order appealed from affirmed, with costs.
