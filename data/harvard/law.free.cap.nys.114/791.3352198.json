The answer contains a general denial, and also sets up the defense of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-18\">The principal question in dispute was whether the car was moving or standing still when the plaintiff attempted to board it.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-19\">In summing up to the jury the plaintiff\u2019s counsel said, speaking of an employ\u00e9 of the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-20\">\u201cHe went to Stein\u2019s house and tried <em>to </em>settle this case without my knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-21\">Defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the remark, and moved for a mistrial, which was denied, and an exception duly noted. There was nothing in the evidence to justify the remark, and it was undoubtedly a willful attempt to influence the jury improperly.....</p>\n<p id=\"b815-22\">The record also shows that it was not the only misstatement of the evidence of which plaintiff\u2019s counsel was guilty. As the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>theory was that it was under no liability whatever, it is obvious that the statement quoted was calculated to prejudice the defense. Verdicts obtained in this fashion will not be allowed to stand (Scott v. Barker [Sup. December, 1908] 113 N. Y. Supp. 695; Strickland v. N. Y. Central, etc., R. R. Co., 88 App. Div. 367, 371, 84 N. Y. Supp. 655), and it is.no sufficient answer to this objection to show that the jury were instructed to disregard the improper statements of counsel (Loughlin v. Brassil, 187 N. Y. 128, 135, 79 N. E. 854; Manigold v. Black River Traction Co., 81 App. Div. 381, 384, 80 N. Y. Supp. 861).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
