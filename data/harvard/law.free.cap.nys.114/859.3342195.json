This failure of proof does not entitle the defendant to a judgment dismissing the complaint upon the merits, and the motion to correct the judgment should have been granted, thus saving the plaintiff the expense of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-17\">The order must therefore be reversed, with costs, and the judgment modified, by striking therefrom the words \u201cupon the merits\u201d and inserting therein the words \u201cwithout prejudice to a new trial,\u201d and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
