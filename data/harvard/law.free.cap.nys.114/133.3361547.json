The complaint is: \u201cGoods sold and delivered.\u201d The answer is: \u201cGeneral denial. Demand for bill of particulars.\u201d The bill of particulars sets forth a claim for $15.20 for goods sold and delivered, and of which claim the items are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">1 end cloth..............................................;........$ 4 20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">S yds. cloth....................................................... 11 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">Total ....-................................................... $15 20</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">The justice gave judgment for the plaintiff, and defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">The plaintiff is a corporation and the assignee of the claim in' suit. It appears that one David Solomon, a brother of Moe \u2018Solomon, one of the defendants herein, went to the store of the firm of Stark, Rosenthal Si Stark, plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and got the goods in suit. The defendants compose the firm of Solomon, Hodes Si Zeeman, of which firm the said David Solomon is an employ\u00e9, and plaintiff's assignor \u25a0charged the goods so taken by David Solomon against the account of the firm of Solomon, Hodes Si Zeeman.. The said David Solomon is the only witness for defendants; and he swears he bought the goods for his wife, and not for the firm of Solomon, Hodes Si Zeeman. He \u25a0says he told Rosenthal, the member of the firm of Stark, Rosenthal Si Stark who sold the goods in question, that he wanted the goods for 'his wife. Rosenthal was not called as a witness, and the plaintiff\u2019s only witnesses are its vice president, one Stark, and its bookkeeper, a girl named Ida Smolinsky. Stark states that he was a member of the firm of Stark, Rosenthal Si Stark, plaintiff\u2019s assignors, and that on March 19, 1908, said David Solomon called at the store of the said firm and .got the goods in suit. Stark testifies thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">\u201cQ. Did you sell the goods? A. My partner did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">\u201cQ. In your presence? A. In my place. I was present at the time he, David Solomonj came in, and I turned him over to Mr. Rosenthal,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">\u201cQ. To whom were those goods sold? A. To Solomon, Hodes &amp; Zeeman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-15\">\u201cQ. Who bought those goods? A. Mr. Solomon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-16\">\u201cQ. Were the goods delivered to Mr. Solomon? A. Tes, sir; and the bill was charged to Solomon, Hodes &amp; Zeeman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-17\">\u201cQ. Were statements sent to Solomon, Hodes &amp; Zeeman? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-18\">\u201cQ. Where were the goods delivered? A. In our place. Mr. Solomon took them along.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-19\">On cross-examination he identified David Solomon as the man to whom the goods were delivered, and testifies thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-20\">\u201cQ. He [David Solomon] was the man that received those \"goods? A. He \u25a0was there to ask for the goods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-21\">\u201cQ. And he is the man that had the conversation with Mr. Rosenthal, which you testify occurred that day? A. Yes; he came into my place and .asked\u2014he wanted to get some goods for himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-22\">\u201cQ.-That is the man (indicating David Solomon)? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-23\"><em>-\u201cQ. </em>And no one else? A. That is all I saw.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>What conversation Solomon had with Rosenthal does not appear from Stark\u2019s testimony. The plaintiff then rested without having shown any authority actual or implied on the part of David Solomon to buy for the firm of Solomon, Hodes &amp; Zeeman, nor even that, in point of fact, said Solomon pretended that he was buying for said firm. David Solomon was then called on defendants\u2019 behalf, and testified, as above indicated, that he bought for his wife only, and so told Rosenthal, and that he never pretended that he was buying for the firm of his brother, the defendants herein, and he says he never bought goods for the defendants. He further claims that Rosenthal owed him $13.88, and that he bought the goods from Rosenthal for $15.20, leaving him in debt to Rosenthal for $1.32. He also states that the goods in question were never turned over to defendants, but that the goods were delivered to the wife of the witness. Plaintiff then called its bookkeeper, Ida Smolinsky, who says that Rosenthal told her to charge the goods to the firm of Solomon, Hodes <em>Sc </em>Zeeman, and to deliver them to said David Solomon. She then testifies thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-3\">\u201cQ. Did you send a statement as ordered? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Presumably she means that she sent the statement to Solomon, Hodes &amp; Zeeman, although she does not so state.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">\u201cQ. Have you ever received a check from Solomon, Hodes &amp; Zeeman for those goods? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201cQ. By the Court: Did you ever send a statement to Solomon, Hodes &amp; Zeeman for this bill of goods? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201cQ. Did you ever have it questioned? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">\u201cQ. No reply ever came to you when a statement was sent? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">\u201cQ. Of any kind? A. Except that a check that I got in August.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">\u201cQ. No, I mean for this bill of $15.20. Did you ever receive any word on that account? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">\u201cQ. Was that statement at any time returned to you by Solomon, Hodes &amp; Zeeman? A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">When or how she sent the statement, or whether it was ever received by defendants, or whether it might not have been returned to plaintiff without her knowledge, her direct testimony fails' to disclose. Upon cross-examination, however, she testifies: That she sent the statement or bill about-two days after the goods were bought, and that it was mailed from her place.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-13\">\u201cQ. Did you mail it personally? A. I mail all th\u00e9 mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-14\">\u201cQ. Do you remember particularly the day that you mailed that letter? A. I mailed it with the rest of my mail, together with everything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-15\">\u201cQ. Do you remember particularly whether you dropped that letter in the letter box? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-16\">\u201cQ. All you know is that you had a pile of letters, and took them down, and mailed whatever you had? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-17\">She is unable to fix the month when the goods were sold and the statement sent. Stark swore the goods were sold in March, and the bill of particulars gives the date as March 19, 1908. Ida Smolinsky is asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-18\">\u201cQ. Are you sure it was not in March? A. Yes, sir; and it was not in April.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-19\">\u201cQ. You say it was in the latter part of May or early part of June. Are you pretty sure of that? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>It seems to us that the evidence as to the agency of Solomon does not support the judgment, while the evidence as to the sending and retention of the statement is too indefinite to make out an admission of liability by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
