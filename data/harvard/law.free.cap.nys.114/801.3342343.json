On cross-examination, the plaintiff testified that he was not in bed at all in consequence of the injury; that he could go around just as though nothing had happened, except that he had something the matter with his eye; and that his general health was all right. The defendant offered no testimony, but moved to dismiss the complaint. Judgment was afterwards rendered in its favor, and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">While there is no dispute that the plaintiff was injured in the manner testified to by him, we do not think that he has brought himself within the provisions of the by-laws relating to benefits in cases of sickness. The injury in itself could not be described as sickness (Kelly v. Ancient Order of Hibernians, 9 Daly, 289), and it is clear from the plaintiff\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that it did not produce illness or sickness.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">\u25a0 The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
