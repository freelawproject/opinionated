Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-19\">It was conceded on the trial that the defendant ordered a bill\" of goods amounting to $65.66 to be delivered at his place of business; the plaintiff claiming they were to be paid for in cash when delivered, and the defendant insisting that nothing was said in reference to the terms of payment. The goods were actually delivered at defendant\u2019s place of business by plaintiff\u2019s agent, and because the defendant refused to pay cash for them they were taken back to plaintiff, and this action was brought for the purchase price. It seems to be well settled that the vendor of goods may tender delivery, and, on refusal of the vendee to accept, may hold the goods for defendant and sue for the purchase price. Horst v. Montauk Brewing Co., 118 App. Div. 300, 103 N. Y. Supp. 381, affirmed 192 N. Y. 29, 85 N.
