The plaintiff holds judgment against him and obtained the issuance of an execution under the provisions of section 1391 of the Code of Civil Procedure, directing application by the city of 10 per cent, of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>salary on such judgment. Within a month after the issuance of such execution the defendant filed a petition in bankruptcy and was adjudged a bankrupt. Thereupon the defendant moved t\u00f3 set aside the execution, which motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The moving papers do not disclose that the defendant has been discharged in bankruptcy, nor do they show that the bankruptcy court or this court has granted any stay of prosecution of actions against the bankrupt, or stayed the collection of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment. A mere adjudication of bankruptcy does not operate to discharge a defendant, nor does it. operate as a stay against prosecution of a claim. If the claim be one from which a discharge in bankruptcy would be a release a stay of prosecution or collection under the provisions of section 11 of the bankrupt act (Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 549 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3426]) may be obtained on application to the state court. Until such stay is obtained, however, parties have the right to prosecute action or enforce collection of judgments. In re Geister (D. C.) 97 Fed. 322. Especially is this so where, as in the present case, the property levied upon is a portion of the current salary of the bankrupt, which could not be applied to the payment of his general debts, and which would not pass to his trustee in bankruptcy. Until a stay of collection is obtained, the plaintiff has a right to the continuance of his execution and the appropriation on his judgment of 10 per cent, of the defendant\u2019s salary. The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs and the execution reinstated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
