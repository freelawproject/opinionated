But that is not so. The language is directly the opposite, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-26\">\u201cWhen one attempts to cross the tracks of a street car and has approached' the track at such a distance from an approaching car that he has reasonable ground to suppose,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>It is not that he supposes, etc., but that he has reasonable ground to suppose. Jt is also urged that the instruction is erroneous because it excludes every element or fact except that the person has \u201capproached\u201d the track, and the distance of the car, and tests his contributory negligence by these alone. By no means; it excludes nothing. The test put by the instruction is that the pedestrian have \u201creasonable ground to suppose\u201d he can pass in safety, and that embraces the distance of the car, its speed\u2014in fine, everything. It will not do to finesse with the charges of trial judges. Controlling regard should be had to the substance, even in the rough, rather than to fine distinctions which those who seek to make them find our language scarcely flexible enough to express. This instruction was given at the request of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. Requests to charge such abstract propositions should not be made. The charge to the jury and requests to charge should be based on the concrete facts of the case. A charge is not to be a mere legal essay.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. WOODWARD, RICH, and MILLER, JJ., concur. JENKS, J., votes for reversal, on the ground of error in the charge of the court at folios 206 and 207 of the record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
