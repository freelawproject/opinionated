J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asg\">The plaintiff boarded an Erie Railroad train at Tuxedo Park, and delivered to the baggageman a dress suit case, containing valuable articles of wearing apparel, and received a check therefor. When the train arrived at New York, and as the plaintiff was stepping off the platform of the train, a man calling out, \u201cBaggage! Baggage!\u201d approached the plaintiff, who inquired if he was \u201cMay\u2019s man.\u201d Upon being informed that he was, and it is so conceded, she gave her check to him, and he handed her a paper, which subsequently she ascertained was one of the usual baggage receipts limiting the defendants\u2019 liability to $50 in case of loss of baggage. The agent of the defendants did not call the plaintiff\u2019s attention in any way to the contents of the paper, nor did she read it, but immediately put it in her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-15\">The defendants concede that they obtained the suit case, and that it was lost on its way from the depot to the destination given by the plaintiff as the place where it was to be delivered by defendants. The only defense is that the plaintiff cannot recover for more than $50, which was the amount the lower court gave her. We think this is one of the numerous cases, known as \u201cbaggage cases,\u201d in which it has been uniformly held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-16\">\u201cThat tokens or writings given in exchange for baggage checks are not of such a nature as to put persons on their guard as to the memorandum printed on them, and persons receiving them are not presumed to know their contents or to assent to them.\u201d Blossom v. Dood', 43 N. Y. 264, 3 Am. Rep. 701; Grossman v. Dodd, 63 Hun, 324,17 N. Y. Supp. 855.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">In the case at bar the plaintiff had no opportunity for negotiation or discussion. The slip of paper was evidently hurriedly placed in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>hand, and the agent immediately passed on engaged in the performance of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
