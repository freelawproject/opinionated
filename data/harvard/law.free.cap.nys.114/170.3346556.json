This rule of practice, announced by the Appellate Division, of the Second Department (Warth v. Moore Co., 125 App. Div. 211, 109 N. Y. Supp. 116), has not been adopted in the First Department. The case of Marchesini v. Scaccianoce, 110 App. Div. 130, 96 N. Y. Supp. 1095, is authority for the procedure followed by the plaintiff in seeking the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion at Special Term for the purpose of obtaining relief from a judgment taken at the trial because of his inability to present his case after an adjournment had been refused, and the facts presented on the motion being such as to require the opening of the judgment, on terms, in the proper exercise of discretion (Richard v. Nat. Dis. Co. [Sup.] 95 N. Y. Supp. 547), the application should have been entertained on the merits and granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">There is also before us an appeal by the plaintiff from an order entered at Trial Term upon the denial of the application for an adjournment. This order affects a substantial right, and therefore is appealable (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3189, and section 1347, subd. 4); but, in view of the distinction in character between the application for an adjournment at the trial and a subsequent motion to open the judgment on terms, as noted in Marchesini v. Scaccianoce, supra, the ruling of the justice at Trial Term, upon the afEdaits presented, does not disclose reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Order denying motion for adjournment affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. Order denying motion to open judgment of dismissal reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, upon payment of costs before notice of trial and $10 motion costs within fiv'e days.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
