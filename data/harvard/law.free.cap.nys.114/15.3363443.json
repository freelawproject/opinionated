The only question presented by this appeal is whether the original decree is valid. I think it is not, because it was made in violation of the mandatory rule of the court, which had all the force and effect of a statute (People ex rel. Mayor, etc., v. Nichols, 18 Hun, 535; Matter of Moore, 108 N. Y. 280, 15 N. E. 369), and the court was not at liberty to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">In Pratt v. Pratt, 2 App. Div. 534, 38 N. Y. Supp. 26, which was an action to annul a marriage, upon appeal.from an order vacating so much of an order of reference as appointed the referee, agreed upon \"by the parties, Mr. Justice Barrett, speaking of section 1012 of the Code of .Civil Procedure and rule 72, which provides that in such actions the court \u201cshall in no case order the reference to a referee \u25a0* * * agreed upon by the parties,\u201d said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">\u201cProcedure in disregard of these provisions is not a mere irregularity. Such procedure is unquestionably void. The law was not enacted, nor was the rule \u25a0established, for the benefit of the parties to matrimonial actions, but for the public good. In this respect the mandate and prohibition differ from the regulations with regard to referees in foreclosure and partition actions. The latter regulations were adopted to secure fair dealing upon judicial sales, and. to \u25a0prevent one party from overreaching the other. The former regulations were \u2022enacted to prevent one party fom colluding with the other. Public policy favors th'e continuity of the marital union. It condemns any break in that con\"tinuity not specifically authorized by law. For this reason the parties are not \u25a0 permitted, as they are in ordinary controversies, to admit the facts or to waive proof thereof; nor is the court permitted to grant relief upon their \u2022consent. To render these interdictions effectual, to prevent the possibility of their being evaded, the referee rule was adopted. It is distinctly in harmony with the statute. The statute says that the court must designate the referee. To guarantee strict compliance with this-mandate, the rule declares that the \u2022court shall not, in any case, \u2018order the reference to a referee nominated by either party, nor to a referee agreed upon by the parties.\u2019 What is that but saying that the court must designate the referee freely, independently, and without a breath of suggestion? The moment the rule is successfully invaded, that moment the statute falls. If parties may walk through or around these \u25a0regulations to a tribunal of their own arrangement, they can as readily walk through or around all the obstacles which the law places between them and their desires. Given their own friendly tribunal, and what becomes of the re.maining statutory safeguards?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">It is contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that defendant, having submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and consented to the entry of the decree, cannot now be heard to complain. 'The trouble with this contention is he consented to the very thing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>which the rule provided should not be done, and no jurisdiction could be conferred upon the court to violate it. The rule was not adopted to convenience the parties to such an action, but to prevent collusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The original decree, as well as the order fixing the alimony, were invalid; and it follows that the order appealed from must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Order reversed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
