Plaintiffs deny acceptance of the order set forth in the counterclaim, and allege that when the order was submitted to them it was rejected by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Defendants\u2019 evidence was to the effect that the alleged contract was made through an agent of the plaintiffs, one Mr. Strauss, of the firm of Strauss &amp; Schlicting, and the question of the authority of said agent to bind the plaintiff was one of the material questions involved in the case. During the course of the trial defendants\u2019 counsel called upon plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to produce a certain written contract between the plaintiffs and the firm of Strauss &amp; Schlicting. The contract was produced by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, when the court inquired whether defendants\u2019 counsel intended to introduce it. Defendants\u2019 counsel stated he wished to read the document before offering it. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel refused to deliver the document to defendants\u2019 counsel unless he offered it in evidence. Defendants\u2019 counsel asked permission to \u201clook through\u201d the document, and the court refused such permission. The record then states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Counsel: I ask your honor to have it marked in evidence, on the ground that it is called for by the other side, and, having been produced in response to that call, it is offered in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">\u201cThe Court: Mark it in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: I object to that as being incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial. (Objection overruled. Exception to defendants. Paper referred to received in evidence, and marked \u2018Defendants\u2019 Exhibit G.\u2019)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">It is contended by respondent that, even if this ruling of the court was erroneous, it was not prejudicial to defendants, inasmuch as the agency had previously been established by competent proof; but, though there had been evidence introduced by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel as to the agency of Strauss &amp; Schlicting, the extent of such agency was in dispute. The document admitted established a limited agency, providing that all sales made by the, agents should first be submitted to plaintiffs with the name of the proposed purchaser, and such proposed sale should not in any event be consummated unless the plaintiffs approved of the credit, risk, and standing of the proposed purchaser. The judgment rendered by the court shows that this evidence was conclusive in the mind of the court as against the defendant; it having been admitted and marked in evidence as defendants\u2019 proof. The admission of such proof was, therefore, prejudicial to defendants\u2019 interest, and, in connection with the court\u2019s refusal to permit defendants\u2019 counsel to inspect the document produced at his request unless he agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>offer it in evidence, constituted reversible error. See Smith v. Rentz, 131 N. Y. 175, 30 N. E. 54, 15 L. R. A. 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">GILDERSLEEVE, P. J., concurs. BISCHOFF, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
