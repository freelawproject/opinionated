All else of the complaint, which covers 16 pages of the printed record, is mere useless verbiage, and should be struck out. Courts have of. necessity to defend themselves in some way against such pleadings. The plaintiff should have a new complaint competently drawn\u2014one that can be understood\u2014and it will not exceed a page. The present-complaint will be a source of useless litigation and expense to the plaintiff for probably a long time if it be not superseded, and in the end may prove fatal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>to the plaintiff\u2019s case, for it will never serve any purpose except to pro-. mote misunderstanding and confusion. A full analysis of the complaint will be found on an appeal from a judgment overruling a demurrer to this complaint which is decided herewith. 114 N. Y. Supp. 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The order should be reversed and the motion granted as to all of the complaint except the part stating the one cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, as to all of the complaint except the part stating the one cause of action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
