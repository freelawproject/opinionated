From the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony it appears that she was fully conscious and in no condition of distress- such as would take from her utterances the quality of deliberation. Hence any statement by her bearing upon the cause of the accident, which the -question involved, would have been but a narration of past events, a self-serving declaration, and not of the character of proof admissible as part of the res geste. Patterson v. Hochster, 38 App. Div. 398, 401, 56 N. Y. Supp. 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-19\">It is contended that proof of other accidents at the same place was \u25a0 improperly excluded; but the question of the extent to which evidence of this character is admissible is not actually before us, since no ruling was made upon the subject, and no evidence was excluded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>other than the obviously irrelevant matter relating to a tenant\u2019s fall \u25a0 upon some other flight of stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\">No ground for a reversal is presented by the record before us, and we conclude that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
