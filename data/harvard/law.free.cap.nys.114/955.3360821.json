Answers were served, but nothing further was done in the action. A criminal prosecution was also instituted against the respondent, Burnham. The latter was held by the committing magistrate, but sued out a writ of habeas corpus upon which it was finally held by this court and the Court of Appeals that upon the facts a criminal prosecution would not lie. The grounds upon which this result was arrived at made it apparent that the plaintiff could not succeed in the present action. A motion was therefore made for leave to discontinue upon payment of costs. The motion was granted as to all of the defendants except Burnham, but as to him it was provided, as a condition of discontinuance, that the plaintiff must pay an extra allowance of $500 in addition to the taxable costs. Erom so much of the order as imposes the payment of the extra allowance, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-16\">It is quite clear, under the rules which now prevail respecting the granting of extra allowances, that this is not a case, considered by itself, in which an extra allowance should be granted. Standard Trust Co. v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 178 N. Y. 407, 70 N. E. 925; Campbell v. Emslie, 188 N. Y. 509, 81 N. E. 458. It is sought to sustain it, however, upon the plea that the respondent should be compensated in this action for the expense and annoyance to which he was put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>in the criminal proceeding. This argument is, as we think, untenable. This action and the criminal prosecution were quite distinct pro-: ceedings, having no relation to -or bearing upon each other, except that they rested upon similar questions of fact and law. The plaintiff was entitled to institute both, or either, as he saw fit. If the criminal proceeding was so unfounded as to amount to a malicious prosecution, the law \u00e1ffords the respondent a means of procuring indemnification. If it was not so unfounded, the law has not provided for indemnification, and he cannot secure indirectly what the law has refused him directly by obtaining an extra allowance in another action, the facts of which, taken by themselves, would not iustify an allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The order so far as appealed from will be modified by striking out the provision for an extra allowance, and, as so modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
