The cause of action was based solely upon the alleged negligence of defendant, who was charged as owner of the premises. He defended upon the ground that some months prior to the accident he had leased the whole premises to another. It was claimed by plaintiff that the alleged lease was sham, and a mere device to relieve defendant from liability, and the question thus raised was the one principally litigated upon the trial and dealt with by the court in the main charge. After the jury had been charged, and just before they retired to consider their verdict, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the court to charge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-17\">\u201cI aslc the court, as the landlord in this case had rented these premises with a nuisance, which the testimony shows had existed prior to the making of the lease and continued, and that he took rent for the premises, that he is responsible if he knew of this condition.\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-18\">To which the court acceded, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-19\">\u201cIf he knew of the existence of the nuisance at the time he made the lease, I so charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-20\">This was duly excepted to, and constitutes reversible error. The complaint charged the defendant with negligence, and the trial proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>ed upon that theory. It is the settled rule that judgment can only be rendered in conformity with the allegations and proofs of the parties (Wright v. Delafield, 25 N. Y. 266), and a recovery for creating or maintaining a nuisance cannot be had upon a complaint which alleges only negligence. Furst v. Zucker, 125 App. Div. 591, 110 N. Y. Supp. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
