It was discovered in the forenoon shortly after the 11 o\u2019clock passenger train went by, but it may have caught from an earlier train. This might be inferred from its considerable extent and headway when discovered. A large number of trains passed daily. The evidence that the locomotives of the defendant generally habitually emitted live cinders at this place large enough to cause such a fire was properly admitted. Coupled with the facts, showing that there was no other present cause for the fire, it was inferable that such cinders caused the fire. They were cast out there regularly, .were apt to c'ause the fire, and, in the absence of any other cause, could be found to be the cause. The contention that the evidence should have been confined to the engine of the 11 o\u2019clock train is without basis. It was also proper to prove, not only that inflammable grass, weeds, and brush were standing uncut, or lying cut, along the defendant\u2019s right of way, but also the length of time they had been there; for the longer the more negligent, and the worse for the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ant. It should not leave material in its right of way which is apt to take fire from its engines.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\">But the.learned trial judge erred in finally yielding to the persistent efforts of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to prove previous fires on lands of different persons along the defendant\u2019s right of way in the neighborhood of the plaintiff. A considerable number of such fires earlier in the year' and during several previous years was proved by the plaintiff. This evidence was harmful to the defendant, for it suggested the inference that the defendant caused the said fires, although there was no evidence to exclude other causes, and it may be that some of them were not caused by the defendant. The forest, fish, and game law (Laws 1900, p. 66, c. 20) requires that every railroad company shall twice a year cut and remove from its right of way passing through \u201cforest lands, or lands subject to fires from any cause,\u201d \u201call grass, brush and other inflammable materials,\u201d- under a prescribed penalty (section 228). This evidence was pressed upon and admitted by the court as showing that the lands were \u201csubject to fires,\u201d and that therefore the defendant violated the statute in not clearing its right of way every six months., The land of the plaintiff which was burned over was, like that in the neighborhood, partly woodland, but not a forest. That word has a larg'e and significant, not an insignificant, meaning. It is not necessary to show that there have been fires on land to show that it is \u201csubject to fires.\u201d The kind of growth and material on it determines that. Although it was indisputable that the land of the plaintiff and that in his neighborhood was liable to take fire, and counsel for the defendant admitted that to be so, this evidence was nevertheless pressed in ostensibly to prove that fact. We cannot regard it as harmless. . It would naturally affect any mind unfavorably to the defendant, and may well have affected the minds of intelligent and fit jurymen in that way, however unconsciously. The cases cited by\" the plaintiff\u2019s counsel have nothing to do with the admission of such evidence, but only with the admission of evidence of the general flying of live coals and cinders from the defendant\u2019s engines, as showing that a proper spark arrester was not used, and to show that such coals and cinders flew far enough to reach the plaintiff\u2019s premises.
