The questions sought to be raised by the exceptions can best be disposed of on the coming in of that report. It cannot be said now, as matter of law, that the receivers are entitled to no compensation because the order appointing them was vacated. That vacation did not proceed upon the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to appoint receivers ex parte, but upon the ground that, having such jurisdiction, it was improvidently exercised. When all the facts are before the court, it can be determined what allowance, if any, should be made to the receivers for their compensation and expenses. The order is not drawn in the usual form, and should be modified, so as to provide that the accounts of the receivers and the objections thereto be referred to the referee named in the order appealed from, and that he report thereon, with his opinion, as well as upon the question as to what compensation and expense, if any, should be allowed to the receivers, and by whom the same should be paid, and, as so modified, will be affirmed, without costs in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Settle order on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
