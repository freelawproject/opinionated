Under these circumstances a cause of action growing out of the agent\u2019s possession of a balance due to his employer would appear to be one arising upon contract,, and not for conversion. See Parmenter v. Am. Box Co., 44 App. Div. 47, 60 N. Y. Supp. 432. We do not place our determination of the appeal on this ground, however; but it is referred to because involved upon an amendment of the complaint which must precede any recovery by this plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-18\">Error, requiring reversal of the judgment, is apparent from the denial of the motion to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency of substance; there being no allegation of fact in the pleading to support the defendant\u2019s liability to the plaintiff.. The only averment bearing upon the defendant\u2019s indebtedness, or failure to account, is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-19\">\u201cThe books of said business showed that the defendant had taken from said business and wrongfully converted to his own use the sum of $1,299.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>This obviously amounts to no more than a statement of the existence of evidence to prove a fact, and is in no sense an allegation of the fact itself, for the purpose of tendering an issue. No amendment of the complaint having been sought or directed, the motion for a dismissal upon the ground that it failed to state a cause of action should have been granted, and the judgment is therefore reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
