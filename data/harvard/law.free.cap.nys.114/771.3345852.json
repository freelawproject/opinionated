In the early part of October, 1908, the landlords instituted summary proceedings to remove the tenant for the failure to pay the rent for October, 1908. After the precept was served, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>tenant paid the rent into court, and the proceeding was marked \u201cSettled.\u201d Subsequently the landlord instituted another proceeding to remove the tenant upon the ground that the rent of the premises for the month of September, 1908, had not been paid. In this proceeding a final order was rendered in favor of the landlords. The tenant appeals from this final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The question presented for decision is whether a landlord may institute summary proceedings against a tenant because of a failure to pay a month\u2019s rent when he has already collected the rent due for the next month. Summary proceedings are statutory, and can only be instituted in the cases provided by statute. A tenant may be removed in these proceedings for the nonpayment of rent due under a lease only when he holds over \u201cwithout the permission of the landlord.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2231. In accepting payment for the October rent the landlords clearly sanctioned the action of the tenant in holding over, or remaining in possession, up to that time. Under these circumstances the tenant\u2019s possession of the premises for the month of September cannot be said to have been without the permission of the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The landlords having failed to prove that the tenant held over in September without his permission, the proceedings should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Final order reversed and proceedings dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
