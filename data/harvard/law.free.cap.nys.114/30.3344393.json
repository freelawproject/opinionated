On December. 28, 1907, an order was granted by the trial justice requiring the de-' fendant to show cause why the judgment should not be amended, by the entry \u201cnunc pro tunc\u201d of a judgment for the foreclosure of a mechanic\u2019s lien. This motion was made returnable December 31, 1907, and was granted, and on the same day a new, or so-called amended, judgment was entered in accordance with the moving party\u2019s request. From this last judgment an appeal was also taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-18\">Upon the hearing of the motion the power of the trial justice to. make the order asked for was challenged upon the ground that more than five days, to wit, 43 days; had elapsed since the entry of the original judgment; but this provision of the statute (section 254, Mu-' nicipal Court Act [Laws 1902, p. 1563, c. 580]) was ignored, and the order and a new judgment entered. The trial justice was without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>jurisdiction to make the order and judgment appealed from, and they must be reversed. <em>Lissuer </em>v.
