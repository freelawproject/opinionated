Quinn v. Quinn, 1 Thomp. &amp; C. 437; Lovell v. Quitman, 88 N. Y. 377, 42 Am. Rep. 254. It would probably have to be found on the oral evidence in this case that- the erasure and addition in the eighth clause of the will were made after the execution by the testator, but upon inspection of the will it appears that they were made by the hand of the notary who drew the will, and he testifies that he did not have possession of the will and made no changes in it after its execution. The words originally were, \u201cThe balance of my cash deposits with the Germania Savings Bank of Brooklyn, N. Y,\u201d is devoted to a burial plot, monument and funeral expenses. A line was drawn through the words \u201cthe Germania Savings\u201d and an \u201cs\u201d added to the word \u201cBank,\u201d so as to make the provision cover the deposits in all of the banks instead of in one.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">Decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Kings county, affirmed, with costs.
