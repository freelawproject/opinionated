The agreement under which the work in question was done is contained in two letters written by the plaintiff to the defendant. The first is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-24\">\u201cFrank McCormack, Mason and Plasterer, 469 Fourth Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-25\">\u201cNew York, July 3, 1908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-26\">\u201cDr. John H. O\u2019Connor\u2014Dear Sir; I will furnish labor and materials requisite to repair sidewalks in front of houses Nos. 222, 224, and 226 East 34th St. for the sum of $75. The above includes furnishing 150 sq. ft. of flagging to replace broken or missing flags.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-27\">\u201cRespt. yours, Frank McCormack.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>The second letter modified the first one somewhat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-5\">\u201cFrank McCormack, Mason and Plasterer, 469 Fourth Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-6\">\u201cNew York, July 15, 1908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-7\">\u201cDr. John H. O\u2019Connor\u2014Dear Sir: I will repair sidewalk and curb in front of Nos. 222, 224, and 226 Bast 34th, as per order of Highways Dept., so as to remove violation oh same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-8\">\u201cRespt. yours, Frank McCormack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-9\">\u201cBill will not become due until violation is removed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-10\">\u201cF. McCormack.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">The defendant contends that there was no evidence on the trial to show that the plaintiff furnished any of the materials or performed any of the labor covered by the contract. The only evidence on this point was given by the plaintiff himself, who presented his case' to the court in person, without the aid of counsel, and the contention of the defendant is that his testimony was hearsay and incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">There is no doubt that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to what his men did in repairing these sidewalks was without basis of personal knowledge on his part, and its admission would have been reversible error, if the defendant\u2019s counsel had objected thereto. But he did not. Even when, on cross-examination, it was brought out clearly that the plaintiff knew nothing personally about the work done, no motion was made to strike out his testimony. It is now too late to claim on this appeal that it was incompetent, and ought not to have been considered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-13\">The defendant further claims that the plaintiff did not prove that the violation filed against these sidewalks had been removed. The only testimony in the case on that point was that of the plaintiff that the violations were removed. The defendant objected to the admission of this testimony; but the trial justice admitted it, saying he wanted to get at the facts. The defendant did not except, when his objection was overruled, and the only inference is that he acquiesced in its coming in. This was the only testimony in the case on the point. The defendant did not dispute the assertion that the violations were removed. This testimony, uncontradicted, was sufficient proof of the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-14\">The only question of fact disputed upon the trial was whether the sidewalks had been properly repaired. At the close of the trial both parties agreed that the trial justice should make an inspection of the premises to determine this question. By deciding in favor of the plaintiff, the trial justice necessarily found that the work was substantially performed; and it is manifestly impossible for this court, under such circumstances, to reverse on the facts upon a point thus left for the trial justice to determine by a personal inspection of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-15\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
