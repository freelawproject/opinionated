The basis of the action is the contract between the Detroit Southern Railway Company and the Iron Railway Company. The defendants admit that there was such a contract, but deny that it is correctly set forth by plaintiff. He is certainly entitled to examine them to find out what the actual contract was. We think, also, that it is made apparent that defendants have knowledge as to the payment and disposition of the consideration. At least, their undisputed relation to the transaction is such as to justify the presumption that they have such knowledge, and this is sufficient. Grant v. Greene Consol. Copper Company, 118 App. Div. 850, 853, 103 N. Y. Supp. '674, 676. It may be that the order permitted too wide a scope for the examination. Upon that point we express no opinion, but, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>it did, the defendants\u2019 remedy was to move to limit the examination, but not to vacate it in toto.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">As the plaintiff is clearly entitled to some examination, the order vacating the order for examination must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant, and the motion denied, with $10 costs, without prejudice to a motion by defendants to limit the scope of the examination. A date for the examination to proceed will be fixed in the order to be entered hereon, which will be settled on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
