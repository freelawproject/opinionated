All evidence properly offered in support of this defense was excluded, for the reason, as the record would indicate, that, since the defendant could read, any transactions leading up to the signing of the agreement were incompetent. This defense of fraud was available to the party in the Municipal Court (Pelgram v. Ehrensweig, 51 Misc. Rep. 31, 99 N. Y. Supp. 913), and his ability to read what he signed did not conclude his right to assert his reliance upon the truth of representations, fraudulent in fact, whereby he was induced to sign the paper without mastering its contents (Wilcox v. Am. T. &amp; T. Co., 176 N. Y. 115, 68 N. E. 153, 98 Am. St. Rep. 650).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-20\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
