There is no power in a justice of the Municipal Court to dismiss a complaint upon this, ground. Proper practice requires that the penalty for the failure to file a bill of particulars should be dependent upon an order. If the bill of particulars is not furnished the defendant may apply to the court for an order preventing the plaintiff from giving evidence as to the matters in reference to which a bill of particulars was ordered.
