While the proof fell short of establishing an oral admission of delivery, in that the promise to pay the account was made to relate to no particular indebtedness, enough appears from the statements made in the books of the defendants\u2019 firm, and from averments of record made with their consent and in their behalf for the purposes of the settlement of the partnership accounts, to disclose an actual admission that the firm was indebted to the &lt; plaintiffs for the claim in suit. The orders of sale were proven by the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 salesman, whose recollection was properly refreshed by memoranda, and the transaction was connected with the defendants\u2019 admission of indebtedness, which admission supported a finding of the fact of delivery.
