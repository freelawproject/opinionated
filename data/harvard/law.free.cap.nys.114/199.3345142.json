The proceeding is, therefore, under the provisions of section 253, c. 908, p. 883, of the Laws of 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The relator in its petition sets forth that it made a verified statement to the respondents, acting as a board of assessors, showing the condition of its assets and liabilities for the purposes of assessment on the 1st day of May, 1908, and that such statement showed that it did not own any personal property subject to taxation, owing to the fact that its indebtedness, not contracted in the purchase of nontaxable property for the purpose of avoiding taxation, was largely in excess of the value of its personal property. The return to the writ does not deny that such statement was made, does not suggest a single reason why the statement was not entitled to be accepted as true, and, indeed, raises no issue whatever. The statement, if true, discloses a state of facts which clearly entitles the relator to the relief asked for, and all of the questions suggested by the respondents on this appeal appear to have been fully considered and disposed of in the case of People ex rel. Bhumgara Co. v. Wells, 93 App. Div. 212, 215, 87 N. Y. Supp. 543, affirmed without opinion 179 N. Y. 529, 71 N. E. 1136, and there is no occasion for continuing the discussion. See, also, People ex rel. Bishop v. Feitner, 116 App. Div. 452, 456, 101 N. Y. Supp. 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The portion of the order appealed from should be reversed, and the assessment canceled.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Order, in so far as appealed from, reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the assessment canceled. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
