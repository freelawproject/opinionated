A proceeding to have a person declared a lunatic, and his property and person put in the charge of a committee, has to be had in the judicial district in which such person resides, as is prescribed by section 2323 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Section 2343 provides that when the lunatic becomes competent again, the court must discharge the committee of his person and property, and restore his property to him. It does not specifically say the application therefor must be in such place of his residence, but that follows plainly enough from reading the whole title on the subject (sections 2320-2344); and the matter is settled by judicial decision. Also, the motion should be in the original proceeding, and not in a newly entitled proceeding, as here. Matter of Porter, 34 App. Div. 147, 54 N. Y. Supp. 654; Matter of Osborn, 74 App. Div. 113, 77 N. Y. Supp. 423; Matter of Bischoff, 80 App. Div. 326, 80 N. Y. Supp. 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The order should be reversed and the proceeding dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and proceedings dismissed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
