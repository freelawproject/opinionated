The answer was in effect a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-21\">The plaintiff proved that the defendant and his wife called at the plaintiff\u2019s store, where they were shown a woman\u2019s chinchilla coat, which, however, was too short; that the saleswoman told them that she had another coat out on approval, which she would get back and send to them at the Hotel St. Regis, where they were living, and that the price would be $985 if accepted; that on the following Monday the coat was given to one Bartholomew Sheehan, an employ\u00e9 of the plaintiff, to deliver to the defendant\u2019s wife at the St. Regis, which he testified he did a few minutes after 6 o\u2019clock that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Without objection from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to such a method of presenting the question to the court, the attorney for the defendant then offered to prove that after the delivery of the coat to his wife and its disapproval by her, and apparently on the same evening it was delivered, which would appear from the record to be Monday, a boy called for the coat and the defendant delivered it to him. This boy, as the defendant afterward learned, was named Zucker, and had been in the employment of the plaintiff previous to that evening and subsequently. The defendant\u2019s attorney also offered to prove that when the defendant made inquiries of the Sheehan boy and other employ\u00e9s of the plaintiff who had had to do with the sale and delivery of the coat as to whether there was another delivery boy in addition to Sheehan in the employment of the company, he was told that there was not, and that later some of those employ\u00e9s admitted that the reason why they did not mention the Zucker boy was because the description given by the defendant tallied with his appearance and they were afraid of getting him into trouble; a criminal proceeding having been instituted in the meantime. There was. testimony, also, on the part of one of plaintiff\u2019s employ\u00e9s, that the Zucker boy was discharged on the evening he called for and obtained the coat, but was re-employed the next morning. The testimony as to such discharge and re-employment was given by one Bolniclc, who admitted his intimacy with the Zucker boy, and that he had attended the theater with him a few nights after the delivery of the coat. No reason was given for the discharge, other than that the Zucker boy was slow, and no reason whatever was given for his re-employment the morning following. The defendant\u2019s counsel also offered to prove that the plaintiff herself by advice of counsel refused to have anything to do with the defendant\u2019s efforts to discover the boy to whom he had delivered the coat.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Upon such a state of the evidence and such an offer of proof the court ruled that the defendant \u201cmust connect Mrs. McMahon (the plaintiff) with the delivery of the coat directly or by such a state of circumstances as that the jury may infer that she was a party in obtaining this coat from Mr. Rothchild for the purpose of cheating and defrauding Mr. Rothchild,\u201d or else no defense was made out. This ruling, we think, was clearly erroneous. Upon the facts in evidence, and the further facts which the defendant\u2019s counsel offered to prove (there being no objection from the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to that method of bringing the matter before the court for a ruling), it would have' been permissible for the jury not only to discredit the remarkable story of the discharge of the Zucker boy and find that he was in fact in the employment of the plaintiff at the time he called for the coat, but to go further and find-that he called for it by her authority, conferred either directly or through her employ\u00e9s who were handling the transaction on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. , All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
