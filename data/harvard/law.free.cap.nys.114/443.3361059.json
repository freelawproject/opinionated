It seems to be undoubted that there was sufficient evidence to establish the negligence of the defendant. The nonsuit was granted on the ground that the plaintiff had not shotvn himself free from contributory negligence. Admitting that when he boarded the car he could have seen the mixer for a distance ahead, and, had he seen it, supposed that it was too near the track, and admitting that the mixer was in plain view from the time he boarded the car to the time he was thrown off the running board, yet he was not guilty of negligence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>his part as a matter of law, for the reasons, first, that he was under no legal obligation to look ahead before getting upon the car to anticipate possible obstructions in the track or near it, and, second, he had his duties to perform, which he was doing after he boarded the car, these duties required his attention elsewhere than to the track ahead, and he had a right to rely upon other users of the highway performing the duty they owed to the trolley company, and to passengers upon its cars, not dangerously to obstruct their passage. If the thing was caused by the negligence of both the defendant and the motorman, a fellow employ\u00e9 of the plaintiff, the defendant would still be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
