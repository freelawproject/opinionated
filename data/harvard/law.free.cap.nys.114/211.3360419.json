He has been granted an order for the examination of the defendants, together with their books, papers, etc., in connection with such examination, and the defendants appeal from such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">Section 870 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the \u201cdeposition of a party to an action pending in a court of record * * * may be taken at his own instance or at the instance of an adverse party, or by a coplaintiff or codefendant at any time before or during the trial as prescribed by this article.\u201d The word \u201cprescribed\u201d has a well-defined legal meaning; it means to \u201clay down, authoritatively as a guide, direction, or rule; to impose as a peremptory order; to dictate; to point ; to direct; to give as a guide, direction, or rule of action; to give law.\u201d 22 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 1179, and authorities cited in notes.Words having a precise and well-settled meaning in the jurisprudence of a country, are to be understood in the same sense when used in statutes, unless a different meaning is unmistakably intended (Perkins v. Smith, 116 N. Y. 441, 23 N. E. 21), and when a statute giving a privilege unknown to the common, law, or enlarging a privilege, authorizes something to be done in the manner therein prescribed, it by necessary implication forbids that it shall be done in any other way, even though that other way should be just as good or better. -</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">Section 872 provides that the \u201cperson desiring to take a deposition as prescribed in this article may present to a judge of the court in which the action is pending * * * an affidavit, setting forth as follows: [Here are set forth seven subdivisions telling what this affidavit shall contain.]\u201d Section 873 prescribes that the \u201cjudge to whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>such an affidavit is presented must grant an order for the examination, if an action is pending,\u201d etc. It is only upon the presentation of such an affidavit\u2014the affidavit prescribed by the previous section\u2014that the judge must grant the order, and he has no authority to grant it upon any other conditions. In the case now before us it is not contended that the affidavit presented to the judge contained the matters prescribed by section 872; but it is urged that as the notice of motion pointed out that it was to be made \u201cupon the annexed affidavit of Abraham B. Loewy, the plaintiff herein, 4and upon all the pleadings and proceedings had herein,\u201d and as the necessary facts may be gathered from such pleadings, the moving papers are sufficient, and that the defendants are technical in their objections. But a notice of motion is no part of the affidavit, the affidavit itself does not refer to the pleadings in any way, or make them a part of the same, and, in any event, the statute does not prescribe this as the way to give power and authority to the court to grant the order. It requires an affidavit setting out the facts called for by section 872, and until such an affidavit has been made and presented to the judge there is no basis whatever for the granting of an order for the examination of an adverse party.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The right of a party presenting such an affidavit, in harmony with the provisions of rule 82 of the general rules of practice, is absolute (Shonts v. Thomas, 116 App. Div. 854, 855, 102 N. Y. Supp. 324, and authorities there cited); but the modern attitude of the court upon these orders does not justify granting or sustaining them where the moving party has not complied with the conditions prescribed. The statute grants a favor, and if the party moving desires the favor he must comply with the conditions prescribed. That is the clear requirement of sections 870, 872, and 873 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and, because the plaintiff has failed to comply with the conditions, the order appealed from must be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b237-6\">GAYNOR, J. (concurring in result).</author>\n<p id=\"AYI\">The order was not obtained ex parte, but on notice of motion. The plaintiff avers in his affidavit on which the order was obtained \u201cthat the sole and only purpose of such testimony and the request of the examination of the defendants herein is to prepare for such trial\u201d; and the motion should have been denied for this. A party cannot be examined before trial for any such purpose. Diefendorf v. Penn, 125 App. Div. 651, 110 N. Y. Supp. 68. The affidavit seems to have been prepared with very little, if any, familiarity with section 872 of the Code of Civil Procedure and such of the decisions thereunder as are any longer controlling. But I am not prepared to vote to reverse the order on account of the other deficiencies in the affidavit which the appellant points out, viz.: (1) That it does not give the name and residence of the defendant\u2019s attorneys, (2) or state the nature of the judgment demanded, (3) or of the defense, i. e., answer. The complaint and answer were made part of the papers on which the motion was made, and they show all of these things much better than an affidavit could do it. And why, if it comes to that, should the affidavit state the names of the parties and of their attorneys\u2014for what purpose ? The names of the parties are in the title, and those of the attorneys on the pleadings, and the addresses of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>parties and attorneys is only so much verbiage. Section 872 prescribes it, but its provisions are taken from the old chancery rule for bills of discovery. When a party could not examine an adverse party in a common law action, but had to go into chancery with a bill of discovery, there was a reason why the bill should describe the pleadings in the common law action and give the names 'and addresses of the parties thereto and of their attorneys, but now that the examination is had in the action itself, and the entire record is present, there is no reason therefor, and the lack of such matter from the affidavit may well be excused when the order is obtained on the pleadings also. In such case it becomes mere verbiage. 'The broad meaning of the section is that such matter shall be shown before the judge to whom the application is made; and if shown by the best evidence, secondary evidence of it becomes unnecessary. Even, where property rights are at stake, a substantial compliance with a statute prescribing the steps to pursue suffices. The letter often killeth. Very little should suffice to dispense with a useless statute requirement; indeed, in the case of proceedings divesting title to property, a requirement which could in no way safeguard the rights of the owner, and is useless, is disregarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
