Brodzak and Morris M. Marx. Her contention was that she was doing business under the firm of J. M. Brodzak Company, and that Joseph M. Brodzak and Morris M, Marx were employed by her. The defendant claimed that there was a copartnership existing between Joseph M. Brodzak and Morris M. Marx, and that he never made a contract with plaintiff, or knew her at all, and that he paid said Marx, one of said partners, as representing the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-19\">The uncontradicted evidence shows that defendant did pay the claim in suit; but Marx, apparently, did not turn it over to plaintiff. The uncontradicted evidence further shows that plaintiff was an undisclosed principal, and that defendant supposed that he was dealing with plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>tiff\u2019s son and Marx as copartners doing business under the name of \"J.
