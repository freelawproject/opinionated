Real Property Law (Laws 1890, p. 612, c. 547) \u00a7 258, requires the acknowledgment of a corporate conveyance to be made by an officer authorized to execute it by the board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>directors, and prescribes its form, and section 255 provides that, where a conveyance is proved or acknowledged, the certificate of the officer taking the proof must state all matters to be done, known, or proved on the taking of such proof. <em>Held, </em>that a certificate of acknowledgment of a lease by a corporation, which did not show who the person signing -the lease was, his residence or connection with the corporation, or that he signed the lease by order of the board of directors, did not substantially comply with the statute, so that the lease was not admissible in evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b892-5\">[Ed.

The complaint alleges that the defendant was a domestic corporation, the making of the lease, the payment by the defendant of the rent reserved for the month of May, 1908, and the nonpayment of the rent sued for. The answer admits the incorporation of the defendant and the nonpayment of the rent, and denies each and every other allegation of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"AR9\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim rested wholly upon the written lease, and, to prove his right to recover, he offered the lease in evidence, which was received over the'defendant\u2019s objection. I think the admission of the lease in evidence was error, and, as that instrument is the foundation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, the judgment must be reversed. The plaintiff testified, under objection, that the paper in question was \u201cthe lease you [he] made with respect to these premises with the defendant.\u201d The lease was then admitted in evidence, and the defendant excepted. Whether or not the lease was made with the defendant corporation was the principal issue in the case, and the. plaintiff\u2019s testimony to his conclusion on that point was not enough to authorize the admission of the paper in evidence. The respondent, however, relies upon the certificate of proof of the instrument as entitling it to admission without further proof. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 937. The lease purported to be made between the plaintiff and the defendant, the latter being therein described as a corporation organized under the laws of the state of New York. It was signed, on the part of the lessee, \u201cGuarantee Dental Co., by Joseph Semon, Prest.,\u201d and it also bore the signature of a subscribing witness. The certificate of proof was in the following form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-3\">\u201cState of New York, County of New York\u2014ss.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-4\">\u201cOn this 6th day of July, 1908, before me personally came Joseph L. Zoetzl, the subscribing witness to the within instrument, with whom I am personally acquainted, who being by me duly sworn did depose and say that he resides in the city, county, and state of New York, that he knew Joseph Semon, the person described in and who executed the within instrument and that he saw the said Joseph Semon execute the same, and that the said Joseph Semon acknowledged to deponent that he executed the same and that said deponent at the same time subscribed his name as a witness thereto. Mary Sehact,\u201eCom\u2019r of Deeds, N. Y. City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">By the provisions of the Code already cited, it was necessary that the proof and certification thereof be taken and made in the manner prescribed by law in the case of a conveyance of real property. The form of a corporate acknowledgment is prescribed by section 258 of the real property law (Laws 1896, p. 612, c. 547), and by section 255 of the same act it is provided that where a conveyance is proved, as well as where it is acknowledged, the certificate of the officer taking the proof must state all the matters to be done, known or proved on the taking of such proof, and, while it has often been held that the precise form of certificate prescribed by statute need not be followed (Jackson v. Gumaer, 2 Cow. 552; Duval v. Covenhoven, 4 Wend. 561; West Point Iron Co. v. Reymert, 45 N. Y. 703; Canandarqua Academy v. McKechnie, 19 Hun, 68, 90 N. Y. 618), it is essential that the statute be substantially complied with (Irving v. Campbell, 121 N. Y. 353, 24 N. E. 821, 8 L. R. A. 620). In the present case there is obviously no such substantial compliance, for it nowhere appears from the certificate of proof who Joseph. Semon was, where he resided,, what his connection with the corporation was, if any, or that he signed the instrument by order of its board of directors. There is no evidence in the record that Joseph Semon was the .president of the defendant corporation at the\" time when the lease is claimed to have been made, so that even if we were to assume that the signature of the lease by Semon was sufficiently proved, and that the president of the corporation possessed the power to bind it by such a lease, an essential element in the plaintiff\u2019s case is still wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>The plaintiff testified, under objection, that the defendant sent him a check in payment of the rent under the lease for the month of May. The check was sent with a letter, and \u2018was signed, as plaintiff testified, \u201cJoseph Semon, President of the Dental Guarantee Company.\u201d Assuming that a signature in that form would bind the corporation, and not merely Semon individually, no attempt was made to prove that the check was in fact signed by Joseph Semon, or that Joseph Semon was in fact the president of the corporation at the time, nor was it proved that the check was ever paid. The plaintiff\u2019s conclusion that the check was sent by the corporation was obviously incompetent, and the defendant\u2019s motion to strike it out should have been granted. The argument of counsel for the respondent that there was a ratification of the lease by the corporation, resting, as it does, upon this testimony, must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
