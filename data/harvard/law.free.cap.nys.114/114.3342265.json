The defendants would not accept this, and the transaction fell through.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The defendants now contend that this case is brought within the rule laid down in Hausman v. Herdtfelder, 81 App. Div. 46, 80 N. Y. Supp. 1039, and that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. Without considering how far that case might be regarded as controlling under its own particular facts, it is sufficient to point out that in' that case the parties never came to an agreement, while in the case at bar they did. The plaintiff\u2019s proposed purchaser not only agreed to take the premises at the price and terms suggested by the defendants at the original meeting, but after the defendants had repudiated their contract and demanded an increase he was still ready, willing, and able to take the premises, with the shortage of three feet frontage, at the original terms. Under such circumstances it is not to be questioned that the brokers had earned their commissions. This was done at the original meeting of the parties, and, while it is true that the plaintiff claimed commissions on the $162,500, the verdict of the jury appears to have been only for commissions on $160,000, with interest from the date of the transaction, and this judgment should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
