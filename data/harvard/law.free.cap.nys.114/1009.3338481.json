At the time in question the defendants were the owners, and were engaged in the conduct, control, and management, of a certain apartment house or hotel known as the \u201cHotel Arlington,\u201d in the city of New York. A Mr. Lord had leased or engaged one of the apartments in the house, and on May <em>22, </em>1905, apparently while Mr. Lord was absent, the plaintiff presented a letter from him, asking the management to allow the plaintiff to occupy his apartment while the plaintiff was in the city. He was shown to the rooms and stayed there that night. About 6 o\u2019clock on the following evening the plaintiff had a conversation with the clerk in the office. The plaintiff testified that he told the clerk that he was going to Washington on the midnight train, and would like to have his things packed and downstairs ready for him when he called for them; and that the clerk called a man over and asked him to go to plaintiff\u2019s room and pack his things. The plaintiff also testified that later in the evening he saw the clerk again and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-19\">\u201cDon\u2019t forget, I am coming for these things myself on the way to the train. I will be in about 11 or 11:30.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-20\">The clerk testified that nothing was said at the first of these conversations as to what was to be done with the things after they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>packed, and that the second conversation did not occur at all. Another witness testified that the plaintiff said he would either call for the goods or send for them. The goods were packed by the man who was sent to the plaintiff\u2019s room, and they were admittedly brought downstairs and left with the clerk in the office. The defendants proved that later in the evening a messenger called at the office, saying that Mr. Booth had sent him from Rector\u2019s for the articles, which he enumerated, and they were delivered to this messenger. The messenger had not been sent by Mr. Booth, or on his behalf, and his representations and his receipt of the goods were fraudulent. The plaintiff did not pay for the privilege of occupying Mr. Lord\u2019s apartment, and the services rendered him while there were rendered gratuitously. \u25a0 The defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss having been denied, the case was left to the jury, which found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">The appellants insist that the house in question, although called a hotel, was in fact merely an apartment house, and that the defendants are therefore not chargeable with the duties or liabilities of innkeepers, and, since the bailm\u00e9nt was gratuitous, were only subject to the obligations of that relation. They claim \u2019accordingly that the trial judge committed reversible error in refusing their request to charge \u201cthat the duty resting upon the defendants was not to be guilty of gross negligence, and their only duty, being gratuitous bailees, was to observe slight care,\u201d to which the judge replied, \u201cordinary care.\u201d In order to understand the situation existing at the time the request was made, it is necessary to go back and note the instruction upon the point which the judge had given to the jury in his main charge, which was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-6\">\u201cThis was a gratuitous bailment, if it was anything; and in a gratuitous bailment the bailee is held to exercise ordinary care. Where you give anything to a person, and ask him to deliver it to somebody, without compensation, that is a gratuitous bailment, and the bailee is held to exercise ordinary care. Where.you pay a person a sum of money for delivering anything to another, then that is a bailment for hire; and a bailee for hire is bound to exercise a higher degree of care than is a bailee of a gratuitous bailment. If you reach that part of the case, you will ask yourselves whether, in view of all the circumstances, the clerk exercised reasonable care in the protection of this property. In considering that question you will take into consideration the surrounding circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">The defendants urge that it is the established law of this state that a gratuitous bailee is liable only in the event of gross negligence. It is mot necessary to deny that claim as an abstract proposition. From the earliest times the writers of text-books and commentaries on the law, and to some extent the courts, have employed the terms \u201cslight,\u201d \u201cordinary,\u201d an.d \u201cgross\u201d negligence; but, however useful those expressions may have been for the purposes of academic discussion, they have been found wanting, and have broken down when an attempt was made to make use of them practically before juries, and many judges have gone to the extent- of questioning whether they served any useful purpose whatever. In Perkins v. New York Central Railroad Company, 24 N. Y. 196, at page 207, 82 Am. Dec. 281, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>\u201cThe difficulty of defining gross negligence, and the intrinsic uncertainty pertaining to the question as one of law, and the utter impracticability of establishing any precise rule on the subject, renders it unsafe to base any legal decision on distinctions of the degrees of negligence. Certainly before cases are made to turn upon the verdict of juries upon any such distinction, the judges should be able to define with some precision what they mean by gross negligence, slight negligence, and ordinary negligence. It will be seen, on examining the many cases reported, where the question has arisen, that this has been found utterly impracticable by the judges, when called upon to instruct &gt; juries on the question, and also when called on to declare the law more carefully in bank. Negligence is essentially always a question of fact, and every case depends necessarily upon its own particular circumstances. _ What is negligence in a given case may easily be affirmed by a jury; but in what degree the negligence consists, in any scale of classification of degrees of negligence, is not so easily determined\u2014will ordinarily be' a inatter of pure speculation and of no practical consequence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">In Hinton v. Dibbin, 2 Q. B. 661, 42 English Common Law Reports, 847, 854, it was said by Lord Denman, C. J., in delivering the judgment of the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-6\">\u201cIt may well be doubted whether between gross negligence and negligence merely any intelligible distinction exists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">In The New World et al. v. King, 16 How. 469, 474, 14 L. Ed. 1019, it was also said that it might be doubted whether the terms \u201cslight,\u201d \u201cordinary,\u201d and \u201cgross\u201d negligence could be usefully applied in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">In First National Bank v. Ocean National Bank, 60 N. Y. 278, at page 295, 19 Am. Rep. 181, the court used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-9\">\u201cWhat constitutes gross negligence\u2014that is, such want of care as would charge a gratuitous bailee for loss\u2014must depend very much upon the circumstances to which the term may be applied. It has been defined to be the want of that ordinary diligence and care which a usually prudent man takes of his own property of the like description\u201d\u2014citing Gibbin v. McMullen, L. R. 2 P. C. Cases, 318, 327.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">The language of Judge Rapallo in Mark et al. v. Hudson River Bridge Co., 103 N. Y. 28, 34, 8 N. E. 243, 244, is especially applicable to the present case, being as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-11\">\u201cIt is true that the judge declined, in his instructions to the jury, to use the term \u2018.gross negligence\u2019 in explaining to them the degree of negligence necessary, under the circumstances of the case, to render the defendant liable. But, without using that term, he charged them very fully on the point, and described to them, in his own language, what kind of negligence was necessary to charge them with damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-12\">In the record before us the learned trial judge had told the jury that a bailee for hire is bound to exercise a higher degree of care than is a bailee of a gratuitous bailment, and he further left it for the jury to determine whether, \u201cin view of all the circumstances, the clerk exercised reasonable care in the protection of this property,\u201d emphasizing this portion of the charge by adding the words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-13\">\u201cIn considering that question you will take into consideration the surrounding circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-14\">The charge, correctly interpreted, and as it must be presumed the jury understood it, left it to them to determine, in view of all the circumstances, whether reasonable care was exercised; the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>stances referred to including the fact that the defendants were gratuitous bailees and that they were not bound to as high a degree of care as they would have been if they had received compensation for their services. It is true that the judge had said that the defendants were held to the exercise of ordinary care, and subsequently refused to use the expressions \u201cgross negligence\u201d and \u201cslight care\u201d; but, so long as he defined correctly and in intelligible terms to the jury the true measure of the defendants\u2019 liability, I do not think any harm, but good, rather, resulted from his refusal to use the terms requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">There is high authority for the form of charge employed. In Preston v. Prather, 137 U. S. 604, 11 Sup. Ct. 162, 34 L. Ed. 788, it was said:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-6\">\u201cThe care usually and generally deemed necessary in the community for the security of similar property under like conditions would be required of the bailee in such cases, but nothing more. The general doctrine, as stated by text-writers and in judicial decisions, is that gratuitous bailees of another\u2019s property are not responsible for its loss unless guilty of gross negligence in its keeping. But gross negligence in such cases is nothing more than a failure to bestow the care which the property in its situation demands. The omission of the reasonable care required is the negligence which creates the liability; and whether this existed is a question of fact for the jury to determine, or by the court where a jury is waived.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">Looking at the whole charge, and judging it from its whole scope, as should be done, of course (Losee v. Buchanan, 51 N. Y. 476, 492, 10 Am. Rep. 623), I am of the opinion that a correct statement of the defendants\u2019 liability was made to the jury, and that no useful purpose would have been served by adding the request made by the defendants, but, on the contrary, that the jury might easily have been confused and misled by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">I find nothing in Hoffman v. Roessle, 39 Mise. Rep. 787, 81 N. Y. Supp. 291, inconsistent with the views above expressed. In that case there was no jury, and there was no question of the correctness of instructions to the jury, but merely a question whether upon all the facts the decision of the trial justice was warranted; the court observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-9\">\u201cThe trial justice has found that the plaintiff has not shown gross negligence on the defendants\u2019 part, and that finding is not unwarranted by the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
