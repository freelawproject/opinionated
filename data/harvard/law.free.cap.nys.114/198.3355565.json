The reference in the terms of sale to occupancy by monthly tenants imported no more than the duration of possession, and in no way involved notice of a claim by the life tenant to rents received in advance for the whole of any month. In the absence of an implied agreement on the purchaser\u2019s part for the retention of rents by the party in possession, the statute measured the rights of the parties by an actual apportionment (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2720), and the plaintiff\u2019s recovery is well supported by authority (Cowen v. Arnold, 58 Hun, 437, 12 N. Y. Supp. 601; Betts v. Betts, 4 Abb. N. C. 317).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
