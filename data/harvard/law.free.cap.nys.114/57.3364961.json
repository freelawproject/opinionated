Agency in the person who gave the order to the representative of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was shown by prior dealings, with ratification; and the fact of a delivery in accordance with the contract to the designated consignee at the defendant\u2019s order is supported by evidence which, if somewhat general in character, is rendered sufficient by the inference of acceptance to be drawn from the defendant\u2019s payments upon account of the order, after delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
