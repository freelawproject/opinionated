Section 20 of the agricultural law provides, inter alia, that the term \u201cadulterated milk\u201d means milk containing more than 88 per centum of water or fluids or less than 12 per centum of milk solids. Laws 1893, p. 660, c. 338, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">It is undisputed that duplicate samples were taken as prescribed by section 12 of the agricultural law. It is likewise .undisputed that the samples so taken were both found, on analysis, to contain more than 88 per centum of water and less than 12 per centum of milk solids. No evidence was offered on behalf of the defendants; nevertheless the Municipal Court gave judgment for the defendants. Upon the undisputed evidence, the plaintiff was entitled to judgment, as it was established that the milk was adulterated within, the meaning of the statute, and it was conceded that it was offered and exposed for sale by the defendants. It may be that the Municipal Court justice decided the case on the supposition that the milk, as given by the cow, contained too much water; for a suggestion of that possibility is found in the cross-examination of the chemist called by the plaintiff. But that is not a defense. The intent of the defendants is not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The judgment is reversed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
