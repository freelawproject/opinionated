She mistook the elevator door for that of the storeroom, which was next to it; both opening off a common hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Without passing upon the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence\u2014 and it is doubtful whether any has been shown\u2014plaintiff failed to show freedom from contributory negligence. She did not know of the existence of the elevator shaft; but, even if she did, such knowledge would not have prevented the accident, because she did not intentionally open the elevator door, but supposed she was opening the door of the storeroom. So warning or knowledge of the existence of the elevator shaft has nothing to do with the case. If there was clear light in the hall, there would be no doubt of her contributory negligence. But there is some testimony as to the\" absence of light. The darker it was, the more cautious she should have been. It is well settled that one who gropes about in a dark place, opens a wrong door, and through such mistake receives injury, may not recover. Piper v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 156 N.
