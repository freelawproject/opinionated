They are not required to file a map thereof; that-requirement is put upon the commissioners of highways in making and filing their order laying out the highway, which comes at the end (section 81). Nor are they required to incorporate a description thereof in their certificate. The application to the highway commissioners (section 82) to lay out a highway must necessarily describe the proposed highway, and the petition to the County Court for the appointment of commissioners to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>determine upon the necessity, etc., must also necessarily do the same in order that it may appear what proposed highway is before the court. In the present case the description is in the application to the highway commissioners, the petition, the notice of presentation thereof to the court, the order appointing the commissioners, and their certificate of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The starting point is fixed with precision, and not \u201cabout,\" as is claimed. The words of the d\u00e9scription are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">_ \u201cCommencing at a point in the westerly side of a. highway known as Higbie\u2019s Lane, <em>the middle line of said proposed highway being about S00 feet southerly (measured along the westerly side of Higbie\u2019s Lame) from the land of' the Long Island Railroad Company on which the trade of the Montaulc Division of said railroad is laid, </em>and being 85 feet southerly from the southeast corner of land of Mrs. Brimley; and from said point of beginning running,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The words I have italicised are obviously surplusage and of no effect, and if they be disregarded it will be seen that the starting point is fixed with precision. The contention that the proposed highway is not authorized by law because it does not terminate in another highway, or is a cul de sac, is without support in law. It runs to the center .of a creek which divides the town from another town. Highways often terminate in open fields. It would be quite impossible to open highways gradually if every one had to terminate in an existing highway. The point that the commissioners acted on an erroneous principle in assessing the damages is unfounded. No such thing appears in the record. The order.appealed from is not reviewable in respect of the necessity of the proposed highway or of the amount of damages (section 89).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Final order of the County Court of Suffolk county affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
