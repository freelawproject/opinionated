Y. Supp. 40) as to the interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>tion of the written agreement. The discretion of the justice was properly exercised in opening the default, but a mistake was made in denying the motion for a retaxation of costs. There is no authority in the taxing officer to allow costs to the defendant; except where the party has appeared by an attorney at law, who filed a verified pleading, or a written notice of appearance (section 332, Municipal Court Act [Laws 1902, p. 1585, c. 580]), and.as the defendant did not file a verified pleading and neglected to file a written notice of appearance, it follows that the costs were improperly taxed, and plaintiff\u2019s motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The judgment of the Municipal Court and order opening the default are affirmed, without costs. The order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a retaxation is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
