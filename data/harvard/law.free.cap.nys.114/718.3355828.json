The motion was made under subdivision 5 of section 3228 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">The plaintiff laid the venue in the Supreme Court in the county of Queens, and there the action was tried. But the defendant shows that it was served personally with process in the county of Kings, and its contention is that, as the action could have been tried in the County Court of Kings county save for the amount of the claim, the said statute applies. We held in Waldstreicher v. Solomon, 127 App. Div. 364, 111 N. Y. Supp. 500, that each county stands separate in the application of the statute. I see no reason for rescission. I think that the word \u201ctriable,\u201d as used in this statute, means the place of trial as indicated by the venue; in other words, this action was triable in the county of Queens. Chubbuck v. Morrison, 6 How. Prac. 367; Askins v. Hearns, 3 Abb. Prac. 184; Bangs v. Selden, 13 How. Prac. 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">The order must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
