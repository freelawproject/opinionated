L. [Ter. Ed] c. 214, \u00a7 3 [1]) to secure repossession of household <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>furniture sold by the plaintiff to the defendant on conditional sale. The judge found that certain payments by the defendant totalling $35, in addition to other payments made at various times, should be deducted from the purchase price, and that the plaintiff had not given a true itemized account to the defendant. He dismissed the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">It is provided by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 255, \u00a7 13C, inserted by St. 1939, c. 509, \u00a7 2, that at least thirty days before taking possession of household furniture or effects for default of the vendee in his payments the vendor shall demand in writing of the vendee or other person in charge of said furniture or effects \u201cthe balance then due\u201d and shall furnish him \u201can itemized statement of the account showing the amount due thereon.\u201d This contemplates a statement of the account showing the <em>true </em>amount due thereon after all just credits have been given. A statement that ignores payments that in fact have been made on account does not show \u201cthe amount due thereon,\u201d as required by the statute. It shows as due an amount different from and greater than \u201cthe amount due thereon.\u201d The purpose of requiring the furnishing of the statement is to enable the vendee to comply intelligently with the demand for \u201cthe balance then due\u201d and so to save his furniture, and also no doubt to furnish him the information necessary to enable him to redeem under \u00a7 11. These purposes can seldom be accomplished by a statement that overcharges the vendee. If there can ever be cases under this statute where an overcharge made in good faith and proved to have done no harm does not vitiate the statement, the present case has not been shown to be of that type. Compare <em>Magnifico </em>v. <em>Nicholson, </em>264 Mass. 519, and cases cited, relating to a somewhat similar statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">When the plaintiff brought suit he had failed to complete his cause of action in that he had failed to perform a condition precedent to the exercise of his right of repossession, and the bill was rightly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
