L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 94, \u00a7 150, alleging that the defendant \u201cdid sell . . . for food certain tainted, corrupt, decayed and unwholesome hamburg, said hamburg not being then and there packed in such a container that upon reasonable inspection the condition of the contents thereof could not be ascertained, without making the condition of said hamburg fully known ta\u201d the buyer. The defendant moved to quash the complaint on the ground that it failed to allege that the defendant had knowledge that the hamburg was decayed or unwholesome. The trial judge denied the motion, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The relevant statute originated in St. 1784, c. 50. Under that statute a defendant, to be guilty, must have sold the provisions \u201cknowing the same\u201d to be unwholesome. In <em>Hemmenway </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>1 Pick. 524, 526, this court said that the \u201cSt. 1784, c. 50, against selling unwholesome provisions, requires a knowledge on the part of the vendor which would not be inferred from the mere fact that the provisions were unwholesome.\u201d In Rev. Sts. (1836) c. 131, \u00a7 1, the language was changed to require the defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d to sell the unwholesome provisions. But the meaning remained the same. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>12 Cush. 499. Gen. Sts. (1860) c. 166, \u00a7 1. Pub. Sts. (1882) c. 58, \u00a7 5. R. L. (1902) c. 56, \u00a7 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">By St. 1913, c. 687, the statute was redrafted into substantially the present form, and the word \u201cknowingly\u201d was omitted. We think the intention was to punish the sale of unwholesome provisions, subject to the statutory exception, without regard to the question whether the seller knew the provisions to be unwholesome or not. The statute was thus interpreted, correctly as we think, in <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>294 Mass. 21, 24, and <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Union News Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>295 Mass. 350, 354, 355. After the amendment of 1913 the offence under the statute became one in which guilty knowledge need not be alleged or proved. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mixer, </em>207 Mass. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
