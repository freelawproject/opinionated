The word \u201cJays\u201d has acquired a secondary meaning as descriptive of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">The defendant has started in the same business in Northampton, using the name \u201cJay\u2019s,\u201d and signs like those of the plaintiff. The judge found that \u201cthe similarity of names, of the signs, and of the nature of the businesses, is such that a reasonable probability exists that purchasers using ordinary care will be induced to trade with the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>fendant in the belief that its [sfc] store is conducted by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">A final decree was entered, restraining the defendant from using the word \u201cJay\u2019s\u201d in connection with her business \u201cwithout making amendments thereto or changes therein to obviate any confusion in the minds of the public between the name so used as changed and that of the plaintiff.\u201d The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In this case the defendant did not use her own name, or any name to which she had any natural right, as in <em>Cain\u2019s Lobster Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>312 Mass. 512. As long as the defendant uses the name in question in competition with the plaintiff, no amendment or change in the name will effectively prevent confusion on the part of some portion of the public. As Knowlton, J., said in <em>Samuels </em>v. <em>Spitzer, </em>177 Mass. 226, 227, \u201cIt was easy to choose a satisfactory name unlike the plaintiffs\u2019, and to conduct the business in such a way as to leave the plaintiffs the whole benefit of such reputation as they had gained in the community.\u201d See also <em>General Fruit Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Markarian, </em>300 Mass. 90, 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The final decree is reversed. A new final decree is to be entered, with costs to the plaintiff, perpetually restraining the defendant and her agents, servants and attorneys, from using the name Jay\u2019s or Jays, or any word or words so nearly resembling such name as to be likely to be mistaken therefor, in the business of selling women\u2019s and misses\u2019 wearing apparel at retail.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
