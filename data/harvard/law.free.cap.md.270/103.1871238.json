Smith, J., dissents and filed a dissenting opinion at page 123 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">We are presented here with a constitutional challenge to Maryland.Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 43, \u00a7 266A (c) (4) (iv)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> resulting from an equity suit brought by appellees in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City. It subsequently became an action at law upon being transferred to the Superior Court of Baltimore City in consequence of a demurrer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>equity bill. Following a trial on the merits, in the course of which the parties presented considerable evidence, the court (Carter, J.) wrote a thoroughly-considered opinion, and declared the statute unconstitutional as a violation of appellees\u2019 due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Appellees, who are three corporations operating seven retail stores in Maryland, instituted the action. Five of these outlets trade under the name o\u00ed Sav-A-Lot and are essentially variety stores that do not contain pharmacy departments. The other two stores, known as Leader Drugs, operate pharmacies. The dispute between the parties began when appellant (the Board) refused to sanction the use of the name, \"Sav-A-Lot Drugs\u201d for appellees\u2019 \u201cprescription-type drug store[s]\u201d because of the prohibition enunciated in Art. 43, ^ 266A (0(4) (iv). The controversy has now ripened into a broader issue \u2014 whether appellees may advertise prescription drug prices, as well as the terms proscribed by the statute that connote price discounts on such drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Briefly summarized, the evidence in the trial court showed the following: Dr. Sidney Wolf, a specialist in internal medicine, a former staff member at the National Institutes of Health, and currently affiliated with an organization known as \"Health Research Group.\u201d testified to the \u201cgreat variation in [prescription drug] prices[sj from store to store within a given city.\u201d This testimony, which has neither been contradicted below nor is seriously challenged here, was amply supported by documentary evidence admitted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">This witness also pointed out that senior citizens, many of whom are on \u201cmaintenance\u201d drugs, are prevented from \u201cshopping\u201d for the lowest available prices by the statutory proscription against advertising. He testified that this is a matter of great concern for the elderly, the sick, and the economically disadvantaged, for it is such persons who are less mobile and therefore less able to survey drug stores for comparative prices. For these reasons, according to the witness, the consumer\u2019s present dilemma of identifying those stores which offer the lowest prices for prescription <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>drugs would be solved by removing the prohibition against prescription drug advertising. This testimony was supported, in part, by Father Donald Wilson, whose parish church operates an apartment house for senior citizens in the City of Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">To counter this evidence, appellant produced Norman J. Levin, a pharmacist in Baltimore County and President of the Maryland Board of Pharmacy. He presented a number of reasons why in his opinion, and that of the entire Board, the statute was necessary. We shall allude to them later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In this Court, appellant renews its argument that the statute does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and urges upon us that it is a reasonable exercise of the state\u2019s police power. Thus, the question we must answer is whether this statute, as an exercise of the state\u2019s police power, provides a real and substantial relation to the public health, morals, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state, <em>Liggett Co. v. Baldridge, </em>278 U. S. 105, 111-12, 49 S. Ct. 57, 73 L. Ed. 204 (1928); <em>Stevens v. City of Salisbury, </em>240 Md. 556, 564, 214 A. 2d 775 (1965); <em>Davis v. State, </em>183 Md. 385, 393, 37 A. 2d 880 (1944); <em>Dasch v. Jackson, </em>170 Md. 251, 263, 183 A. 534 (1936). The wisdom or expediency of a law adopted in the exercise of the police power of the state is not subject to judicial review, and such a statute will not be held void if there are any considerations relating to the public welfare by which it can be supported, <em>Salisbury Beauty Schools v. St. Bd., </em>268 Md. 32, 48, 300 A. 2d 367 (1973); <em>Davis v. State, supra, </em>at 397; <em>State v. Seney Company, </em>134 Md. 437, 448, 107 A. 189 (1919). Hence, this statute carries with it a strong presumption of constitutionality, <em>Gino\u2019s v. Baltimore City, </em>250 Md. 621, 636, 244 A. 2d 218 (1968); <em>Deems v. Western Maryland Ry., </em>247 Md. 95, 102, 231 A. 2d 514 (1967); <em>Magruder v. Hall of Rec\u2019ds Comm\u2019n, </em>221 Md. 1, 6, 155 A. 2d 899 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Nevertheless, if a statute purporting to have been enacted to protect the public morals or the public safety has no real or substantial relation to those objects or is a palpable invasion of rights secured by fundamental law, it is our duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>to so adjudge and thereby give effect to the Constitution, <em>Mugler v. Kansas, </em>123 U. S. 623, 661, 8 S. Ct. 273, 31 L. Ed. 205 (1887); <em>Hiller v. State, </em>124 Md. 385, 391, 92 A. 842 (1914); <em>State v. Hyman, </em>98 Md. 596, 615, 57 A. 6 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Statutes similar to that under attack here have been upheld on constitutional grounds, <em>Patterson Drug Company v. Kingery, </em>305 F. Supp. 821 (W.D. Va. 1969); <em>Supermarkets Gen. Corp. v. Sills, </em>93 N. J. Super. 326, 225 A. 2d 728 (1966). Other states have, however, declared such statutes unconstitutional, <em>Florida Board of Pharmacy v. Webb\u2019s City, Inc., </em>219 So. 2d 681 (Fla. 1969); <em>Stadnik v. Shell\u2019s City, Inc., </em>140 So. 2d 871 (Fla. 1962); <em>Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy v. Pastor, </em>441 Pa. 186, 272 A. 2d 487 (1971), 44 A.L.R.3d 1290. Other states have resolved analogous conflicts relying upon other grounds, <em>see West Romaine Corp. v. California State Board of Pharmacy, </em>266 Cal. App. 2d 901, 72 Cal. Rptr. 569 (1968); <em>Oregon Newspaper Publishers </em>Ass\u2019n <em>v. Peterson, </em>244 Ore. 116, 415 P. 2d 21 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In <em>Patterson Drug Company v. Kingery, supra, </em>a three-judge federal court had before it a Virginia statute which subjected any pharmacist to a charge of unprofessional conduct who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">\u201cissues, publishes, advertises or promotes, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, any amount, price, fee, premium, discount, rebate or credit terms for professional services or for drugs containing narcotics or for any drugs which may be dispensed only by prescription.\u201d 305 F. Supp. at 823.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Relying principally upon the cases of <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., </em>348 U. S. 483, 75 S. Ct. 461, 99 L. Ed. 563 (1955) and <em>Semler v. Dental Examiners, </em>294 U. S. 608, 55 S. Ct. 570, 79 L. Ed. 1086 (1935) for the rationale that the practice of pharmacy is a professional pursuit \u2014 and thus \u201csubject to regulation and control in the public interest\u201d \u2014 the federal court in Virginia sustained the prohibition against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>advertising the retail prices of prescription drugs as a constitutional exercise of the state\u2019s police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In <em>Supermarkets, supra, </em>the New Jersey court upheld a state law which declared as grossly unprofessional conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">\u201cThe promotion, direct or indirect, by any means, in any form and through any media of the prices for prescription drugs and narcotics or fees or for services relating thereto or any reference to the price of said drugs or prescriptions whether specifically or as a percentile of prevailing prices or by the use of the terms \u2018cut rate,\u2019 \u2018discount,\u2019 \u2018bargain,\u2019 or terms of similar connotation\u201d; 225 A. 2d at 732.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In part, the court applied the same reasoning as the <em>Kingery </em>court, and concluded that the plaintiffs had not rebutted the \u201cstrong presumption of constitutionality\u201d with which the statute was cloaked.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">In <em>Stadnik v. Shell\u2019s City, Inc., supra, </em>the Florida Supreme Court affirmed a lower court ruling which struck down as unconstitutional a regulatory measure promulgated by the State Board of Pharmacy against advertising \u201c. . . the name or price of tranquilizing drugs or antibiotics or other drugs which can be purchased and dispensed only by means of a prescription from a physician,\u201d 140 So. 2d at 872. There, as in the Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases cited above, the court was,met by a contention that the statute was a. reasonable exercise of the state\u2019s police power. It rejected that argument, however, holding that there was \u201cno reasonable justification for such an administrative intrusion on private rights when the regulation is so completely lacking in public benefit,\u201d 140 So. 2d at 875. Later, upon the authority of <em>Stadnik, </em>the Florida Supreme Court, in <em>Florida Board of Pharmacy v. Webb\u2019s City, Inc., supra, </em>declared unconstitutional a statute which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">\u201cNo pharmacist, owner or employee of a retail drug establishment shall use any communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>media to promote or advertise the use or sale of any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">\u201c(f) Any drugs which require a prescription.\u201d 219 So. 2d at 681 (emphasis omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In <em>Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy v. Pastor, supra, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court considered the constitutionality <em>vel non </em>of a statute which made it unlawful for a pharmacist to advertise the prices of dangerous or narcotic drugs. Elsewhere the statute defined as \u201cdangerous\u201d all drugs which can be dispensed only with a physician\u2019s prescription. The court found that the statute did not bear a \u201csubstantial relation to any of the objects\u201d to which it was directed, 272 A. 2d at 494; thus it held the statute unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited the advertising of \u201cdangerous drugs,\u201d 272 A. 2d at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The Board here, in arguing for the constitutionality of the statute, advances these grounds to support its position:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">(1) That the advertising of drug prices will increase the demand for drugs, thereby creating an atmosphere conducive to drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">(2) By encouraging consumers to \u201cshop around,\u201d the advertising of drug prices will make it unlikely that they will patronize only one pharmacy. Thus, the pharmacist will no longer be in a position to \u201cmonitor\u201d prescriptions to determine whether the consumer is using antagonistic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">(3) That, since pharmacy is a profession which affects the public health and welfare, the state, in the exercise of its police power, may prohibit such advertising to prevent rivalry demeaning to the profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">(4) That advertising of drug prices will result in increased pressure on physicians to prescribe larger quantities than are medically indicated to enable their patients to take advantage of quantity discounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">The first reason asserted by the Board in defense of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>statute is that the advertising of drug prices will increase the demand for dangerous drugs. Undoubtedly, the answer to this argument is found in the comprehensive regulatory scheme reflected by other provisions of the Maryland Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the face of a contention similar to that being made here, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in <em>Pastor, supra, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">\u201cWe must therefore conclude that because of the highly regulated structure of the pharmaceutical profession, and the fact that the consumer cannot choose his purchases, it would appear most unlikely that advertising the prices of retail prescription drugs would, or could, have any impact on the demand or consumption of such drugs. ...\u201d 272 A. 2d at 493.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">We think that conclusion is apposite here.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The second argument made by the Board is that advertising of drug prices will encourage consumers to \u201cshop around,\u201d thus preventing pharmacists from monitoring prescriptions. In so contending, the Board derives only limited support from the two cases upon which it relies most heavily, <em>Patterson Drug Company v. Kingery </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>Supermarkets Gen. Corp. v. Sills, </em>both <em>supra. </em>With respect to a similar claim, the court said in <em>Kingery:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">\u201c ... Some pharmacists, probably a minority, systematically monitor prescriptions by family records to avoid allergic reactions or the simultaneous use of antagonistic drugs, of which the patient\u2019s doctor may not be aware. Although monitoring is <em>not completely effective </em>because of the mobility of customers and the availability of nonprescription drugs which may be antagonistic, it is a benefit to the public.\u201d 305 F. Supp. at 824 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">And in <em>Supermarkets, supra, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzE\">\u201cIt was urged that the patient\u2019s records are reviewed by the pharmacist only for the purpose of checking prices on prescriptions previously filled for the customer. Perhaps that may be the practice of many pharmacists, but there may be <em>infrequent </em>instances where a pharmacist does \u2018monitor\u2019 the prescription for the purpose of possibly detecting the prescription of an antagonistic drug. <em>Infrequent </em>as such occasions may be, they may justify the enactment of [the statute].\u201d 225 A. 2d at 737 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In noting the restraint that is reflected in those two statements, we might observe that \u201cmonitoring\u201d is one of the two reasons upon which each of those cases rested its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Again, we think the correct answer to this argument is found in <em>Pastor, supra. </em>There the court aptly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">\u201cWe do not believe, however, that this asserted reason [monitoring] is sufficient to sustain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>prohibition. The Commonwealth has produced no evidence to indicate the extent, if any, to which pharmacists monitor prescriptions, and even the courts which have accepted this rationale have admitted that monitoring is \u2018infrequent\u2019 and <em>\u2018not completely effective.\u2019 </em>Further, it is primarily the physician\u2019s duty to be certain that he is not prescribing drugs antagonistic to those already being taken by his patient. Indeed, it would appear that if the Legislature was in fact concerned about the prescribing of antagonistic drugs, it wotild have chosen a route more direct than simply prohibiting the advertising of their prices. . . .\u201d 272 A. 2d at 493 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Similarly, here no evidence was produced \u201cto indicate the extent, if any, to which pharmacists monitor prescriptions.\u201d We strongly suspect that monitoring, which may have been common in the past, hardly exists today. The President of the Board disclosed unfamiliarity with this term when first asked to define it. Given the diversification of modern retailing practices and the mobility of our society, it is quite likely that the physician is better able to monitor the possible ingestion of antagonistic drugs than the pharmacist. Therefore, in this context, we too are unpersuaded that the legislative means employed have a \u201creal or substantial relation\u201d to the objects for which they are allegedly designed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The Board next argues that since pharmacy is a profession which affects the public health and welfare, the state may prohibit practices that tend to result in unseemly advertising, and possibly the lowering of professional standards. Unquestionably, this is the major premise upon which <em>Kingery </em>and <em>Supermarkets, </em>both <em>supra, </em>were decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The Board likens the pharmacist\u2019s position to that of physicians, <em>Davis v. State, supra, </em>opthalmologists, optometrists, and opticians, <em>Ullom v. Boehm, </em>392 Pa. 643, 142 A. 2d 19 (1958); <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., supra, </em>and dentists, <em>Semler v. Dental Examiners, supra. </em>It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>says that its position is similar to the beauty school operators in <em>Salisbury Beauty Schools v. St. Bd., supra, </em>where we upheld the constitutionality of the statutory prohibition against charging prices for the clinical work performed by students in beauty schools. The analogy does not apply here, since beauty schools, unlike pharmacies, are not engaged in a business relationship with the consumer. In <em>Salisbury, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">\u201c . . . The schools are not engaged in the <em>business_ </em>of supplying services to the public, but are engaged in qualifying students to become practitioners of the art. . . .\u201d 268 Md. at 59 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">As we shall observe later, pharmacies are predominately-engaged in a retailing enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Furthermore, as Judge Carter noted in the court below, appellant\u2019s comparison of the professional aspects of pharmacy and medicine, <em>Davis v. State, supra, </em>is inapposite. The Courts in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Semler, supra, </em>were confronted with the effect upon a gullible public of advertising professional services. The Court in <em>Davis </em>was concerned that the physician would use \u201cknowledge of mass psychology and skill in appealing to the emotions and hopes of the uninformed and credulous,\u201d 183 Md. at 394. Likewise, in <em>Semler, supra, </em>the Supreme Court was concerned with the use of \u201cadvertising methods \u2018to lure the credulous and ignorant members of the public to [dentists\u2019] offices for the purpose of fleecing them,\u2019 \u201d 294 U. S. at 612. Clearly, the thrust of these cases was the protection of an unwitting public against the lure of misleading advertising of professional <em>services. </em>These arguments would be more appropriately advanced in support of Code Art. 43, \u00a7 266A (c) (4) (v) which prohibits pharmacists from advertising their \u201cprofessional superiority.\u201d They are unpersuasive here. When describing the quality of services, advertising may be prone to distort; when listing definite prices or discounts, it serves as a tool to educate rather than to deceive. Thus, pharmacists may be distinguished from the other \u2018\"professions\u201d discussed above, in that price advertising of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>retail drugs casts no unfavorable reflection on the professional aspect of pharmacy by deceiving the public about the type of services available.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Furthermore, none of the other professions is as involved with retailing as is pharmacy. The effort on the part of the Board to demonstrate the professional aspects of pharmacy by its sole witness, Mr. Levin, President of the Board, failed completely. His testimony is replete with references to pharmacy\u2019s retail characteristics. In describing how advertising draws the consumer into the pharmacy, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201cOnce he passes the door, he is exposed and he is vulnerable to purchase anything else in the store. <em>And this is the whole retail game, you might say, today. This is what the retail business is. It is a method of advertising items to the public at prices that will induce them to come into the place to buy all of the other things you are trying to sell them, </em>and that is what certain deceitful, lecherous people want to do with the prescription business.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Ironically, Mr. Levin admits that he, himself, has an advertising program in conjunction with a group of other proprietors, and said that \u201c[w]e have a pharmacy that does a pretty fine <em>business </em>in prescriptions.\u201d (emphasis added). Later, he also admitted that \u201cunfortunately\u201d druggists are essentially retailers. Furthermore, he agreed that on a national average, only 10% of prescriptions are compounded, <em>see also, Supermarkets Gen. Corp. v. Sills, supra, </em>at 735; but that this was not the case in his store. No evidence was submitted to show that this statistic is not representative of the State of Maryland. Mr. Levin also says he has not noticed any harm as a result of posting the prices of drugs as required by the National Economic Stabilization Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Mr. Levin\u2019s testimony underscores the fact that pharmacy is rapidly evolving into almost exclusively a retail business where prescription drugs constitute only about 11% of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>sales volume of chain drug stores;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and as noted above, only 10% of prescription drugs are compounded. The retail aspects of pharmaceutical business were also noted in a study prepared by the Department of Justice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Likewise, the Internal Revenue Services\u2019s \u201cPosting Requirements for Retailers of Prescription Drugs\u201d notes:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">\u201cThe dispensing of prescription drugs is considered to be a <em>retail activity, </em>and therefore, it is covered by Price Commission regulations requiring that base prices be posted. The fact that a <em>professional pharmacist is employed to dispense drugs is incidental to the sale of those drugs and does not alter the retail nature of the transaction.\" </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">When the regulation of pharmacy extends beyond the qualifications of pharmacists and the safety of the products, and encompasses the commercial aspects of the profession, serious questions of constitutional validity arise, <em>Milligan v. Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>348 Mass. 491, 204 N.E.2d 504, 510 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\"><em>Supermarkets, supra, </em>the case cited by the Board as its leading authority, supports our reasoning and lends a final <em>coup de grace </em>to the arguments made by appellants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">\u201cThe field of pharmacy is an admixture of both professional and commercial functions. The pharmacist, while practicing a profession by compounding drugs and rendering the incidental services to which reference has already been made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>also is engaged in a commercial venture requiring merchandising and marketing techniques. This dichotomy has been recognized in other professions, with the result that legislation regulating the commercial aspects thereof has not been sustained', (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">\u201cAdditionally, though statutory proscription of advertising for professional services has been upheld, it may be observed that the respective courts were' concerned with professions which exclusively involved the rendering of a service rather than the vending of- commodities. See Semler v. Oregon State Board of Dental Examiners, supra. The various courts sought to foster a personal relationship predicated upon a confidence in the one rendering the service rather than a relationship based upon price. That rationale seems inapplicable to pharmacy. The pharmacist dispenses a commodity the quality of which is strictly regulated by state statutes . . . .\u201d 225 A. 2d at 737.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In sum, the specific statute at bar bears no relation to the wholly permissible regulation of <em>professional services </em>affecting the public health and welfare. Rather, it prohibits advertising of consumer goods sold within the scope of the pharmacist\u2019s retail activity. As such, it cannot be constitutionally sanctioned on the particular basis advanced here.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">There is no merit in the Board\u2019s fourth contention that the advertising of drug prices would subject physicians to pressure by their patients to prescribe larger quantities of drugs than medically indicated to enable the latter to avail themselves of quantity discounts. The Supreme Court of Florida in <em>Stadnik v. Shell\u2019s City, Inc., supra, </em>provided an appropriate answer to this contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201c . . . The rule proceeds on the notion that the advertisement of a prescription drug will subject the physicians to some sort of irresistible pressures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>that will force them to prescribe drugs for their patients simply on the basis of patient demand and without regard to the physical well-being of the patient. This concept disregards completely the professional and ethical integrity of the medical profession in prescribing remedies for patients. Furthermore, it actually suggests the probability of unethical conduct. In actuality, the rule has more resemblance to an economic regulation prohibiting price competition in the prescription drug business than it does to a regulation guarding the public health.\u201d 140 So. 2d at 875.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">As we indicated earlier, the sale of prescription drugs is thoroughly regulated in this state. Thus, as correctly observed by both the court below and the Pennsylvania court in <em>Pastor, </em>it is the physician, not the consumer, who determines what drugs, if any, are to be prescribed or administered. For these reasons, the argument that the advertising of retail prescription drugs will generate increased consumption or result in a greater demand provides no support for upholding the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Aside from the above arguments, the Board challenges the analysis of the \u201cdue process\u201d issue in <em>Pastor, </em>the authority which Judge Carter unquestionably found controlling. The thrust of its contention is that the constitutional standard applied by the court in <em>Pastor </em>in striking down the Pennsylvania statute is not the same as that followed by either the Supreme Court of the United States or this Court. The Board argues that the Pennsylvania court distinguished between state courts and the Supreme Court in their respective handling of due process arguments in economic regulation cases. Furthermore, the Board maintains, since this type of regulatory legislation would be found constitutional under the reasoning of recent Supreme Court cases, so must the Maryland statute. This is so, it says, because Maryland applies the same rule in testing the police power as does the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">To be sure, the Pennsylvania court did state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u201c . . . [T]he Supreme Court of the United States has \u2018returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws.\u2019 (citations omitted). \u2018Deference to the legislative judgment\u2019 is now the federal watchword, (citations omitted). \u2018It is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it.\u2019 Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., 348 U.S. 483, 488, 75 S.Ct. 461, 464, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955). See also Adams v. Tanner, 244 U.S. 590, 599-600, 37 S.Ct. 662, 665, 666, 61 L.Ed. 1336 (1917) (Brand\u00e9is, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">\u201cWhile this test may mean that in the federal courts the \u2018due process barrier to substantive legislation as to economic matters has been in effect removed,\u2019 the same cannot be said with respect to state courts and state constitutional law. This difference between federal and state constitutional law represents a sound development, one which takes into account the fact that \u2018state courts may be in a better position to review local economic legislation than the Supreme Court. State courts, since their precedents are not of national authority, may better adapt their decisions to local economic conditions and needs.\u2019 \u201d 272 A. 2d at 490.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">This trend in the Supreme Court decisions dealing with the Due Process Clause in \u201ceconomic matters,\u201d as distinguished from personal rights, has received much attention from the commentators. McCloskey, <em>Economic Due Process and the Supreme Court: An Exhumation and Reburial, </em>1962 Sup. Ct. Rev. 34, presents a comprehensive review of the subject, as do Stern, <em>The Problems of </em>Yesteryear\u2014 <em>Commerce and Due Process, </em>4 Vand. L. Rev. 446 (1951) and 37 Brooklyn L. Rev. 617, 622 (1971). We traced the development of this federal-state distinction in <em>Brooks v. State Board, </em>233 Md. 98, 110-12, 195 A. 2d 728 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Despite the reference to the federal-state dichotomy in <em>Pastor, </em>we disagree with the conclusion drawn from it by the Board that the Pennsylvania test is unlike that of Maryland. The following statements in <em>Pastor </em>leave no doubt that both follow the same test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\">\u201cThrough all these cases we have been guided by the proposition that \u2018a law which purports to be an exercise of the police power must not be unreasonable, unduly oppressive or patently beyond the necessities of the case, and the means which it employs must have a <em>real and substantial relation to the objects sought to be attained.\u2019 . . .\u201d </em>272 A. 2d 491 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201cExamining each reason in turn, however, we will find that none meet the test set out in <em>[Gambone v. Commonwealth, </em>375 Pa. 547, 101 A. 2d 634 (1954)]: Whether the means employed \u2014 the prohibition of retail price advertising of prescription drugs \u2014 <em>bears a \u2018substantial relation to the objects sought to be obtained.\u2019\u201d </em>272 A. 2d at 491-92 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201cWe thus find that the prohibition in question bears no substantial relation to any of the objects which . . . were sought to be obtained.\u201d 272 A. 2d at 494.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The rule of the Maryland cases is virtually identical. As recently as <em>Salisbury Beauty Schools v. St. Bd., supra, </em>where we recited the applicable principles at length, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">\u201c \u2018 . . . Freedom of contract is subject to legislative regulation in the interest of public health, safety, morals or welfare. But such legislation must not be unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, and the means selected <em>must have a real and substantial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>relation to the object sought to be attained. . . .\u2019 \u201d </em>268 Md. at 58 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Thus, we applied this standard there in stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">\u201cAlthough the effect of the prohibition in Art. 43, \u00a7 537 (a), may be to undertake to limit competition between the beauty schools and registered beauty shops, the Legislature was free to adopt such an economic policy so long as it appeared reasonably necessary to protect the public welfare. . . . We cannot say, to the extent it may \u2018control prices\u2019 or affect competition, that the statute is unreasonable or that it does not <em>bear a real and substantial relationship to the object sought to be attained.. . </em>.\u201d 268 Md. at 59-60 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Therefore, it is readily apparent that whatever may be the current direction taken by the Supreme Court in the area of economic regulation, as distinguished from the protection of fundamental righ,ts, Maryland and Pennsylvania adhere to the more traditional test formulated by the Supreme Court and enunciated in <em>Lawton v. Steele, </em>152 U. S. 133, 137, 14 S. Ct. 499, 38 L. Ed. 385 (1894). <em>See Goldblatt v. Hempstead, </em>369 U. S. 590, 594-95, 82 S. Ct. 987, 8 L. Ed. 2d 130 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">We pass then to the determination of whether the \u201cmeans selected\u201d here bear \u201ca real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained.\u201d That they do not is effectively demonstrated, we think, by what we said earlier in analyzing the arguments advanced by the Board. Furthermore, the record reveals the following: The ban on advertising prescription drug prices imposes a burden on senior citizens because they are unable to conduct any investigation, such as by reading advertisements, to learn the available prices for drugs. Many of these same persons have a great need for maintenance-type drugs. Apart from what the record discloses, it is clear that these conditions also apply to those who have modest or low incomes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>These circumstances are compounded by what now stands as an incontestable fact, namely, that there is a wide disparity in prescription drug prices.* ****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It follows from these facts that it would be in the best interests of the public to be informed of prescription drug prices to enable purchasing at the lowest available prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Thus, the arguments advanced by the Board demonstrate no \u201creal and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained,\u201d by the \u201cmeans selected.\u201d Quite to the contrary, the evidence indicates that continued existence of the statute is inversely related to the public health and welfare. Consequently, we do not hesitate to label it \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary and capricious,\u201d and therefore an unconstitutional exercise of the police power. Although the objectives attributed to the statute are, indeed, commendable ones, there is no \u201csubstantial relation\u201d between them and the statute. The result is, and we so hold, that subsection (iv) of \u00a7 266A (c) (4) violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Art. 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Lastly, the Board makes two related points. It contends that the court below paints with too broad a brush when it grants appellees \u201cthe unrestricted right to advertise drugs and drug prices, whether they be controlled dangerous substances or other prescription drugs, free from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>interference by the [Board],\u201d and further, that \u201c[n]o Court in the United States has gone as far as the lower Court in the instant case, in declaring drug price advertising statutes unconstitutional. . . .\u201d We do not agree with the gloss placed by the Board upon the decision of the lower court. Subsection (iv) does not mention \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d Nor do we share the Board\u2019s view that the decision reached below, if left intact, \"... will permit a pharmacist, or a pharmacy, to advertise even the most dangerous drug by description, price or otherwise, without accountability to the Board . . . .\u201d Elsewhere we have stressed the comprehensiveness of the regulatory scheme applicable to pharmacies; thus we are not persuaded that the Board is rendered incapable of effective regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">A companion argument advanced by the Board is that the decision reached here will cast doubt on Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 300 (e) (ii).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The short answer to this contention, as the trial judge stated, is that \u201cthe statute under constitutional attack in the instant case is not Art. 27, \u00a7 300 (e) (ii),\u201d which is a <em>criminal </em>statute. We note, furthermore, that the statute here proscribes the advertising of \u201cprescriptions, dangerous or nonproprietary drugs,\u201d whereas \u00a7 300 (e) (ii) restricts the advertising of \u201cany controlled dangerous drug or prescription drug.\u201d By definition, as contained in \u00a7 300 (a), the term \u201cprescription drugs\u201d does \u201cnot mean any controlled dangerous substance,\u201d which is defined elsewhere by schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In any event, lest there be any lingering doubts, we are not here concerned with \u00a7 300 (e) (ii), and we carefully refrain from expressing any opinion regarding its constitutionality <em>vel non. </em>To underscore the limits of our holding, we repeat that we go no further than to declare subsection (iv) of Art. 43, \u00a7 266A (c) (4) unconstitutional as a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Amendment and Art. 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\n<em>Order affirmed; appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-10\">. \u201c(c) <em>Grounds. </em>\u2014 The Board\u2019s power either to reprimand a pharmacist or assistant pharmacist or to suspend or revoke his license shall be for any of the following causes:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">\"(4) Upon proof \u2022 satisfactory to the Board of Pharmacy that a pharmacist .or assistant pharmacist is guilty of grossly unprofessional conduct.

Therefore, the statute carries with it a strong presumption of constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The test has been expressed for the Court in a number of different ways, all basically adding up to the same thing. The version of Judge Barnes in <em>A &amp; H Transp. Inc. v. Baltimore, </em>249 Md. 518, 240 A. 2d 601 (1968), was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">\u201cThe courts look, when a legislative action is challenged, to <em>any </em>set of circumstances that may justify the action.\u201d (Citing cases.) <em>Id. </em>at 523, footnote 2.

Comm\u2019r, </em>219 Md. 607, 616-17, 150 A. 2d 421 (1959), Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e and Judge Hammond, respectively, referred for the Court to <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., </em>348 U.

I find it interesting in the context of this case to note that Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is, two of the more liberal members of the Court at that time, dissented. Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is concurred in the Holmes dissent which said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\u201cThe Constitution does not make it a condition of preventive legislation that it should work a perfect cure.

A unanimous Court held <em>Liggett was not </em>authority for invalidation of the South Carolina act. Against arguments that there was no evil to be corrected by the legislation and that the Court should \u201ccall the statute arbitrary and unreasonable,\u201d Mr. Justice Murphy said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">\u201cLooking through the form of this plea to its essential basis, we cannot fail to recognize it as an argument for invalidity because this Court disagrees with the desirability of the legislation. We rehearse the obvious when we say that our function is thus misconceived.

There our inquiry must stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In <em>Williamson, </em>Mr. Justice Douglas said for a unanimous Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">\u201cThe day is gone when this Court uses the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought. See <em>Nebbia v. New York, </em>291 U. S. 502; <em>West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, </em>300 U. S. 379; <em>Olsen v. Nebraska, </em>313 U. S. 236; <em>Lincoln Union v. Northwestern Co., </em>335 U.

Kingery, </em>305 F. Supp. 821 (W.D. Va. 1969).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This case apparently was not appealed to the Supreme Court. Judge Butzner there said for the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201cA few prescriptions, but nevertheless a significant number, cannot be filled from drugs available in manufactured form, so the medicine must be compounded by the pharmacists. Some pharmacists, probably a minority, systematically monitor prescriptions by family records to avoid allergic reactions or the simultaneous use of antagonistic drugs, of which the patient\u2019s doctor may not be aware. Although monitoring is not completely effective because of the mobility of customers and the availability of nonprescription drugs which may be antagonistic, it is a benefit to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">\u201cFrom the evidence we find that dispensing prescription drugs affects the public health, safety and welfare. And we conclude that the state\u2019s classification and regulation of pharmacy as a professional practice is not arbitrary or invidious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 824-25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">As is conceded in the majority opinion, another similar statute was upheld against attack on constitutional grounds in <em>Supermarkets Gen. Corp. v. Sills, </em>93 N. J. Super. 326, 225 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>A. 2d 728 (1966). I regard what Judge Mintz said there as relevant here. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">\u201cIn concluding that pharmacy is a profession, I am not unmindful of the fact that over 90% of the prescriptions dispensed are pre-compounded; that is, the pharmacist\u2019s function is to count the tablets called for by the prescription and transfer them from the container furnished by the manufacturer into the bottle ultimately dispensed to the purchaser. As will hereinafter appear, however, the role of the pharmacist goes beyond that of the sale of a commodity. In filling a prescription the pharmacist often aids the physician by informing him of the properties and effects of various drugs. If the prescription calls for a generic compound, he chooses the particular brand to be dispensed. Additionally, he may \u2018monitor\u2019 each prescription as to dosage, and possibly determines whether the prescribed drug may be antagonistic to another previously prescribed for the patient by another physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">\u201cSince pharmacy is a profession, the practice of which affects the public health and welfare, the Legislature in the exercise of its police power may enact such legislation as it deems appropriate to safeguard the public interest, and ban practices tending to unseemly competition which lower standards of service. <em>Abelson\u2019s, Inc. v. New Jersey State Board of Optometrists, </em>[5 N. J. 412 (1950)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">\u201cThough the primary responsibility for drug prescription rests with the physician, the pharmacist plays an ancillary but important role in insuring that the proper drug and dosage are provided. Accordingly, the pharmacist is required to maintain records of all prescriptions. <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>45:14-15. Thus, if the customer frequents one pharmacy for all of his prescription needs, that pharmacist is in a position to check his records and thereby determine if a prescription is in any way antagonistic or contra-indicated by his previous prescription record. The Legislature may have concluded, that this important function of pharmacists would be impaired if they were permitted to advertise. The Legislature may have determined that \u2018cut rate,\u2019 \u2018discount\u2019 or promotional advertising in any way would encourage the patient to seek the pharmacy offering the drug at the cheapest price. As a result of \u2018price shopping\u2019 the pharmacist presumably would not be in a position to effectively determine,. by reference to his prescription records, if a particular drug is antagonistic to one previously prescribed, possibly by another physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">\u201cIt was urged that the patient\u2019s records are reviewed by the pharmacist only for the purpose of checking prices on prescriptions previously filled for the customer. Perhaps that may be the practice of many pharmacists, but there may be infrequent instances where a pharmacist does \u2018monitor\u2019 the prescription for the purpose of possibly detecting the prescription of an antagonistic drug. Infrequent as such occasions may be, they may justify the enactment of <em>chapter </em>120. See <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, supra, </em>348 U.S., at <em>p. </em>487; 75 S.Ct. 461.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">\u201cPlaintiffs argued that no evidence was presented to indicate that a pharmacist who advertises prescription drugs at a discount would in any way have a lesser duty to \u2018monitor\u2019 a prescription. True, the duty to \u2018monitor\u2019 may still exist, but the ability to do so effectively might be impaired if the customer tended to \u2018shop\u2019 for his prescription needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341-42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>See also </em>Annot., <em>Drugs </em>\u2014 <em>Prohibiting Advertising of Prices </em>44 A.L.R.3d 1301(1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">There is a similarity, as I see it, between this statute and the numerous statutes prohibiting advertising relative to eyeglasses. This similarity was mentioned in <em>Supermarkets. </em>The majority opinion notes that the Maryland Board of Pharmacy also saw a similarity, a similarity that does not seem to be distinguished in that opinion. <em>See </em>Annot., <em>Price Posting </em>\u2014 <em>Requiring </em>\u2014 <em>Prohibiting </em>89 A.L.R.2d 901, 935-949 (1963). The problem of advertising by dental laboratories, likewise related, is treated in Annot., <em>Prosthetic Dentistry </em>\u2014 <em>Regulation </em>45 A.L.R.2d 1243, 1251-53 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In <em>Williamson </em>an Oklahoma statute was applicable to opticians, but not to sellers of ready-to-wear glasses. As Mr. Justice Douglas put it, the practical effect of the law was that \u201cno optician [could] fit old glasses into new frames or supply a lens, whether it be a new lens or one to duplicate a lost or broken lens, without a prescription.\u201d The district court rebelled at the notion that a State could require a prescription from an optometrist or opthalmologist \u201cto take old lenses and place them in new frames and then fit the completed spectacles to the <em>face </em>of the eyeglass wearer.\u201d (Emphasis in its opinion, 120 F. Supp. at 135.) It found that through mechanical devices and ordinary skill the optician could take a broken lens or a fragment thereof, measure its power, and reduce it to prescriptive terms. It concluded that this provision of the law arbitrarily interfered with the optician\u2019s right to do business. The Supreme Court reversed upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In <em>Williamson </em>the statute also made it unlawful \u201cto solicit the sale of . . . frames, mountings ... or any other optical appliances.\u201d The district court conceded that under <em>Semler v. Dental Examiners, </em>294 U. S. 608, 55 S. Ct. 570, 79 L. Ed. 1086 (1935), regulation of advertising relating to eye examinations by the State was permitted, being \u201crationally related to the public health and welfare.\u201d It held, however, that regulation of the sale of eyeglass frames intruded \u201cinto a mercantile field only casually related to the visual care of the public\u201d and restricted \u201can activity which in no way can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>detrimentally affect the people.\u201d In reversing upon that point, Mr. Justice Douglas said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">\u201cAn eyeglass frame, considered in isolation, is only a piece of merchandise. But an eyeglass frame is not used in isolation, as Judge Murrah said in dissent below; it is used with lenses; and lenses, pertaining as they do to the human eye, enter the field of health. Therefore, the legislature might conclude that to regulate one effectively it would have to regulate the other. Or it might conclude that both the sellers of frames and the sellers of lenses were in a business where advertising should be limited or even abolished in the public interest. <em>Semler v. Dental Examiners, supra. </em>The advertiser of frames may be using his ads to bring in customers who will buy lenses. If the advertisement of lenses is to be abolished or controlled, the advertising of frames must come under the same restraints; or so the legislature might think. We see no constitutional reason why a State may not treat all who deal with the human eye as members of a profession who should use no merchandising methods for obtaining customers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\"><em>See also Head v. New Mexico Bd. of Exam. in Optometry, </em>374 U. S. 424, 83 S. Ct. 1759, 10 L.Ed.2d 983 (1963). A New Mexico statute forbade the advertisement \u201cby any means whatsoever ... of any prices or terms on eyeglasses, spectacles, lenses, frames or mountings . . . .\u201d It was upheld against the attack of a newspaper and radio station whose areas of service included a portion of the State of Texas. The newspaper and radio station were enjoined from accepting or publishing within New Mexico the advertising of a Texas optometrist found to be in violation of the New Mexico law. The Court rejected their contentions that the statute was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce and that it was in a field preempted by the Federal Communications Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>In <em>Bedno v. Fast, </em>6 Wis. 2d 471, 95 N.W.2d 396 (1959), the court upheld the validity of a statute making it unlawful to advertise any definite or indefinite price or credit terms on eyeglasses or frames. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">\u201cThe language of sec. 153.10, Stats., in no way indicates that proof of fraud is necessary to spell out an offense under its price-advertising prohibition. The practice which the statute is intended to protect the public against is that of filling a prescription to meet the price rather than the needs of the patient. To permit price advertising on the part of those who deal with the human eye, even truthful advertising, is to leave the door open for the unscrupulous practitioner to lure and to defraud unsuspecting members of the public. In <em>[Ritholz </em>v.] <em>Johnson, </em>[246 Wis. 442, 17 N.W.2d 590 (1945)], this court relied heavily upon <em>Semler v. Oregon State Board of Dental Examiners </em>(1934), 148 Or. 50, 34 Pac. (2d) 311, 294 U.S. 608, 55 Sup. Ct. 570, 79 L.Ed. 1086, where the court stated that the question was whether the kind of advertising prohibited afforded the unscrupulous practitioner a means of perpetrating fraud and deception upon his patients. It was there recognized that although there is nothing harmful in itself in merely advertising prices, there could be no doubt that unethical practitioners do resort to price-advertising methods to lure the credulous to their offices for the purpose of fleecing them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477-78.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The court responded to the attack on the constitutionality of the statute by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 argument that they are merely merchants has no merit. We cannot see that eyeglasses are any more merchandise than dentures. Both are prepared according to the needs of the individual. \u2018Furnishing glasses as much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>affects the public health as does furnishing dentures,\u2019 this court said in <em>Ritholz v. Johnson, supra, </em>page 453. In fact, it seems to us that a person\u2019s health may be more gravely endangered by wearing improper glasses than by wearing improper dentures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">\u201cArticles such as clothing or shoes are merchandise, purchased by the consumer for comfort and warmth. Eyeglasses are worn for correctional purposes. The customer himself knows whether a suit or a pair of shoes fit him and will serve the purposes for which he intends them; and if they do not, he suffers no harm. But he must rely on the word of the optician or optometrist that the glasses sold to him contain the proper correction for his vision; and if the correction is wrong he may very well sustain lasting injury to his eyes. This is clearly a matter of public health.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The fact that the modern drugstore is a retail establishment really has no bearing upon the validity of this statute. Prescription drugs may constitute \u201cconsumer goods,\u201d as the majority refers to them, but I believe \u201cthe man in the street\u201d would not regard them as \u201cconsumer goods.\u201d Whether they are or are not consumer goods in my opinion is irrelevant, however. It may be, as the majority opinion says, that prescription drugs constitute only about 11% of the sales volume of chain drugstores. I suspect, however, that if one eliminated from that base the department stores, supermarkets, or whatever one wishes to call them that have a prescription counter in one corner, the relationship of prescription drugs to total sales volume would be much higher, but that, too, is irrelevant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> What is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>relevant is whether there is a constitutionally valid, rational basis upon which the statute in question may be rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The majority apparently believes that the effect of advertising will be to educate the public as to which store has the lowest prices. If advertising can so educate the public, then it follows that there should be an increase in business on the part of stores with the lowest prices. Bearing in mind that every given action usually brings a reaction and that self-preservation is one of the first laws of nature, I see one rational basis for the statute set forth in <em>Supermarkets. </em>The New Jersey court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201cIn further relating the statute to the protection of the public health and welfare, it may be observed that discount price advertising may encourage smaller retailers to buy unusually large quantities of drugs in order to take advantage of cheaper prices for such purchases, and thus meet the competition of the larger outlets. As a result, otherwise potent drugs may remain on the shelf for an extended period of time, during which they may deteriorate and ultimately be sold to the customer. Dr. Friend testified that little is known about the problems of drug deterioration, but that the situation poses a prime concern in the profession. Hence, if the statute at all deters such buying practices, its relation to the public interest is manifest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The majority states that the ban on advertising prescription drug prices imposes a burden on senior citizens because they are unable to conduct any investigation \u201csuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>as by reading advertisements\u201d to learn the available prices for drugs. It apparently believes that by permitting advertising the public will be benefited. The thought that there can be advertising which will provide a <em>meaningful </em>basis for comparing prices in my opinion is, to borrow the words of Lord Denman, \u201ca delusion, a mockery and a snare.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It certainly would be no exaggeration to say that the prescription department of the average drugstore carries more than a thousand separate items of prescription drugs. To effectively compare prices one would need to know, in addition to the compound, the strength, the manufacturer, and the form of dosage in which the medicine is being prescribed \u2014 a lot different and a lot more complicated than comparison shopping for chickens, apples, canned tomatoes, shoes, or even a lady\u2019s handbag. Advertising just cannot make available to the public a rational basis for comparison of prices between one store and another. Short of a computer print-out, I fail to see how a <em>sound </em>basis for comparison of prices can be found. The General Assembly might well have concluded just that and prohibited advertising for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">It must be remembered that there is nothing to prevent a given store from advertising a drug below its normal selling price in an effort to entice into the store those persons who might have prescriptions for such drugs which they have had filled elsewhere at higher prices \u2014 and making up for that reduction by raising other prices. For a substantial period of time it was a known fact in the poultry industry on Delmarva that certain supermarkets, to lure customers into their respective stores, were offering \u201cspecials\u201d on chicken at a price often below the cost of production to the processing plant. The General Assembly might well have reached a similar conclusion and decided that drugs necessary for the health of our people should not be used for \u201cbait\u201d advertising. In <em>Ritholz v. Johnson, </em>246 Wis. 442, 17 N.W.2d 590 (1945), the statute under consideration, among other things, made it unlawful to advertise any definite price on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>complete eyeglasses. The court upheld the validity of the statute, reversing a trial court. One portion of its opinion makes interesting reading and indicates my fears are not completely without foundation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">\u201cWe do not have to rest the constitutionality of the statute wholly upon the dentist case, <em>[Modern S. Dentists v. State Board of D. Examiners, </em>216 Wis. 190, 256 N. W. 922 (1934)]. The evidence in this case shows that the advertising used by the plaintiffs actually does operate to defraud the public. The customers of plaintiffs are mostly poor persons. The plaintiffs by their own testimony aim to advertise where their advertisements will reach \u2018workers, foreigners and negroes\u2019 particularly. They use the advertisement as a lure or bait, or as they call it \u2018an inducement\u2019 to draw such persons to their stores. The general nature of their advertising is shown by the photostatic copy of an advertisement printed herewith. Note the following in the photostat: \u2018$12.00 value $3.88;\u2019 \u2018at the low price of only $3.88;\u2019 \u2018get the glasses you need at prices you can afford;\u2019 \u2018no extra cost;\u2019 \u2018FREE;\u2019 \u2018no extra charge.\u2019 This on its face is dishonest advertising. It manifestly aims and tends to mislead the public within the rule of <em>Semler v. Oregon State Board of Dental Examiners, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth v. Ferris, </em>305 Mass. 233, 25 N.E.(2d) 378, and is therefore fraudulent advertising.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">All of the cases I have read regard the pharmacist as a professional person. It is true, as the majority states, that much of the business carried on in the average drugstore is ordinary retailing. However, that with which we are here concerned is the professional part of the business. In <em>Semler </em>the Court had under consideration an Oregon statute forbidding a number of advertising activities on the part of dentists including advertising prices and \u201cadvertising by means of large display, glaring light signs, or containing as a part thereof the representation of a tooth, teeth, bridge work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>or any portion of the human head . . . The Court said the challenger claimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">\u201cthat the statements in his advertisements were truthful and were made in good faith; that by these methods he had developed a large and lucrative practice; that through long training and experience he had acquired ability superior to that of the great majority of practicing dentists; that he had been able to standardize office operations, to purchase supplies in large quantities and. at relatively low prices, and thus to establish a uniform schedule of charges for the majority of operations; also that he had made contracts for display signs and for advertisements in newspapers, and had entered into other engagements, of which he would be unable to take advantage if the legislation in question were .sustained, and, in that event, his business would be destroyed or materially impaired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610 of 294 U. S.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Mr. Chief Justice Hughes said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201cThe State court defined the policy of the statute. The court said that while, in itself, there was nothing harmful in merely advertising prices for dental work or in displaying glaring signs illustrating teeth and bridge work, it could not be doubted that practitioners who were not willing to abide by the ethics of their profession often resorted to such advertising methods \u2018to lure the credulous and ignorant members of the public to their offices for the purpose of fleecing them.\u2019 The legislature was aiming at \u2018bait advertising.\u2019 \u2018Inducing patronage,\u2019 said the court, \u2018by representations of \u201cpainless dentistry,\u201d \u201cprofessional superiority,\u201d \u201cfree examinations,\u201d and \u201cguaranteed\u201d dental work\u2019 was, as a general rule, \u2018the practice of the charlatan and the quack to entice the public.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">\u201cWe do not doubt the authority of the State to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>estimate the baleful effects of such methods and to put a stop to them. The legislature was not dealing with traders in commodities, but with the vital interest of public health, and with a profession treating bodily ills and demanding different standards of conduct from those which are traditional in the competition of the market place. The community is concerned with the maintenance of professional standards which will insure not only competency in individual practitioners, but protection against those who would prey upon a public peculiarly susceptible to imposition through alluring promises of physical relief. And the community is concerned in providing safeguards not only against deception, but against practices which would tend to demoralize the profession by forcing its members into an unseemly rivalry which would enlarge the opportunities of the least scrupulous. What is generally called the \u2018ethics\u2019 of the profession is but the consensus of expert opinion as to the necessity of such standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611-12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">It seems to me that the General Assembly might well have concluded that in the operation of the professional portion of a drugstore advertising of prices should be forbidden as one of the \u201cpractices which would tend to demoralize the profession by forcing its members into an unseemly rivalry which would enlarge the opportunities of the least scrupulous.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">In my judgment there is yet another valid, rational basis for the statute which the General Assembly might have had in mind, <em>i.e. </em>\u201cmonitoring,\u201d mentioned in both <em>Supermarkets </em>and <em>Patterson. </em>It is not sufficient to say that the physician is better able than the pharmacist to monitor, that this is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>physician\u2019s basic responsibility. We hear much today of the need and necessity for fail-safe mechanisms. Prescription drugs directly affect the health and physical well being of our people. Can we, therefore, correctly label as arbitrary a legislative desire that there be a second possible check against prescription of antagonistic drugs or drugs to which an individual might have an allergic reaction? I think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">It is true, as said in <em>Patterson, </em>that \u201cmonitoring is not completely effective because of the mobility of customers and the availability of nonprescription drugs which may be antagonistic.\u201d In this day of specialization in the medical field, where an individual may conceivably be under the care of more than one physician at a time without a single physician\u2019s being in full charge, a prescribing physician may not necessarily be aware of all medicine being taken by an individual. Approximately a year ago I witnessed monitoring in action. When presented with a prescription, an alert, conscientious pharmacist noted from his record that the patient was allergic to a certain type of drug. He then called the prescribing physician before filling the prescription. Fortunately, in that situation the physician had already taken the known allergy into consideration and was of the opinion that the particular drug would have no adverse effect. Under other circumstances, however, the action of the pharmacist might well have prevented disastrous results. Therefore, I am of the opinion that, as put in <em>Patterson, </em>monitoring \u201cis a benefit to the public.\u201d Surely this would be a rational basis upon which the action of the General Assembly might have been rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We must not lose sight of the fact that ours is the judicial, not the legislative, function. It might well be that as legislators we would not enact a law such as this. We are not legislators, however; we are judges. As I have pointed out, we have said that reasonable doubt in favor of a statute is enough to sustain it and that when a legislative action is challenged the courts look to <em>any </em>set of circumstances that might justify the action. As previously mentioned, in <em>Salisbury Beauty Schools </em>we said earlier this year:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\u201cIf any state of facts reasonably can be conceived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>that would sustain the constitutionality of the statute within the exercise of the police power, the existence of that state of facts as a basis for the passage of the law must be assumed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>268 Md. at 49.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">I am of the opinion that any one of the hypotheses I have set forth above might have been a basis for the passage of the law and that any one of them would constitute a valid basis for the exercise of the police power. Accordingly, I would reverse the action of the trial judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-11\">. It is noted that the Attorney General of Maryland submitted a brief there as amicus curiae.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-6\">.
