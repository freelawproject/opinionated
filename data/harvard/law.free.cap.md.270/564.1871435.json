The provision with which we are principally concerned is that contained in Item Eight of the will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-12\">\u201cItem Eight: I hereby give, devise, and bequeath the residue of my estate unto the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>National Bank, its successor or successors, Trustee for the uses and purposes set forth:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-3\">\u201cMy Trustee shall collect the income arising from the principal of the Trust Estate arising from this item Eight (8) and after paying all expenses incident to the trust estate, including the usual commissions to the Trustee, shall distribute the income and principal as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">\u201cMy Trustee shall pay the <em>entire net income from this Trust estate in equal shares unto such of Mrs. Gladys K. Moore, Mrs. Helen Crossley, Miss Mary L. Schleupner as shall be qualified to receive the same from time to time. </em>By \u2018qualified to receive the same\u2019 I mean until their respective deaths as to Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Crossley and to her death or marriage as to Miss Schleupner. This Trust shall terminate when the last person qualified to receive the net income dies or marries, as the case may be, at which time my Trustee shall pay over and deliver the accumulated income and principal as then constituted unto The Shriner\u2019s Crippled Children Hospitals to be used by the said hospital to endow a memorial to be known as the Harry Clinton Memorial, the selection and form of the memorial to be in the sole discretion of the then Imperial [Potentate] of the Ancient Arabic Order, Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, [whose] headquarters are in Chicago and the then Potentate of Osiris Temple, Wheeling, West Virginia, of which Temple I have been a member in good standing for over fifty seven (57) years \u2014 this selection shall [embody)?)] all the remainder interest of my estate and <em>should qualify as a deduction under Section 2055(a)(2) of 1951 Internal Revenue Code or the corresponding Charity section of the Internal Revenue Code in effect at my death. </em>\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">While Mr. Clinton exhibited not inconsiderable skill as a draftsman, and clearly demonstrated that he had both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>charitable intent and tax consciousness frequently-associated with people of means, he was apparently unaware that the Tax Reform Act of 1969 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was enacted on the very day that he signed his will, and could not know that the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \u00a7 664 and \u00a7 2055(e)(2) [hereinafter I.R.C.], would deny a result \u2014 which he had very much in mind \u2014 the deduction, for federal estate tax purposes, of the value of the charitable remainder unless the trust which he created could qualify as a charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust as described by I.R.C. \u00a7 664 and the regulations to be issued thereunder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unhappily, Mr. Clinton\u2019s trust was neither, and a federal estate tax saving of some $90,000.00 would be lost unless something could be done.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">As a consequence, Maryland National Bank (Maryland National) as personal representative of Mr. Clinton, and as trustee under his will, filed a petition in equity in the Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City seeking a construction of the will and such modification of it as might be necessary to bring its provisions into conformity with the Internal Revenue Code. Joined as respondents were the three income beneficiaries, Gladys K. Moore (born in 1899), Helen Crossley (born in 1896), sisters of Mr. Clinton, and Mary L. Schleupner (born in 1925), together with the holder of the vested remainder, Shriners Hospitals for Crippled Children (the Hospitals). Answers were filed by the several parties, admitting the allegations of the petition and concurring in the granting of the relief prayed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>'</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>When the case came on for hearing, however, the individuals who were the income beneficiaries, on the one hand, and the Hospitals, as the holder of the vested remainder, on the other, differed in their views as to the proper construction of the will. The individual beneficiaries contended that they, and the survivors of them (subject to the provision in respect to the marriage of Miss Schleupner, which under the wdH\u2019s concept of \u201cqualified to receive the same\u201d will hereafter be treated as equivalent to her death), would take the entire net income, in equal shares, so long as more than one survived, and that the last survivor would take the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The Hospitals took a different view, relying primarily on the provision of the will which directed, on the termination of the trust, that the trustee should \u201cpay over and deliver the <em>accumulated </em>income and principal, as then constituted\u201d (emphasis supplied) to the Hospitals, and on Maryland Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol.) Art. 50, ij 9,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which dealt with the express provision required to create a joint tenancy. The Hospitals contended that under a proper construction of the will, upon the death or marriage of Miss Schleupner and upon the death of each of the other life tenants, the share of income to which such person was theretofore respectively entitled should be accumulated and ultimately distributed to the Hospitals when the trust terminated, or should be distributed to them currently if tax considerations required.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">\n<em>The Proper Construction of the Income Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">In disposing of the conflicting contentions regarding the devolution of income, Judge Ross said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">\u201cThe language of the will so plainly states the intention of the testator that it is not open to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>construction. It is clear he intended that the surviving qualified income beneficiaries would share \u2018the entire net income\u2019 until the termination of the trust upon the death or marriage of the last qualified income beneficiary. \u2018[Play the entire net income * * * unto such * * * as shall be qualified * * * from time to time\u2019 can have no other meaning. All that [Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol.)l Art. 50, \u00a7 9 requires is a clear statement of intention and such is present here. <em>Marshall v. Security Storage Co., </em>155 Md. 649 [, 652-53, 142 A. 186, 187] (1928). The subsequent use of the term \u2018accumulated income\u2019 in connection with distribution upon termination gives rise to no ambiguity. It undoubtedly refers to income accumulated between the last distribution to the final income beneficiary and her death or marriage, thus avoiding the distribution of such income to her estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Without intending to question the chancellor\u2019s conclusion, we could speculate that Mr. Clinton may well have confused the concept of \u201caccumulated\u201d income with \u201caccrued\u201d income \u2014 an imprecision utilized by many draftsmen more sophisticated than he. In general, where a will is drawn by a layman, \u201cthe language used may be given the meaning it would commonly have to a person in his situation,\u201d. <em>Buchwald v. Buchwald, </em>175 Md. 103, 111, 199 A. 795, 798 (1938). Whatever his reason for using \u201caccumulated\u201d as an adjective, it is patent that this does not negate his clear intention as expressed by the will: that the income beneficiaries, \u00e1nd the survivors and survivor of them, were to take the <em>\u201centire </em>net income\u201d until \u201cthe last person qualified to receive <em>the </em>net income dies or marries.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">It seems to us that the devolution of the trust income is clearly controlled by the intention of the testator; as expressed in the will, <em>Davis v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>235 Md. 266, 269, 201 A. 2d 373, 374 (1964); <em>Gent v. Kelbaugh, </em>179 Md. 343, 350-51, 18 A. 2d 595, 598 (1941); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>Buchwald v. Buchwald, supra, </em>175 Md. at 111, 199 A. at 798; <em>Chew v. Chew, </em>1 Md. 163, 168 (1851). We agree with the chancellor, that as expressed in the will, it was Mr. Clinton\u2019s intention that such of the income beneficiaries, as were \u201cqualified\u201d from time to time, were to receive the entire net income.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Furthermore, the rule of our cases is clear: income is not to be accumulated absent an express provision or necessary implication, <em>Green v. Green, </em>182 Md. 571, 575, 35 A. 2d 238, 240 (1944); <em>Burt v. Gill, </em>89 Md. 145, 151-52, 12 A. 968, 970, 43 A. 177 (1899); <em>see also </em>Restatement of Property \u00a7 440 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Elsewhere, in cases where intention was not clearly spelled out, an equal division among income beneficiaries has been justified as a class gift, <em>In re Hicks' Estate, </em>345 Mich. 448, 75 N.W.2d 819 (1956); <em>Old Colony Trust Co. v. Treadwell, </em>312 Mass. 214, 43 N.E.2d 777 (1942); as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, <em>Bodeman v. Cary, </em>152 Neb. 506, 41 N.W.2d 797 (1950); <em>In re Monroe, </em>42 R. I. 412, 108 A. 497 (1920);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or by an implication of cross remainders, <em>Kiesling v. White, </em>411 Ill. 493, 104 N.E.2d 291 (1952). Examples of the latter in Maryland are <em>Tilghman v. Frazer, </em>191 Md. 132, 59 A. 2d 781, 191 Md. 153, 62 A. 2d 596 (1948), and <em>Heald v. Heald, </em>56 Md. 300 (1881); <em>cf. Gent v. Kelbaugh, supra. See also </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 143, comment <em>b </em>(1959); 2 Scott, Law of Trusts \u00a7 143 (3d ed. 1967). <em>See generally </em>Annot., 71 A.L.R.2d 1332 (1960), and Annot., 140 A.L.R. 841 (1942), where cases involving the devolution of income from testamentary trusts upon the deaths of life beneficiaries are collected, and numerous constructions are discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>\n<em>The Modification of the Provision? of the Trust</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">After the case was at issue, and at or prior to the hearing, Maryland National filed what was later marked for identification as Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1, titled \u201cThe Harry Edward Clinton Charitable Remainder Unitrust under decree by Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City, Maryland,\u201d which appears as an appendix to this opinion. It set out in considerable detail the manner in which Maryland National apparently proposed that the will be modified, a modification which was seemingly acceptable to the parties, but not formally consented to by them, except for the provision of Article II relating to distribution of income. Article I made Miss Schleupner\u2019s interest a true life estate,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Article II adopted the distribution of income urged by the life tenants and opposed by the Hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We need not pass on the question whether the proposed modification could have been accomplished solely by agreement of the parties under Chapter 312 of the Laws of 1972 and Chapter 366 of the Laws of 1971, which were enacted by the General Assembly to facilitate the conformance of charitable remainder trusts to certain requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, and are now codified as Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 16, 199D-1 and 199F.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the first place, no agreement was reached; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>more importantly, it seems to be conceded that the time for reformation by agreement of the parties expired under Treasury Regulations on 31 December 1972, and that an acceptable modification can now only be effected by judicial decree, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.664-l(f)(3)(ii) (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\">Exhibiting commendable restraint, the chancellor filed an opinion in which he declined to rule on the proposed modification of the terms of the will until (i) the question as to the proper construction of the provisions dispositive of income was finally resolved; (ii) the consent of the several parties in interest had been obtained,* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (iii) the modifications proposed had been limited to the bare minima required by the Tax Reform Act of 1969. To this end, he retained jurisdiction over the trust estate until a final decree was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">We think the chancellor had it just about right when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">\u201cIt is clear beyond question that subject to rare exception a court of equity has no power to rewrite or amend a decedent\u2019s will. <em>McCurdy v. Safe Deposit </em>&amp; <em>Trust Company, </em>190 Md. 67, 76 [, 57 A. 2d 302, 307 (1948)], and <em>Ridgely v. Pfingstag, </em>188 Md. 209, 228 [, 50 A. 2d 578, 587 (1946)]. Where the overriding general intent of the testator is clear, a court may change, transpose or add to the words of the will in order to effect the general intent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>McElroy v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company, </em>229 Md. 276 [, 182 A. 2d 775 (1962)]: <em>Payne v. Payne, </em>136 Md. 551 [, 111 A. 81 (1920)]; <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company v. Winters, Trustee, </em>246 Md. 106 [, 228 A. 2d 289 (1967)]. However, there is a vast difference between the transposition, addition or changing of a word or two in order to carry out the overriding general intent of the testator and incorporating in his will an 8-page document such as is proposed in the instant case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">\u201cOne (and perhaps the only one) rare exception to the general rule against amending or rewriting the will of a testator is with respect to charitable trusts under the doctrines of <em>cy pres </em>and deviation. IV Scott on Trusts, ijij 381, 399-399.4 [3d ed. 19671. The contention is made here that the Court should invoke the doctrine of <em>cy pres </em>or deviation to prevent the loss of the tax deduction and the consequent diminution in the size of the gift to charity. In a proper case it would seem that an equity court would have the power under either the <em>cy pres </em>or deviation doctrine to modify the trust instrument to the extent necessary to insure a charitable deduction for estate or income tax purposes on the theory that diversion of assets from charitable purposes contrary to the clearly expressed intent of the donor would thus be avoided. Art. 16, \u00a7 196, Code [(1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.)]; <em>Miller v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company, </em>224 Md. 380 [, 168 A. 2d 184 (1961)]; <em>Gordon v. City of Baltimore, </em>258 Md. 682 [, 267 A. 2d 98 (1970)1; <em>Wesley Home, Inc. v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company, </em>265 Md. 185 <em>[, </em>289 A. 2d 337 (1972)]; <em>In the Matter of Estate of Barkey, </em>[65 Misc. 2d 738,] 318 N.Y.S.2d 843 (Surrogate\u2019s Court, New York County 1971); <em>In re Estate of Klosk, </em>[65 Misc. 2d 1005,] 319 N.Y.S.2d 685 (Surrogate\u2019s Court, New York County 1971); <em>In re Roche\u2019s Will, </em>[69 Misc. 2d 481,] 330 N.Y.S.2d 441 (Surrogate\u2019s Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Queens County 1972); <em>Bok Trust, </em>[27 Am.

Kidd, </em>Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Docket 111A, Folio 659, Case No. A-52246.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">\u201cA direction or statement of intention in the instrument that the charitable gift qualify for the deduction would weigh in favor of the existence of such a power in a given case. However, the power to alter would extend only to the minimum modification necessary to obtain the deduction and could only exist when its exercise would not disturb any other gift, estate or interest provided for in the trust instrument which the donor had not clearly subordinated to the maximization of the charitable gift. In none of the cases cited and relied on by counsel, or in any found by the Court, was as extensive a rewriting of the trust instrument permitted as is requested here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">\u201cApparently, the changes needed in this case to conform the will to the requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 are: (1) limit the income to <em>5% </em>of net market value of the trust assets valued annually, (2) eliminate marriage as an event which would terminate Miss Schleupner\u2019s income estate; (3) add express administrative provisions preventing self-dealing by the trustee and prohibiting the trustee from making taxable expenditures, having excess business holdings and investing in a manner jeopardizing the trust\u2019s exempt purposes; and (4) provide for distribution of remainder to some other tax qualified charity in the event Shriners is not tax qualified on termination of the trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">\u201cThe <em>Klosk, Barkey, Roche </em>and <em>Bok </em>cases relied upon by the plaintiff and cited above dealt with charitable trusts in which there were no other beneficiaries. The <em>Barkey </em>and <em>Kiosk </em>cases merely</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>permitted the addition of administrative provisions. In <em>Roche </em>and <em>Bok </em>the income of the trust was payable to a charity or charities and the courts permitted only (1) addition of the required administrative provisions and (2) a provision with respect to minimum income distribution. <em>Estate of Bird </em>[N.Y.L.J. May 10, 1972] (New York County Surrogate\u2019s Court), and <em>Estate of Pearlbrook, </em>[30 Am. Fed. Tax R. 2d 72-5904] (New York County Surrogate\u2019s Court [1972]) while involving split interest trusts merely provided for inclusion of administrative provisions not inconsistent with any \u2018mandatory direction\u2019 or the \u2018substance of the testamentary provisions or the rights of the beneficiaries\u2019 in the wills. In none of these six cases was the estate or interest of another individual modified by the court nor did it appear from the opinion in any of the cases that any of the modifications or deviations substantially altered an express provision of the trust instrument. It is true that in <em>Maryland National Bank v. Kidd, \u00a1supra,] </em>a nisi prius decision in this court, the estate of a life beneficiary was modified, but such was by express agreement of all affected parties and the court was not called upon to hold that the abandonment of the interest of the income beneficiary resulted in a gift from the grantor rather than the income beneficiary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\">\u201cThe proposed amendment in this case would:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">\u201c1. Modify the income estate of Mary L. Schleupner by eliminating the provision for termination upon her marriage. [Appendix, Article II]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">\u201c2.

[Article X[</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-11\">\u201cWhile the proposed amendment might well be one upon which all parties in interest could agree under [Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.)[ Art. 16, \u00a7 199D-1, it is not one which the Court has the power to adopt under the doctrine of either deviation or <em>cy pres. </em>The very most that would be within the Court\u2019s power would be to rule that the trust be amended to include (from the items listed above) only items 2, 4 and those powers under item 6 which are required by the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Although the evidence is scant, it seems reasonably clear that the trustee\u2019s conclusion expressed in its brief that the income during the existence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>trust will never exceed that distributable under the proposed formula is a sound one. Furthermore, although the reference to the charitable deduction in the will can more readily be interpreted as an expression of probability or expectancy than a declaration of intent (clearly it cannot serve to incorporate by reference under [Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Vol.ll Art. 93, ij 4-107), reading the will as a whole one can support the holding that the testator would prefer the limitation on income to the loss of the charitable deduction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">\u201cAlthough Internal Revenue has ruled that item 1 is necessary to obtain the charitable deduction, the modification of Miss Schleupner\u2019s income estate is so great as to put it beyond the power of the Court, at least without the express consent of all affected parties. It seems ironic that Internal Revenue is insisting on a modification which can only serve to reduce the charitable gift and can in no way increase it. Since Miss Schleupner is substantially younger than the other two income beneficiaries, the chances are she will outlive them by a number of years. If she should marry, the elimination of this event as a disqualifying one would increase her estate and at the same time diminish that of Shriners. Apparently, Internal Revenue\u2019s problem is one of difficulty of valuation. Its end could be achieved by requiring valuation of Miss Schleupner\u2019s interest as if it were an unrestricted life estate without requiring an actual change in the will. This would assure the minimum deduction and the maximum gift to charity which seems to be more consistent with the underlying policy of the pertinent provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\u201cWhile item 3 is required by Internal Revenue Regulations, it constitutes a change in substance which could only be achieved under [Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.ll Article 16, \u00a7 199D-1. There would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>appear to be no justification for the remaining suggested modifications. Items 5, 7, 8 and 9 and many of the powers in item 6 appear to bear no relation to the estate tax law or regulations and therefore are unnecessary to prevent diversion of property from charitable purposes. While many of these items might constitute no more than codification of existing rules of law regarding administration of trusts, or innocuous supplements thereto, some materially vary express provisions of the will for no demonstrated tax purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Almost two months thereafter, there having been no express agreement of the parties, a final decree was entered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\u201cThis case came on for hearing in open Court on September 26, 1972.

FURTHER ORDERED that this Court retain no jurisdiction over the administration of the,trust created under the Will of Harry Edward Clinton.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">In their appeal, the Hospitals have challenged not only the construction of the provision relating to the distribution of income, but also the determination that a court of equity is without power to modify the trust instrument without the consent of the several parties in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">As regards the power of a court of equity to modify a trust instrument beyond the point of preventing a complete frustration of the creator\u2019s purpose, we agree with the chancellor that if an instrument is to be conformed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, it must be done in the light of the clear expression of legislative intent contained in Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 16, ij 199D-1. Changes may be made by the parties, for purposes of complying with I.R.C. \u00a7 664, so long as the court is satisfied that such alterations are not contrary to the terms of the governing instrument, Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 16, \u00a7 199F. Reading the two sections together, it would seem that two approaches are available: either amendment by consent of the parties, subject to court review, or amendment by decree of a court of competent jurisdiction with the consent of those parties whose substantive rights may be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The prevailing rule is that the doctrine of reformation of instruments is not applicable to wills,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>see </em>Annot, 90 A.L.R.2d 924, 933-34 (1963), and cases there cited, although concededly a somewhat similar but much more restrictive result may sometimes be accomplished in an action for construction, <em>see McElroy v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., supra, </em>229 Md. at 283-84, 182 A. 2d at 778-79; <em>Slingluff v. Johns, </em>87 Md. 273, 280-81, 39 A. 872, 875 (1898). Cases dealing with the power of a court of equity to reform other instruments, <em>e.g., Housing Equity Corp. v. Joyce, </em>265 Md. 570, 290 A. 2d 769 (1972); <em>Anne Arundel County v. Cushman, </em>255 Md. 153, 257 A. 2d 150 (1969), are therefore clearly inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">While it is true that trustees cannot alter the interests of the beneficiaries without their consent, <em>Walbach v. Walbach, </em>165 Md. 8, 166 A. 422 (1933), a trust instrument may be reformed by the court to correct a mistake, <em>Liberty Trust Co. v. Weber, </em>200 Md. 491, 507, 90 A. 2d 194, 200, 200 Md. 523, 91 A. 2d 393 (1952); <em>Kiser v. Lucas, </em>170 Md. 486, 496-97, 185 A. 441, 445-46 (1936), in the exercise of an equity court\u2019s inherent power. However, the doctrine of reformation is ordinarily applicable only in cases, such as <em>Liberty Trust </em>and <em>Kiser, </em>involving inter vivos trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>instruments.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here we are confronted with a testamentary-trust and, except for the statutes, Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 16, \u00a7 199D-1 and \u00a7 199F, the general prohibition against the reformation of a will would prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Further, it seems to us that this is not a situation where modification can be obtained under the doctrine of <em>cy pres, </em>because there is no element of illegality, or impossibility or impracticability of enforcement present here, as contemplated by Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 16, \u00a7 196; <em>Gordon v. City of Baltimore, supra, </em>258 Md. at 702, 267 A. 2d at 108-09; <em>Miller v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., supra, </em>224 Md. at 387, 168 A. 2d at 188; <em>see generally </em>Casenote, <em>The Cy Pres Doctrine Explored, </em>22 Md. L. Rev. 340, 345-48 (1962); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 399, comment <em>a </em>(1959); 4 Scott, Law of Trusts ij 399, at 3085 (3d ed. 1967); Bogert, Law of Trusts &amp; Trustees \u00a7 431, at 390-91 (2d ed. 1964), for a general discussion of common law <em>cy pres </em>principles in the absence of statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Strictly speaking, neither is this a case where the doctrine of deviation can be invoked, because deviation usually \u201chas to do with the powers and duties of the trustees of charitable trusts with respect to the <em>administration </em>of the trust,\u201d Restatement (Second) of Trusts $ 381, comment <em>a </em>(1959) (emphasis supplied); Bogert, <em>supra, </em>$ 394, at 236. Although deviation is a principle analogous to <em>cy </em>pres,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and is not as extensive. Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 399, comment a (1959), it is a power which may be exercised with particular liberality in the case of charitable trusts, <em>Gordon v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>Baltimore, supra, </em>258 Md. at 706, 267 A. 2d at 111; 4 Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 381, at 2987.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Even without the statutes, it is conceivable that some degree of modification might have been accomplished, so long as it did not materially alter the substantive rights of the parties, for example, to prevent the frustration of Mr. Clinton\u2019s clearly expressed desire that the provision made for the Hospitals should qualify as a charitable deduction for federal estate tax purposes. Here, the root of the difficulty was the absence of the express consents of the affected parties. <em>See Davison v. Duke University, </em>282 N. C. 676, 194 S.E.2d 761 (1973), where modification of the administrative provisions of the trust instrument which created the Duke Endowment to conform to the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 was permitted, possibly under the doctrine of deviation, only to an extent not at variance with the expressed intention of the settlor.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">While we think that the chancellor was eminently correct in his resolution of both the question of construction and the issue regarding modification, we propose to remand the case so that it may be reconsidered in the event that the necessary consents of the parties are forthcoming. Except for the fact that we were assured at argument that the parties will now be in a position formally to consent to the modifications necessary to conform the provisions of the trust to the requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, we would have affirmed the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\n<em>Case remanded without affirmance or reversal for further proceedings and entry of a decree conformable to the views herein expressed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellee, Maryland National Bank, from funds of estate inits hands.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The Harry Edward Clinton Charitable Remainder Unitrust Under Decree By Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City, Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">WHEREAS, in consideration of the agreements made by the trustee of the said Harry Edward Clinton Trust, and by the beneficiaries specified therein and by the personal representative under the will of Harry Edward Clinton deceased, said personal representative shall transfer to said trustee all of the net assets contained within the residue of the estate of said Harry Edward Clinton as the sole and exclusive contribution to such trust and said trustee agrees to hold said assets and all reinvestments thereof, herein collectively known as the \u201cTrust Estate,\u201d for the uses and purposes hereinafter set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">WHEREAS, in the exercise of its equity powers, the Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City, Maryland, has, on the .......... day of............ , 1971, amended a certain trust under the will of Harry Edward Clinton to conform to the rules and regulations prescribed by U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1954, Section 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Therefore, be it known that the said Trust Estate, on and after February 6, 1970, be and hereby is subject to the following terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">ARTICLE I</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">Commencing as of February 6, 1970, and continuing for the lifetime of each of the life income beneficiaries, specified in Schedule A, the \u201cUnitrust Amount of the Trust Estate,\u201d (as defined below and as qualified by the last sentence of this Article), shall be paid in equal shares to such beneficiaries quarterly.
