Appellants (the Chirichellas) had contracted in June 1971 to sell their home in Silver Spring to appellees (the Erwins) for the sum of $39,200. Due to the refusal of the Chirichellas to settle, the Erwins finally sued them on August 31, 1972 for specific performance. At the conclusion of the trial, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Miller, J.) entered the decree from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">The contract entered into by the parties was the \u201cstandard\u201d form used by the Montgomery County Board of Realtors. Paragraph Six of the form contract, entitled \u201cSettlement,\u201d reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-15\">_ days from date of \u2018Within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>acceptance hereof by the Seller, or as soon thereafter as a report of the title can be secured if promptly ordered, and/or survey, if required, and/or Government-insured loan, if used, can be processed, if promptly applied for, the Seller and Purchaser are required and agree to make full settlement in accordance with the terms hereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Apparently when the real estate salesman initially submitted the contract to the Chirichellas, the words, \u201cby Oct. 1, 1971 or sooner,\u201d had been inserted in the blank space. By mutual agreement, this language was amended to read, \u201cCoincide with settlement of New Home in Kettering Approx. Oct. \u201971.\u201d No other reference to the \u201cNew Home in Kettering\u201d appears in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The Chirichellas had contracted to purchase the \u201cNew Home\u201d in April 1971. Their agreement provided that they were to settle \u201cwithin fifteen (15) days from the date of completion.\u201d Although construction of the new house had not yet commenced when the Erwin contract was executed in April, the Chirichellas were confident that it would be completed by October unless unforeseen developments intervened. Their confidence proved to be unwarranted as the first settlement of the \u201cNew Home\u201d was scheduled for June 15, 1972. The record does not indicate when construction actually commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The June settlement on the \u201cNew Home\u201d never materialized because the Chirichellas claimed it was not completed \u201cin a workmanlike manner.\u201d In July, their attorney wrote to the realtor handling that transaction and itemized 84 alleged defects in the house. The testimony at trial reflects a clear-cut difference of opinion in that regard between the Chirichellas and a representative of the builder. The latter maintained that the house had been satisfactorily completed and implied that the Chirichellas were being unreasonable. In any event, settlement was rescheduled for two separate dates in August, but the Chirichellas persisted in their claim that the house was not yet ready for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>occupancy. Settlement has never occurred on the \u201cNew Home\u201d and it appears that it has been resold to another purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The first settlement of the contract on the house sold by the Chirichellas to the Erwins was also scheduled for June 15, 1972. Sometime prior to that date, but after October 1971, Mr. Erwin asked Mr. Chirichella to settle, but the latter refused because the \u201cNew Home\u201d was not ready. The Chirichellas did not appear at the June 15 settlement, and it was rescheduled for August 9. When that proved to be futile, the Erwins filed their suit on August 31,1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Although he was of the view that the Chirichellas\u2019 complaints concerning the \u201cNew Home\u201d were justified, the chancellor concluded that the provision for settlement inserted in the Erwin contract was not a condition precedent to performance, but merely a requirement that settlement take place during the month of October 1971, or within a reasonable time thereafter. And, since more than a reasonable time had elapsed, the Erwins were entitled to a decree for specific performance. We agree, and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Before this Court, the Chirichellas attack the chancellor\u2019s ruling on the same grounds raised below: That the contested provision was a condition precedent to performance on their part, and since that condition failed, the contract failed with it. They rely almost entirely on <em>Griffith v. Scheungrab, </em>219 Md. 27, 146 A. 2d 864 (1958) for this contention. This reliance is completely misplaced, as there we merely held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201c . . . <em>Where a contractual duty is subject to a condition 'precedent, . . </em>. there is no duty of performance and ... \u2018a decree for specific performance will not be granted unless conditions precedent, express, implied, or constructive, have all occurred or been performed.\u2019 (citations omitted).\u201d 219 Md. at 34-35 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">This argument begs the question. The issue is not whether there was a failure of a condition precedent, but whether the disputed clause indeed constitutes a condition precedent. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>have already indicated our agreement with the chancellor that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">A condition precedent has been defined as \u201ca fact, other than mere lapse of time, which, unless excused, must exist or occur before a duty of immediate performance of a promise arises,\u201d 17 Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts, \u00a7 320. Similar definitions may be found in <em>Bergman v. Parker, </em>216 A. 2d 581, 583 (D. C. App. 1966); <em>In Re Roberts\u2019 Estate, </em>190 Kan. 248, 373 P. 2d 165, 171 (1962); Corbin, <em>Conditions in the Law of Contract, </em>28 Yale L.J. 739, 747 (1919); 1 <em>Restatement of Contracts, </em>\u00a7 250 (1932); and 3A Corbin, <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 628 (1960). The question whether a stipulation in a contract constitutes a condition precedent is one of construction dependent on the intent of the parties to be gathered from the words they have employed and, in case of ambiguity, after resort to the other permissible aids to interpretation, 17A C.J.S. <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 338; <em>see United States v. Schaeffer, </em>319 F. 2d 907, 911 (9th Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>376 U. S. 943, 84 S. Ct. 798, 11 L. Ed. 2d 767 (1964). Although no particular form of words is necessary in order to create an express condition, such words and phrases as \u201cif\u201d and \u201cprovided that,\u201d are commonly used to indicate that performance has expressly been made conditional, <em>Beattie-Firth, Inc. v. Colebank, </em>143 W. Va. 740, 105 S.E.2d 5, 8-9 (1958), 74 A.L.R.2d 431; 17 Am. Jur. 2d, <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 320; as have the words \u201cwhen,\u201d \u201cafter,\u201d \u201cas soon as,\u201d or \u201csubject to,\u201d <em>id; </em>5 Williston, <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 671 (Jaeger Ed. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We turn then to the question of whether the language in controversy here meets the definition of a condition precedent, i.e., \u25a0 whether it may be read to mean that settlement on the \u201cNew Home in Kettering\u201d must have occurred before the Chirichellas\u2019 duty to settle with the Erwins arose. We think the provision in issue no more accomplishes that purpose than the words which it replaced. As we read the clause, \u201cCoincide with settlement of New Home in Kettering Approx. Oct. \u201971,\u201d it merely fixes a convenient and appropriate time for settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Although the amendment attempted to link one settlement with the other, its only effect was to insure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the October 1971 time designation not be regarded as of the essence. <em>Cf. String v. Steven Development Corporation, </em>269 Md. 569, 307 A. 2d 713, 718 (1973) where, given a form contract identical to that used here with \u201c130\u201d inserted in the blank space of the \u201csettlement clause,\u201d we held that time was not made of the essence; and that \u201cthe parties were required to settle within a reasonable period\u201d after the expiration of the time specified. <em>See Doering v. Fields, </em>187 Md. 484, 50 A. 2d 553 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Here, whatever might have been the consequence had the phrase, \u201cApprox. Oct. \u201971,\u201d not been added to the insertion, its inclusion effectively defeats the Chirichellas\u2019 argument. The result, as the chancellor ruled, was not to allow them to \u201cavoid the contract,\u201d but to \u201cdelay settlement for a reasonable period of time while the [new] house was completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In sum, the Chirichellas\u2019 duty to perform by settling under their contract with the Erwins was not subject to the condition precedent that they first settle on the new house. Hence, they were required to do so within a reasonable time after October 1971. As suggested by the chancellor, that time had long since expired by January 29, 1973, the day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed; appellants to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
