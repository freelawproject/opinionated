Cockrell, a member of the Bar of Maryland, respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">The petition alleges that Cockrell engaged in \u201cprofessional misconduct or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d This misconduct purportedly resulted from the respondent\u2019s representation of Alfred Mason in his claim against Frank J. Gach for personal injury and property damage which was the aftermath of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on January 24, 1970. The petition additionally states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>[The respondent in] a conversation with Mason on or about January 28, 1971, . . . advised [his client] that the property damage portion of Mason\u2019s claim had been inflated [from $135.00] to approximately $435.00 in Cockrell\u2019s dealings with Gach\u2019s insurer; and that the [insurance company\u2019s] adjuster, Alarid, would be willing to settle Mason\u2019s claims for $2,000.00 if he were paid a \u201ckick-back\u201d. Cockrell further advised that his fee would be $250.00, the medical bills were $250.00, and Mason would receive $800.00 out of the settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">Mason next met with Cockrell on or about May 18, 1971, at which time Mason was presented \u201ca settlement sheet\u201d showing a total fund of $2,500.00, and disbursements therefrom including an attorney\u2019s fee of $833.33 and a \u201creimbursement for monies advanced\u201d of $600.00. Mason signed this settlement sheet, indicating his approval of the disbursements listed; but he denies that any monies were ever advanced to him by Cockrell.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Based on these factual allegations, the petition then formally charged Cockrell with professional misconduct in that he disobeyed a number of the Disciplinary Rules contained in the Code of Professional Responsibility (Rule 1230 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) by (i) \u201crecommending and/or permitting his client to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>participate in misrepresentation\u201d to the insurance company concerning the amount of property damage suffered in violation of DR 1-102(A) and DR 7-102(A)(5) and (7); (ii) \u201coffering and/or paying a kick-back to the insurance adjuster\u201d in violation of DR 1-102(A)(3), (4) and (6); and (iii) either \u201cadvancing monies to his client beyond the expenses of litigation\u201d in violation of DR 5-103(B) or if the monies were not so advanced, then by presenting a settlement sheet to his client reciting such advances in violation of DR 1-102(A)(4) and (6), DR 7-101(A)(2) and (3) and DR 7-102(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">As authorized by Rule BV3 b, upon the filing of this petition, we directed that it be transmitted to the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City and designated Judges Albert L. Sklar, David Ross and Joseph C. Howard to hear the charges. These allegations were scheduled to be considered on May 22, 1973. However, when shortly before the day of the hearing Judge Howard became unable to participate, we named, on May 21, 1973, Judge Harry A. Cole as his replacement. At the beginning of the hearing, Cockrell requested a postponement averring that, because this change in the judicial panel became known to him only when he received a copy of our order in the morning mail, a continuance was required so as to provide the respondent with an opportunity \u201cto determine whether or not Judge Cole should be challenged for cause.\u201d The refusal to grant this delay constitutes one of the reasons the respondent assigns for his excepting to the report and recommendation of the Supreme Bench. For reasons of clarity and convenience it is more appropriate that we consider this issue now rather than at a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">First we mention that under Rule BY4 e the same rules of law, evidence and procedure as used in civil proceedings in equity are applicable in disciplinary hearings. And, under equity procedure, unless the discretion which rests with the chancellor in granting or refusing a request for postponement of a scheduled hearing is arbitrarily and prejudicially administered, it will not be disturbed by this Court. <em>Herring v. Herring, </em>251 Md. 516, 518-19, 248 A. 2d 117 (1968); <em>Fontana v. Walker, </em>249 Md. 459, 463, 240 A. 2d 268, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>393 U. S. 927 (1968); <em>Vermilya-Brown v. Dallas, </em>248 Md. 7, 13-14, 234 A. 2d 569 (1967). In this case the record discloses that when the request for continuance was made the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">COLE, J.: On the other hand, the fact that you want time to find out if you have a reason to object, do you have any reason to suggest to me why I should disqualify myself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">MR. COCKRELL: <em>None whatsoever.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOt\">SKLAR, J.: Then, the motion to continue the matter is denied on the grounds which have been stated, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Since Cockrell himself stated that he had no reason \u201cwhatsoever\u201d to suggest that Judge Cole be disqualified, we see no abuse of discretion by the hearing court when it denied the continuance requested merely to afford ,the respondent an opportunity to seek some possible basis for proposing the assignment of a different judge to the panel. With this disposition, we now consider the remaining reasons assigned by the respondent for his exceptions to the recommendation of the Supreme Bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">Following a four day session, the hearing court transmitted to this Court its conclusion that Cockrell was guilty of professional misconduct by violating Disciplinary Rules DR 5-103(B) and DR 9-102(A) and recommended that he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year. The court assigned the following reasons for its recommendation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-12\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule BV5 a, the following findings of fact are made:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-13\">By his own testimony, Respondent concedes that he made advancements to his client, Mason, in the amounts of $300, $150, and $150 on January 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>1971, January 22, 1971, and January 26, 1971. This, obviously, is in violation of DR 5-103(B).* 12<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">It is clear that the Respondent negotiated the check [received from the insurance company] no later than February 3, 1971, and, therefore, had cash in his possession no later than that date. The Respondent\u2019s testimony that he maintained these funds in his client\u2019s file in his office from that time until he finally settled by check with his client on May 18, 1971, is difficult to believe (which check when finally presented, bounced). The inescapable inference from all of the testimony is that during the period February 3, 1971, to late June, 1971, the Respondent misappropriated his client\u2019s funds. Therefore, it must be concluded he is in violation of DR 9-102(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">When the recommendation and reasons therefor were received in this Court, Cockrell, as permitted by Rule BV5 b, filed exceptions noting, in addition to the objection already discussed, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">1. The panel based its findings, decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>and recommendation on \u201cultra vires charges\u201d; or, in other words, recommended punishment for professional misconduct which had not been charged in the Bar Association\u2019s petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">2. The panel improperly suppressed the complainant\u2019s criminal records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">3. The panel failed to properly set forth the facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">In considering the respondent\u2019s failure of notice contention (number 1 above), we turn our attention to Rule BV3 c which provides: \u201c[t]he charges shall be in writing and shall be <em>sufficiently clear and specific </em>reasonably to inform the attorney proceeded against of any <em>misconduct </em>charged . . . .\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While this rule does not require that the charges be set forth in any certain form or in extensive detail, it does establish a requirement that the charges be \u201csufficiently clear and specific\u201d so as to make the attorney aware of what he is compelled to answer for and defend against. <em>See Braverman v. Bar Assn. of Balto., </em>209 Md. 328, 335-37, 121 A. 2d 473 <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U. S. 830 (1956). In fact any rule which did not require this degree of specificity would violate the minimum requirements of constitutional due process mandated by Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The hearing court, in recommending that disciplinary sanctions be imposed, found that Cockrell had \u201cmisappropriated his client\u2019s funds.\u201d If this is true, he has violated at least DR 1-102(A)(3) and (4) and DR 9-102(A) and (B)(4) of the Code of Professional Responsibility. <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 516-18, 307 A. 2d 677 (1973). However, any order now disciplining the respondent based on such a finding would be clearly violative of Rule BV3 c as respondent has not been charged in the Bar Association\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>petition with that particular misconduct. We say this because it cannot be validly contended that the failure to allege this charge in any form is a charge in writing \u201csufficiently clear and specific reasonably to inform the attorney proceeded against\u201d of the misconduct alleged. Our conclusion in this regard is not attenuated by the fact that the evidence upon which the hearing court\u2019s factual findings are based resulted largely from testimony given before the judicial panel by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Apparently recognizing that its petition as filed may not have contained the requisite allegations to support disciplinary sanctions based on a finding that the \u201crespondent misappropriated his client\u2019s funds,\u201d the Bar Association, at the oral argument before this Court, asked that it be granted leave to amend its pleading so as to make this additional charge. The interest of justice requires that we permit this requested amendment. However, we do so without prejudice to the respondent\u2019s prerogative to raise, first in the hearing court and then in this Court, an objection based on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>390 U. S. 544, 88 S. Ct. 1222, 20 L.Ed.2d 117 (1968), unless he elects to waive this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">As the panel of judges of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City to which the petition was originally transmitted has already made a factual determination and recommendation based on those facts which concern the possible additional allegations of professional misconduct, we believe it is more appropriate that any additional charge or charges which may be contained in an amendment to the petition should be considered by a different panel. Accordingly, we grant the Bar Association twenty days from the date of this opinion and order within which to file its amendment to the petition; and, if it is so filed, we will then designate the judicial panel to hear any additional charges made. Consideration as to a proper disposition of the charges made in the original petition will be deferred until such time as the entire proceeding can be concluded by this Court.
