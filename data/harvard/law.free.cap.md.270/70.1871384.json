Friel, </em>210 Md. 274, 123 A. 2d 303 (1956), the determination made by the trial court was a narrow one: that the plaintiffs\u2019 action was barred by Uniform Commercial Code (the UCC) \u00a7 4-406 (4), Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol.) Art. 95B, \u00a7 4-406 (4), which the defendant had specially pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The appellant Charles R. Wolfe was one of three general partners of the co-appellant, Watkins Glen Limited Partnership (Watkins Glen). In March, 1969, Watkins Glen opened a checking account with the predecessor of University National Bank (the Bank) in Rockville, Maryland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Through December, 1969, Watkins Glen\u2019s agreement with the Bank required that checks on the Watkins Glen account be signed by any two of its then three general partners: Wolfe, Per Olof Holtze and Wolfgang H. Altmann.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From and after 31 December 1969, Watkins Glen\u2019s agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>required that checks on its account be signed by either Wolfe and Per Olof Holtze <em>or </em>Wolfe and Paul S. Waymoth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">During the period 27 October 1969 through 18 September 1970, 37 checks totalling $235,012.02, each bearing only one signature, were drawn on Watkins Glen\u2019s account, and paid by the Bank. Of the 37 checks, 31 were signed by Holtze; five, by Waymoth; and one, by Wolfe. Seven of the checks, six of which were signed by Holtze, in the aggregate amount of $222,900.00, were payable to Holtze Corporation. In August, 1972, Wolfe and Watkins Glen brought suit against the Bank, their declaration sounding in contract and tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Although no notice had been given the Bank until March, 1972, it was stipulated that monthly statements, together with the canceled checks, had been sent during the period November, 1969 to September, 1970 to Watkins Glen\u2019s office, where they were reconciled by Waymoth\u2019s assistant, and were at all times accessible to Wolfe.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">In contending that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the Bank relied upon those provisions of the UCC which impose upon a customer the duty to examine statements received from a bank and report an unauthorized signature within one year from date of receipt. The provisions are found in UCC \u00a7 4-406 (1) and (4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">\u201c(1) When a bank sends to its customer a statement of account accompanied by items paid in good faith in support of the debit entries or holds the statement and items pursuant to a request or instructions of its customer or otherwise in a reasonable manner makes the statement and items available to the customer, the customer must exercise reasonable care and promptness to examine the statement and items to discover his unauthorized signature or any alteration on an item and must notify the bank promptly after discovery thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201c(4) Without regard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank a customer who does not within one year from the time the statement and items are made available to the customer (subsection (1)[)1 discover and report his unauthorized signature or any alteration on the face or back of the item or does not within three years from that time discover and report any unauthorized indorsement is precluded from asserting against the bank such unauthorized signature or indorsement or such alteration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We dealt with the effect of UCC \u00a7 4-406 (4) on an unauthorized signature in <em>Taylor v. Equitable Trust Co., </em>269 Md. 149, 160-61, 304 A. 2d 838, 844-45 (1973), and referred there to <em>Union Trust Co. v. Soble, </em>192 Md. 427, 64 A. 2d 744 (1949), a pre-UCC case, which held that a depositor was precluded from asserting a claim against his bank on an unauthorized endorsement if he failed to act within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The view which we take of this case, which is markedly different from that taken by the trial court, makes \u00a7 4-406 (4) only of tangential interest. As we see it, and are prepared to hold, despite the fact that we neither have been referred to, nor have we found a case in point, a single signature on a check drawn against an account on which two signatures are required is not necessarily an <em>unauthorized </em>signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">UCC \u00a7 4-401 sets forth the circumstances under which a bank may charge its customer\u2019s account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">\u201c(1) As against its customer, a bank may charge against his account any item which is otherwise properly payable from that account. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Here, the Watkins Glen partnership was a \u201ccustomer\u201d of the Bank.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Watkins Glen\u2019s signature was comprised of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>individual signatures,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as provided for in its contract with the Bank. Consequently, since Watkins Glen\u2019s signature did not appear on any of the 37 checks in question, the partnership cannot be held liable on them, UCC \u00a7 3-401 (l),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Bank may not properly charge them to Watkins Glen\u2019s account,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in the absence of circumstances which alter the usual rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">UCC \u00a7 4-406 is inapplicable here because it is only concerned with unauthorized signatures and alterations. An \u201cunauthorized signature,\u201d \u201cmeans one made without actual, implied or apparent authority and includes a forgery,\u201d UCC \u00a7 1-201 (43). UCC \u00a7 3-407 (1) gives examples of material alterations, none of which is relevant here. The signatures of Holtze, Waymoth, and Wolfe were not forged, not made without authority, nor did they constitute an alteration of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Either Holtze\u2019s and Wolfe\u2019s signature at all times or Wolfe\u2019s signature and Waymoth\u2019s after 31 December 1969 was an <em>authorized </em>signature. The infirmity lay not in the presence of an unauthorized signature on the check, but in the absence of a second authorized signature, that of either Wolfe or Altmann prior to 31 December 1969, or that of Wolfe thereafter \u2014 a second signature which was essential, under the agreement with the Bank.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">It naturally follows that the motion for summary judgment should not have been granted, because the one-year period of limitations imposed by \u00a7 4-406 (4) did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>apply, and because Wolfe\u2019s claim was asserted by bringing suit in August, 1972, well within the three-year period allowed by Code (1957,1972 Repl. Vol.) Art. 57, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We must not be understood as intimating what success, if any, Wolfe or the partnership may achieve on remand. There may well be defenses available to the Bank, never developed during the procedural stage of the controversy, which could effectively preclude recovery. Such defenses might encompass those available at common law, UCC \u00a7 1-103, if the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the UCC prove inapplicable. UCC \u00a7 1-103 operates \u201cas a general adoption of common law principles to commercial transactions, where the code provisions do not apply to replace them,\u201d <em>Gorge Lumber Co. v. Brazier Lumber Co., </em>6 Wash. App. 327, 493 P. 2d 782, 787 (1972). <em>See also Chicago Roller Skate Mfg. Co. v. Sokol Mfg. Co., </em>185 Neb. 515, 517, 177 N.W.2d 25, 26 (1970) (The UCC \u201ccontemplates that it shall be supplemented by existing principles of law and equity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, case remanded for further proceedings, costs to abide the result.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\">. On 1 July 1970, Montgomery Bank and Trust Company was merged into University National Bank, which assumed the obligations of its predecessor.
