Such challenges based on the length of prison time already served are rare: Most claims of constitutionally excessive punishment challenge sentences when first imposed, looking prospectively at the time the offender\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   serve. Such challenges rarely succeed, as courts generally defer to determinations of the punishments appropriate to particular offenses made by legislative representatives of the People. Indeterminately sentenced inmates, however, serve terms whose length is fixed not by the Legislature but by the decisions of the Board of Parole Hearings (Board) as to whether and when the prisoner has become \"suitable\" for release on parole. As will be seen, the serial denials of parole Palmer experienced resulted in punishment so disproportionate to his individual culpability for the offense he committed, that it must be deemed constitutionally excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Palmer's incarceration began in 1988, when, at age 17, he pled guilty to kidnapping for robbery and was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. He became eligible for parole in 1996 and, over the next 19 years, had 10 parole suitability hearings at which parole was denied. The present petition was filed against the backdrop of ongoing litigation challenging the denial of parole at a hearing in 2015: We initially granted Palmer's petition for writ of habeas corpus on a ground that was subsequently rejected by the California Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    In re Butler\n   </em>\n   (2018)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514369\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/230/736/\">\n    4 Cal.5th 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514369\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/230/736/\">\n    230 Cal.Rptr.3d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514369\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/230/736/\">\n    413 P.3d 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ), then subsequently granted the petition on the alternative ground we had originally not addressed.

The punishment for Palmer's offense, kidnapping for robbery, is not a legislatively specified number of years; it is simply \"imprisonment in the state prison for life with the possibility of parole.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\u00a7 209.) The number of years an inmate actually serves under such a sentence is determined not by the Legislature but by the Board's decision whether to grant or deny release on parole. For indeterminately sentenced life prisoners, the Legislative direction is only that the Board \"shall normally grant parole\" unless \"consideration of the public safety requires a more\n   lengthy period of incarceration for this individual.\" (\u00a7 3041, subds. (a)(2) &amp; (b)(1).) The Board decides whether to grant release on parole based on its determination of the prisoner's \"suitability\" for release (\u00a7\u00a7 3041, 3041.5), a determination that focuses on the inmate's current dangerousness, and is largely governed by postconviction conduct and personal development.

In accordance with\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and related cases, the California Legislature enacted statutes that require the Board, at parole suitability hearings for \"youth offenders,\" to \"give great weight\" to the diminished culpability of youth as compared to adults, the hallmark features of youth, and any subsequent growth and increased maturity of the prisoner in accordance with relevant case law (\u00a7\u00a7 4801, subd.

Significantly, since first enacted, the youth offender statutes have increased the age of the offenders to whom they apply from 18 years, to 23 years, to the current 25 years. (Stats. 2015, ch. 471, \u00a7 1; Stats. 2017, ch. 674, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.)

After the family moved from a low-income area to one with \"predominantly wealthier kids,\" Palmer's self-esteem suffered and he committed crimes and used drugs in order to be accepted by his peers, \"have the things that they had\" and \"do the things they were doing.\" He admitted his first offense, driving without a license, in\n   July 1985. In February 1986, at age 15, he admitted a felony violation of section 288a, but later insisted he was not guilty of this offense; psychological reports indicate that Palmer acknowledged having observed masturbation by younger boys whom his mother was supervising in foster care, but he insisted he did not touch them as they alleged. He was placed on probation, which he then violated with two charges of robbery, burglary, and attempted burglary. Palmer committed the life offense after being fired from a job in Palm Springs that he had valued, explaining afterward that he needed money quickly, had no other way to get it because he could not find a friend to drive him to Palm Springs to pick up a paycheck, and considered selling drugs but thought it would be \"easier to just take the money from someone else.\" At a parole hearing years later, Palmer called this a \"poor decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A psychological report from 1988 stated that Palmer's \"unstable family situation\" and \"chronic substance abuse\" appeared to be factors contributing to his delinquency. Testing indicated he was \"easily aroused by emotionally loaded situations\" and \"likely to respond in an impulsive and at times aggressive manner,\" had \"poor behavior controls\" and had \"not identified with an adult male figure.\" According to one report, testing showed him to be a \"self-serving, egocentric, assertive, forceful personality with sociopathic tendencies who lacks a strong internalized value system and sensitivity to other persons and who views the acquisition of money as the panacea for all of his problems,\" and \"a self-conscious personality with narcissistic traits and strong affiliative and social needs for approval and dominance to compensate for underlying feelings of weak self-esteem and insecurity.\" Appellant stated at his 2013 parole hearing that while he had been a \"leader\" in his old environment, after the move he \"started at the bottom\" and \"did whatever it\n   took to fit in,\" committing thefts and burglaries rather than working to get the things he wanted because his \"low self-esteem\" and \"wanting to be accepted by others\" overcame the values he had been raised with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The impulsiveness, low esteem and need for social acceptance reflected in appellant's self-evaluation and others' evaluations of him is consistent with the United States Supreme Court's observations about juveniles' culpability compared to that of adults. \"Inexperience, less education, and less intelligence make the teenager less able to evaluate the consequences of his or her conduct while at the same time he or she is much more apt to be motivated by mere emotion or peer pressure than is an adult.

As a 17-year-old high school dropout, Palmer made an impulsive 'spur of the moment' decision to turn an attempted robbery with an unloaded gun into a kidnapping for robbery, during the course of which Palmer was shot by the victim. Years later at his 2013 parole hearing, Palmer reflected that asking the victim if he had a bank card \"didn't make any sense. Because if you don't have a wallet, you don't have any credit cards in your\n   [pocket], why would you have a bank card just sitting in your pocket? But later you have the time to figure that part out. But he said yes. And he had it in his car. So I said, Okay. Well, let's just all go to the-let's both go to the bank, and you can get it out and give me the money.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   That Palmer, at the time, had no idea of the consequences of his conduct is demonstrated by his question to the police officer who waited with him at the emergency room: \" 'What will I get for doing this, six months or a year in custody?' \" As appellant points out, had he not made the on the spot decision to make Compton drive to the ATM, he would have faced at most a sentence of seven years (five years for second degree robbery or three years for attempted robbery, plus a two-year firearm enhancement).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   As with the\n   defendant in\n   <em>\n    Dillon,\n   </em>\n   the characteristic immaturity and impulsiveness of youth is evident here. Palmer's crime was by no means trivial, but more than 30 years in prison is a consequence far out of proportion to the danger he posed or actual harm he inflicted as a 17 year old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Respondent's assessment of the nature of the offender aspect of the\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   analysis is devoid of any recognition of the significance of Palmer's youth at the time of the offense, or of any of the circumstances of his background other than his criminal conduct. Respondent argues that \"[d]espite being 17, Palmer admittedly had a criminal, adult mind set,\" citing examples such as Palmer saying he committed the commitment offense because he needed money and getting it honestly had not worked out, telling his mother after his arrest that he had tried it one too many times, and telling a counselor, \"I will make the change from a criminal to a law abiding citizen.\" Respondent fails to explain how such statements by a 17 year old demonstrate \"adult\" thinking rather than juvenile failure to appreciate and weigh consequences and exercise judgment in the face of perceived inequities and misguided desire to achieve social status. Similarly, respondent points to Palmer's admission of having committed a number of burglaries for which he was not caught as evidence of his culpability, but does not address the fact that these offenses were committed before Palmer was even 17 years of age, for the same misguided reasons as the commitment offense. To be sure, Palmer acted to achieve the goal of obtaining money, as respondent says, despite the consequences his action would have for Compton, but respondent ignores the possibility-supported by the science discussed above-that his conduct and mindset could reflect impulsivity and underdeveloped judgment and sense of responsibility rather than a necessarily entrenched criminal mindset. The evaluations conducted in 1988 to which respondent points, which discuss Palmer's antisocial tendencies outweighing his motivation to improve, suffer the same flaw; these evaluations, of course, predate the relatively\n   recent increased scientific and judicial recognition of the degree to which juvenile and adult brain function differs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is telling that Palmer did not remain in prison for 30-plus years because of any assessment that his culpability for the crime he committed warranted such lengthy incarceration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Palmer became eligible for parole over 20 years ago. As we have described in our prior opinions, he was subsequently denied parole not because of the seriousness of his offense or criminal history, or even because of violent conduct in prison\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (which would not, in any case, bear on the proportionality of his punishment), but because of minor disciplinary issues seen as bearing on his judgment and impulse control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We are convinced that in light of Palmer's age at the time of the offense and attendant diminishment of his culpability, and the facts that he attempted to minimize the danger he posed by using an unloaded weapon and did not physically injure his victim, that his continued incarceration has become so disproportionate to his individual culpability as to be \"constitutionally excessive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Butler, supra,\n   </em>\n   4 Cal.5th at p. 745,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514369\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/230/736/\">\n    230 Cal.Rptr.3d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514369\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/230/736/\">\n    413 P.3d 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As any one of the three\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   factors may be sufficient to demonstrate the disproportionality of a sentence (\n   <em>\n    Mendez, supra,\n   </em>\n   188 Cal.App.4th at pp. 64-65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20870\">\n    114 Cal.Rptr.3d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Nunez, supra,\n   </em>\n   173 Cal.App.4th at p. 725,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20242\">\n    93 Cal.Rptr.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), our analysis need not go\n   further.

Palmer offers various examples of crimes more serious in terms of dangerousness, resulting harm and/or moral reprehensibility for which the maximum prison term is less than half the 30 years he has already served. These include: 11 years for voluntary manslaughter (unlawfully killing a person without malice, upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion) (\u00a7 193, subd.

Here, of course, the augmented penalty is not at issue. More importantly, with respect to culpability in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   case, Palmer used an unloaded gun in an effort to avoid inflicting injury. This fact also bears on\n   <em>\n    Maston\n   </em>\n   's statement that \"[b]y its very nature [kidnapping] involves violence or forcible restraint.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20164\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) In using an unloaded weapon to compel his victim's compliance, Palmer clearly caused the victim to fear for his safety and life; the victim did not know the gun was not loaded. But compared to a similar offense committed with a loaded gun or other weapon capable of inflicting deadly injury, Palmer's intentional attempt to reduce the potential for injury obviously lessens his culpability. He could not have anticipated that his victim would be an off-duty police officer armed with his own weapon-and Palmer himself was the only person\n   injured in the course of the offense. While the asportation element of the offense entailed an inherent risk of harm such as a traffic accident (\n   <em>\n    In re Earley, supra,\n   </em>\n   14 Cal.3d at pp. 132-133,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20881\">\n    120 Cal.Rptr. 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=534%20P.2d%20721\">\n    534 P.2d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), such harms did not materialize. \"[T]he consequences of the defendant's actions inform the nature of the offense and are important in assessing the constitutional penalty the state may impose.\" (\n   <em>\n    In re Nunez, supra\n   </em>\n   , 173 Cal.App.4th at p. 726,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20242\">\n    93 Cal.Rptr.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Maston\n   </em>\n   also reasoned that because kidnapping for robbery requires movement of the victim that is more than \"incidental to the robbery\" and increases the risk of bodily harm, kidnapping for robbery \"possesses elements of deliberation comparable to those of kidnapping for ransom,\" which the court described as \"coldly planned deliberate schemes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Maston, supra,\n   </em>\n   33 Cal.App.3d at p 563,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20164\">\n    109 Cal.Rptr. 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Regardless of the accuracy of that conclusion in general, in the present case, while the\n   <em>\n    robbery\n   </em>\n   component of Palmer's offense was obviously premeditated and planned, the\n   <em>\n    kidnapping\n   </em>\n   was not; it was a spontaneous response to the victim telling Palmer he did not have money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Respondent's comparison to the penalty for kidnapping for robbery with bodily harm ignores the actual circumstances of Palmer's offense. Moreover, it has no relevance with respect to a juvenile\n   offender: Whatever the constitutionality of section 209 's augmented penalty for an adult offender, a juvenile offender cannot be subjected to a mandatory sentence of life without parole.

Palmer understates the potential maximum penalties some of these offenses would carry by ignoring the additional sentence they would carry for a perpetrator using a firearm in commission of the offense. Even taking enhancement for firearm use into account, however, the 30-plus years Palmer has served greatly exceeds the maximum sentence possible for these offenses. Voluntary manslaughter is an unlawful killing of a human being (albeit without malice), but, with the maximum firearm enhancement, can be punished with no more than 21 years imprisonment; assault with a machine gun threatens extreme danger but subjects the perpetrator to no more than 22 years; rape of a child under age 14, with firearm use, carries a maximum of 23 years; poisoning a water supply with a potentially deadly substance could expose any number of people to a mortal threat but can be punished with a sentence no longer than eight years, or 18 if\n   a firearm were somehow used in such an offense. Moreover, these are examples of sentences for\n   <em>\n    adult\n   </em>\n   perpetrators, and\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   enhancement sentences, which would be difficult to justify for an unloaded firearm. Considering the far more serious effect of or danger posed by these offenses, a sentence of more than 30 years for an impulsive 17 year old's attempt to commit robbery by using an unloaded gun to force a man to drive to an ATM is so clearly disproportionate that it \"shocks the conscience.\" (\n   <em>\n    Dillon, supra,\n   </em>\n   34 Cal.3d at p. 478,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20390\">\n    194 Cal.Rptr. 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=668%20P.2d%20697\">\n    668 P.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The third\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   technique calls for comparison of Palmer's punishment that he would be subjected to in other jurisdictions for the same offense.

The fact that-as will be discussed-many states authorize punishment of up to life in prison for a kidnapping in facially similar circumstances (i.e., for the purpose of robbery, with use of a firearm and without injury to the victim) is\n   of limited significance without knowing whether and how such states would account for matters such as the facts that the firearm was not loaded and appellant was 17 years old. In general, reliance upon an interstate comparison may be subject to the criticism leveled by respondent here, that even if California imposes the harshest penalty for a given offense, this does not necessarily demonstrate the penalty is constitutionally excessive. (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Nevertheless, a few points are worth making.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Palmer has compiled information on the sentence prescribed for his offense in all 50 states, the accuracy of which respondent expressly declines to challenge, and we rely upon it for purposes of this discussion. (See\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez, supra,\n   </em>\n   14 Cal.3d at p. 656,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20552\">\n    122 Cal.Rptr. 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=537%20P.2d%20384\">\n    537 P.2d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) According to this information, the 30 years Palmer has spent in prison equals or exceeds the\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   sentence applicable to his offense (taking into account his use of a firearm) in 21 states. Over half of these (12) impose a maximum of 20 years or fewer and five of which impose a maximum of 15 years or fewer. These maximums are for\n   sentences imposed on adults. Thus, even without accounting for Palmer's youth-which, at the risk of tiresome repetition, is of crucial importance in analyzing his culpability for the offense-Palmer has already served a decade more than the longest term permitted for his offense in 12 states, and at least five years more than the longest permissible term in another five states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Twenty-eight states permit a maximum penalty greater than 30 years for the offense of kidnapping for robbery, at least where a firearm is used. In eight of these, the maximum is a term of years-35 years in one state, 40 years in two states, 45 years in two others, 50 in two, 60 in two, and 99 in two others. Sixteen states allow up to a life sentence. Notably, however, none of these states\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   imposition of the maximum permissible term. Some allow a life term only in certain circumstances and otherwise specify a significantly lower sentence. For example, in one state a life term can be imposed only if the court finds there are \"substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .94A.535 ), and the standard sentencing range appears to be roughly five to seven years. ( Wash. Rev. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 9.94A.510, 9.94A.515 [level X] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In another, the specified sentence is 11 to 40 years unless a unanimous jury selects a life sentence. (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2097-3-53\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 97-3-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97-37-37(2).) Most of the states specify a range of permissible terms (e.g., five to 60 years) or a term of \"up to\" life. Among states prescribing a specific range, the minimum terms vary from a low of three (one state), five (six states) or six years (one state) to a high of 40 years (one state), with nine states in between, requiring minimum terms of 10 (two states), 15 (two states) or 20 years (five states). Unlike California, the states that permit sentences as long or longer than the term Palmer has served so far allow the actual length of the sentence for this offense to be determined as appropriate in an individual case-and appear to contemplate terms far short of 30 years in nonaggravated cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Respondent's argument that Palmer's information shows California is not out of step with the majority of the country is necessarily based on a comparison of maximum allowable sentences, not actual sentences imposed, and therefore misses the point. Another of respondent's arguments-that because many states permit sentences of life\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   parole for nonviolent offenses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"California is not an outlier\"-misses the point for a different reason. As we have said, no state can constitutionally impose a sentence of\n   life without possibility of parole upon a juvenile offender.

Respondent's attempt to demonstrate the proportionality of Palmer's sentence by comparing it to a sentence to which Palmer could not be subjected completely ignores \"the circumstances existing at the time of the offense\"-precisely the circumstances that are the measure of individual culpability and therefore constitutional proportionality.

However well such conditions might serve both Palmer himself and the public, their existence as conditions of parole demonstrates that Palmer is not free from restraint. And these are only two of 29 \"Special Conditions of Parole\" that affect most aspects of Palmer's life.

At that time, respondent argues, Palmer had served 27 years in prison and knew the five-year denial would result in him serving more than 30 years. Respondent thus appears to take the position that Palmer was required to decide in advance the point at which he would claim his prison term had become constitutionally disproportionate, and present this claim as soon as he realized he would in fact serve that length of time. This position ignores the difficulty faced by a prisoner serving an indeterminate life term. Historically, it was the absence of any yardstick by which to gauge the proportionality of a given inmate's sentence (within the permissible statutory range under the former indeterminate sentencing law) that led the California Supreme Court to require the Board to set a maximum term, based solely on the circumstances of the crime and not postconviction factors, to facilitate prisoners' ability to seek, and courts' ability to provide, meaningful review.

But it is worth noting that the character of the present California prison population raises some question whether indeterminate sentencing has been \"largely abandoned.\" In December 2017, when reliable estimates were most recently made, our total prison population consisted of 130,263 inmates. Of that figure, 34,388 inmates (27,431 lifers and 6,957 third-strikers) were indeterminately sentenced life prisoners. (Cal. Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Offender Data Points (2017), Div. of Internal Oversight &amp; Research, Offender Data Points (2017) Populations, p. 6.) In other words, over one-quarter (26.4%) of the total prison population are lifers, whose punishment is determined by the Board. The number of indeterminately sentenced prisoners now confined in California prisons is therefore now\n    <em>\n     twice\n    </em>\n    the size of the entire population of indeterminately sentenced prisoners in 1975, when\n    <em>\n     Wingo\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Rodriguez\n    </em>\n    were decided, which was 17,296 inmates.

The Board's published statistics raise some question as to how the Board applies the constitutional, statutory and scientific recognition of this diminished culpability to its parole suitability determinations, as youth offenders do not appear to have been granted parole more frequently than adult offenders. According to the Board's \"2017 Report of Significant Events,\" of 2,586 youth offender hearings scheduled by the Board in 2017, 458 resulted in parole being granted-17.7 percent. (Board of Parole Hearings, 2017 Report of Significant Events (May 14, 2018) p. 1.) This rate is not much different than the rate for adults during the same period: Parole was granted in 457 of the 2,748 adult offender cases scheduled for hearing-16.6 percent. Looked at conversely, 1,033 youth offenders were denied parole (about 40 percent), while 1,184 adult offenders were denied (43 percent).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Along similar lines, it has been noted that some of the factors viewed by the Board as tending to favor denial of parole, such as \"a history of being abused and living in a criminogenic environment as a child,\" while \"the law flowing from\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n    is clear that a history of abuse, a criminogenic environment, and negative peer influence are mitigating factors in considering culpability and the appropriate sentence for a juvenile.\" (Bell, A Stone of Hope: Legal and Empirical Analysis of Juvenile Lifer Parole Decisions (2018), forthcoming in Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties L.Rev., vol. 54; Corrections &amp; Sentencing L. &amp; Policy eJournal, p. 75 (Corrections &amp; Sentencing) &lt; https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?Abstract _id=3228681&gt; [as of Apr. 5, 2019].)
