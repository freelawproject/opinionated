A pair of decisions from the Third Appellate District carved out three exceptions to this general rule. First, under\n   <em>\n    Haywood v. American River Protection Dist\n   </em>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Application for Disability Retirement of Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   (2013) CalPERS Precedential Dec. No. 12-01 (\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Linda Martinez, a former state employee, settled the termination for cause action against her, and agreed to resign and not\n   re-apply for employment with the agency she was leaving. Her application for disability retirement was denied by the CalPERS Board of Administration (Board). Joined by her union, the Service Employees International Union, Local 1000 (SEIU), Martinez challenged the soundness and continued validity of\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , particularly as extended in\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   . Her challenge failed during her administrative appeal, and was rejected by the trial court that denied her petition for mandate relief, which concluded that\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   \"set out the relevant law\" and were binding as stare decisis. The trial court further concluded that \"\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   is a reasonable extension of\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\" and, moreover, was entitled to \"substantial weight\" due to \"the\n   agency's area of expertise.\" We agree with both of these conclusions, and in doing so we reject the contention of Martinez and SEIU that a 2008 enactment tacitly \"superseded\"\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The salient details are without dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Martinez began work for the State in 1985. In 2001, she commenced working at the State Department of Social Services (DSS); she also served in various positions with SEIU, eventually becoming Secretary-Treasurer of the regional District Labor Council. In 2014, DSS moved to terminate her employment with a Notice of Adverse Action (NOAA), citing numerous grounds for her dismissal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Believing this action \"was taken in retaliation for her union activities,\" and having already filed an unfair labor practices complaint, Martinez prepared to contest the dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2014, the parties negotiated a settlement, under which DSS agreed to pay Martinez $30,000, withdraw the NOAA, and remove certain matters from her personnel file. Martinez agreed to \"voluntarily resign from her position ... effective at the close of business on September 30, 2014. [DSS] hereby accepts Martinez's voluntary resignation as of the day of the execution of this settlement agreement [September 22, 2014].\" Martinez agreed \"she will never again apply for or accept any employment position\" with DSS, which \"agree[d] to cooperate with any application for disability retirement filed by Martinez within the next six months.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Martinez duly filed her disability retirement application, claiming she could no longer function as a \"disability eval[uation] analyst\" because of various job-related conditions. In June 2015 CalPERS notified her \"Your application has been cancelled.\" Citing\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   , CalPERS explained: \"We have determined that you were dismissed from employment for reasons which were not the result of a disabling medical condition. Additionally, the dismissal does not appear to be for the purpose of preventing a claim for disability retirement. Therefore, you are not eligible for disability retirement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Martinez appealed the denial to the Board. Her appeal was heard by an Administrative Law Judge, who concluded \"the decision made by CalPERS to\n   cancel [Martinez's] application for disability retirement was correct.\" The Board adopted\n   the Administrative Law Judge's proposed decision, and denied Martinez's petition for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Martinez and SEIU filed a petition against CalPERS, its Board, and DSS (named as \"real party in interest\") for a writ of mandate (both traditional and administrative) ordering the Board to \"set aside and reverse\" its decision. Reiterating the position they took before the Board, Martinez and SEIU sought to have the trial court \"overrule\"\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   and \"disavow\"\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   because they \"misconstrue and misapply the California Public Employees' Retirement Law ... and result in the harsh forfeiture of public employees' disability retirement rights, in contravention of the California Constitution and principles of equity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Perhaps recognizing that asking a trial court to flout stare decisis by \"disavowing\" higher court decisions was, to say the least, a long-shot, Martinez and SEIU's alternate approach was to get the court \"to distinguish Martinez's case from the\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   cases on the grounds that ... DSS contractually promised in a Settlement Agreement to ... cooperate with the disability retirement application ... DSS was aware ... Martinez intended to imminently file. ... State of California ... agencies, their employees, and the labor unions that represent employees will be discouraged from settling disputes if, despite the parties' express contractual stipulations, [the] Board prohibits employees from pursuing disability retirement on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   the precedents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Martinez and SEIU further alleged that \"CalPERS members, such as Petitioner Martinez and other SEIU Local 1000 unit members, have the vested right to retirement benefits including ... disability retirement benefits.\" And, they alleged, in denying Martinez's application for those benefits, the Board violated the Contract Clauses of the state and federal constitutions ( Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9 ; U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1 ) and its duty to administer the CalPERS system \"in a manner that will assure prompt delivery of benefits ... to the participants.\" (See Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 17, subds. (a)-(b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The petition's concluding allegation was that the Board has \"a duty to comply with Article XVI, section 17 of the California Constitution and ... to process disability retirement applications on the merits even where an employer has issued the applicant a notice ... terminating their employment,\" which overrode the Board's \"practice of cancelling the disability retirement applications of SEIU Local 1000's members such as [ ] Martinez on the sole ground that the applicants have at one point received a notice of termination from their employer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court denied the petition with a 31-page written order. Although it expressed considerable disagreement and unease with the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded they \"set out the relevant law\" and must be followed. In addition to concluding that \"\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   is a reasonable extension of\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\" the court stated it \"gives substantial weight to administrative decisions interpreting statutes and case law within the agency's area of expertise,\" and thus \"will give effect to\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard Of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"A public employee has a fundamental vested right to a disability pension if he or she is in fact disabled. [Citation.] Accordingly, the trial court was authorized to apply its independent judgment as to the weight of the evidence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Beckley v. Board of Administration etc\n   </em>\n   .

The trial court in this case did so. Ordinarily, a reviewing court would examine the record to determine if substantial evidence supported the trial court's judgment. (E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Fukuda v.

However, with undisputed facts, this appeal presents only issues of law, which will receive our independent review. (E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Yuba City Unified School Dist. v.

The first merely moved the words \"in the state service\" within the statute. (Stats. 2006, ch. 118, \u00a7 10.) The second, in 2008, divided the statute into subdivisions and added what is now subdivision (a)(2). (Stats. 2008, ch. 370, \u00a7 3.) That subdivision, which is the keystone for all the arguments advanced by appellants, provides: \"In determining whether a member is eligible to retire for disability, the board or governing body of the contracting agency shall make a determination on the basis\n   of competent medical opinion and shall not use disability retirement as a substitute for the disciplinary process.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As appellants see it, \"The outcome of this case should begin and end with ... section 21156 [, subdivision] (a)(2),\" which in their view mandates that determinations of eligibility for disability retirement can only be made on the basis of competent medical opinion. Appellants submit that\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   has been \"superseded\" by subdivision (a)(2) in that \"the\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   court examined Haywood's disciplinary history rather than medical evidence of his disability, in clear contravention of current statutory authority,\" that is, subdivision (a)(2), \"and then created the requirement that a disabled retiree have the potential for reinstatement.\" And, appellants go on,\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   's creation of the \"potential for reinstatement\" requirement was created out of the blue, \"is unsupported by any law, whatsoever, past or present,\" and \"conflicts with the current statutory scheme.\" Moreover, the concept of the \"potential for reinstatement\" is \"inconsistent with past and present statutes\" allowing for reinstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The same is also true with respect to what appellants treat as \"\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   's underlying rationale,\" namely, the creation of \"the unable/unwilling dichotomy to assure disability retirement benefits would be provided only to persons unable to work rather than those who are unwilling.\" This dichotomy, they assert was also overturned by the enactment of subdivision (a)(2), which \"assures disability retirement is available only to employees unable to perform job duties, not those unwilling to.\" \"While the unable/unwilling dichotomy might have been a helpful analytical tool for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   , the legislative requirement that disability retirement eligibility determinations be made on the basis of competent medical opinion would resolve the problem\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   presented.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Next, appellants argue that\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   's\"interpretation\" of section 21193\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   -which covers reinstatement when an employee determined to be no longer \"incapacitated for duty\"-is \"inconsistent\" with the \"recent interpretation\" of that statute in\n   <em>\n    California Dept. of Justice v.

According to appellants, that decision \"establishes that when it is unknown whether an individual is\n   eligible for state employment, the former employer's mandatory duty to extend an offer of reinstatement to the employee continues. The employer cannot create conditions that undermine its mandatory reinstatement obligations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Pointing to statutes allowing former employees terminated for cause to apply for reinstatement (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 18941, 20969.3, 21190-21203), appellants conclude that the Public Employees Retirement Law \"does not establish, either expressly or by clear implication, that dismissal for cause precludes individuals otherwise eligible for disability retirement from receiving disability retirement benefits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Turning to\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , appellants argue \"following\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   held 'dismissal for cause consequently extinguished [Smith's] right to a disability retirement,' \" And by doing so, \"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   failed to consider medical evidence in order to determine whether the plaintiff was eligible for disability retirement, contrary to the present statutory requirements.

Failing to recognize this distinction,\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   erroneously applied\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   's analysis of section 19583.1 to section 21193, where it does not lie because section 21193 deals solely with reinstatement. By resting its conclusion on section 19583.1, applicable only to employees terminated for cause,\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   ignores cases such as the present matter where employees have resigned pursuant to a settlement agreement and the termination for cause has been withdrawn.\n   <em>\n    Such individuals remain eligible for reinstatement\n   </em>\n   .

Said otherwise, individuals who resign pursuant to settlement agreements with reemployment waivers remain potentially eligible for reinstatement to every state agency except the one from which they resigned by mutual agreement to settle a dispute. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot,\n   </em>\n   like\n   <em>\n    Haywood,\n   </em>\n   overstates the so-called 'complete severance' of the employer-employee relationship.

In light of their full frontal assault on\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , appellants do not maintain that\n   Martinez can establish that the conduct which led to her termination was the product of the same conditions for which she would claim a disability retirement. Nor do they contend that Martinez had a matured entitlement to a disability retirement prior to DSS commencing the process to terminate her employment and appellants have abandoned their argument to the Board that principles of equity will support the existence of such a matured claim. In short, they do not claim Martinez qualifies for any of the exceptions identified by\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   .

It may be partial or total. The term can be found in statutory contexts ranging from workers' compensation (e. g., Lab. Code, \u00a7 4650 et seq. ) to discrimination against pregnant women (\u00a7 12945). We therefore emphasize that we are addressing disability only as that term is used in Article 6 (\"Disability Retirement,\" \u00a7\u00a7 21150-21176) of Chapter 12 (\"Retirement from Employment,\" \u00a7 21060 et seq.) of the Public Employees Retirement Law. And in this context \"disability retirement\" has a very distinct meaning. It is not \"retirement\" in the ordinary sense, nor is it a permanent condition. It is a sort of temporary hiatus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As noted, appellants rest their case on subdivision (a)(2) of section 21156.

The intent and scope of the bill was explained in the Legislative Counsel's summary digest:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"The Public Employees' Retirement System provides for the granting of disability benefits to members in state service. Existing law generally provides that if a medical examination and other available information show to the satisfaction of the Board of Administration of the Public Employees' Retirement System that a member in state service is incapacitated physically or mentally for the performance of his or her duties and is eligible to retire for disability, the board shall immediately retire him or her for disability. The State Teachers' Retirement System permits the board of administration of the system to authorize payment of a disability allowance or disability retirement allowance, requires a member to provide medical documentation to substantiate the claim qualifying the member for the disability allowance or disability retirement allowance, and permits the board to order a medical examination in this regard, as specified. The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 permits a member permanently incapacitated for duty to retire for disability only if specified criteria are met. Existing law permits the legislative body of a local agency to establish a pension trust, as specified, for the benefit of its officers and employees and permits that legislative body to establish reciprocal retirement benefits with other specified retirement systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \"This bill would restrict the board or body administering a retirement system or a pension trust, as described above, with respect to the medical opinion or documentation used to determine whether a member is eligible to retire for disability, as specified, and would prohibit the use of disability retirement as a substitute for the disciplinary process.\" (Legis. Counsel's Dig., Assem. Bill No. 2023 (2007-2008 Reg. Sess.) 5 Stats. 2008, Summary Dig., p. 152.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The measure codified one of the recommendations of the Public Employee Post-Employment Benefits Commission established by Governor Schwarzenegger in December 2006. Change was needed, it concluded, because \" 'there can\n   be, and has been, significant differences in standards between employers as to what constitutes a disability, with some local agencies at times using disability retirement as a substitute for the disciplinary process.' \" (Sen. Com. on Public Employment and Retirement, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2023 (2007-2008 Reg. Sess.), as amended June 18, 2008, p. 3.) The complete bill history prepared by the Assembly shows it was passed in both houses without a single negative vote. All of five parts of the bill declared the sole point that eligibility for disability retirement should be decided on the basis of medical evidence, not the desire to get rid of an employee without going through the process of disciplining that employee. It was, in short, unopposed and uncontroversial. There is not a single mention of either\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   in the legislative history. In short, the central pillar of\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   -the employee's inability to resume performing his or her duties-has not changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   However, if the disciplinary process is used, and results in a termination for cause, there is nothing in the legislative history of subdivision (a)(2) suggesting the terminated employee may then apply for a disability retirement. Dismissal for cause is a \"[p]ermanent separation ... from state service,\" while disability retirement is only a \"[t]emporary separation ... from state service.\" ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 446 ; see\n   <em>\n    Willis v. State of California\n   </em>\n   (1994)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4546650\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/22/287/#p291\">\n    22 Cal.App.4th 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 291,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20413\">\n    27 Cal.Rptr.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"A disability retirement is not, by definition, permanent. ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 446.)\"].) This \"dichotomy,\" to use appellants' term, is fully consistent with the purposes of the disability procedures outlined by the\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   court, procedures meant to ascertain the duration of an employee's inability to return to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Appellants' arguments do not persuade us that fundamental change of that structure was either intended or accomplished by subdivision (a)(2). The nature of disability retirement was not changed. The procedure for obtaining benefits has changed only in one respect. The concept of reinstatement is still the desired conclusion. The mechanism for reinstatement, the medical examination, is still in place. The \"unwilling/unable dichotomy\" is still, as the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   court put it, \"inherent in the structure of the statutes governing disability retirement\" (\n   <em>\n    Smith, supra,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1109285\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/120/194/\">\n    120 Cal.App.4th 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20908\">\n    14 Cal.Rptr.3d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) of the Public Employees Retirement Law. In the language of\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   , Martinez's voluntary resignation \"constituted a complete severance of the employer-employee relationship, thus eliminating a necessary requisite for disability retirement-the potential reinstatement of [her] employment relationship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Haywood, supra,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2372506\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/67/1292/\">\n    67 Cal.App.4th 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1297,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20749\">\n    79 Cal.Rptr.2d 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In these circumstances, we cannot agree with appellants that the enactment of subdivision (a)(2) \"superseded\"\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We also conclude that\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   are not \"inconsistent with subsequent case law,\" specifically,\n   <em>\n    California Dept. of Justice v.

The issue there was whether an employer was required to reinstate an employee who was no longer incapacitated by the physical difficulty that led to the disability retirement. The employer wanted to make reinstatement dependent upon a formal offer of reinstatement conditioned on the employee completing \"medical and psychological evaluations and a background investigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 137,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20619\">\n    194 Cal.Rptr.3d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court of Appeal held that both of the employer's arguments were contrary to section 21193 (quoted at fn. 6,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   ): \"The first paragraph of section 21193 suggests there is a two-step process for reinstatement, but when read in context with the second paragraph, it is clear that a state employee who is not incapacitated for duty must be reinstated. An offer to reinstate the employee is mandatory under those circumstances. DOJ was required to reinstate [the employee] after CalPERS determined that she was no longer incapacitated for duty.\" (\n   <em>\n    California Dept. of Justice v. Board of Administration\n   </em>\n   etc.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053161\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/242/133/\">\n    242 Cal.App.4th 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 142,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20619\">\n    194 Cal.Rptr.3d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Moreover, \"[m]andatory reinstatement, by itself, does not require medical and psychological evaluations or a new background investigation. Placing conditions on [the employee] prior to reinstatement would be contrary to the mandatory reinstatement provisions of section 21193.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   It may be that criteria for reinstatement have been relaxed, and that Martinez may have a theoretical right to seek employment with a state agency other than DSS. And it is true that there are circumstances where an application for disability benefits can be submitted following termination. (See \u00a7 21154.) Even so, there is nothing in the decision providing support to appellants' reading of it, namely, that the Court of Appeal held that a \"former employer\" has a \"mandatory duty to extend an offer of reinstatement\" that continues past termination. That stands the very nature-the\n   temporary quality-of disability on its head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As already mentioned, in 2004 the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   court noted: \"If\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   were indeed a judicial derelict on the waters of the law of disability retirement [citation], the Legislature has had five years in which to scuttle it. The absence of legislative action supports our belief in the propriety of our interpretation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Smith, supra,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1109285\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/120/194/\">\n    120 Cal.App.4th 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20908\">\n    14 Cal.Rptr.3d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) That is even more true if the legislative inaction spans more than 20 years. During those years,\n   <em>\n    Smith's\n   </em>\n   central premise-what appellants term the \"unwilling/unable dichotomy\"-has never been challenged-and has become accepted. (E. g.,\n   <em>\n    Riverside Sheriffs' Assn. v. County of Riverside\n   </em>\n   (2009)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052015\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/173/1410/#p1419\">\n    173 Cal.App.4th 1410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1419-1420,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20832\">\n    93 Cal.Rptr.3d 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Holtzman, Cal.

We therefore decline appellants' invitation to \"disavow\"\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   With respect to\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   , it was designated as a precedential decision because the Board believed it had \"a significant legal or policy determination of general application that is likely to recur.\" (See fn. 2,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   .) The Board presumably did so because employees leaving state service with a settlement of a pending termination for cause were becoming sufficiently common to merit a statement of policy. The Legislature and the Board have decided that resignation effects a \"permanent separation\" from state service. (\u00a7 19996 [\"Any ... employee may be ... permanently separated through resignation\"]; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 446 [\"Permanent separations from state service shall include ... resignation\"].) Which is exactly what Martinez did when she agreed to leave state service and \"never again apply for or accept any employment\" with DSS. Notwithstanding the theoretical possibility of reinstatement, Martinez was not going to return to her former job. From this perspective,\n   <em>\n    Vandergoot\n   </em>\n   is eminently logical: resignation in these circumstances does indeed appear to be \"tantamount to a dismissal for purposes of applying the\n   <em>\n    Haywood\n   </em>\n   criteria.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A long-standing principle is that \"the Board's interpretation of the Public Employees Retirement Law is accorded great weight unless clearly erroneous.\" (\n   <em>\n    City of Fremont v.
