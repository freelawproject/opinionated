We conclude the\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   rule survives as\n   an interpretation of the state Constitution's double jeopardy clause. The trial court's failure here to receive a partial acquittal verdict on first degree murder rendered the declaration of a mistrial on that charge without legal necessity. Accordingly, defendant may not be retried on that allegation. As the Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Evidence was introduced that, on the night of December 1, 2009, defendant received texts from his girlfriend, 15-year-old Alexis C.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   asking for help because she feared her father was going to rape her as he had done before. Defendant went to her home and found her asleep in bed with her father. As defendant tried to take her out of the house, the father awakened and a fight\n   ensued. During that confrontation, defendant fatally stabbed the father with an ice pick he had brought with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant was charged with a single count of murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the close of evidence, the court instructed the jury on first degree murder, second degree murder, and voluntary manslaughter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury received \"guilty\" verdict forms for each offense and a single \"not guilty\" form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the third day of deliberations, the jury reported discussions had become hostile. After consulting with counsel, the court asked the foreperson \"how things are going\" and if the court could do anything to assist. The foreperson reported the jury was \"at a stalemate\" and explained: \"So we've basically ruled out murder in the first degree. So then we moved to murder in the second degree. ... [\u00b6] So we worked down to voluntary manslaughter, but there's still a couple that are still stuck on second degree.\" The foreperson later repeated that some jurors \"are stuck on second degree and then went down to\n   voluntary,\" but they were \"working through it.\" Deliberations continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next court day, defense counsel asked the jury be given a \"not guilty\" verdict form for first degree murder. The prosecutor objected. The foreperson asked to speak with the court and again reported the jury was at an impasse, explaining that one juror \"thinks it's second degree,\" \"[a]nd then we've got two that are on the side of voluntary. And then we've got nine that are not guilty.\" Outside the foreperson's presence, the prosecutor expressed his view that the jury was \"hopelessly deadlocked.\" Defense counsel urged the jury was frustrated but not deadlocked. The court brought the panel into the courtroom to ask if anything would assist them. As they waited for the jury, counsel debated the defense request for a \"not guilty\" verdict form on first degree murder. The court denied the request, stating: \"I don't want to change horses in midstream. We sent it in a certain way, and to change anything makes it seem like we're directing them as to which way to think, and I don't want to do that.\" After answering some questions about jury instructions, the court ordered the jury to deliberate for the remainder of the day, about 40 minutes. After that time expired, the jury returned, and the foreperson said they were \"still at the same spot.\" The court asked whether \"it's still basically nine to two to one,\" and the foreperson replied it was. The court concluded the jury was deadlocked and declared a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defense moved to dismiss the first degree murder allegation on double jeopardy grounds. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   , defendant argued the court's failure to\n   allow the jury to acquit him of first degree murder barred a retrial on that charge. Defendant also argued double jeopardy barred a trial on second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter as well. The court\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ultimately dismissed the first degree\n   murder charge but declined to dismiss the lesser offenses. The People unsuccessfully sought reconsideration based upon\n   <em>\n    Blueford\n   </em>\n   , which had recently been decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The People, represented by the Riverside County District Attorney's Office, appealed the dismissal of the first degree murder charge. The Court of Appeal affirmed. We likewise affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 15, of the California Constitution, a person may not be twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense.

The verdict on a lesser offense masks whether the jury intended to acquit on the greater, in which case the jury should do so expressly before convicting on a lesser, or whether it is deadlocked on the greater, whereupon the court should declare a mistrial and not accept a verdict on a lesser offense.

Rather than accept a verdict that perpetuates ambiguity,\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   suggested a procedure that clarifies the jury's intent. Similarly in\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   , when the jury has affirmatively indicated it has unanimously acquitted on a greater offense, allowing the jury to record such a verdict serves to clarify and give effect to the jury's intent. The procedures outlined in both\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   thus further the interest of promoting clarity in jury verdicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   By requiring the taking of partial verdicts in single count cases,\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of the state double jeopardy clause sought to eliminate an anomaly created by our criminal procedure. Although our affirmation of the\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   rule does not depend on the existence of any particular statutory scheme, we observe that\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   's solution to this anomaly is fully consistent\n   with other Penal Code provisions regarding the taking of verdicts. Our statutory scheme reflects a general legislative preference for giving effect to unanimous\n   jury verdicts. \"No jury shall be discharged until the court has verified on the record that the jury has either reached a verdict or has formally declared its inability to reach a verdict on all issues before it ....\" ( \u00a7 1164, subd. (b) ; see also \u00a7 1140.) After deliberations, \"[w]hen the jury appear they must be asked by the Court, or Clerk, whether they have agreed upon their verdict, and if the foreman answers in the affirmative, they must, on being required, declare the same.\" (\u00a7 1149.) \"When the verdict given is receivable by the court, the clerk shall record it in full upon the minutes ....\" ( \u00a7 1164, subd. (a).) Under these provisions, a jury cannot be\n   discharged unless it has rendered a verdict in open court or has declared an inability to agree. The jury must declare in open court if it has unanimously agreed to a verdict and, if the jury agrees on some counts and not others, the court must accept the verdicts upon which the jury agrees. ( \u00a7 1160 ; cf.\n   <em>\n    People v. Anzalone\n   </em>\n   (2013)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225161\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/56/545/#p555\">\n    56 Cal.4th 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 555,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20352\">\n    155 Cal.Rptr.3d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=298%20P.3d%20849\">\n    298 P.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\u00a7 1149 part of \"procedural provisions designed to protect the right to a unanimous verdict\"].) The\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   rule, allowing verdicts of acquittal for a greater offense when the jury unanimously agrees, is fully consistent with a statutory scheme that generally requires a jury to announce when it agrees and requires the court to accept verdicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Our statutes also reflect a strong preference for the acceptance of acquittals. A court has discretion to clarify a jury's intention in the face of ambiguity. To that end, it may \"direct the jury to reconsider their verdict\" if \"it appears to the Court that the jury have mistaken the law.\" (\u00a7 1161.) This rule, however, only authorizes such an instruction if the jury's apparent misunderstanding underlies a\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   - not if it underlies an\n   <em>\n    acquittal\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .) Further, \"[i]f the jury persist in finding an informal verdict, from which, however, it can be clearly understood that their intention is to find in favor of the defendant upon the issue, it must be entered in the terms in which it is found, and the Court must give judgment of acquittal.\" (\u00a7 1162.) This rule, too, is asymmetrical. Even if the jury renders an informal verdict in favor of the state, \"no judgment of conviction can be given unless the jury expressly find against the defendant upon the issue, or judgment is given against him on a special verdict.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, unlike a judgment of conviction, \"a jury verdict of acquittal need not be in any particular form. [Citation.] The jury may render its verdict in any manner that unmistakably manifests its intent. The touchstone of a jury verdict of acquittal is the jury's manifestation of a definite and final intent to acquit of the offense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Bigelow v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1989)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4411875\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/208/1127/#p1134\">\n    208 Cal.App.3d 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1134,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=256%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20528\">\n    256 Cal.Rptr. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   rule simply provides a mechanism by which a jury may formally render an acquittal verdict on a greater offense, providing clarity to what otherwise may be considered an informal verdict of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Blueford\n   </em>\n   's reasoning calls\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   's analysis into question. As discussed,\n   <em>\n    Blueford\n   </em>\n   raised two primary concerns. First,\n   <em>\n    Blueford\n   </em>\n   suggested that a foreperson's report \"was not a final resolution of anything\" because \"[t]he fact that deliberations continued after the report deprives that report of the finality necessary to constitute an acquittal on the murder offenses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Blueford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 566 U.S. at p. 606,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189887\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/599/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) However, if, under the\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   rule, a jury is given verdict forms and given the option of rendering a unanimous verdict consistent with the foreperson's report, such a formalized verdict\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   be a final resolution of the issue. Second,\n   <em>\n    Blueford\n   </em>\n   observed that the high court has \"never required a trial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury, to consider any particular means of breaking the\n   impasse ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 609,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189887\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/599/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) However, in the\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   scenario, the jury has unanimously acquitted a defendant of a greater offense and it is at an \"impasse\" only as to which of several lesser offenses may have been committed. Accepting a unanimous, final verdict on the former has nothing to do with breaking an impasse on the latter, which can be retried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The People observe that some states have declined to require the acceptance of partial verdicts under their state double jeopardy provisions for fear of jury coercion. For example, one court suggested that \"[i]nquiry concerning partial verdicts on lesser included offenses, no matter how carefully phrased\n   and delivered, carries a significant potential for coercion,\" and that \"[t]here is simply too great a risk that such a verdict would merely be the product of one hasty, final attempt to satisfy the judge's apparent desire for some form of decision on the case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Here, there was an indication that the jury agreed defendant was not guilty of first degree murder. On three separate occasions over two court days, the jury foreperson reported that jurors were split between second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and a not guilty verdict. The foreperson said the jury had \"ruled out\" first degree murder and had \"worked down to voluntary\n   manslaughter, but there's still a couple that are still stuck on second degree.\" The next day, the foreperson gave a numerical split of one vote for second degree murder, two for voluntary manslaughter and nine for an acquittal. After further deliberations, the foreperson confirmed the split had not changed, and the court discharged the jury.

(Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 245 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 154-155, pp. 158-160, 437 P.3d at pp. 848-849, pp. 851-854.)\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   did, indeed, cite Penal Code provisions to bolster its conclusion.

But the court believed its holding was\n   <em>\n    constitutionally\n   </em>\n   compelled. It simply interpreted the Penal Code the way it did to bring it into compliance with this perceived constitutional compulsion. The court stated that it interpreted the statutes \"[\n   <em>\n    f\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    or the purpose\n   </em>\n   of delineating the scope of the double jeopardy protection\" (\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   , at p. 517,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=183%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20647\">\n    183 Cal.Rptr. 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=646%20P.2d%20809\">\n    646 P.2d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , italics added) and reiterated its holding that \"the trial court is\n   <em>\n    constitutionally\n   </em>\n   obligated to afford the jury an opportunity to render a partial verdict of acquittal on a greater offense when the jury is deadlocked only on an uncharged lesser included offense\" (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 519,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=183%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20647\">\n    183 Cal.Rptr. 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=646%20P.2d%20809\">\n    646 P.2d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , italics added).\n   The statutory rationale, by itself, is not persuasive. As the majority explains, the\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   court cited Penal Code section 954 ( section 954 ) as supposedly permitting prosecutors to charge all lesser included offenses as separate counts, which would presumably permit a verdict - either conviction or acquittal - on any or all of those counts. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   concluded, something similar must be permitted if the prosecutor chooses to charge all included offenses in a single count. The majority here describes this as a \"fairness rationale.\" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 245 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 158, 437 P.3d at p. 852.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   court apparently envisaged a scenario in which the prosecution might charge a single homicide in four counts: first degree murder, second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter. If so charged, the jury would have a smorgasbord of options: guilty or not guilty of any or all of the counts. That scenario would permit a defendant to be convicted on all four counts, thus receiving four felony homicide-based convictions for the same homicide. It is a truly bizarre scenario. But it is artificial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Section 954 permits, in specified circumstances, the\n   <em>\n    charging\n   </em>\n   of multiple crimes, including \"different statements of the same offense,\" and\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   \"of any number of the offenses charged.\" But, despite section 954 's seemingly all-inclusive language, we have held that a defendant may\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be convicted of both a greater and a lesser included offense. \"In California, a single act or course of conduct by a defendant can lead to convictions 'of\n   <em>\n    any number\n   </em>\n   of the offenses charged.'

Charging a greater offense permits conviction of all lesser included offenses. ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1159 ; see maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 245 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 159-160, 437 P.3d at p. 853.) Thus, in effect, charging the greater offense also charges all\n   lesser included offenses. Our interpretation of section 954 should be consistent. The section\n   simply does not govern lesser included offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Moreover, after\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   , we implicitly abandoned this so-called fairness rationale.

For\n   example, we made clear that if the jury unanimously agrees a defendant is guilty at least of second degree murder but is deadlocked on first degree murder, the court may not take a partial verdict of guilty of second degree murder; such a verdict would preclude retrial of the first degree murder charge, and thus not be a partial verdict. (\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 311-312,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20282\">\n    52 Cal.Rptr.2d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20P.2d%20832\">\n    914 P.2d 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) A procedure permitting a partial verdict of guilt would work the same way a procedure permitting a partial verdict of acquittal is supposed to work. If the jury unanimously found the defendant was guilty of a lesser offense (for example, second degree murder), but was hopelessly deadlocked on the greater offense (for example, first degree murder), the trial court could take a verdict of guilty of second degree murder and declare a mistrial regarding first degree murder. At retrial, the jury would decide only whether the murder was of the first or second degree. This procedure would be exactly as clear (or murky) as partial verdicts of acquittal. No reason exists to require the one and prohibit the other. The same fairness rationale that, the\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   court held, mandated the taking of partial verdicts of acquittal should have mandated the taking of partial verdicts of conviction. But\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   concluded otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The majority also cites another statute, apparently in support of\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   's rule, specifically, Penal Code section 1164, subdivision (b), which provides that \"[n]o jury shall be discharged until the court has verified on the record that the jury has either reached a verdict or has formally declared its inability to reach a verdict\n   <em>\n    on all issues before it\n   </em>\n   , including, but not limited to, the degree of the crime or crimes charged ....\" (Italics added; see maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 245 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 162, 437 P.3d at p. 854.) This statute does not support the\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   rule. The jury\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   indicate its inability to reach a verdict on all issues. It could not decide several issues, including whether defendant was guilty of anything and, if so, exactly what. Section 1164 neither permits nor requires partial verdicts of acquittal, just as it neither permits nor requires partial verdicts of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For these reasons, California's Penal Code does not supply the answer to the question presented here. I recognize that this circumstance does not mean we must abandon the\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   rule. As\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   itself said, \"we remain free to delineate a higher level of protection under article I, section 15..., of the California Constitution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 31 Cal.3d at p. 510,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=183%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20647\">\n    183 Cal.Rptr. 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=646%20P.2d%20809\">\n    646 P.2d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) But it does mean we have to decide the constitutional question, which\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   did not resolve. I now turn to that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, as relevant, \"nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" Article I, section 15 of California's Constitution provides, as relevant, \"Persons may not twice be put in jeopardy for the same offense ....\" \"The double jeopardy clause in the federal Constitution, as we have noted, uses 'words very similar' to California's.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Even under the majority's holding, defendant\n   <em>\n    can be retried\n   </em>\n   , albeit with second degree murder as the upper limit. He can be subjected to the embarrassment, expense, and ordeal of a second trial, although the embarrassment, expense, and ordeal might be slightly lessened by the knowledge that he could only be convicted of second degree murder. That leaves the concern that retrial of first degree murder will enhance the possibility that he will be found guilty of that offense even though he might be guilty only of second degree murder.

The jurors are confronted with the request, and asked to absorb its inherent complexity, at the worst possible time, when they are tired, anxious to be discharged, and perhaps angry at fellow jurors whom they blame for failing to reach agreement. While technically inquiring only as to what the jurors have already agreed on, the request for partial verdicts broken down by lesser included offenses implicitly suggests that the jurors should try just a little bit harder to come back with at least a partial decision to show for all of their efforts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at pp. 447-448.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   court found \"too great a risk that such a verdict would merely be the product of one hasty, final attempt to satisfy the judge's apparent desire for some form of decision on the case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Roth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 776 N.E.2d at p. 448.) \"Such inquiries of the jury may succeed in extracting a partial verdict, but we could not have confidence that that partial verdict was the product of a thoughtful and thorough deliberation process.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 449.) Accordingly, the court \"conclude[d] that judges should not initiate any inquiry into partial verdicts premised on lesser included offenses within a single complaint or count of an indictment. In our view, the risks of juror coercion are too high, and the reliability of any such partial verdict returned is too low, to warrant such an approach to salvaging some partial result from a deadlocked jury. We remain of the view that such inquiries 'constitute an unwarranted and unwise intrusion into the province of the jury.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 450.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Colorado Supreme Court quoted at length from, and agreed with, the\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   decision in a case in which the jury unanimously agreed the defendant was not guilty of murder\n   but was deadlocked on the lesser included offenses of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. It found \"the\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning - including its concerns about juror coercion and compromise - persuasive.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v. Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 184 P.3d at p. 763.) I do too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Indeed, the coercive effect identified in\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   is even greater under California law as it now stands. After\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   , we prohibited partial verdicts of conviction. (\n   <em>\n    People v. Fields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1965922\" index=\"359\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/13/289/#p298\">\n    13 Cal.4th 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"360\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20282\">\n    52 Cal.Rptr.2d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"361\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20P.2d%20832\">\n    914 P.2d 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) I see no compelling, or even cogent, reason for prohibiting partial verdicts of guilt while requiring, in some circumstances, partial verdicts of acquittal. Under the majority holding, the coercive effect can only go one way - towards a not guilty verdict. The coercive message a\n   deadlocked jury will receive in these circumstances is that the court really wants to salvage\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   from the trial, and that something can only be an acquittal, not a conviction.\n   We should not interpret our state constitutional double jeopardy clause differently than the similarly worded federal counterpart to compel this coercive message. The first jury resolved nothing. Providing defendant with a new, unrestricted, jury trial, once again placing the burden of proof on the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, sufficiently protects defendant's constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The majority invokes what it calls a \"fairness rationale\" for the\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   rule it embraces. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 245 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 152, 437 P.3d at p. 852.) I would invoke a different fairness rationale. The rule should be consistent. Just as the trial court cannot take a partial verdict of guilt, so too it should not take a partial verdict of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For these reasons, I would find a legal necessity existed for discharging the first jury. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 245 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 152, 437 P.3d at p. 852.)
