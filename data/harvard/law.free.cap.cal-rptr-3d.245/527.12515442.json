This crisis led to a deep recession in the United States and around the globe. California was hit particularly hard. While the recession ended in mid-2009, at least as a definitional matter, persistent high unemployment continued throughout 2012, along with the continuing decline in home values, increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies, and the concomitant decrease in state revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In March 2012, the federal government and the attorneys general of 49 states and the District of Columbia (every state except Oklahoma) brought suit in federal court against the nation's five largest mortgage servicers, i.e., Ally (formerly GMAC), Bank of America, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo (collectively, Bank defendants), alleging a number of violations of federal law. The case was resolved by settlement agreement (the National\n   Mortgage Settlement or NMS), the terms of which the federal court formally entered as consent judgments in April 2012. In addition to setting comprehensive\n   new mortgage servicing standards and providing more than $20 billion in financial relief for homeowners damaged by the mortgage crisis, the NMS also provided for about $2.5 billion to be paid to the states directly, \"which sum shall be distributed in the manner and for the purposes specified in Exhibit B\" to the agreement. Exhibit B states that \"[e]ach State Attorney General shall designate the uses of the funds\" and requires, \"[t]o the extent practicable, such funds shall be used for purposes intended to avoid preventable foreclosures, to ameliorate the effects of the foreclosure crisis, to enhance law enforcement efforts to prevent and prosecute financial fraud, or unfair or deceptive acts or practices and to compensate the States for costs resulting from the alleged unlawful conduct of [the Bank defendants].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   California's share of this $2.5 billion direct payment was about $410 million. In Exhibit B-2 to the NMS, former Attorney General Kamala Harris provided fairly detailed instructions as to how these funds should be used. We describe these instructions later in the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the consent judgments were entered, the Legislature enacted Government Code 1 section 12531, creating a special deposit fund in the treasury (the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund) where 90 percent of the $410 million amount would be deposited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ( \u00a7 12531, subds. (b), (d).) The Legislature provided, \"all moneys in the [National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund] are hereby continuously appropriated, and shall be allocated by the Department of Finance\" (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. (b)), and further provided: \"Notwithstanding any other law, the Director of Finance may allocate or otherwise use the funds in the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund to offset General Fund expenditures in the 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 fiscal years.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. (e).) While the Legislature did not specify which General Fund expenditures may be offset using the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund, subdivision (f) required the Department of Finance to \"submit an expenditure plan to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee detailing the proposed use of the moneys in the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund\" at least \"30 days prior to allocating moneys pursuant to subdivision (e).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. (f).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to this procedure, the director of finance received approval for various expenditures from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund \"to offset General Fund costs of programs that support public protection, consumer fraud enforcement and litigation, and housing related programs\" during the specified fiscal years. We set forth the details of these expenditures later in the opinion. For present purposes, we note they nearly exhausted the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2014, the National Asian American Coalition, COR Community Development Corporation, and the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Governor, the director of finance, and the controller, seeking the\n   immediate return of approximately $350 million they alleged was unlawfully diverted from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund to the General Fund in contravention of both section 12531 and the federal consent judgments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court concluded section 12531 was intended to effectuate the terms of the federal consent judgments, which required compliance with the instructions provided by former Attorney General Harris in Exhibit B-2 to the National Mortgage Settlement designating the permissible uses of the $410 million direct payment. Rejecting defendants' contention subdivision (e) of that section permitted the director of finance to use the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund to offset General Fund expenditures regardless of whether such offsets were consistent with these instructions, the trial court reasoned such a reading of the statute would \"raise serious doubts about the legality of the statute, not only as to whether the Legislature may override a federal judgment, but also whether the Legislature constitutionally may delegate to an agency the authority to decide how millions of dollars of state funds shall be spent with virtually no guidance or direction from the Legislature.\" Turning to the question of whether the particular offsets were consistent with the former Attorney General's instructions, the trial court concluded $331,044,084 was unlawfully appropriated from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund for purposes inconsistent with these instructions. Nevertheless, pointing out that it lacked the constitutional authority to order the Legislature to appropriate funds, the trial court declared an obligation to restore the unlawfully diverted funds and ordered such restoration \"as\n   soon as there is a sufficient appropriation 'reasonably' and 'generally' available for such purpose.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   These appeals followed. Defendants contend: (1) plaintiffs lack standing to seek a writ of mandate directing the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund to be reimbursed for the challenged expenditures; (2) section 12531 does not restrict the director of finance's ability to use the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund to offset General Fund expenditures, aside from requiring Legislative approval of such offsets; (3) the Legislature possessed absolute authority to approve the challenged expenditures regardless of whether they were consistent with the federal consent judgments; and (4) even if section 12531 required consistency with the federal consent judgments, the challenged expenditures were consistent with both the purposes of the direct payment set forth in Exhibit B to the National Mortgage Settlement and the former Attorney General's instructions set forth in Exhibit B-2. Plaintiffs dispute each of these contentions and, in their appeal, contend: (1) the amount unlawfully diverted from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund was actually $350 million; and (2) the trial court erred in concluding separation of powers principles prevented it from ordering the immediate restoration of the unlawfully diverted funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 10, 2018, we issued an opinion concluding plaintiffs have public interest standing to seek the requested writ of\n   mandate. We also concluded, as did the trial court, section 12531 was intended by our Legislature to effectuate the terms of the National Mortgage Settlement, including the former Attorney General's instructions regarding the proper uses of the money, and over $331 million was unlawfully appropriated from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund for purposes inconsistent with the NMS. We parted ways with the trial court, however, on the issue of remedy. As we explained, because the unlawfully diverted funds are \"in law still in the [National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund]\" (\n   <em>\n    Daugherty v. Riley\n   </em>\n   (1934)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1204581\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/1/298/#p312\">\n    1 Cal.2d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20P.2d%201005\">\n    34 P.2d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (\n   <em>\n    Daugherty\n   </em>\n   ), separation of powers principles do not preclude this court from ordering the immediate return of these funds. We accordingly reversed the judgment in part and remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to issue a writ of mandate directing the immediate retransfer from the General Fund to the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund the sum of $331,044,084.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After we issued our original opinion in this case, defendants petitioned our Supreme Court for review. While that petition was pending, the Legislature passed and the Governor signed into law Senate Bill No. 861 (2017 - 2018 Reg. Sess.) (Stats. 2018, ch. 331 (SB 861)), amending section 12531 to add subdivision (h), the text of which we provide in its entirety later in this\n   opinion. For present purposes, we note SB 861 states in uncodified section 2: \"It is the intent of the Legislature in [adding subdivision (h) to section 12531 ] to confirm that allocations and uses of funds made by the director of finance from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund pursuant to [ section 12531 ] in the 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 fiscal years were consistent with legislative direction and intent and to abrogate the holding of the Court of Appeal in [this case]. The Legislature further declares that the allocations made by the director of finance pursuant to [ section 12531 ] were made for purposes consistent with the National Mortgage Settlement.\" (Stats. 2018, ch. 331, \u00a7 2, subd. (a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thereafter, on October 10, 2018, our Supreme Court granted the petition for review and transferred the matter to this court with directions to vacate our original opinion and reconsider the matter in light of this new statutory enactment. Having done so, and giving SB 861 all due consideration, we confirm the conclusions reached in our original opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Having already provided a description of the events giving rise to this appeal in order to provide context for the parties' contentions and our resolution thereof, we shall not repeat ourselves here. Rather, we elaborate on those portions of context deliberately omitted above. Specifically, we shall provide (1) a fuller description of the terms of the NMS, including the former Attorney General's instructions for use of the $410 million direct payment amount, (2) the complete text of section 12531, as originally enacted, creating the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund and authorizing disbursements to offset General Fund expenditures, (3) the details of the challenged disbursements made from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund, and (4) the Legislature's amendment to section 12531 expressing its view that these disbursements were consistent with both the legislative intent and the National Mortgage Settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The National Mortgage Settlement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The stated purpose of the NMS \"is to remediate harms allegedly resulting from\n   the alleged unlawful conduct of the [Bank defendants].\" The portion of the NMS relevant to these appeals provided for about $2.5 billion to be paid\n   directly to the states. As mentioned, the agreement provided this amount \"shall be distributed in the manner and for the purposes specified in Exhibit B.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Paragraph 1 of Exhibit B provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"b.\n   <em>\n    State Payment Settlement Amounts\n   </em>\n   .

The Finance letter states: \"For 2011-12 and 2012-13, $94.2 million of the [direct payment amount] will be used to offset General Fund costs of programs that support public protection, consumer fraud enforcement and litigation, and housing related programs. An additional $198 million will be used for debt service payments for programs funded with Proposition 46 and Proposition 1C housing bonds that assist homeowners. The remaining $118.4 million will be reserved for similar use in 2013-14.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   About six weeks later, the Legislature enacted section 12531 as part of a trailer bill to the 2012 Budget Act. At the time of its enactment, this section provided in full:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"(a) The Legislature finds and declares that California, represented by the California Attorney General, entered a national multistate settlement with the country's five largest loan servicers. This agreement, the National Mortgage Settlement stemmed from successful resolution of federal court action (Consent Judgment, United States v. Bank of America (No. 1:12-cv-00361, Banzr. D.C. Apr. 4, 2012). The National Mortgage Settlement is broad ranging, with California's share of this settlement estimated to be up to eighteen billion dollars ($18,000,000,000). Of this amount, approximately four hundred ten million dollars ($410,000,000) will come directly to the state in costs, fees, and penalty payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"(b) There is hereby created in the State Treasury the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund. Notwithstanding Section 13340, all moneys in the fund are hereby continuously appropriated, and shall be allocated by the Department of Finance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"(c) Direct payments made to the State of California as civil penalties pursuant to the National Mortgage Settlement shall be deposited in the Unfair Competition Law Fund as required by the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"(d) Direct payments made to the State of California pursuant to the National Mortgage Settlement, except for those payments made pursuant to subdivision\n   (c), shall be deposited in the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"(e) Notwithstanding any other law, the Director of Finance may allocate or otherwise use the funds in the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund to offset General Fund expenditures in the 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 fiscal years.

Thereafter, pursuant to section 12531, 10 percent of that amount was redirected into the Unfair Competition Law Fund and 90 percent was redirected into the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Before setting forth the details of the challenged disbursements, we briefly note those that are not challenged. Consistent with section 12531, subdivision (g), the 2012 Budget Act authorized a $100 million loan from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund to the General Fund to be repaid by June 30, 2014. Such a loan was made on September 24, 2012 and repaid with interest on April 11, 2014. The 2012 Budget Act also appropriated about $18 million from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund to the State Department of Justice, $8 million of which was appropriated to support the Office of the California Monitor, who assists the Attorney General in ensuring the Bank defendants comply with the terms of the NMS, and the remaining $10 million was appropriated for grants to assist homeowners affected by the foreclosure crisis. These disbursements are clearly consistent with the former Attorney General's general instructions for use of the funds and are not challenged in these appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The challenged disbursements total about $350 million. The expenditure plan submitted by the Department of Finance pursuant to section 12531, subdivision (f), proposed the following offsets:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"General Fund debt service payments for Propositions 1C and 46 Housing Bonds will be offset by [$292.4 million, i.e.,] $106 million, $92 million, and $94.4 million in 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14[,] respectively.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"The Department of Justice's (DOJ's) General Fund expenditures will be offset by [$49.2 million, i.e.,] $14.9 million, $17.8 million, and $16.5 million in 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14[,] respectively.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"The Department of Fair Employment and Housing's General Fund expenditures will be offset by [$9 million, i.e.,] $3 million in 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14[,] respectively.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   While the department of finance did not receive a response to this expenditure plan, that department's Final Change Book for the 2012-13 Budget indicates the\n   Legislature accepted the request made in the Finance\n   letter that preceded enactment of section 12531, i.e., that the direct payment would be used to offset General Fund costs of programs that support public protection, consumer fraud enforcement and litigation, and housing related programs. Various executive orders executed the offsets proposed in the expenditure plan, with minor alterations to the amounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2018 Amendment to Section 12531\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After we issued our original opinion concluding the vast majority of these challenged disbursements (over $331 million) were unlawful, the Legislature enacted SB 861, effective September 10, 2018, amending section 12531 to add subdivision (h). This subdivision provides: \"The Legislature hereby confirms and ratifies that the allocations of funds from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund in the 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 fiscal years were consistent with the direction given to the Director of Finance in subdivision (e) to offset General Fund expenditures in those years. The Legislature further confirms and ratifies that because those allocations were displayed in the Governor's proposed budget for the 2012-13 and 2013-14 fiscal years, and left unchanged in the budget acts adopted for the 2012-13 and 2013-14 fiscal years, the Legislature was aware of, and approved, the allocation and expenditure of funds from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund to offset General Fund expenditures in those fiscal years.

We consider the duty to comply with restrictions placed by our Legislature on the expenditure of public funds to be \"sharp.\" Indeed, as we explain more fully later in this opinion, money misappropriated from a special deposit fund is considered a loan by operation of law and a writ of mandate may issue to direct reimbursement.

As we explained, providing standing to the fire protection district, and inevitably other entities for which the county collects taxes, would create \"chaos\" in the taxing process.

This is not a suit to enforce the NMS. It is an action in mandamus to compel defendants to return to the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund money plaintiffs claim was misappropriated in contravention of section 12531. As we have explained, there is a sharp duty to comply with restrictions placed on the expenditure of public funds and a weighty public need for enforcement of such restrictions.

The trial court concluded section 12531 was intended to effectuate the terms of the federal consent judgments, which required compliance with the instructions provided by former Attorney General Harris in Exhibit B-2 to the National Mortgage Settlement designating the permissible uses of the $410 million direct payment. Rejecting defendants' contention subdivision (e) of that section permitted the director of finance to use the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund to offset General Fund expenditures regardless of whether such offsets were consistent with these instructions, the trial court reasoned such a reading of the statute would \"raise serious doubts about the legality of the statute, not only as to whether the Legislature may override a federal judgment, but also whether the Legislature constitutionally may delegate to an agency the authority to decide how millions of dollars of state funds shall be spent with virtually no guidance or direction from the Legislature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendants assert this interpretation of section 12531 runs \"[c]ontrary to the plain meaning of the statute\" and argues the plain meaning of subdivision\n   (e) of that section \"gives the Director of Finance discretion to 'allocate or otherwise use the funds' in the [National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund] 'to offset General Fund expenditures' in three fiscal years, '[n]otwithstanding any other law.'

As previously stated, subdivision (a) of this section provides: \"The Legislature finds and declares that California, represented by the California Attorney General, entered a national multistate settlement with the country's five largest loan servicers. This agreement, the National Mortgage Settlement stemmed from successful resolution of federal court action (Consent Judgment, United States v. Bank of America (No. 1:12-cv-00361, Banzr. D.C. Apr. 4, 2012). The National Mortgage Settlement is broad ranging, with California's share of this settlement estimated to be up to eighteen billion dollars ($18,000,000,000). Of this amount, approximately four hundred ten million dollars ($410,000,000) will come directly to the state in costs, fees, and penalty payments.\" ( \u00a7 12531, subd. (a).) Then subdivision (b) creates the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund, continuously appropriates all moneys in the fund, and directs the department of finance to allocate the money. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. (b).) Subdivisions (c) and (d) direct where the settlement disbursement shall be deposited, 90 percent going into the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subds. (c) &amp; (d).) Subdivision (e) then provides: \"Notwithstanding any other law, the Director of Finance may allocate or otherwise\n   use the funds in the [National Mortgage Special] Deposit Fund to offset General Fund expenditures in the 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 fiscal years. The Department of Finance and the Controller's office shall recognize this fiscal alignment accordingly for the purpose of the state budget process and legal basis of accounting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. (e).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Because subdivision (a) makes reference to the former Attorney General's successful negotiation of the National Mortgage Settlement, and subdivisions (b) through (d) effectuate California's receipt of the settlement proceeds as set forth in the former Attorney General's instructions, i.e., 10 percent to the Unfair Competition Law Fund and 90 percent into a special deposit fund (the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund), and because the purpose of creating a special deposit fund is to house money that is \"collected or received for specific purposes\" (\u00a7 16372), it is only reasonable to conclude the Legislature intended the specific purposes set forth in the former Attorney General's instructions are also the purposes for which the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund money may be spent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Nevertheless, defendants claim the Legislature intended to allow the director of finance to disregard the former Attorney General's instructions and use the money in the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund to offset\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   General Fund expenditures. This supposed intent, they argue, may be found in the phrase \"[n]otwithstanding any other law\" in subdivision (e), before that subdivision directs the director of finance to \"offset General Fund expenditures in the 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 fiscal years.\" ( \u00a7 12531, subd. (e).) We are not persuaded that this phrase was intended to untether the offsets from the purposes for which the money was received. Indeed, defendants' reading of the statute would effectively defeat the purpose of creating a special deposit fund to house the money. Moreover, the fact that the Legislature intended the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund to be a special deposit fund with restrictions on the use of the money housed therein is also supported by subdivision (g), which allows for \"cashflow loans to the General Fund as provided in Sections 16310 and 16381.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subd. (g).) Sections 16310 and 16381 allow for such loans\n   <em>\n    from special deposit\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    funds\n   </em>\n   when the General Fund is or will be exhausted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Our reading of the statute, and that of the trial court, is also bolstered by the legislative history. The Legislative Counsel's Digest for section 12531 states: \"This bill would establish the [National Mortgage Special] Deposit Fund in the State Treasury as a continuously appropriated fund and would require certain direct payments made to the state under the National Mortgage Settlement to be deposited in the fund for allocation by the Director of Finance, as specified. This bill would further authorize the Director of Finance to allocate moneys from the fund to offset General Fund expenditures during the 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 fiscal years\n   <em>\n    for purposes\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    consistent with the National Mortgage Settlement\n   </em>\n   .\" (Legis. Counsel's Dig., Sen. Bill No. 1006, (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.) Stats. 2012, ch. 32, \u00a7 12, italics added &lt; http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_1001-1050/sb_1006_bill_20120625_amended_asm_v98.html&gt; [as of Mar. 26, 2019], archived at &lt; https://perma.cc/6ZHW-P2GM&gt;.) The former Attorney General's general instructions for use of the settlement money is part of the NMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We also agree with the trial court's conclusion that defendants' reading of the statute would \"raise serious doubts about the legality of the statute, not only as to whether the Legislature may override a federal judgment, but also whether the Legislature constitutionally may delegate to an agency the authority to decide how millions of dollars of state funds shall be spent with virtually no guidance or direction from the Legislature.\" Defendants address the first of these concerns by arguing the Legislature has plenary power over appropriations that includes the authority to override an Attorney General's settlement agreement as long as doing so does not interfere with a party's vested rights (primarily relying on\n   <em>\n    Van de Kamp v.

Addressing the nondelegation doctrine, defendants argue there was no unconstitutional delegation because subdivision (f) requires the department of finance to \"submit an expenditure plan to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee detailing the proposed use of the moneys in the [National Mortgage Special] Deposit Fund.\" ( \u00a7 12531, subd. (f).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We need not decide these potential constitutional issues because our reading of section 12531, supported by the language of the statute and its legislative history, avoids them entirely. \"When faced with a statute reasonably susceptible of two or more interpretations, of which at least one raises constitutional questions, we should construe it in a manner that avoids\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   doubt about its validity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Association for Retarded Citizens v.

In their supplemental briefing on the new enactment, defendants argue, \"the intended effect of SB 861 was to clarify that the allocations of funds\n   made by\n   the Director of Finance were consistent with ... section 12531\" and \"such a subsequent expression by the Legislature as to the intent of a prior statute is persuasive evidence regarding the meaning of that statute.\" In making this argument, defendants rely primarily on\n   <em>\n    Western Security\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1006037\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/15/232/#p244\">\n    15 Cal.4th 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20243\">\n    62 Cal.Rptr.2d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=933%20P.2d%20507\">\n    933 P.2d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3853036\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/38/914/#p922\">\n    38 Cal.4th 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20223\">\n    44 Cal.Rptr.3d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20P.3d%20637\">\n    135 P.3d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Proc., \u00a7 580d, the antideficiency statute), and the other making a letter of credit issuer's obligation to pay a draw conforming to the letter's terms separate from any underlying contract between the issuer's customer and the letter's beneficiary (the independence principle).

After a nonjudicial foreclosure left a deficiency, the lender attempted to draw on standby letters of credit of which it was the beneficiary.

(a).) This declaration, while at odds with the conclusion we reach immediately below, is a tacit admission that the allocations were required to be consistent with that settlement agreement. Moreover, as we explain below, the fact that the Legislature believes the director of finance's allocations were consistent with section 12531 and the NMS \"is not binding on a court. [Citation.] ...

As mentioned, the trial court concluded over $331 million was unlawfully diverted from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund for purposes inconsistent with the NMS, specifically the former Attorney General's general instructions set forth in Exhibit B-2 thereto. Defendants argue these expenditures were consistent with both the purposes of the direct payment set forth in Exhibit B to the NMS and the former Attorney General's instructions. In their appeal, plaintiffs contend the amount unlawfully diverted from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund was actually\n   $350 million. We again agree with the trial court's assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we reject defendants' assertion that consistency with the purposes set forth in Exhibit B would suffice to authorize the expenditures even if those expenditures were contrary to the former Attorney General's instructions. The NMS provided that the direct payment amount \"shall be distributed in the manner and for the purposes specified in Exhibit B.\" Paragraph 1 of Exhibit B provides that \"[e]ach State Attorney General shall designate the uses of the funds\" and then states: \"To the extent practicable, such funds shall be used for purposes intended to avoid preventable foreclosures, to ameliorate the effects of the foreclosure crisis, to enhance law enforcement efforts to prevent and prosecute financial fraud, or unfair or deceptive acts or practices and to compensate the States for costs resulting from the alleged unlawful conduct of [the Bank defendants]. Such permissible purposes for allocation of the funds include, but are not limited to, supplementing the amounts paid to state homeowners under the Borrower Payment Fund, funding for housing counselors, state and local foreclosure assistance hotlines, state and local foreclosure mediation programs, legal assistance, housing remediation and anti-blight projects, funding for training and staffing of financial fraud or consumer protection enforcement efforts, and civil penalties.\n   <em>\n    Accordingly, each Attorney General has set forth general instructions for the funds in the attached Exhibit B-2\n   </em>\n   .\" (Italics added.) Thus, while Exhibit B provides general permissible purposes for use of the direct payment, it expressly incorporates the more specific instructions provided by the former Attorney General in Exhibit B-2. Because, as we have concluded, section 12531 was intended to effectuate the NMS, the offsets made by the director of finance must be consistent with the former Attorney General's instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   These instructions provide: \"The remainder [i.e., 90 percent of the direct payment] shall be paid and deposited into a Special Deposit Fund created for\n   the following purposes: for the administration of the terms of this Consent Judgment; monitoring compliance with the terms of this Consent Judgment and enforcing the terms of this Consent Judgment; assisting in the implementation of the relief programs and servicing standards as described in this Consent Judgment; supporting the Attorney General's continuing investigation into misconduct in the origination, servicing, and securitization of residential mortgage loans; to fund consumer fraud education, investigations, enforcement operations, litigation, public protection and/or local consumer aid; to provide borrower relief; to fund grant programs to assist housing counselors or other legal aid agencies that represent homeowners, former homeowners, or renters in housing-related matters; to fund other matters, including grant programs, for the benefit of California homeowners affected by the mortgage/foreclosure crisis; or to engage and pay for third parties to develop or administer any of the programs or efforts described above.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Relying on our decision in\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3974223\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/175/577/\">\n    175 Cal.App.4th 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20379\">\n    96 Cal.Rptr.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the trial court concluded these instructions \"do not allow use of the funds to reimburse the General Fund for past expenditures.\" We agree.

The trial court invalidated the latter transfer because Proposition 116 restricted appropriation of money in the PTA to \"transportation planning or mass transportation purpose[s]\" and the trial court concluded offsetting the General Fund for past debt service payments on mass transportation bonds did not comport with these purposes. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 594,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20379\">\n    96 Cal.Rptr.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   We agreed with this determination, explaining: \"There is a clear distinction between transferring revenue from the PTA to the General Fund to pay\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   debt obligations on mass transportation bonds and transferring such revenue to reimburse for\n   <em>\n    past\n   </em>\n   debt obligations. In the case of the former, the revenue flows from the source to the present obligation via the General Fund to serve a mass transportation purpose. Although the money passes through the General Fund, it is still actually being used for the identified mass transportation purpose. In the Legislature's discretion, this may include the payment of current bond debt on mass transportation bonds. In the case of offsets or reimbursement of past debt service payments, however, there is no mass transportation debt obligation to be paid with the PTA funds. The debt was paid by the General Fund in the prior fiscal years. No actual debt remains. Money from the PTA under the label of offsetting or reimbursing\n   past debt payments is simply transferred to the General Fund where it can be used for any governmental purpose. Such reimbursement of the General Fund for its previous payment of its obligation on the specified bonds does not serve a 'mass transportation' purpose.

We also invalidated the $200 million transfer from the MTF. Having concluded earlier in the opinion that the transfer of $622 million of spillover gas tax revenue from the PTA to the MTF was invalid (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 602,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20379\">\n    96 Cal.Rptr.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), this $200 million transfer from the MTF was also saddled with the \" 'mass transportation' purpose\" requirement and payment of past debt did not satisfy that requirement.

The trial court also invalidated transfers made to the General Fund during the 2012-13 and 2013-14 fiscal years to offset DOJ and DFEH expenditures for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 fiscal years, (totaling $38.4 million), as those expenditures had also already been paid by the General Fund. We agree with this assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Nevertheless, defendants argue the fact that \"the Legislature knew and understood how the Director of Finance intended to use the money\" and did not \"object is strong evidence that the plan complied with the Legislature's intent in enacting section 12531.\" This argument is bolstered by SB 861, as we have explained above. However, we still are not persuaded. While this is evidence the Legislature may have\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   the director of finance's proposed offsets were consistent with section 12531 and the NMS, confirmed by the current Legislature's declared belief \"that the allocations ... were made for purposes consistent with the National Mortgage Settlement\" (Stats. 2018, ch. 331, \u00a7 2, subd. (a)), we reiterate that such a \"belief is not binding on a court. ...

The trial court declined to invalidate these transfers concluding there was no evidence the obligations were already paid at the time of the transfers. In their appeal, plaintiffs claim these payments should also have been invalidated, arguing these offsets \"rest upon an accounting fiction\" and the fact that DOJ and DFEH \"might have something to do with administering programs or enforcing regulations related to the purposes for which the [National Mortgage\n   Special Deposit] Fund was created is not sufficient\" to comply with the former Attorney General's instructions. However, while DOJ and DFEH do more than investigate mortgage fraud and housing-related matters, respectively, the burden was on plaintiffs to show these specific expenditures went to other purposes. We agree with the trial court's conclusion they failed to carry that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Appropriate Remedy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, we address the question of the appropriate remedy. The trial court concluded principles of separation of powers prevented it from issuing a writ of mandate directing the Legislature to appropriate funds to restore the $331 million unlawfully diverted from the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund. Instead, the trial court declared an obligation to restore the unlawfully diverted funds and ordered such restoration \"as soon as there is a sufficient appropriation 'reasonably' and 'generally' available for such purpose.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiffs do not dispute that directing an appropriation would violate the separation of powers. Instead, they argue: \"The legal violations at issue in this case lie not in a failure to\n   <em>\n    appropriate\n   </em>\n   the requisite funds, but in a series of executive orders, issued by the Defendant Director of Finance to the Defendant Controller, that unlawfully\n   <em>\n    transferred\n   </em>\n   the funds that had already been appropriated. Accordingly, the appropriate remedial order would simply direct Defendants to rescind those transfers-or, equivalently, to transfer equal sums back from the General Fund to the [National Mortgage Special] Deposit Fund.\" We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \" Article III, section 3 of the California Constitution provides that '[t]he powers of state government are legislative, executive, and judicial.

Article XVI, section 7 provides that '[m]oney may be drawn from the Treasury only through an appropriation made by law and upon a Controller's duly drawn warrant.' Article IV, sections 10 and 12 set forth the respective powers of the Legislature and Governor over the enactment of appropriations.

Rather, the Legislature continuously appropriated the money in the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund for those very purposes and authorized the director of finance to transfer the money to the General Fund to offset expenditures comporting with those purposes. While, as defendants argue, the Legislature may have believed the director of finance's proposed offsets complied with the purposes for\n   which the National Mortgage Special Deposit Fund was created, it is the judicial branch that has the constitutional authority to interpret statutes. (\n   <em>\n    California School Boards Assn. v.

We have determined, as did the trial court, the challenged offsets reimbursing the General Fund for past obligations did not comport with these purposes.

The second appropriation (i.e., a capital expenditure for the completion of a state office building \"without restriction as to office space for housing the corporation commissioner's department or the collection of rent[ ] for the benefit of that department\") could not be deemed to have been for the benefit of the department and was \"chargeable only against the general fund or some other tax or general revenue fund.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at pp. 307-308,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20P.2d%201005\">\n    34 P.2d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

The court held, \"provid[ing] fees for regulatory purposes ... and\n   then devot[ing] the money so received to capital expenditures for a foreign purpose\" violated the special law provision of the California Constitution. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) Important to our discussion of the appropriate remedy, the court concluded the unlawfully diverted money was \"in law still in the corporation commission fund\" and issued a writ of mandate ordering the Controller to \"retransfer from the general funds of the state to the corporation commission fund\" the amount that was unlawfully diverted.
