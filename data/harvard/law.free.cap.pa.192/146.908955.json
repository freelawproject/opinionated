This indebtedness was incurred in the building of a town hall, authorized by an act of assembly and approved by the votes of the qualified electors of the borough- at a public election held for that purpose. The money was lawfully expended, but the town was growing, streets were opened, graded and macadamized and repaired. The town was lighted by gas and electricity, but the borough never built or owned any lighting plant. The expenditures were for the ordinary things incident to the common municipality. It was unfortunate that instead of assessing and collecting sufficient taxes to meet the current expenses, the borough resorted to the issuing of bonds to meet deficiencies. When the bonds matured they were sometimes paid in money, and sometimes new bonds were issued. Of the bonds now outstanding it is impossible for any one to tell which were issued beyond the two per cent limit, and it has been held in Borough of Millerstown v. Frederick, 114 Pa. 435, that \u201c a bond issued by a municipal corporation to fund a debt incurred contrary to the provision of the constitution is worthless, and that a bona fide holder of \u00e1 negotiable municipal bond issued contrary to the provisions of the constitution and the statutes in relation to the same cannot maintain an action against the corporation on it, and that the issuing of bonds by a municipal corporation to fund a debt only a portion of which is beyond the constitutional limit is an entire and indivisible transaction, and the whole issue of bonds is therefore invalid: \u201d Rainsburg Borough v. Fyan, 127 Pa. 74; Williamsport v. Com., 84 Pa. 487; Wade v. Oakmont Borough, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>165 Pa. 479; Davis v. Doylestown Borough, 3 Pa. C. C. R. 573; Com. v. Councils of Pittsburg, 41 Pa. 278; Millerstown Borough v. Frederick, 114 Pa. 435.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-5\">The borough of Columbia created debts for ordinary current expenditures and recognized them and paid the interest and is only now seeking to redeem them by issuing new ones, because of the cheapness of money. It recognizes the debts and is willing to pay them and is now proceeding by election to procure popular approval, and no question is raised as to the propriety of the proceeding under the.act of assembly. It did not before ask for popular approval as it should have done, but it is asking for it now. The liability of the borough for the debts is admitted in the answer and a popular election may now be had to authorize and approve the issuing of bonds, and this could be done if none had been issued, and their issue maybe authorized, approved and now ratified.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-6\">No appearance or paper-book for appellee.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A9R\">May 31, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b170-7\">Pee Cueiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">We find no error in the decree from which this appeal was taken.
