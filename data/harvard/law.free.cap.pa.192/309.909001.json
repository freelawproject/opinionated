A. Hirst, Esq., presented claim of S. H. Austin, Jr., for $5,830.40. This claimant had dealt with L. H. Taylor &amp; Company for some time, but his account was closed in March, 1895. On October 17, 1895, he paid Taylor &amp; Company $1,000 and ordered the purchase of 200 shares of American Tobacco Company common stock for $9,312.50. On October 31 he purchased 100 shares of Electric Storage Company stock, selling same on that day at an advance of over $400. On November 7 and 11 he purchased in three lots a total of 600 shares of American Tobacco Company common stock, costing about $26,000. On the latter date the Electric Storage Company stock was ordered sold, and $3,000 cash was paid on account. On November 14, two lots of 200 shares each of American Tobacco Company common stock were sold for a total of $18,037.50. On November 18,19 and 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>1895, the claimant ordered the purchase of three lots of 200 shares each of American Tobacco Company common stock, and paid $3,000 additional on account. On November 26,100 shares of American Sugar Refining Company common stock and 200 shares of American Tobacco Company common stock, and on November 27, 100 shares of the latter stock were ordered purchased, making Mr. Austin\u2019s debit balance $65,328.67. On November 29, 200 shares of American Tobacco Company common stock and 100 shares American Sugar Refining Company common stock were ordered sold. On December 20,1895, claimant\u2019s account is in debit $39,457.10 as against which L. H. Taylor &amp; Company held 1,000 shares of American Tobacco Company common stock and 100 shares of American Tobacco Company preferred stock. This account shows seven or eight completed transactions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-4\">After a most careful consideration of all the evidence in this case, having regard to the presumption of regularity, I am obliged to find, from the number and character of the transactions, that this claimant merely intended to gamble upon the rise and fall of the market, and I therefore disallow his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\">On exceptions the auditor reported as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-6\">It was strongly urged, on the argument of these exceptions, that I erred in ignoring the claimant\u2019s testimony that he bought the stocks as a \u201c permanent investment,\u201d and that he was a man of large means. The claimant\u2019s testimony as to what he intended to do, however, is strangely at variance with the admitted facts. From October 17, 1895, to the time of the failure, he bought and sold seven or eight lots of stock. His sales would often follow two or three days after his purchases. I am at liberty under the decisions to go beneath the surface and find the real character of the transactions, and it is a stretch of language to say that a man who buys stocks and habitually sells the same a day or so thereafter, is purchasing for \u201c investment.\u201d At the urgent request of counsel, I heard additional testimony at the time of the argument of the exceptions, to the effect that Mr. Austin was worth $1,000,000, and that he had stated prior to the assignment that he was buying this stock for investment. I find that the claimant was a man of wealth. I am unable to see, however, how his statements as to his intentions are legal evidence. The fact remains that instead of hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ing any stock delivered to him he repeatedly bought and sold, taking the profits thereof. I overrule the exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-4\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-5\"><em>Henry J.

H. Taylor &amp; Company, brokers, which was considered in Howard\u2019s Appeal, ante, p. 304. The law was sufficiently discussed in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">At the time of the assignment Taylor &amp; Company held certain shares of stock which had been bought on appellant\u2019s order, partly paid for by him, but not yet delivered. They were not forthcoming on demand but were credited on his account, and he presented a claim for the balance that appeared to be due him.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">. The auditor found that \u201c as far as Taylor &amp; Company were concerned the transactions were not fictitious, but were actual purchases and sales of stock.\u201d He however found \u201c from the number and character of the transactions, that this claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>merely intended to gamble upon tbe rise and fall of the market.\u201d And on the argument of exceptions, the claimant having testified that he bought the stocks as an investment, the auditor said: \u201c The claimant\u2019s testimony as to what he intended to do, however, is strangely at variance with the admitted facts. From October 17, 1895, to the time of the failure, he bought and sold seven or eight lots of stock. His sales would often follow two or three days after his purchases. I am at liberty, under the decisions, to go beneath the surface and find the real character of the transactions, and it is a stretch of language to say that a man who buys stocks and habitually sells the same a day or so thereafter is purchasing for investment.\u201d He therefore disallowed the claim. These two extracts from his report show that the learned auditor proceeded on the popular and not on the legal view of dealing in stocks, and entirely failed to apply the settled legal distinction between \u201c gambling \u201d and legitimate dealing. A man may speculate by buying and selling upon expectation of the rise or fall of the market and he is not thereby gambling. Whether he dealt for that purpose or for investment, and whether he held his purchases an hour, or a day, or a year, are wholly immaterial except as evidence. The test is whether he bought and sold, and not merely settled on differences with no intention at any time of taking his purchases or delivering his sales. That and that only is gambling. As already said, the auditor found that as to Taylor &amp; Company the transactions were actual purchases and sales. The appellant testified that as to himself they had the same character, and this testimony was corroborated and in no way contradicted except by the auditor\u2019s inference \u201c from the number and character of the transactions.\u201d This conclusion was not warranted by anything in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The judgment so far as it relates to this appellant\u2019s claim is reversed and the claim directed to be allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
