Before Finletter, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-4\">. This action was brought by Laura Y. Mintzer against the trustees under the will of William Hogg, Jr., for personal injuries received by stepping into a hole in the sidewalk on the southern side of East York street near Jaspar street. Five trustees are appointed by the will, and are named in the summons ; one of them is dead and two are nonresidents. The summons was served on only two of the trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that on the evening of October 3,1896, she came from a point beyond Jaspar street, which she crossed, and stepped into a hole in front of No. 1904, which was more than two feet long by more than a foot and a half wide and nearly a foot deep. She excused her failure to see the hole by the statement that the electric light was very poor. The house had been rented to a Mrs. Kress, about the previous Easter, and it was alleged by plaintiff that there were at the time some loose bricks in the pavement, and sweeping and cleaning by the tenants had enlarged the hole. It was repaired immediately after the accident, and it was alleged that the new bricks used in the repair still showed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\">[The court was asked to allow the jury to view the place that they might see for themselves where the patching had been done; but the request was refused, and defendants excepted to the refusal.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-7\">It was admitted that testator had died seized of the property and that defendants, who were before the court, together with William and James Hogg, residents of Worcester, Mass., were trustees under his will, and as such have a legal title to the property. It was not shown that any of the defendants or any of their agents or subagents knew or had notice of the defect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-8\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-9\">This action is brought to recover damages arising from an injury which plaintiff suffered in consequence of the negligence of the defendants. There are two questions to be determined by the jury. First, were the defendants negligent; and, secondly, was the plaintiff negligent in such a way as contributed to the injury? No matter how negligent the defendants may have been, if the plaintiff in any degree contributed to the accident she cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>[It was the duty of the defendants to keep their pavement in reasonably good repair.] [1] It was the duty of the plaintiff to exercise reasonable watchfulness under all the circumstances of the case. The questions which the jury are to consider are, first of all, was the brick pavement out of repair; that is to say, were the bricks removed and was there a hole created by the removal of the bricks, or any other matter, touching the want of repair. You will understand that property owners are not responsible for the ordinary unevenness of a brick pavement, but only when the pavement itself is out of repair, or, in other words, when portions of a brick pavement are removed, or when there exists such a condition as is complained of here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">Again, if you find that the brick pavement was out of repair, you will determine from the evidence whether it was dangerous or not. You will also determine from the evidence whether the want of repair in the pavement caused the injury complained of by the plaintiff. In this connection it is important for you to consider what knowledge the plaintiff had of the pavement itself\u2014its condition, and its surroundings, and the general locality or neighborhood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">If you are satisfied from all the evidence in this case\u2014and I mean the evidence of the defendants as well as for the plaintiff \u2014that the defendants were negligent, then the question arises, was the plaintiff herself negligent? In considering this question the jury will consider, first, her knowledge of the locality, of the pavement itself, and of the hole, and its want of repair. Again, the jury are to take into consideration a very important thing, and that is the time\u2014whether it was daylight or night, or whether there was sufficient light, or what quantity of light was thrown upon the hole itself by the reflection of light in and about the place. Again, the jury will take into consideration all the difficulties and circumstances which might have entered into a consideration of the safety or danger of crossing that pavement, in the plaintiff\u2019s mind, such as the darkness of the night, and the obscurity of the light, and all the attendant circumstances. In this connection I have also to say that the greater the difficulty of seeing clearly, renders the greater care on her part. The wayfarer is bound to consider the difficulties of seeing clearly, as he passes along, just as in ordinary circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>3tances lie will consider any question which involves his safety. In this connection it is my duty to say to you that the plaintiff was not bound to exercise extraordinary care. She had a right to assume that the pavement was reasonably safe, and that by the ordinary use of her eyes she could safely walk upon it. Care, under all the circumstances, is all that the law enjoined upon her to exercise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">Defendants\u2019 points and the answers thereto were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">1. If the accident for which this suit is brought occurred by reason of the defect (described in the evidence) in the sidewalk of the public highway in front of a house occupied by a tenant, the landlords of the house are not liable therefor to the plaintiff. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-7\">2. An owner out of possession, whose house is in the actual occupation of a tenant, is not required to keep a constant supervision of such house and of the highway in front of it; and if a defect occurs in the sidewalk during such occupation by a tenant, by reason of which a person walking on the street is injured, the landlord is not liable to the person injured, unless knowledge or notice of such defect is traced to him. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-8\">3. An owner out of possession, whose house is in the actual occupation of a tenant, is not liable for an accident from a defect in the sidewalk arising during the occupation by the tenant unless he have formal notice from the city to repair the defect. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-9\">5. If the jury believe that the hole in which the plaintiff claims to have fallen was in front of property 1902 York street, under the pleadings and evidence the plaintiff cannot recover. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-10\">6. The defendants, being merely trustees of a legal title, are not responsible in the first instance to plaintiff for her injury from an accident occurring by reason of a defect in the public highway unconnected with the building, no notice having been given them to repair. The responsibility in the first instance is on the city of Philadelphia. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-11\">7. The evidence on behalf of plaintiff showing that at the time 1904 was leased to the tenant in possession at the time of the accident, the defect in the highway was a very minor one, and the hole having been rendered dangerous by sweeping dirt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>out of it, making it deeper and loosening the bricks, tbe responsibility is upon tbe tenant and not upon tbe trustees defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-5\">8. It appearing in plaintiff\u2019s evidence, if believed, that tbe defect was an obvious one; that it was near an electric light, and that the sidewalk was not obstructed, she is guilty of contributory negligence, and tbe verdict should be for tbe defendants. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-6\">9. Under all tbe evidence tbe verdict should be for tbe defendants. <em>Answer: </em>Refused.

By the Act of March 25,1805, 4 Sm. L. sec. 5, p. 233, the councils were authorized by ordinance to compel property owners to pave the footwalks. By Act of April 10,1826, P. L. 326, sec. 2, it was made the duty of property owners to have the footway in front of such ground curbed and paved and to keep the same in repair.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">To the same effect are: Act of April 16, 1838, P. L. 626, sec. 3; Act of April 16,1840, P. L. 412, sec. 9; Act of March 22, 1865, P.

So by the Act of May 16, 1891, P. L. 75, sec. 11, the municipal authorities may require sidewalks to be kept in repair by the property owners. So by the Act of May 7, 1889, P. L. 110, sec. 2, all sidewalks built by landowners along the public highways must be kept in repair by said landowner at his own expense. By the ordinance of May 3, 1855, sec. 1, p. 142 (Brightly\u2019s Phila. Digest, p. 260, \u00a7 279), it is provided that the footways of all public streets and highways in the city of Philadelphia \u201cshall be graded, curbed, paved and kept in repair at the expense of the owners of the ground fronting thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-8\">An owner of property cannot escape liability for an existing nuisance thereon by demising it to a tenant and putting him in possession: Wunder v.

Chief Justice Stebbett,</author>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">While the manner in which the defendants sought to perfect their appeal, etc., after .the record was sent up here, is irregular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>and unsatisfactory, we all agree that in view of the special circumstances of the case\u2014especially the illness of the learned trial judge, etc.\u2014the motion to quash the appeal should not prevail; and the motion is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Without unnecessarily consuming time in referring here to the evidence relied on by the parties respectively, it is sufficient to say that our examination of the record has not disclosed any error in the proceedings, leading up to and including the judgment, that would justify us in sustaining any of the specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In view of the evidence, all of the nine points for charge presented by the defendants, except the fourth, were rightly refused by the learned trial judge. In affirming their fourth point, he properly instructed the jury in the words thereof thus: \u201c A person walking along the highway is required to exercise a reasonable watchfulness over his feet, and if the jury believe that this plaintiff, at the time of the accident, did not exercise such watchfulness, she cannot recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Viewed in the light of this instruction, the verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor necessarily implies a finding by the jury that she did exercise such \u201creasonable watchfulness,\u201d in walking on the pavement in front of defendants\u2019 house on the east side of York street,\u2014the point at which she was injured,\u2014and hence she was not guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The question of defendants\u2019 neglect of duty, in not keeping the pavement in front of their \u201c house in such order and condition as to permit persons traveling over and along said pavement, .... to do so safely, etc., was fairly submitted to the jury with instructions so full and adequate that no just exception can be taken thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The subject of complaint in the first specification is that \u201cthe court erred in entering judgment in favor of the plaintiff, inasmuch as her statement .... sets forth no cause of action, but purports to be a breach of duty in failing to keep a part of the highway in repair; whereas there is no duty in law incumbent on defendants or any of them to keep the highway in repair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">If this is intended to appty to the sidewalk on which plaintiff was injured, it is not correct as a legal proposition. It is the primary duty of property owners along a street, to keep in proper repair the sidewalk in front of their respective proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ties: Lohr v. Phillipsburg, 156 Pa. 249; Duncan v. Philadelphia, 173 Pa. 554; Pittsburg v. Fay, 8 Pa. Superior Ct. 275; Pittsburg y. Daly, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 532. Hence it is that, owing to this primary liability, many cases exist in this state, in which, after recovery from the municipality, the latter has successfully recovered over from the property owner on account of his breach of his primary duty to keep the sidewalk in a safe condition. Among these are Reading v. Reiner, 167 Pa. 41, Brookville v. Arthurs, 152 Pa. 334, and s. c. 130 Pa. 501. Several statutes in this state also recognize the duty of the property owner to keep his sidewalk in a safe condition. By Act of March 25, 1805, 4 Smith\u2019s Laws, 233, sec. 5, councils were authorized by ordinance to compel property owners to pave the footwalks; and by the Act of April 10, 1826, P. L. 326, sec. 2, it was made the duty of property owners to pave the foot-way in front of their respective properties, and to keep the same in repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">To the same effect are the following acts: April 16, 1838, P. L. 626, sec. 3; April 16, 1840, P. L. 412, sec. 9; March 22, 1865, P. L. 562, sec. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The averments in plaintiff\u2019s statement are quite sufficient to entitle her to recover, and the evidence tended to sustain all that were material to her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The second and last specification, complaining of the refusal of the court to permit \u201cthe jury to be taken to the place in question and inspect the pavement,\u201d cannot be sustained. The request of defendants was an appeal to the sound discretion of the court, and there appears to be nothing whatever in the record that would justify us in saying that the discretion vested in the court below in that regard was improperly exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">We find nothing in any of the assignments of error that require further notice. They are all overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
