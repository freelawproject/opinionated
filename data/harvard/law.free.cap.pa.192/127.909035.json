Wilkinson, and his brother Samuel Wilkinson, composed the firm of John P. Wilkinson &amp; Brother, doing business at Unionville, Chester county, Pennsylvania, for over twenty years prior to Samuel Wilkinson\u2019s death, in carrying on a tannery. Samuel Wilkinson died January 14, 1893. John P. Wilkinson died July 22, 1896. His widow, Hannah A. Wilkinson, died November 9,1896. On January 1, 1892, the firm of John P. Wilkinson &amp; Brother leased their tannery at Unionville, to Edgar A. Wilkinson and Charles F. Cutler. All the business of the firm from that time done at the tannery by said firm was to work up the raw stock, and dispose of the material on hand. Several months were occupied in this work. While' thus engaged in business, the firm to a large extent invested their surplus money in western mortgages and to some extent in Reading Railroad stock, in the name of John P. Wilkinson &amp; Brother. They also had an interest in real estate at Jennerville, Chatham and Unionville, the title to which was in their individual names, but had been paid for with the firm funds and was carried on their books as firm assets. Each kept separate bank accounts and had separate bank boxes. They also kept a firm bank account in the name of John P. Wilkinson &amp; Brother, and also had a firm bank box, in which the firm securities were kept. At the death of Samuel Wilkinson, there was about $7,000 to $8,000 worth of leather on hand belonging to the firm, and securities standing in the name of the firm for the face value of about $20,000, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>had been paid for with firm funds. After Samuel Wilkinson\u2019s death, John P. Wilkinson took charge of all the firm assets, including securities and railroad stock standing in the firm name, disposed in part of the firm assets and discharged the firm liabilities, and, prior to his death, had paid all the firm debts owing when Samuel died, so that at the death of John P. Wilkinson, there were no liabilities of the firm outstanding, except the current expenses of carrying the joint property; the remaining assets of the firm were in part in western mortgages, Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad stock and cash in bank to the credit of John P. Wilkinson &amp; Brother. This account in bank was continued on after Samuel Wilkinson\u2019s death to John P. Wilkinson\u2019s death, as it had been before. At the death of John P. Wilkinson, the amount standing to the credit of John P. Wilkinson &amp; Brother in the First National Bank of West Chester, where all these accounts and securities were kept, was $7,497.47, which sum the accountant in this account has charged herself with. The balance of this firm account to the credit of the firm, at the time of Samuel Wilkinson\u2019s death was about $687.87. The deposits in this firm account since January 1, 1894, to the death of John P. Wilkinson, consists exclusively of coupons on western mortgages and western securities collected, and the credits since the same date are made up of taxes and repairs on joint real estate, insurance on the same, foreclosure costs, assessments on the Reading Railroad stock and payments to the executors of Samuel Wilkinson on account of his interest in the securities collected. At the date of John P. Wilkinson\u2019s will, February 8, 1894, the balance to the credit of the firm account in the bank was about $350. On October 1, 1894, it was $398. On July 12, 1895, it was $1,496.49. On August 19, 1895, it was increased by the Alexander mortgage collected, $850. On January 13, 1896, by another firm investment collected, $4,280. And on June 20, 1896, by another collection of like character, $925. On February 22, 1894, John P. Wilkinson paid said executors $1,500. On August 9, 1894, $1,800, and on January 16, 1895, $1,000. After the death of John P. Wilkinson, the legal representatives of the estate of Samuel Wilkinson spent considerable time in going over the account between John P. Wilkinson and Samuel Wilkinson, taking into account all the moneys received by John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>since the death of Samuel, as well as all the moneys paid by John to Samuel Wilkinson\u2019s executors, and arrived at a conclusion which was satisfactory to the representatives of both estates, that John P. Wilkinson\u2019s estate was entitled to credit as against Samuel Wilkinson upon the joint account of $1,614.68. All the other joint and firm property had been disposed of prior to John\u2019s death, except the securities standing in the firm name of John P. Wilkinson &amp; Brother, which were not collected, and the above bank balance. This settlement fixed the respective interests of the partners in this cash balance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-4\">The balance in bank at time of John\u2019s death as above</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">stated, was.........$7,497 47</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-6\">Add the amount due by Samuel\u2019s estate, to the firm as above agreed upon, .......1,614 68</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-7\">Makes a total of........$9,112 15</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-8\">One half of which, or....... 4,556 07</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-9\">would represent John P.

Wilkinson made his will dated February 8,1894, and by said will in item No. 2, devised to his widow, Hannah A. Wilkinson, his undivided one-half interest in all the real estate in Unionville he owned, \u201ctogether with the household and kitchen furniture, clothing, contents of the cellar, and all provisions and all articles belonging to me in the house, my horse, two carriages, all my harness, cutter, stable furniture, hay, feed, feed chest, cutting box, chickens, all money in the house and bank or on hand at the time of my death.\u201d Under this clause of the will, Mr. Pierce claims that the above sum of $4,556.07 belongs to the estate of Hannah A. Wilkinson. The balance of said fund in bank, as above ascertained, belongs to the estate of Samuel Wilkinson, and it is agreed that it shall be so awarded. . . . . Did John P. Wilkinson\u2019s share of this deposit, in the First National Bank of West Chester to the credit of John P. Wilkinson &amp; Brother, pass to his widow, Hannah A. Wilkinson, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the bequest contained in his will, of \u201c all moneys in bank or on hand at the time of my death.\u201d Strictly speaking, the balance to the credit of a depositor in bank is not \u201c money.\u201d It is a chose in action, a liability of the bank to the depositor. Where it is clear from the will that the intention of the testator was to pass a deposit in bank by the term \u201c money,\u201d that term has been held to cover such deposit. Where a testator gives to one person \u201c all his moneys on hand,\u201d and to another, \u201c all his money out on securities,\u201d the balance at his banker\u2019s will pass as \u201c money on hand: \u201d Varsey v. Reynolds, 5 Russell, 12. A legacy of \u201c all money on hand or in bank at the time of my decease \u201d will pass money in the hands of an agent: Copias\u2019s Estate, 5 Philadelphia, 214.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-4\">Under a bequest of \u201c all moneys \u201d that the testator should die possessed of, the legatee is entitled to the cash\u2014using the term in a popular sense\u2014which at the time of his death, the testator had in his possession or deposited in bank: Beck v. McGillis, 9 Barber, 59. The term \u201c money \u201d in a will may be construed to mean pash, or may stand for the whole of the personal estate, and it is to be received in one or the other sense as will best effectuate the general intention of the testator deduced from every part of his will: Smith v. Davis, 1 Grant, 158; Carr\u2019s Estate, 13 Pa. C. C. R. 643. And it has been even held to include real estate: Jacob\u2019s Estate, 140 Pa. 268.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-5\">It is admitted, and properly so, that the moneys John P. Wilkinson had on deposit in the First National Bank of West Chester to his individual credit, at the time of his decease, passed to his widow under this clause of his will. The testator used the word \u201c money \u201d twice in his will, namely, in the clause under consideration and also in the seventh item of his will, disposing of his residuary estate. The seventh item of his will is as follows: \u201c I direct my executor to pay all moneys not herein disposed of to in-trust nevertheless for the bpnefit of my wife for life,\u201d and then to legatees specifically named. In this clause he undoubtedly used the term \u201c money \u201d to include all his personal property not otherwise disposed of, and the proceeds of his real estate directed to be sold. It might be assumed fairly that the same meaning should be given to the word in both clauses; but when item No. 2, in which the term \u201c money \u201d is first used is examined, it is evident that he did not give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>same meaning to the term in the second item as he has in the seventh item of his mil. For, in the second item he specifically mentions all the other property in the house, and the use of the word \u201cmoney\u201d in this clause occurs in one of these specifications. If he had meant by the use of the word \u201c money \u201d in the second item all his property in the house, it would not be necessary to specify his other property therein, nor is it likely he would do so. The use of the word in different meanings in the same instrument shows that he did not employ the term \u201c money \u201d in any strict sense of its meaning. It is probable that in drafting the residuary clause, he looked upon and contemplated his whole estate as turned into money and disposed of it in that form. By the will, he first gave to his wife, \u201c for a home,\u201d all his interest in the real estate where he resided, together with all the personal estate therein and used in connection therewith. He then authorizes his executrix, his widow, to sell and rent all his real estate not specifically disposed of, and after giving two pecuniary bequests aggregating $550, and bequeathing his watch and chain, he gave all the residue of his estate under the term \u201c money \u201d for the use of his wife for life, and at her death he gave the same to the collateral heirs therein named. He had no children. He was a man of considerable property. He had not been in active business for several years and was living on the income of his investments and property. The general intention of his will, so far as his wife is concerned, seems to have been to make such a disposition of his estate that his wife should be enabled to continue keeping up the same home and to live in the same way as they had been living in his lifetime. He not only gives her the real estate which had been their home for years, but also directs that she should have everything needful to make that home comfortable, and to carry the same on, and to live in the same way as they had been living during his lifetime. To accomplish this, he seeks to place her in the same situation as to his property as he was. She was not only to have the real estate for her home, but everything in the way of personal property about it, just as it was when he died, namely, \u201c the household and kitchen furniture, including the contents of the cellar, all provisions, and all articles belonging to me in the house, my horse, two carriages, all my harness, cutter, stable furniture, hay, feed, feed chest, cutting box, chick<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ens, all money in the house and bank or on hand, at the time of my death.\u201d In addition thereto, she was to have the income of nearly all the balance of his estate. As he had been dependent on the income from his investments for a livelihood, so she was to have and enjoy the same after his decease. This being the clear intention as gathered from the will, the words of the will under consideration are to be interpreted in the light of this general intention, and she would be entitled under the term \u201c money \u201d to all specific sums of money he had at the time of his death available for his immediate use, in case of need. All such items coming under the general description of money which he had on hand to be used in the payment of the current expenses of his household, and which he could immediately command, would pass by this bequest. Prudent men keep on hand, or in hank, or about them, a reasonable sum of money to meet all ordinary and usual expenses of living, and it was the evident intention of Mr. Wilkinson by his will, that his wife should at his death, take for her own use, all such funds he then had on hand. He had at the time of his death in cash in the house $30.00, and in the bank to his individual credit $336.54, for the purposes indicated, and such moneys he undoubtedly meant his wife should get at once and absolutely upon his decease. An examination of John P. Wilkinson\u2019s individual bank account, for several years prior to his decease, shows that it was made up of dividends collected, coupons and cash deposited, and the checks were for personal expenses, and that the balance he had on hand for several years averaged about $400. These moneys undoubtedly passed by the will to the widow under the clause in question. The account kept in the name of the firm was never drawn upon by John P. Wilkinson for his personal expenses or in any way used for his individual transactions except to purchase investments. In lieu of the cash he paid over from time to time to the executors of Samuel Wilkinson, he took with their approval investments belonging to the firm and standing in the firm name. This bank account was kept in the name of the firm and by the surviving partner, and was made up exclusively of firm assets and transactions. It was treated as firm assets by John P. Wilkinson. He never drew upon it for his individual use. No settlement of the partnership affairs had been made before his death. As the surviv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ing and liquidating partner, lie was the trustee for all concerned in the partnership and was accountable as such: Parsons on Partnership, p. 441.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-4\">This fund was a trust fund and consisted exclusively of firm assets and was firm assets until a settlement was made between the partners or their representatives. Neither partner had any right to any part of the fund. At the death of John P. Wilkinson, the only legal way to close up the partnership would have been the appointment of a receiver, who would have been entitled to take this trust fund as part of the partnership assets and hold the same until the respective rights of the partners therein, as well as in other assets, were adjudicated. The estate of Samuel Wilkinson could not compel payment to them of any part of this fund until an account was stated or settlement made of the firm affair\u2019s. The fund was not the individual property of the partners, and if it had not been for the settlement of the relations of the partners to this fund immediately after John\u2019s death, by the representatives of both parties, this fund could not have been paid to the bank by any one except a receiver of the firm. So that this balance to the firm account in bank was of such a character that it was not \u201c money in bank or on hand \u201d of John P. Wilkinson at his death. In the judgment of the auditor, for the reasons given, the widow is not entitled to this fund under the terms of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-6\"><em>Thomas W.

Justice Gbeen,</author>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">We quite agree with the learned auditor in the court below in his disposition of tins case. The money deposited in bank to th\u00a9 credit of the firm of John P. Wilkinson &amp; Brother was not the money of John P. Wilkinson, but of a firm of which he was a member. What proportion of it might belong to him as an individual would depend upon a settlement of the partnership accounts, and even when that was done it would have to be paid over to him before his private and exclusive ownership of it could attach. This fund could only be claimed by the executor of the widow under the clause of the will of John P. Wilkinson which gave to his widow, \u201c All money in the house and bank or on hand at the time of my death.\u201d At the time of the testator\u2019s death there was a small sum of money, $30.00, in the house, and there was to the credit of his individual account in bank the sum of $336.45. These were the only sums of money \u201c in the house and bank or on hand,\u201d belonging to him at the time of his death. They would fully satisfy the requirement of the words which gave the legacy, and would obviate any necessity for resorting to another fund which did not belong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>to the testator in his individual capacity, in order to give effect to his will. We think this conclusion is so exceedingly plain that any further elaboration of the subject is quite unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
