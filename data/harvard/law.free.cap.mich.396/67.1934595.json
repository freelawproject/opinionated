Further, we are asked to consider whether the alibi notice statute is constitutional, or if it violates defendant\u2019s rights to due process and to compulsory process. We hold there was such an abuse of discretion. We therefore reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial. It is therefore unnecessary to reach the issue of constitutionality in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">I \u2014 Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Defendant Joseph Charles Merritt appeared with retained counsel and was arraigned on a charge of armed robbery in the taking of a wallet containing $8 to $10 on November 19, 1971. A trial date of January 18, 1972 was established at pretrial conference. Defendant notified counsel of the existence of alibi witnesses two weeks before trial. However, because he was ill with the flu, counsel was unable to investigate these witnesses until Saturday, January 15, and did not complete his interviews until Monday, January 17. A notice of alibi was not filed until the following day, January 18, the first day of trial. This was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>trary to the alibi statute then in effect, MCLA 768.20; MSA 28.1043, which required such notice to be filed at least four days before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In order to avoid the consequences of the late filing, counsel made a motion to adjourn. The first hearing on the adjournment motion was on January 12, but counsel was absent because of illness. A second hearing the next day resulted in what the judge characterized as a \"Mexican standoff\u201d at the last hearing five days later. The prosecution objected to the adjournment motion and the defense rejected a consolidation of the trials of defendant and another man, Richard Firth, who had been apprehended at the same time. By now, the judge suggested, matters were out of his hands, and he recommended that the waiver of the four-day alibi notice provision be considered the next day, when the matter would be brought to trial before another judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Trial proceeded the following day in front of another judge. The prosecution motion for consolidation was rendered unnecessary when defendant Firth\u2019s counsel announced Firth\u2019s intention to plead guilty to a reduced charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Defense counsel renewed his motion for adjournment, and was referred back to the first judge, who apparently denied it. The prosecution again objected to late filing of the alibi notice and the objection was sustained. Despite the ruling, defense counsel filed the notice, listing four witnesses who would sustain defendant\u2019s alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">During the course of the trial, defense counsel made two other attempts to present the alibi defense. On the first occasion, he renewed his motion to assert the defense, and explained he had received the alibi information from his client ten days before trial, but because of his illness was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>unable to interview the witnesses. Further, he maintained that since the purpose of a notice of alibi was to provide notice, the prosecution had that, and were now able to check out the purported witnesses. The prosecution objected, claiming this delay was caused by the defendant\u2019s own conduct, and he should not be permitted to use it for his benefit. The judge denied the motion:</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\"Well, this court is not inclined to give heavy reliance to rules which are essentially technical and doesn\u2019t often, but the rule requiring minimal notice to the people of so significant a defense as alibi is something more than a technical rule. I think its purpose has been demonstrated in this case. For that reason, the motion is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The trial progressed. Shortly before the prosecution called its two last witnesses, defense counsel suggested that denial of the motion to present the alibi defense referred only to the charge to the jury. He should, therefore, he argued, be permitted to present witnesses to show defendant was elsewhere. However, he was unable to present requested legal precedent to support this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Counsel requested the judge to use his discretion and to admit the evidence anyway. The judge denied the request:</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">\"In view of those circumstances, there appears to be no justification for the notice not having been given to the prosecutor according to the legislative intention. Certainly, the giving of the . notice on the day of the trial, which is three months after the alleged event where counsel is present and retained, is not, in this court\u2019s judgment, valid excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">\"The order will be, gentlemen, that the statute be complied with and I direct defendant and counsel for both sides not to suggest to the jury, directly or indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>rectly, through any evidence offered by the defendant or any other witness, that alibi is the defense. That order is made, exercised in the court\u2019s discretion and consistent with MSA 26.1044.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The court also instructed counsel to be sure defendant himself did not refer to alibi in his testimony. The defense rested without presenting evidence. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to 10 to 25 years imprisonment. The Court of Appeals affirmed without discussion in a memorandum opinion. We granted leave to appeal June 24, 1974. 392 Mich 751; 219 NW2d 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">II \u2014 The Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">At the time of trial, the statute requiring defense counsel to file a notice of alibi not less than four days before trial did not require automatic exclusion of the evidence. Instead, the statute required the court to use its discretion to determine whether the preclusion sanction was warranted by a particular failure to timely file.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The pertinent statutory language at the time of this case read:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\"Whenever a defendant in a criminal case not cognizable by a justice of the peace shall propose to offer in his defense testimony to establish an alibi on behalf of the defendant, or of the insanity of such defendant either at the time of the alleged offense or at the time of trial, such defendant shall at the time of arraignment or within 10 days thereafter but not less than 4 days before the trial of such cause file and serve upon the prosecuting attorney in such cause a notice in writing of his intention to claim such defense and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>names of witnesses to be called in behalf of such defendant to establish such defense known to him at that time. Names of other witnesses may be filed and served before or during the trial by leave of the court and upon such conditions as the court shall determine. In cases of a claimed alibi such notice shall include specific information as to the place at which the accused claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense.\u201d MCLA 768.20; MSA 28.1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\"In the event of the failure of a defendant to file the written notice prescribed in the preceding section, the court may in its discretion exclude evidence offered by such defendant for the purpose of establishing an alibi or the insanity of such defendant as set forth in the preceding section.\u201d MCLA 768.21; MSA 28.1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The United States Supreme Court has recently upheld the constitutionality of requiring a notice of alibi, <em>Williams v Florida, </em>399 US 78, 83; 90 S Ct 1893; 26 L Ed 2d 446 (1970), but did not reach the question of the constitutionality of the preclusion sanction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3****Three years later, when the Court invalidated an alibi notice statute for failure to provide reciprocal discovery, <em>Wardius v Oregon, </em>412 US 470, 472; 93 S Ct 2208; 37 L Ed 2d 82 (1973), it once again did not reach the preclusion issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since defendant at trial in the instant case contested only the discretion of the trial judge under the statute, it is not necessary for this Court, too, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>to decide the constitutionality of the preclusion sanction at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Ill \u2014 Application of Alibi Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">According to the United States Supreme Court, the rationale behind the notice of alibi statute is that</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\"[T]he ends of justice will best be served by a system of liberal discovery which gives both parties the maximum possible amount of information with which to prepare their cases and thereby reduces the possibility of surprise at trial.\u201d <em>Wardius v Oregon, </em>412 US 470, 473; 93 S Ct 2208, 2211; 37 L Ed 2d 82, 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Further, \"[g]iven the ease with which an alibi can be fabricated the State\u2019s interest in protecting itself against an eleventh-hour defense is both obvious and legitimate\u201d. <em>Williams v Florida, </em>399 US 78, 81; 90 S Ct 1893, 1896; 26 L Ed 2d 446, 450. Thus, the statute \"was not intended as a disparagement of the defense\u201d, <em>Connery v State, </em>499 P2d 462, 465 (Okla Crim App, 1972), but \"statutes providing for the defense of alibi are intended to erect safeguards against its wrongful use and give the prosecution time and information to investigate the merits of such defense\u201d. <em>State v Martin, </em>2 Ariz App 510, 514-515; 410 P2d 132, 136-137 (1966). The procedure is \"for the benefit and protection of the public\u201d. <em>People v McFadden, </em>347 Mich 357, 363; 79 NW2d 869, 872 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">State judgments as to the appropriate time for such notice differ, from, for example, the day of arraignment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to three days before trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>days before trial,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> four days after prosecutor\u2019s demand,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> five days before trial,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or four days before trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If timely notice is not filed, most states require that the alibi notice be excluded within the discretion of the court. Statutory guidance for the exercise of such discretion varies from \"for good cause shown\u201d,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to a requirement that \"the defendant establishes to the satisfaction of the court that witnesses to be called and not named in the notice were not known at the time such notice was filed or the court for other good cause permits the notice to be amended\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Preclusion of alibi evidence is mandatory in Kansas<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> *****and under the new Michigan statute, fn 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Discretion of judges in excluding alibi testimony in the absence of timely notice has usually been upheld. The trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in these instances will not be disturbed<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> unless it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\"discretion manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons\u201d. 10 Wash App 468, 470-471; 519 P2d 261, 263. At least one Court, however, has required that surprise or other disadvantage must be claimed by the prosecution, no matter how inexcusable defendant\u2019s neglect, in order to justify use of the preclusion sanction. The Court determined that the trial judge has ample discretionary powers other than preclusion to deal with those unduly delaying the court\u2019s proceedings or trifling with the judicial process. <em>State v Grant, </em>10 Wash App 468, 474; 519 P2d 261, 265 (1974). Thus, instead of excluding evidence, a trial court may grant a continuance in order to permit the prosecution to investigate the alibi defense. <em>E.g., Connery v State, supra, </em>499 P2d 462, 466;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>State v Grant, </em>10 Wash App 468, 473-474; 519 P2d 261, 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">IV \u2014 Applicable Michigan Precedent</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">It is clear that under Michigan law a trial judge has discretion to determine whether to grant a continuance instead of applying the preclusion sanction. <em>People v Fleisher, </em>322 Mich 474, 480-481; 34 NW2d 15 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Most cases, however, dealing with the question of discretion in applying the alibi notice statute have focused on the appropriateness of excluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>evidence. The Court of Appeals has given trial judges broad discretion<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in determining whether alibi evidence was indeed correctly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">It is by now well-settled that a trial judge commits reversible error if he or she does not recognize that he or she has discretion and therefore fails or refuses to exercise it. <em>People v Jackson, </em>391 Mich 323, 332; 217 NW2d 22, 26 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In the ordinary course, this is the correct approach. A motion addressed to the trial court\u2019s discretion may be reversed only upon finding an abuse of this discretion by the trial judge. <em>Wendel v Swanberg, </em>384 Mich 468, 477; 185 NW2d 348 (1971). We set out the appropriate means for determining whether such an abuse has occurred in <em>People v Charles O Williams, </em>386 Mich 565, 573; 194 NW2d 337, 340 (1972), which relied on the approach of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Ungar v Sarafite, </em>376 US 575, 589; 84 S Ct 841; 11 L Ed 2d 921 (1964):</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\"The matter of continuance is traditionally within the discretion of the trial judge, and it is not every denial of a request for more time that violates due process even if the party fails to offer evidence or is compelled to defend without counsel. <em>Avery v Alabama, 308 US </em>444 [60 S Ct <em>321; 84 L Ed 377 </em>(1940)]. <em>Contrariwise, </em>a <em>myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justi\u00f1able request for delay can render the right to defend with counsel an empty formality. Chandler v Fretag, </em>348 US 3 [75 S Ct 1; 99 L Ed 4 (1954)]. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>There are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. <em>The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied. Nilva v United States, </em>352 US 385 [77 S Ct 431; 1 L Ed 2d 415 (1957)].\u201d 386 Mich 565, 575; 194 NW2d 337, 341-342. (Emphasis added in <em>Williams.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><em>Williams </em>dealt with defendant\u2019s request for a continuance in order to effect a substitution of counsel. We held, 386 Mich 565, 578; 194 NW2d 337, 343:</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\"In view of the facts that: 1) defendant was asserting a constitutional right \u2014 the right to counsel; 2) he had a legitimate reason for asserting this right \u2014 an irreconcilable <em>bona \u00a3de </em>dispute with his attorney over whether to call his alibi witnesses; 3) he was not guilty of negligence; and 4) the trial court was incorrect in stating that defendant had caused the trial to be adjourned several times \u2014 we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and in preventing defendant from changing attorneys and granting a continuance in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The issue in the instant case is no less fundamental and important than, and is analogous to, the right to counsel in <em>Williams. </em>Defendant has a right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> US Const, Am VI; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20, and the judge\u2019s choice to invoke preclusion rather than grant a continuance jeop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ardizes that right. Therefore, the stricter standard and four-part test of that case is appropriate to the issue before us. The preclusion sanction is an extremely severe one, and the judge\u2019s discretion in exercising preclusion should be limited only to an egregious case. Clearly, it would be improper to exclude the defense where neither serious abuse of the right on the part of defendant nor prejudice to the people\u2019s case have been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The Court of Appeals, even without applying the stricter <em>Williams </em>standard, has properly looked closely at several instances of exclusion. Thus, in <em>People v Woody, </em>25 Mich App 627, 630; 181 NW2d 621, 622 (1970), no abuse of discretion was found as long as the trial court allowed defendant\u2019s main alibi witness to testify. Even more important, the panel in the recent case of <em>People v Robinson, </em>54 Mich App 704, 707; 221 NW2d 596, 598 (1974), required more than a simple declaration that the prosecution would be prejudiced to justify exercise of the sanction where it appeared the prosecutor had one week\u2019s oral notice of alibi and the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">However, even under <em>Williams, </em>whether the choice was an appropriate one varies with the facts of each case, and must inevitably involve a weighing of the competing interests involved. Where the preclusion sanction is involved these issues become: do the possible risk of false testimony<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the interruption in the orderly admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>istration of justice justify this intrusion on defendant\u2019s right?</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Obviously, there may be occasions when defendant\u2019s delaying tactics or clear disregard for the rules leave the trial court no other choice. At times, however, perhaps because of late discovery of witnesses despite a diligent search, or other circumstances beyond the control of defendant and his or her counsel, the interest of the state in fullest discovery and a fair trial for defendant might well outweigh any negative effects on the trial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Although the judge recognized the alibi notice statute was more than a technical rule, and indicated he had looked at the circumstances, he made no observations as to prejudice to the prosecution, or dereliction on the part of defendant. Therefore, it seems appropriate that, applying the standard we accepted in <em>People v Charles O Williams, </em>the preclusion sanction should not have been applied in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">V \u2014 What is Precluded?</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">A further error relating to the alibi statute occurred in the instant case. The alibi statute in effect at the time of defendant\u2019s trial provided that \"the court may in its discretion exclude evidence offered by such defendant for the purpose of establishing an alibi\u201d. MCLA 768.21; MSA 28.1044. The trial judge construed \"evidence\u201d to include defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ant\u2019s testimony, as well as that which might have been offered by witnesses, and therefore precluded both types. This interpretation, as it is relevant to any new trial, will therefore be considered by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The right of a defendant to produce witnesses is part of the Michigan and United States Constitutions. Further, MCLA 763.1; MSA 28.854 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\"On the trial of every indictment or other criminal accusation, the party accused shall be allowed to be heard by counsel and may defend himself, and he shall have a right to produce witnesses and proofs in his favor, and meet the witnesses who are produced against him face to face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Thus, the preclusion sanction for failure to timely file a notice of alibi creates an exception to this right.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">The relevant rule of statutory construction is that \"where there is doubt about how inclusively a statute should be construed to apply, if the mischief that it was enacted to remedy can be perceived it will be construed to apply only so far as is needed in order to effectuate the remedy\u201d. 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction, \u00a7 54.04, p 358. This Court has long applied the doctrine of equitable interpretation, in which, when words may have two possible meanings, \"the spirit and purpose of the statute should prevail over its strict letter\u201d. <em>Aikens v State Department of Conservation, 387 </em>Mich 495, 499; 198 NW2d 304, 306 (1972). Thus, because the word \"evidence\u201d in the notice statute may be interpreted to include all evidence, not just that of witnesses for defendant, but even, perhaps, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the testimony of defendant, we should examine the purpose of the alibi notice statute itself. \"The purpose of the court in interpreting a statute is to give effect to the legislative intent.\u201d 387 Mich 495, 499; 198 NW2d 304, 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In <em>People v McFadden, </em>347 Mich 357, 360; 79 NW2d 869 (1956), we stated that the requirement of notice of the defense of alibi \"was enacted for the benefit and protection of the public\u201d. The prosecution requires time to investigate proposed witnesses. An alibi notice before trial avoids a motion for adjournment to permit such investigation and to make pretrial investigation possible. Theoretically, a prosecution may even be dropped if results are favorable to defendant. The intent therefore is to serve the interests of both parties and the public by facilitating orderly, uninterrupted trials. <em>State ex rel Simons v Burke, </em>41 Wis 2d 129, 140; 163 NW2d 177, 183 (1968). The preclusion sanction is designed to ensure that this statutory purpose is realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Whether the purpose may be achieved by eliminating all testimony relevant to alibi, or only that of defendant\u2019s witnesses, is a question several states have faced.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Wisconsin, for example, interprets its alibi notice statute \"to mean any testimony placing the defendant somewhere else at the time of the crime\u201d. 41 Wis 2d 129, 134; 163 NW2d 177, 179. Ohio permits the judge to exercise his or her discretion to permit defendant to testify, while excluding testimony of defense witnesses. <em>Johns v Perini, </em>440 F2d 577, 579 (CA 6, 1971). Iowa permits defendant to</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\"testify not only that he did not commit the act but also that he was so far away and at such a specified place he could not have been present at the scene of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>crime. If he voluntarily elects to go further and call witnesses to testify in support of his alibi, he must then give notice required by statute.\u201d <em>State v Schlater, </em>170 NW2d 601, 605 (Iowa, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Of greatest applicability to the instant case are attempts by other courts to reconcile the statute permitting defendant to testify and produce witnesses in his or her behalf with that permitting a preclusion sanction for failure to timely file notice of alibi. In <em>State v Rider, </em>194 Kan 398, 401; 399 P2d 564, 567 (1965), the Supreme Court of Kansas reasoned that the sanction applied to defendant\u2019s own testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\"Section 10 of the Bill of Rights of the Kansas Constitution provides in all prosecutions the accused shall be allowed to appear and defend in person, or by counsel; to meet the witness face to face, and to compel attendance of witnesses in his behalf. This provision is a mere statement of the common law and does not make a defendant competent to testify in his own behalf. Our legislature recognized the deficiency that under the common law a defendant was incompetent to testify in his own defense, and in 1872 changed the common law by statute, now appearing as K.S.A. 61-1420, which provides that no person shall be rendered incompetent to testify in criminal causes by reason of his being the person on trial. The legislature, therefore, having the right to extend the privilege, also had the right to restrict or take away the privilege, and subsequently the legislature restricted this right to testify insofar as it pertained to an alibi unless the defendant gives the notice as provided in K.S.A. 62-1341 aforementioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">On the other hand, New York adopted the opposite approach in <em>People v Rakiec, </em>289 NY 306, 308-309; 45 NE2d 812, 813-814 (1942):</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\"If more than a reading of the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>statute and a consideration of its purpose were necessary, rules of statutory construction would remove any doubt as to its applicability. Thus, section 393 of the Code of Criminal Procedure also relates to the testimony of a defendant. It reads as follows: '\u00a7 393. Defendant as witness. The defendant <em>in all cases </em>may testify as a witness in his own behalf, but his neglect or refusal to testify does not create any presumption against him.\u2019 [Emphasis supplied.] The section is all inclusive. The enactment of section 393 in its original form (L 1869, ch 678) was a milestone in the progress of criminal jurisprudence and its object was to benefit the accused. <em>(People v Hoch, </em>150 NY 291, 309 [44 NE 976 (1896)]). Up to that time under the common law of England, which we adopted following the American Revolution, a defendant had no right to testify in his own behalf. <em>(People v Courtney, </em>94 NY 490 [1884]); <em>People ex rel Woronoff v Mallon, </em>222 NY 456 [119 NE 102, 4 ALR 463 (1918)]). Section <em>295-1 </em>on the other hand is contained in chapter III-A entitled 'Simplified Indictments,\u2019 all of the sections of which relate to form and procedure. It is a sound rule of construction that in the absence of express language, it will be presumed that the Legislature did not intend to defeat the main purpose and object of another legislative enactment relating to the same subject <em>(People ex rel Wood v Lacombe, </em>99 NY 43 [1 NE 599 (1885)]), nor to make a radical change in long-established rules. <em>Seligman v Friedlander, </em>199 NY 373 [92 NE 1047 (1910)].</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\"These considerations confirm us in our view that the statute is applicable only to witnesses other than the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Although the language of our statutes differs from those of New York, we believe the reasoning of the New York Court is sound. While it is true that a defendant did not have an inherent right to testify at the common law, that disability was limited by the Federal and Michigan Constitutions, and largely eliminated by a statute. Therefore, although the Legislature can qualify or condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tion this right to testify, once it has given this right, it is difficult to presume that the Legislature meant to condition it unless it said so in unambiguous terms. \"[E]vidence offered\u201d is not of itself unequivocal. This reasoning, together with the objective to be achieved by the preclusion sanction leads us to adopt the approach permitting defendant to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Defendant is already in custody or, at least, available to the prosecutor. While there may be a necessity to learn something about other witnesses who have not hitherto been available, that necessity is not present where the defendant is concerned. Should defendant suddenly develop an alibi after having told a different story, he or she may be impeached by the prosecutor. Further, the chance that the finder of fact may not choose to believe defendant\u2019s unsubstantiated testimony is itself sufficient motivation to promote timely filing. In any event, whether defendant was at the scene of the alleged crime would seem to be a fundamental question,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the information should reasonably be developed early in the investigative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">At the retrial commanded by this opinion, the defendant, even if he fails to give proper notice of alibi, will be allowed to testify himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">VI \u2014 Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Evidence of alibi was improperly precluded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>this case where neither egregious fault by defendant nor prejudice to the people\u2019s case was shown.

Where, as here, the exercise of discretion turns upon a factual determination made by the trier of the facts, an abuse of discretion involves far more than a difference in judicial opinion between the trial and appellate courts. The term discretion itself involves the idea of choice, of an exercise of the will, of a determination made between competing considerations. In order to have an 'abuse\u2019 in reaching such determination, the result must be so palpably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof, not the exercise of reason but rather of passion or bias.\u201d 355 Mich 382, 384-385.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">However, the finding of an abuse of discretion under the facts of <em>Williams </em>is cited favorably:</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\"In view of the facts that: 1) defendant was asserting a constitutional right \u2014 the right to counsel; 2) he had a legitimate reason for asserting this right \u2014 an irreconcilable <em>bona fide </em>dispute with his attorney over whether to call his alibi witnesses; 3) he was not guilty of negligence; and 4) the trial court was incorrect in stating that defendant had caused the trial to be adjourned several <em>times </em>\u2014 we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and in preventing defendant from changing attorneys and granting a continuance in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Even assuming the <em>Williams </em>finding was appropriate to that case, we find it inapposite to the facts now under scrutiny. Here, delay was not requested because of the assertion of any constitutional right (right to counsel in <em>Williams); </em>there was no dispute as to the calling of witnesses; defendant and also his counsel were guilty of negligence (or delaying tactics).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The trial judge exercised discretion and stated the reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\n<em>\"In view of those circumstances, there appears to be no justification for the notice not having been given to the prosecutor according to the legislative intention. Certainly, the giving of the notice on the day of the trial, which is three months after the alleged event where counsel is present and retained, is not, in this court\u2019s judgment, valid excuse.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\"The order will be, gentlemen, that the statute be complied with and I direct defendant and counsel for both sides not to suggest to the jury, directly or indirectly, through any evidence offered by the defendant or any other witness, that alibi is the defense. <em>That order is made, exercised in the court\u2019s discretion and consistent with MSA 28.1044. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">This is an adequate expression by the court that (1) defendant did not have a legitimate reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>failure to file notice of alibi until the date of the trial when the court, counsel, jurors, witnesses and others were gathered; and (2) defendant was guilty of negligence in failure to comply with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Regardless, we are not convinced that the <em>Williams </em>case, relied upon by the majority (erroneously in my opinion), is correct under Michigan law. The majority opinion and <em>Williams </em>urge that discretion in denying a continuance should be judged by a stricter standard in criminal cases, as opposed to civil cases. Such an argument ignores both a court rule and a statute, neither of which were discussed by <em>Williams </em>or the majority opinion in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">MCLA 768.2; MSA 28.1025 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\"The trial of criminal cases shall take precedence over all other cases; but this provision shall not be interpreted to mean that trials of civil cases shall not be interspersed between trials of criminal cases triable before a jury at any term of court. <em>No adjournments, continuances or delays of criminal causes shall be granted by any court except for good cause shown in the manner provided by law for adjournments, continuances and delays in the trial of civil causes in courts of record: </em>Provided, That no court shall adjourn, continue or delay the trial of any criminal cause by the consent of the prosecution and accused unless in his discretion it shall clearly appear by a sufficient showing to said court to be entered upon the record, that the reasons for such consent are founded upon strict necessity and that the trial of said cause cannot be then had without a manifest injustice being done.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">GCR 1963, 503.1 provided at the time of trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\"It is the policy of this rule to encourage the diligent preparation and trial of cases. <em>Continuance for any cause shall not be granted unless a showing is made and the court \u00f1nds that the grounds for continuance do not arise out of the fault or negligence of the moving </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number><em>party </em>and the court finds that substantial justice more nearly will be obtained.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Thus, the Legislature has provided that continuance be granted on the same grounds as in civil actions. (The Court by this case has decided the opposite.) GCR 503.1 has provided that continuance <em>not </em>be granted where it arises out of the party\u2019s fault or negligence. (This Court has added other criteria to the end that it makes no difference who is at fault.) Many Michigan cases have recognized application of our legislative and GCR standard for judging abuse of discretion in criminal cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>As Justice Williams states, \"[discretion of judges in excluding alibi testimony in the absence of timely notice has usually been upheld\u201d in Michigan and elsewhere on both state and federal levels. He also says, \"[t]he trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in these instances will not be disturbed unless it is 'discretion manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds\u2019 \u201d. Much precedent is cited for these statements. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In Michigan, the courts have been consistent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Two members of this Court while in the Court of Appeals have upheld the required notice of alibi. See <em>People v Ware, </em>28 Mich App 434; 184 NW2d 533 (1970); <em>People v Chamberlain, </em>15 Mich App 541; 166 NW2d 815 (1969); <em>People v Tyrone Williams, </em>38 Mich App 146; 195 NW2d 771 (1972). In <em>Williams, </em>the Court of Appeals noted that defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\"informed the judge of his wish to present an alibi defense on the first day of trial. At that time the judge questioned Williams and Williams said that 'three weeks ago\u2019 he had informed his lawyer of his alibi defense. The judge determined that there had been ample opportunity to present timely notice of alibi. In such circumstances the judge justifiably refused to permit Williams to introduce witnesses in support of his alibi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Under any standard so far proposed, the trial judge properly exercised his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Most importantly, we cannot agree that defendant should be enabled to do indirectly what he cannot do directly, to wit: trap the prosecutor by surprise alibi testimony of his own at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The reasoning of my colleagues results in precisely the ill sought to be avoided by statute and court rule. If followed, the statutes and court rules minimize the probability of \"gamesmanship\u201d, delaying tactics, wasted resources and last-minute fabrications by defendant as well as of surprise alibi testimony by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">\"Fair trial\u201d is a two-edged sword and should b&lt;_ designed to insure fairness to both defendant and people. By the majority opinion, defendant could personally interject a concocted alibi defense at any point in trial and leave the people without opportunity to investigate and rebut. It is a one-sided rule which is not likely to bring about fundamental fairness. It is a rule which invites abuse. Also, it is the more injurious because it would encompass as well the successor statute now in effect. The so-called \"preclusion sanction\u201d rationale would apply equally to the prior statute and the present version.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">We agree with the first paragraph of III of the majority opinion which cites precedent in support of the requirement of notice prior to the use of alibi evidence. Alibi evidence can be easily fabricated. \"[Safeguards against its wrongful use\u201d must be erected.

Also, he knew that his wife was his only available alibi witness who could corroborate his testimony in that respect. <em>That he did not advise his counsel of Mrs. Selik\u2019s condition until just shortly prior to the service of the motion for continuance ought not to enable Selik to take advantage of his self-made situation with which he confronted the trial court. * * * </em>[Defendant] was not entitled to have his wife\u2019s testimony at the trial as an alibi witness, because he failed to comply with the statute * * * .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Similarly, in <em>People v Kotek, </em>306 Mich 408; 11 NW2d 7 (1943), this Court observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">\" 'The matter of delaying a trial to enable a party to get his witnesses is one so peculiarly within the discretion of the trial judge, that we should not feel warranted in reviewing said discretion, except in a very extreme case.\u2019 <em>Gold v Detroit United Railway, </em>169 Mich 178, 180 [134 NW 1118 (1912)].</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">\" 'It was entirely within the discretion of the court to refuse a delay for the purpose of procuring witnesses. * * * The judge was possessed of all the facts, and was in a far better position than are we to judge of the propriety of a delay.\u2019 <em>People v Foote, </em>93 Mich 38 [52 NW 1036 (1892)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">In <em>People v Knox, </em>364 Mich 620; 111 NW2d 828 (1961), this Court commented: \"It has been repeatedly recognized by this Court that a trial judge has discretion in granting or refusing a motion [for continuance], and that this Court will not interfere unless there has been a palpable abuse of such discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\"><em>Also see, People v Eamaus, </em>207 Mich 442; 174 NW 177 (1919).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\"> <em>See People v McFadden, </em>347 Mich 357; 79 NW2d 869 (1956); <em>People v Longaria, </em>333 Mich 696; 53 NW2d 685 (1952); <em>People v Sherrod, </em>32 Mich App 183; 188 NW2d 221 (1971); <em>People v George Johnson, </em>5 Mich App 257; 146 NW2d 107 (1966); <em>People v Watkins, 54 </em>Mich App 576; 221 NW2d 437 (1974); <em>People v Williams, </em>11 Mich App 62; 160 NW2d 599 (1968); <em>People v Crawford, </em>16 Mich App 92; 167 NW2d 814 (1969).
