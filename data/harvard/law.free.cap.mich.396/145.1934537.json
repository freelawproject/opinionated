Jordan while he was repairing an overhead crane located on the premises of C. A. Roberts Company in the City of Detroit. Plaintiff, the administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate, brought this action in warranty and negligence against defendants Whiting Corporation, the manufacturer of the crane parts, Dear-born Fabricating &amp; Engineering Company, the assembler of the crane parts, and N &amp; K Electric Company, the electrical contractor which performed certain services in initially electrifying the crane.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The circuitous history of this litigation in the courts of this state is as follows: after submission of plaintiffs proofs at the trial held in 1970, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of all three defendants. Appeal to the Court of Appeals followed and that Court, by order, remanded the proceedings to the trial court for reconsideration of its grant of directed verdict in light of a recent decision of the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> discussing the evidentiary weight to be accorded presumptions. Upon remand the trial court reconsidered his grant of directed verdict and granted plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>motion for a new trial with respect to all defendants. This ruling was again brought before the Court of Appeals. Acknowledging that the trial court had misconstrued the earlier remand,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Court in its opinion at 42 Mich App 448; 202 NW2d 477, proceeded to uphold the trial court grant of new trial. The Court of Appeals then reversed itself upon rehearing,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> reinstating the directed verdict as to all counts against defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>except the count against defendant Dearborn alleging negligence in failure to ground the electrical system of the crane. We granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Plaintiff first contends that the Court of Appeals failed to afford to plaintiff\u2019s decedent, in proper manner, the presumption that he had exercised reasonable care for his own safety at the time of his fatal injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff would have this presumption \u2014 the presumption of due care \u2014 afford substantive evidence of defendants\u2019 negligence. The presumption, however, pertains to the conduct of plaintiff\u2019s decedent, rather than the conduct of the defendants. <em>Clark v Detroit &amp; Mackinac R Co, </em>197 Mich 489; 163 NW 964 (1917); and <em>Walsh v Grand Trunk W R Co, </em>363 Mich 522; 110 NW2d 799 (1961). The trial court and the Court of Appeals found plaintiff\u2019s proofs respecting N &amp; K Electric Company\u2019s and Whiting Corporation\u2019s negligence lacking. The presumption of due care, and the manner in which it was to be applied, were not relevant to the critical determination made by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Plaintiff next contends that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the proofs failed to establish a duty owed the decedent by defendants. Defendant Dearborn complains that it was error for the court to find a jury-submissible question respecting its alleged negligence in failing to ground the crane. We are unable to find any record evidence which establishes that decedent\u2019s death was causally connected with defendant Dearborn\u2019s alleged failure to properly ground the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>crane. Plaintiff s expert witness could not testify as to decedent\u2019s location on the crane or whether the grounding had any causal connection with his death.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *8</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The sole evidence presented consists of expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>testimony that a hypothetical person making simultaneous contact with a live conductor and metal would have a \"70 or 80 per cent chance of extracting himself from that connection\u201d if the crane were grounded. The mere possibility that a defendant\u2019s negligence may have been the cause, either theoretical or conjectural, of an accident is not sufficient to establish a causal link between the two. <em>Howe v Michigan Central R Co, </em>236 Mich 577; 211 NW 111 (1926). The directed verdict in favor of defendant Dearborn is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">The Court of Appeals permitted N &amp; K Electric and Whiting to tax one-half of their costs against Dearborn. Dearborn, in turn, was permitted to tax one-half of its costs against plaintiff. Our disposition of the case makes unnecessary the resolution of whether the defendants involved were \"prevailing parties\u201d within the meaning of GCR 1963, 526.1 and 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The original order of the trial court granting a directed verdict in favor of defendant Dearborn is reinstated. The award of costs to N &amp; K Electric and Whiting against Dearborn is reversed. Dear-born may tax costs against plaintiff.</p>\n<judges id=\"b249-5\">Kavanagh, C.

While that appeal still impended a motion was made in this court to remand the case to trial court for the purpose of making a motion for a new trial in <em>that </em>court. The motion in this case came on for hearing on a special motion docket. In support of this motion to remand it was represented to the panel hearing the motion that the trial court held that 'decedent was somehow contributorily negligent\u2019. This was a clear misstatement. We attribute no improper motive to the misstatement but rather attribute it to the fact that appellate counsel may well have not had an opportunity to scrutinize the vast record, which at that time was not available to this Court. Disposition of the motion was made October 28,1970. Just 20 days prior thereto this Court had released to the parties the opinion in <em>Wirtanen v The Prudential Insurance Company of America, </em>27 Mich App 260 [183 NW2d 456] (1970). The panel was thus understandably concerned whether the trial judge and all counsel had <em>Wirtanen </em>available because it discussed the evidentiary weight to be accorded presumptions. Since in this case there were no witnesses to the fatal accident, the presumption that decedent was in the exercise of due care for his own safety was highly relevant to the issue of the claimed holding as to his contributory negligence. The panel issued an order which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">\" '1) It is ordered that this cause be remanded to the trial court for further consideration in light of <em>Wirtanen v Prudential Insurance Co of America, </em>our docket #7134, released Oct. 8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">\" '2) The <em>appeal </em>in this matter is hereby dismissed without prejudice to the rights of either party to file a motion to reinstate this cause in the Court of Appeals.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Instead of considering only the presumption of due care as it bore on the issue of decedent\u2019s claimed contributory negligence the trial judge read the limited order of remand to mean that he should reconsider the whole issue of granting directed verdicts as to all these defendants. He reversed his prior holding and granted plaintiff a new trial on the general ground that the minds of reasonable men could differ on the whole issue of negligence and breach of warranty of fitness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\"> The opinion upon rehearing appears at 49 Mich App 481; 212 NW2d 324 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\"> In raising this contention plaintiff urges that the Court of Appeals did not treat the presumption as substantive evidence in the manner prescribed in <em>In re Wood Estate, supra; </em>and <em>Wirtanen v The Prudential Insurance Co, supra. </em>Our resolution of this issue does not require that we address the merits of the <em>In re Wood Estate </em>and <em>Wirtanen </em>analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\"> On cross-examination plaintiffs expert witness, Stephen S. Squillace, testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\"><em>\"Q. * * * </em>In any event, grounding or no grounding, if you don\u2019t know where this man was in relation to the top of that bridge on that crane, and the sergeant from the fire department says he doesn\u2019t recall, he doesn\u2019t know what part of the crane he was on, if he doesn\u2019t know that and you don\u2019t know it, then you don\u2019t know whether the grounding had anything to do with his death or not, do you?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\"><em>\"A. </em>That\u2019s right.
