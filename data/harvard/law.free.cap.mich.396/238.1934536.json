The Court of Appeals granted a motion to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">Burton was held on an \"open\u201d charge of murder. He waived preliminary examination and an \"open\u201d charge information was filed. It appeared to this Court that Burton might have been overcharged and his plea of guilty offered under the constraint of an unwarranted first-degree murder charge. We remanded to the district court for the holding of a preliminary examination to determine whether there was probable cause to find that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>crime of first-degree murder was committed and that the defendant committed that offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\">The district judge found that there was probable cause to believe that the killing had been committed by Burton in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate a robbery and that a charge of first-degree murder was justified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It now appears that the prosecutor had a basis for filing a first-degree information.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">We affirm Burton\u2019s conviction of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">During the plea-taking colloquy Burton said that he spent the afternoon and evening of the homicide drinking beer with his brother in a number of taverns. They saw an acquaintance, the decedent, in one of the bars and had a few beers with him. The decedent asked Burton for a ride home. Burton and the decedent went to another bar and stayed until it closed; they bought some beer, put it in Burton\u2019s trunk, and \"just started riding around\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">While riding in Burton\u2019s car, the decedent kissed Barton on the cheek and said, \"Burton, I love you\u201d. Burton responded by hitting him twice with his fist. The decedent desisted. A short while later Burton stopped the car, got out and opened the trunk to get a beer. The decedent got out of the car, grabbed Burton\u2019s hair and pulled Burton towards him, saying, \"Kiss me\u201d. Burton hit the decedent, grabbed the jack out of the open trunk and repeatedly hit the decedent over the head <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>with it. He then threw the jack back into the trunk and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Burton contends the judge erred in failing to inquire and advise him regarding the potential defenses of \"provocation\u201d and \"diminished capacity\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, he contends that his sentence of 50 to 80 years constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Rule 785.7(l)(a), adopted after Burton\u2019s plea was accepted,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> required the judge to advise the defendant of \"the general nature of the charge to which the plea is offered\u201d and further provided that \"the court is not obliged to, but may explain the elements of the offense or any defenses possible\u201d. The current rule similarly provides that the \"court is not obliged to explain the elements of the offense, or possible defenses\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">We may appropriately consider the current rule in deciding whether a pre-rule 785.7 plea was properly accepted. In <em>People v Armstrong, </em>390 Mich 693, 700; 213 NW2d 190 (1973), this Court said that it would not apply \"a standard more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>stringent than the standard presently in force\u201d to a plea taken before the effectiveness of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In reviewing convictions on pre-rule 785.7 pleas of guilty, the Court of Appeals has held that the judge is not obliged to examine the defendant regarding a possible intoxication defense even though it appears during the plea-taking colloquy that such a defense might be raised.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are of the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Although Burton said he spent the afternoon and evening of the homicide drinking beer in a number of taverns, he did not claim he was unable to recall the events. His recital of what occurred distinguishes this case from <em>People v Stoner, </em>23 Mich App 598, 602; 179 NW2d 217 (1970), where the defendant asserted \"that he was so deeply intoxicated that he could not recall his participation in the commission of the offense\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Even though a defendant asserts he was intoxicated or narcoticized at the time the offense was committed, the judge may accept a plea of guilty as long as the defendant sufficiently recalls facts and circumstances which tend to show he participated in the commission of the offense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Burton claims that his sentence of 50 to 80 years is cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>The statute provides that upon conviction of murder in the second degree the offender may be \"punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life, or any term of years, in the discretion of the court\u201d.* <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Since the enactment of the indeterminate sentencing law, which vests in the parole board the power to release prisoners before service of the maximum sentence,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> this Court has eschewed any reviewing function for itself or the Court of Appeals with regard to the exercise of the trial judge\u2019s sentencing discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We appreciate that a strong case can be made for appellate review of sentencing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This Court is not, however, yet prepared to take that step.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-7\">Kavanagh, C.
