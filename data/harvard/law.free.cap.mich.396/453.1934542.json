Dr. Leon Fill was the principal stockholder, secretary, and a director of Wayne National and the sole shareholder, president, and a director of Fill Buildings. On the basis of Dr. Fill\u2019s relationship with each corporation, Alexander Hamilton sought to avoid liability under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>lease, contending that it was \"unfair\u201d to Wayne National under MCLA 450.13(5); MSA 21.13(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court found for Alexander Hamilton, concluding that Fill Buildings had failed to surmount its burden of establishing the \"fairness\u201d of the contract. The Court of Appeals, in an unpublished per curiam opinion, Judge Bronson dissenting, affirmed, concluding that the trial court findings were not \"clearly erroneous\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">We granted leave to appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">On appeal plaintiff presses two contentions. It is first argued that plaintiff did in fact succeed in surmounting its burden of proof in establishing that the lease agreement between itself and defendant\u2019s predecessor, Wayne National, was fair under MCLA 450.13(5); MSA 21.13(5). Plaintiff next contends that, in any event, the lease agreement was ratified by the acquiescence of the board of directors of Wayne National and by the board of directors of defendant Alexander Hamilton.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Central to the issues tried and framed upon appeal is the following language of MCLA 450.13(5); MSA 21.13(5):</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">\"No contract of any corporation made with any director of such corporation or with a partnership or other group or association of which any such director shall be a member or with any other corporation of which such director may be a member or director and no contract between corporations having common directors shall be invalid because of such respective facts alone. <em>When the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>validity of any such contract is questioned, the burden of proving the fairness to the contracting parties of any such contract shall be upon such director, partnership, other group or association, or corporation who shall be asserting the validity of such contract. \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In 1966 the headquarters of Wayne National were located on several floors of a building owned by plaintiff. A principal witness at trial was Alex Ritchie, the assistant secretary of Wayne National, who signed the lease which is the subject of this litigation. He indicated that he was authorized to sign the lease in January 1967 because the president of Wayne National wished to provide increased space in the headquarters building for increasing numbers of agency personnel and to consolidate the officers of the corporation on another floor of the building. He also speculated that the corporate officers wanted the new space in the headquarters building in order to terminat\u00e9 leases for corporate offices in less convenient locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The testimony of Alex Ritchie also indicated, however, that his signing of the lease for Wayne National was not accomplished in accordance with the provisions of the corporate bylaws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>he testified that the state insurance department had warned the company against over-expansion in the summer of 1966, noting that there was a \"surplus drain\u201d caused by the rate of acquisition of new business. The problems noted in 1966 ultimately led to the resignation of corporate officers, including Dr. Leon Fill, direct supervision of corporate operations by the state insurance department, and corporate collapse in early 1967.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plans for Wayne National\u2019s entry into the lease relationship were laid against this background in the summer of 1966. The lease was signed on January 4, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Other testimony introduced at trial indicated that the premises leased to Wayne National had been rented to a 20-year tenant as a warehouse before it was remodeled, at an expense of $26,000 to Fill Buildings, for Wayne National. The former tenants had been charged a rental of $400 per month. Under the new lease Wayne National was to pay $875 per month for 2,600 square feet of rental space \u2014 an equivalent of $4 per square foot of rental space. Over the five year term of the lease Fill Buildings stood to recoup, in increased rental, slightly more than the amount invested in renovations. Plaintiffs expert witness, noted to be of dubious qualification by the trial court, testified to the effect that a rental of $4 per square foot for the rental premises was reasonable compared to similar properties in the downtown Detroit area.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Cognizant of the foregoing and other record testimony, the trial court in its opinion drew the following conclusion:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">\"[T]he Michigan Department of Insurance was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ducting an, extensive investigation of the Wayne Insurance Co., which had an inadequate capital position and was undercapitalized. This was known to the Directors of the company. On April 24, 1967, the Insurance Department declared that the company\u2019s capital was impaired by over a million dollars. This, of course, raises the question as to whether this was a proper time for the company to take on additional space or to enter into five-year leases at greatly increased rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\"Plaintiff points with pride to the fact that he invested $26,000.00 in remodeling the leased quarters to suit the Insurance Company, and, to do so, he had to remove an old tenant who was paying $400.00 per month for the space. The rent charged to the Insurance Company was $875.00 per month which would cover the rent and amortize the $26,000.00 investment of Dr. Fill in five years, who, then obtained, presumably, the return of the remodeled quarters with the alterations and improvements fully paid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\"There was no testimony of any shopping around for cheaper quarters for the limping company, or why, under the circumstances, a one year lease would not have sufficed and saved the company money, and heaven knows, they needed it, or why the Directors of the company were not informed and given a chance to express their views, and perhaps suggest other procedures that would be acceptable under the circumstances that existed. Had the proper procedures been followed, Dr. Fill would not, perhaps, have been able to remodel his building and recover the cost in five years. There is not one word of testimony of explanation in the record to indicate the reason neither Board of Directors was consulted, before this self-serving deal was completed, nor why it was necessary to have the agreement by the Insurance Company signed by an Assistant Secretary alone, who, by the way, worked immediately under the plaintiff, Dr. Fill. The only suggestion made to explain these strange facts, no meetings, no minutes, no records of any kind is that 'everyone knew Doc Fill owned the building and the Directors passed the new quarters every day.\u2019 This explanation does not satisfy this court as adequate or satisfactory. No ratification can be de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>duced from such facts as these. The plaintiff completely failed to sustain his burden of proof, as to the fairness of the transaction to the Insurance Company which inured to his own personal benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In rendering its conclusion set forth above as the fairness of the lease contract, the trial court appropriately cited the following language from <em>Baker v Hellner Realty Co, </em>265 Mich 625, 631; 251 NW 793 (1933), defining the \"fairness\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">\"[Ojfficers of a corporation may deal with it only in good faith. Such contracts must be <em>fair and in the interest of the corporation </em>and all of the material facts must be made known to the directors. Any unfair advantage taken by an officer or director may be the basis for an attack upon the validity of the contract. See <em>Barnes v Spencer &amp; Barnes Co, </em>162 Mich 509 (139 Am St Rep 587) [1910]; <em>Quinn v Quinn Manfg Co, </em>201 Mich 664 [1918]; <em>Old Mortgage &amp; Finance Co v Pasadena Land Co, </em>241 Mich 426 [1928]; <em>Patrons\u2019 Mutual Fire Ins Co v Holden, </em>245 Mich 493 [1929], Under the provisions of Act' No 327, Pub Acts 1931, \u00a7 13, subd 5. [MCLA 450.13(5); MSA 21.13(5).]</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">\" 'When the validity of any such contract is questioned, the burden of proving the fairness to the contracting parties of any such contract shall be upon such director, partnership, other group or association, or corporation who shall be asserting the validity of such contract.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">See, also, <em>Veeser v Robinson Hotel Co, </em>275 Mich 133; 266 NW 54 (1936);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Barber v Kolowich, </em>283 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Mich 97; 277 NW 189 (1938); <em>Holden v Lashley-Cox Land Co, </em>316 Mich 478; 25 NW2d 590 (1947); <em>Kukla v Perry, </em>361 Mich 311; 105 NW2d 176 (1960). Given an instance of alleged director enrichment at corporate expense such as in this case, the burden to establish fairness resting on the director requires not only a showing of \"fair price\u201d but also a showing of the fairness of the bargain to the interests of the corporation.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Only when a convincing showing is made in both respects can \"fairness\u201d under the statute be said to have been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">We are inclined to agree with Fill Buildings\u2019 position that that corporation was entitled to make a profit on its lease and that a \"fair price\u201d for the leasehold agreement was established. The costs of extensive renovations and the thrust of expert testimony adduced at trial support this conclusion. The proofs respecting the showing that entry into the lease served the interests of Wayne National are, however, unconvincing. Evidence adduced at trial indicated that Wayne National was a corporation in trouble. The corporation had been warned against over-expansion. Yet here we have entry into a long-term lease <em>(i.e., </em>expansion) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>at a time when the corporate future was in question. Only one witness testified briefly as to the reasons for entry into the lease agreement and he was not a principal party to the corporate decision-making process. As defendant Alexander Hamilton states in its brief:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\"The real questions in this case were: Was the lease necessary? Was the company in a position to take on additional space at the time, given its critical financial position? Was the company able to pay the rent at the time? What was the company\u2019s five-year forecast? Would it have been wiser to enter into a one-year lease? And most importantly, were any of these questions or similar questions answered by the Wayne National Board of Directors?\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">It was necessary that proofs on these points be adduced to rebut the statutory presumption<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of insider enrichment at corporate expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Perhaps, as plaintiff Fill Buildings suggests, defendant, standing in the shoes of Wayne National, is attempting to avoid legitimate responsibilities of Wayne National under the leasehold contract. We can only note that plaintiff did not produce evidence which might have shed more light on Wayne National\u2019s legitimate \"interest\u201d in the contract.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial judge correctly perceived the law. He viewed the witnesses. On the state of this record we cannot say that his application of law to the facts \u2014 his conclusion that the \"fairness\u201d of the contract was not established by plaintiff and that there was no ratification of the contracts \u2014 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>clearly erroneous.

The relationship between the disinterested quorum requirement and the statutory scheme <em>(i.e., </em>\"fairness\u201d) is unsettled. Since the disinterested quorum, argument was not raised in this case, we do not attempt to define this relationship. It can be noted, however, that there would appear to be no purpose for the disinterested quorum requirement under MCLA 450.1545; MSA 21.2p0(545) since that statute looks not to form but to justification in terriis of what is \"fair and reasonable\u201d to the corporation (see MCLA 450.1545[a]), and considers the role of other directors and shareholders (see MCLA 450.1545[b] and [c]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b559-11\"> At oral argument in this Court defense counsel demonstrated this principle admirably in discussion with a member of the Bench.

First the statute\u2019s nebulous language \"burden of proving the fairness to the contracting parties\u201d does not provide a standard of review other than the substitution of the reviewing court\u2019s assessment of the evidence for that of the trial court. I am satisfied from my review of the record that this lease was as \"fair\u201d as most leases to the contracting parties.
