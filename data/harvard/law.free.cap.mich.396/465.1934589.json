It is the purpose of this opinion to examine those remaining questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">An advisory opinion is not precedentially binding upon the Court and represents only the opinions of the parties signatory. See <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1972 PA 294, </em>389 Mich 441; 208 NW2d 469 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">A recent decision of the United States Supreme Court reviewing the constitutionality of Federal campaign legislation has provided substantial guidance in our deliberations. <em>Buckley v Valeo, </em>424 US 1; 96 S Ct 612; 46 L Ed 2d 659 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">In our examination we also have been greatly assisted by the fine briefs and oral presentations of the Attorney General and eight amici. Their scholarly contributions are worthy of our highest praise.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">The Legislature has undertaken the extremely difficult task of drafting legislation which will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>bring about meaningful political reform without causing unconstitutional intrusion upon the protected rights of the people. With regard to many of the provisions contained in 1975 PA 227 this task has been successfully accomplished. However, other provisions improperly infringe upon constitutional rights and must fall. Still other provisions cannot properly be judged in a factual vacuum and must be tested at a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Certified Question II \u2014 Constitutionality of Section 40</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">We are asked in certified question II whether \u00a740<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is unconstitutional as an infringement upon freedom of speech and the press as guaranteed by Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Section 40 of the 1975 PA 227 provides the following prohibition:</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">\"Any person filing or aware of the filing of a sworn complaint according to the provisions of section 38 shall not publicize any information relative to the sworn complaint. A violation of this section shall be subject to penalty contained in section 178 of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">This state\u2019s Constitution (art 1, \u00a7 5) sets forth the following guarantee:</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">\"Every person may freely speak, write, express and publish his views on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of such right; and no law shall be enacted to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">It is our opinion that \u00a7 40 is constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Section 31 of the political reform act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> creates the Political Ethics Commission (PEC) as an autonomous body within the Department of State. The PEC is made up of six members appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Formal complaints alleging violations of the act or rules promulgated under the act may be filed with the commission. Under \u00a7 38<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the commission is charged with investigating these allegations to determine whether a violation has occurred. During the entire period of the investigation all information relating to the complaint, including any documents or reports in the commission\u2019s possession, must be held confidential by the PEC. Matters shall be made public by the PEC upon a final determination that a violation has occurred or if the person whose conduct is under investigation requests the information be made available to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">In addition to providing for confidential proceedings before the PEC, \u00a7 40 of the act provides that \"Any person filing or aware of the filing of a sworn complaint * * * shall not publicize any information relative to the sworn complaint\u201d. A violation of this section is a felony punishable by a \"fine of not more than $10,000.00 or imprison[ment] for not more than 3 years, or both\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">No challenge is made to the Legislature\u2019s authority to impose confidentiality upon commission members and personnel, or its records and proceedings. Perhaps, as Amicus Michigan Association of Broadcasters suggests, this veil of secrecy \"constitutes the least drastic means for advancing the claimed governmental interests\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>However, in an effort to augment the confidentiality created by \u00a7 38 with the prohibition contained in \u00a7 40, the political reform act has improperly imposed restrictions upon the constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">On its face, \u00a7 40 prohibits not only media publication but private communications between two or more persons as well.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition the prohibition extends for an indefinite duration. By its terms, \u00a7 40 prohibits communication of information even after the information has been made public by the commission or the person under investigation has authorized its revelation.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The Attorney General, in his brief in support of the constitutionality of 1975 PA 227, concedes that \"A literal interpretation of \u00a7 40 appears to intrude upon the constitutional guarantee of free speech\u201d. However, he invites this Court to read into the statutes certain time limitations to construe the prohibition against publication of information as in effect only until such time as \u00a7 38 permits matters to be made public <em>(i.e. </em>upon final determination of the PEC that violation has occurred or person under investigation requests that information be made public).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Even with the limitation suggested by the Attorney General we do not believe \u00a7 40 would pass constitutional muster. If public discussion were banned until after the commission concluded its proceedings, it is very possible that violations of the act would not come to the attention of the public until after the election. Further, if the commission concluded that no violation had occur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>red, it is not clear when, if ever, the person bringing the complaint could make his case before the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In electing persons to serve in positions of public trust, it is fundamental to our system of government that the voters be provided with the information necessary to make informed choices. Section 40 restricts freedom of speech and the media and could impede the flow of vital information to the voter.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Of course, the freedom of speech and of the media has its limitations and is not an absolute right. <em>Near v Minnesota ex rel Olson, </em>283 US 697, 708; 51 S Ct 625; 75 L Ed 1357 (1931); <em>Whitney v California, </em>274 US 357, 371; 47 S Ct 641; 71 L Ed 1095 (1927). However, when the state seeks to restrict this right, its efforts must be strictly scrutinized. Former Chief Justice Thomas M. Kavanagh, in <em>Kropf v Sterling Heights, </em>391 Mich 139, 157-158; 215 NW2d 179 (1974), set forth the principle to guide our deliberations:</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\"For the state itself to legislate in a manner that affects the individual right of its citizens, <em>the state must show that it has a sufficient interest in protecting or implementing the common good, via its police powers, that such private interests must give way to this higher interest. </em>Different degrees of state interest are required by the courts, depending upon the type of private interest which is being curtailed. <em>When First Amendment rights are being restricted we require the state to justify its legislation by a \u2019compelling\u2019 state interest. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Proponents of the constitutionality of \u00a7 40 argue that compelling state interests are present. They maintain that confidentiality provided by this section will reduce the possibility that the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>system will be abusively used as a means to discredit a candidate or public official with a nonmeritorious complaint. Also they suggest that confidentiality protects against pretrial publicity which could adversely affect an impartial consideration of the complaint and encourages those persons with information to come forward. Finally, they maintain that by keeping matters confidential until it is determined that a violation has occurred it will preserve public confidence in the integrity of the government from being unnecessarily or prematurely diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">These are no doubt important considerations but they do not amount to \"compelling state interests\u201d sufficient to justify the substantial restrictions imposed by \u00a7 40 on the guarantees of free speech and press.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Possible injury to the reputation of a public official does not afford a basis for repressing speech. See <em>New York Times Co v Sullivan, </em>376 US 254, 272; 84 S Ct 710; 11 L Ed 2d 686 (1964). Publication and discussion of information relative to proceedings before the PEC does not pose an imminent threat to the administration of its proceedings. There is no jury to be prejudiced by pretrial publicity and the PEC members should be capable of making independent determinations. Finally, while some measure of the confidentiality maintained by the PEC over its proceedings may help preserve the integrity of governmental institutions, a complete ban on public discussion may well do more to destroy than preserve the public\u2019s confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Section 40 was conceived as one means of providing fair and honest elections. However, in seeking to accomplish this noble goal the act has impermissibly infringed upon the freedoms of speech and the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Certified Question III \u2014 Campaign Organization, Expenditure, and Reports</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Certified question III asks:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\"Is Chapter 2 of Act No 227 of the Public Acts of 1975, which requires a specific organizational structure for campaigns, limits expenditures and contributions for promoting or opposing candidates or ballot questions, and requires reports in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3 or 5 of article I of the State Constitution of 1963?\u201d8 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">It is our opinion that:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">1. The requirement for a specific organizational structure for campaigns is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">2. Expenditure limitations as they apply to \"persons\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as defined within the act are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">3. Limitation of contributions to candidate committees are constitutional excepting those made by a candidate and family to his own candidate committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">4. Disclosure and record keeping requirements are constitutional, both as to promotion of or opposition to a candidate or ballot question.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>1. <em>Organizational Structure for Campaigns.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Under Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 4, the Legislature is given the power to regulate the conduct of elections. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">\"The legislature shall enact laws to preserve the purity of elections, to preserve the secrecy of the ballot, to guard against abuses of the elective franchise, and to provide for a system of voter registration and absentee voting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The organization structure for campaigns provided in chapter 2 lies within permissible limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">2. <em>Limitation on Expenditures.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Subsequent to the request of the Michigan House of Representatives for an advisory opinion, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Buckley v Valeo, </em>424 US 1; 96 S Ct 612; 46 L Ed 2d 659 (1976), <em>rev\u2019g in part, aff'g in part, </em>171 US App DC 172; 519 F2d 821 (1975), which effectively disposes of the greater part of question III.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">This Court has held that First Amendment rights under the Federal Constitution are applicable to the state via the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Book Tower Garage, Inc v Local No 415, </em>295 Mich 580, 586; 295 NW 320 (1940). Also, the rights endowed under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, and 5 are similar to those protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">Although the regulation of elections is a permissible legislative activity, such legislation must be examined closely when it infringes on fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the United States and our state Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">In <em>Buckley, supra </em>14, the Supreme Court spoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>generally of contribution and expenditure limits before regarding each issue with specificity. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">\"The act\u2019s contribution and expenditure limitations operate in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities. Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution. The First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such political expression in order 'to assure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people\u2019. <em>Roth v United States, </em>354 US 476, 484 [77 S Ct 1034; 1 L Ed 2d 1498] (1957). Although First Amendment protections are not confined to 'the exposition of ideas,\u2019 <em>Winters v New York, </em>333 US 507, 510 [68 S Ct 665; 92 L Ed 840] (1948), 'there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of th[e] Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs, * * * of course including] discussions of candidates. * * *\u2019 <em>Mills v Alabama, </em>384 US 214, 218 [86 S Ct 1434; 16 L Ed 2d 484] (1966).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The Supreme Court proceeded thereafter to find the limitations of expenditures on behalf of a candidate to be in violation of First Amendment rights because:</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">\"A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today\u2019s mass society requires the expenditure of money. The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails printing, paper, and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event. The electorate\u2019s increasing dependence on television, radio, and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>mass media for news and information has made these expensive modes of communication indispensible instruments of effective political speech.\u201d (19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Three distinctive limitations on expenditures imposed by the Federal act were found to be unconstitutional. Included were limitations on expenditures by candidates from personal or family resources,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> overall limitations on expenditures by or on behalf of candidates,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the $1,000 limitation on expenditures by \"persons\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Four provisions of chapter 2 of the Michigan act must fall in light of the <em>Buckley </em>rationale. Sections 83 and 84<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which impose maximum expenditure limits upon campaigns and \u00a7 91<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which fixes ceilings upon expenditures by individuals and committees are unconstitutional because of their direct infringement on First Amendment freedom of speech. Section 61<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is defective in its referral to \"expenditure * * * limits\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">3. <em>Limitation of Contributions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Limitations on contributions, however, excepting those made by the candidate and family,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> were found to be not such a deprivation of free speech. The Court rationalized:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">\"By contrast with a limitation upon expenditures for political expression, <em>a limitation upon the amount that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restric</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>tion upon the contributor\u2019s ability to engage in free communication. </em>A contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support. The quantity of communication by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of his contribution, since the expression rests solely on the undifferentiated, symbolic act of contributing. At most, the size of the contribution provides a very rough index of the intensity of the contributor\u2019s support for the candidate. <em>A limitation on the amount of money a person may give to a candidate or campaign organization thus involves little direct restraint on his political communication, for it permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor\u2019s freedom to discuss candidates and issues. </em>While contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present views to the voters, <em>the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor.\u201d </em>(20-21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In short, the Court found that the great potential for abuse inherent in the contribution of large sums of money could be avoided. The purpose served by limiting contributions outweighed the constitutional rights which were infringed. The Court elaborated, 26-27:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\"To the extent that large contributions are given to secure political <em>quid pro quos </em>from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined. Although the scope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained, the deeply disturbing examples surfacing after the 1972 election demonstrate that the problem is not an illusory one.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\"Of almost equal concern as the danger of actual <em>quid pro quo </em>arrangements is the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>opportunities for abuse inherent in the regime of large individual financial contributions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The pertinent provision of 1975 PA 227 concerned with contribution limitations is \u00a7 93.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The analogous provisions in the Federal act are found in 18 USC 608. Section 93 limits the amount which persons (as defined in the act) and committees may contribute to candidate committees of candidates for state elective office.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">However, the Supreme Court did not find similar potential dangers in the contributions of candidates and their families to the candidate\u2019s own campaign committee. <em>Buckley, supra, </em>found unconstitutional a limitation similar to subsection 93(6) of the Michigan act because it limited political expression and would serve no governmental interest once the limit on independent expenditures was removed. Such abuses as <em>quid pro quo </em>or undue pressure are not present in the use of a candidate\u2019s own or family funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Section 93(7)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> limits to $1,700 annually aggregate contributions to all committees in support of or in opposition to a candidate \"except that this subsection shall not apply to the transfer of funds between an organization and a subsidiary, subunit or affiliate of that organization\u201d. The meaning of the exception is obscure. In this factual vacuum, we can make no determination as to validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Therefore, we find \u00a7 93 to be constitutional, excepting subsections (6) and (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">4. <em>Disclosure and Record Keeping.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">In <em>Buckley, </em>the Supreme Court also dealt with the impact of the compelled disclosure of contribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>tions and expenditures on behalf of candidates encompassed by the Federal act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">\"We long have recognized that significant encroachments on First Amendment rights of the sort that compelled disclosure imposes cannot be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental interest. Since <em>Alabama </em>we have required that the subordinating interests of the State must survive exacting scrutiny. We also have insisted that there be a 'relevant correlation\u2019 or 'substantial relation\u2019 between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed. See <em>Pollard v Roberts, </em>283 F Supp 248, 257 (ED Ark, 1968) (three-judge court), aff'd, 393 US 14 [89 S Ct 47; 21 L Ed 2d 14] (1968). This type of scrutiny is necessary even if any deterrent effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights arises, not through direct government action, but indirectly as an unintended but inevitable result of the government\u2019s conduct in requiring disclosure. <em>NAACP v Alabama, supra, </em>at 461 [357 US 449; 78 S Ct 1163; 2 L Ed 2d 1488 (1958)]. <em>Cf. Kusper v Pontikes, </em>414 US 51, 57-58 [94 S Ct 303; 38 L Ed 2d 260] (1973).\u201d (64-65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The governmental interests espoused by the Supreme Court as justification for the disclosure requirements included: (1) informing the public as to the source of campaign money and its utilization by the candidate; (2) deterrence of actual corruption and the avoidance of the appearance of corruption by bringing publicity to large contributions; (3) providing data to be used in the detection of violations of contribution limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Although ballot questions were not at issue in <em>Buckley, </em>the same rationale applies to the reporting and disclosure requirements for contributions and expenditures relative to ballot questions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Certified Question IV \u2014 Constitutionality of Section 95</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Certified question IV addresses the constitutionality of \u00a7 95 of 1975 PA 227.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This section prohibits the use of corporate contributions<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or expenditures<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> for the purpose of influencing the nomina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tion or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The specific question is whether this prohibition provides unequal protection of the laws or infringes upon the right to freedom of expression and assembly as guaranteed by Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 3, and 5.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">It is our opinion that corporate contributions or expenditures for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate may be constitutionally prohibited in order to preserve the integrity of the electoral process. However, we would view the prohibition of corporate contributions or expenditures for the purpose of influencing the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question as an unconstitutional abridgement of freedom of speech and press as guaranteed by art 1,\u00a75.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">1. <em>Equal Protection.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Corporations have been prohibited from contrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>uting to electoral campaigns in Michigan since 1913, the year in which the corrupt practices act<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> passed.

The possibility of misuse of corporate assets by persons acting on behalf of uninformed or unwilling shareholders and the attempts at influence or importunity which might be exerted upon a successfully elected candidate by a contributing corporation represent abuses which the passage of the corrupt practices act sought to eliminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The state\u2019s interest in preserving the integrity of the elective process must be balanced against the assumed right to free expression of an artificial entity <em>(i.e., </em>a corporation) regarding the candidacy of persons seeking election to public office. Recognizing that the state must show a compelling interest<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> to justify interference with the fundamental right of freedom of speech or press, it is our opinion that this test is met and that the Legislature can exercise its power to insure the integrity of the elective process by prohibiting any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>corporate contributions or expenditures made for the purpose of influencing either the nomination or election of a candidate. We need not discuss further those circumstances under which corporations may be afforded First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The prohibition against corporate contributions or expenditures for such purposes does not violate their right to equal protection under the law as guaranteed by art 1, \u00a7 2. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Buckley, supra, </em>recently restated the established principle that:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\"[A] 'statute is not invalid under the Constitution because it might have gone further than it did,\u2019 <em>Roschen </em>v <em>Ward, </em>279 US 337, 339 [49 S Ct 336; 73 L Ed 722 (1929)], that a legislature need not 'strike at all evils at the same time\u2019, <em>Semler v Dental Examiners, </em>294 US 608, 610 [55 S Ct 570; 79 L Ed 1086 (1935)], and that 'reform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind,\u2019 <em>Williamson v Lee Optical Co, </em>348 US 483, 489 [75 S Ct 461; 99 L Ed 563 (1955)].\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> (105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">It is our opinion that restricting the application of \u00a7 95 to corporations alone did not constitute a violation of equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">2. <em>Ballot Questions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">We believe a significant distinction exists between corporation contributions or expenditures made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate and, on the other hand, corporate contributions or expenditures made for the purpose of expressing a position or opinion concerning a public issue which may in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>elude the qualification, passage or defeat of a ballot question. Though <em>Buckley </em>did not address ballot-question campaigns, the Court determined that expenditures for communication of views and opinions about <em>public issues </em>are constitutionally protected. Political expression must be afforded the broadest protection in order \"to assure the unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people\u201d.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> That our discussion involves corporations and not individuals does not render inapplicable our society\u2019s \"profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open\u201d.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Contributions or expenditures by corporations to communicate their positions or opinions concerning ballot questions serve to enlighten the public and encourage an informed decision-making process.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Such contributions or expenditures create no danger of incurring obligations from an elected official to a major contributor. The right of the public to be informed is a paramount consideration in seeking to preserve the free exchange of ideas in the market place.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">A ballot question may affect the assets, the conduct, or, indeed, the very existence of a corporation.

We make no judgment upon the extent to which art 1, \u00a7 5, protects the right of corporations to freely express their ideas in other contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Certified Question V \u2014 Constitutionality of Chapter 3</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">We are asked to decide whether \u00a7 101 of the act in chapter 3<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> constitutes an appropriation for private purposes passed by the Legislature in violation of art 4, \u00a7 30 of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Section 30 of article 4 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\"The assent of two-thirds of the members elected to and serving in each house of the legislature shall be required for the appropriation of public money or property for local or private purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Since the act was enacted upon a vote of less than two-thirds of the members of each house, and since we have concluded that \u00a7 101 is an appropriations bill in our discussion of certified question VI, the only remaining question is whether \u00a7 101 constitutes an appropriation for private purposes. If it is such an appropriation, \u00a7 101 is invalid under art 4, \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">At the outset, it should be recognized that the term public purpose should not be narrowly construed by the courts, for the determination of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>constitutes a public purpose for which an appropriation of public money may be made is primarily the responsibility of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">As stated in <em>Gregory Marina, Inc v Detroit, </em>378 Mich 364, 394; 144 NW2d 503 (1966):</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">\"[Determination of what constitutes a public purpose involves considerations of economic and social philosophies and principles of political science and government. Such determinations should be made by the elected representatives of the people.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The fact that certain individuals benefit from the appropriation does not necessarily imply that the appropriation is lacking a public purpose. The question is whether society at large has an interest in having those individuals benefited. <em>Gaylord v Gaylord City Clerk, </em>378 Mich 273, 299-300; 144 NW2d 460 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">In this regard, it is highly relevant that the method of financing presidential elections established in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 26 USCA 9001, which is analogous to the provision before us, was held by the United States Supreme Court to be well within the \"general welfare\u201d clause of the United States Constitution, art I, \u00a7 8, in <em>Buckley v Valeo, </em>424 US 1; 96 S Ct 612; 46 L Ed 2d 659 (1976):</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">\"[P]ublic financing of Presidential elections as a means to reform the electoral process was clearly a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>choice within the granted power. It is for Congress to decide which expenditures will promote the general welfare: '[T]he power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution.\u2019 [Citations omitted.] * * * In this case, Congress was legislating for the 'general welfare\u2019 \u2014 to reduce the deleterious influence of large contributions on our political process, to facilitate communication by candidates with the electorate, and to free candidates from the rigors of fundraising.\u201d (90-91.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Similarly, the Michigan Legislature has determined that public financing of gubernatorial elections is for the general welfare of the public, and it is well within the Legislature\u2019s powers to so determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Chapter 3 may be said to have any of the following beneficial public purposes:</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">1. To allow gubernatorial candidates to become less dependent upon financial support from special-interest groups, thus promoting the appearance and reality of an executive with the welfare of the public at large in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">2. To encourage greater participation in gubernatorial campaigns by reducing financial obstacles for candidates with less fundraising abilities, and by enhancing the importance of smaller contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">3. To promote the dissemination of political ideas to the electorate by gubernatorial candidates who have been encouraged to campaign for the governorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">We can only conclude that chapter 3 of the act, specifically \u00a7 101, does not constitute an appropriation for a local or private purpose, and thus did not require a two-thirds majority in both houses for passage under art 4, \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Such conclusion is entirely consistent with prior decisions of this Court regarding the nature of a public purpose. As noted in <em>Gaylord v Gaylord City Clerk, supra, </em>p 299, a case which held that a Municipal Industrial Aid Financing Program involving the issuance of bonds to finance the construction of private industrial plants had a public purpose, the concept of public purpose has been construed quite broadly in Michigan:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">\"Michigan cases have steadily broadened the concept of public purpose. In <em>Miller v Michigan State Apple Commission, </em>296 Mich 248 [296 NW 245 (1941)], a State tax on apples, which was used to promote sale of Michigan apples, was upheld because stimulation of the State\u2019s apple industry would be beneficially reflected throughout the State. In <em>Hays v Kalamazoo, </em>316 Mich 443 (169 ALR 1218) [25 NW2d 787 (1947)], the expenditure of general funds of a city for membership in the Michigan Municipal League, a private nonprofit corporation established to advise and lobby for cities and villages in the State, was upheld as being for a public purpose. In <em>Sommers v Flint, supra </em>[355 Mich 655; 96 NW2d 119 (1959)], a transfer of city property to the Federal government, without consideration, for use as an armory was upheld, based upon mutuality of obligation between the United States and the city in the field of national defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">See also <em>Gregory Marina, Inc v Detroit, supra, </em>holding that the construction of marinas in which boatwells would be leased under non-transferable, perpetually renewable leases was a public purpose.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>In sum, given the broad powers of the Legislature to determine public purpose, and the clear relationship between the goals of \u00a7 101 and the public welfare, there is little doubt that there has been no contravention of art 4, \u00a7 30 in the enactment of \u00a7 101 by less than a two-thirds majority in both houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Certified Question VI \u2014 Constitutionality of Section 101</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Section 31, article 4 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\"The general appropriation bills for the succeeding fiscal period covering items set forth in the budget shall be passed or rejected in either house of the legislature before that house passes any appropriation bill' for items not in the budget except bills supplementing appropriations for the current fiscal year\u2019s operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The Michigan Legislature passed several general appropriation bills after it passed the political reform act.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">We are asked in certified question VI whether \u00a7 101 of the act is an appropriation bill within the meaning of art 4, \u00a7 31. If \u00a7 101 is an appropriation bill, it is invalid as having been passed prior to the passage of general appropriation bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Art 4, \u00a7 31 defines an appropriation bill as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">\"Any bill requiring an appropriation to carry out its purpose shall be considered an appropriation bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Our central question therefore is whether the political reform act \"[requires] an appropriation to carry out its purpose\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Little analysis is needed to demonstrate that the central purpose of chapter 3 of the act, and \u00a7 101 in particular, requires an appropriation. That purpose is to help finance gubernatorial campaigns with state funds through a voluntary check-off system from the state income tax, \u00a7 101(2), the establishment of a state campaign fund through the transfer of an amount equal to the sum checked off by taxpayers to that fund, \u00a7 101(4), and the granting of authority to the state treasurer to issue warrants on the state campaign fund to pay appropriate amounts of money to qualified gubernatorial candidates, \u00a7 102(5). Therefore, \u00a7 101 constitutes an appropriation bill which is invalid under the provisions of art 4, \u00a7 31 in that it was enacted prior to certain general appropriation bills. See also <em>Boards of County Road Commissioners v Board of State </em>Canvassers, 50 Mich App 89, 95; 213 NW2d 298 (1973), <em>aff'd </em>391 Mich 666; 218 NW2d 144 (1974), and MCLA 21.9; MSA 3.289.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Irrespective of the fact that \u00a7 101 was violative of art 4, \u00a7 31 in that it was passed before certain general appropriation bills, \u00a7 101 could only serve as an appropriation for one fiscal year under the rationale of <em>Board of Education of Oakland Schools v Superintendent of Public Instruction, </em>392 Mich 613, 620; 221 NW2d 345 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In <em>Oakland, </em>dealing with a statute which purported to be an appropriation bill, but which did not take effect during the ensuing fiscal year,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> we held that \"any provision that does not take initial effect during the ensuing fiscal year is intended to function only as an authorization \u2014 an intention to appropriate\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The Court felt that such construction avoided conflict with art 4, \u00a7 31, for if such a provision were to be effective as an appropriation, the Legislature would be unable to match revenues with appropriations as is required under the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Section 101(4) presents a very similar situation. That section reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">\"(4) An amount equal to the amounts designated under subsection (2) each year is appropriated from the general fund of the state to the state campaign fund. The amounts appropriated under this section shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain available to the state campaign fund for distribution without fiscal year limitation except that any amounts remaining in the state campaign fund on December 31 immediately following a gubernatorial general election shall revert to the general fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">This provision is a continuing appropriation, <em>i.e. </em>an appropriation that does take effect in the ensu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ing fiscal year, but which by its terms continues to appropriate beyond that fiscal period.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">After the ensuing fiscal year, in which revenues can be matched with the appropriation, the conflict with art 4, \u00a7 31 created by such a statute is identical with that created by the type of provision found in <em>Oakland; </em>in both situations, the budgetary procedure required by the constitutional provision becomes impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Therefore, under the rationale of Oaklandthere can be an appropriation to the state campaign fund, only for the ensuing fiscal year but not thereafter, appropriations necessarily being made on a year-to-year basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Certified Question VII \u2014 Financial Disclosure</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">We are asked in certified question VII whether sections 131<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and 132<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> which require the filing of certain financial information constitute \"an invasion of the rights of privacy, or do they violate the equal protection clause or the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizure\u201d. Section 131 specifies the individuals who must file and describes the procedures for filing and the penalties for failure to comply. Section 132 describes the information which must be disclosed by every individual who must file. Persons violating either section may be subjected to a fine not exceeding $1,000, up to 90 days in jail, and may be prohibited from assuming the duties of public office or from receiving compensation from public funds or both.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The initial question we address concerns whether \u00a7\u00a7 131 and 132 violate the equal protection clause of our Constitution. Those opposed to constitutionality argue that these sections:</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">\"impose the same burdensome disclosure requirements on all public officials, without regard to their geographical jurisdiction or official duties.\u201d Brief of Michigan State Grange, et al., p 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Their argument is that the statute is overinclusive because it:</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">\"imposes a burden upon a wider range of individuals than are included in the class of those tainted with the mischief at which the law aims.\u201d Tussman &amp; tenBroek, <em>The Equal Protection of the Laws, </em>37 Calif L Rev 341, 351 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The analysis of an overbroad classification differs from the more common equal protection challenge to separate classifications. While separate classifications are subjected to challenge on the basis that there is no legitimate state reason for making a differentiation between members of the separate classes, the question that must be answered in an overbroad classification case is: Is the state\u2019s grouping of all individuals into a single class rationally related to the furtherance of a legitimate state interest. It is as reprehensible for the law to separately classify individuals who ought to be treated equally as it is for the law to fail to separately classify individuals who ought to be treated differently. While the drawing of lines need not be done with \"mathematical nicety\u201d, the lines must be drawn for some rational reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">We proceed with our analysis of the lines drawn and the burden imposed. Section 131 places into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>single class individuals with vastly differing areas of responsibility and influence and totally differing constituencies, both as to size and geographical location. The act requires the same degree of financial disclosure of the Governor, the Mayor of Grand Rapids, a county road commissioner in Montmorency County, a member of the State Board of Horology, a member of the Michigan Bean Commission, or a city clerk, among others. They have different spheres of influence; some are empowered with wide discretion in matters of great significance while others perform only ministerial functions over rather routine matters. Logic alone must lead us to the conclusion that the possibilities for conflicts of interests of these various governmental officials are also of different proportions and the information required to be disclosed should reflect this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The burden imposed concerns public disclosure of an individual\u2019s private financial affairs. At this juncture it is both convenient and necessary for us to depart from the analysis of the equal protection problem in order to discuss the right to privacy issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">This Court has long recognized privacy to be a highly valued right. <em>De May v Roberts, </em>46 Mich 160; 9 NW 146 (1881). No one has seriously challenged the existence of a right to privacy in the Michigan Constitution nor does anyone suggest that right to be of any less breadth than the guarantees of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized the presence of constitutionally protected \"zones of privacy\u201d. <em>Griswold v Connecticut, </em>381 US 479, 484; 85 S Ct 1678; 14 L Ed 2d 510 (1965); <em>Roe v Wade, </em>410 US 113; 93 S Ct 705; 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973). These zones have been described as being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>within \"penumbras\u201d emanating from specific constitutional guarantees. Often mentioned as a basis of the right to privacy are the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution. The people of this state have adopted corresponding provisions in art 1 of our Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We reject the notion that an individual\u2019s entry into the governmental arena waives the right to privacy. <em>New York Times Co v Sullivan, </em>376 US 254; 84 S Ct 710; 11 L Ed 2d 686 (1964), insures the public an opportunity to make nonmalicious criticisms of a public official\u2019s official conduct. Those seeking public office are well advised to recall the words of Harry S. Truman:</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\"If you can\u2019t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Public officials must recognize their official capacities often expose their private lives to public scrutiny. However, we see a great difference between \"unavoidable exposure\u201d and \"compelled disclosure\u201d. We reject any notion that the <em>Sullivan </em>case can be read to require public officials to fuel the fires of those who seek to roast them.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The right to privacy includes certain activities which are fundamental to our concept of ordered liberty. Rights of this magnitude can only be abridged by governmental action where there exists a \"compelling state interest\u201d. <em>Roe, supra, </em>152, 155. <em>Kropf v Sterling Heights, </em>391 Mich 139, 157-158; 215 NW2d 179 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">It is argued by those seeking to uphold the constitutionality of these provisions that disclosure of specified governmental official\u2019s financial affairs is necessary to further a legitimate and compelling state interest. We agree. Disclosure assists in pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>serving the integrity of the political process. It is legitimate for the Legislature to provide a means for effectively investigating possible conflicts of interest. Disclosure requirements promote integrity, fairness, and public confidence in government as well as providing the citizens with information concerning an officeholder\u2019s integrity and fitness for office.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Having determined that the state is possessed of a compelling interest in seeking disclosure of financial affairs, we must establish whether the means employed are sufficiently narrow. Even when motivated by a compelling reason, the abridgment of such rights must be accomplished by the least intrusive method.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">\"[T]he governmental purpose * * * cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.\u201d <em>Shelton v Tucker, </em>364 US 479; 81 S Ct 247; 5 L Ed 2d 231 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The encroachment must be shown to be necessary to, not merely rationally related to, the accomplishment of the state interest. <em>Griswold, supra, </em>497.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">With regard to at least some of the individuals listed in \u00a7 131 most of the information required by \u00a7 132 to be disclosed appears to be sufficiently narrow and necessary to the accomplishment of the state interest. The act contains certain threshold limits. Small amounts of income, debt, real estate and gifts need not be disclosed. Even when the threshold limits are reached the exact numerical amounts or values need not be disclosed to the public (except for the information required by subsection [e] which is to be filed with the Secre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tary of State and remain confidential, the exact value of income, real estate, or gifts need not be disclosed at all). The term gift as defined in \u00a7 121(5) does not include gifts received from members of the individual\u2019s immediate family or certain other close relatives. There are also broad exceptions to the required disclosure of creditors. Accounts payable, debts arising out of retail installment transactions or from loans made by financial institutions in the ordinary course of business, loans from a relative within the third degree of consanguinity, and land contracts that have been properly recorded with the county clerk or the register of deeds need not be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">A notable exception exists regarding the language in \u00a7 132(1) which requires individuals to report information concerning \"what they know or have reason to know\u201d about members of their immediate family. In our opinion this language and similar language contained in \u00a7 132(2) present very real problems of vagueness. As the statute imposes criminal penalties for violations, due process requires that the statute provide adequate notice to a person of ordinary intelligence of conduct that is illegal. We believe the quoted language lacks the specificity required to alert individuals to the responsibility imposed upon them to discover the information required to be disclosed. While we agree with those who argue in support of the constitutionality of this section that immediate family members were included in the disclosure provisions in order to prevent the individual from circumventing the disclosure provisions by transferring an interest held by that individual to a member of his immediate family, we believe the same result may be accomplished with more precise language. See Ill Rev Stat 1971 ch 127, \u00a7 604a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>102; <em>Lehrhaupt v Flynn, </em>129 NJ Super 327; 323 A2d 537, 541 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">However, despite the fact that we find the disclosure provision to be sufficiently narrow for some officials, we are convinced that for many others listed in \u00a7 131 the disclosure requirements mandate production of information which is not \"necessarily related\u201d to achieving the state interests involved. For those minor officials whose sphere of influence is geographically limited or whose functions are routine and ministerial, we find the disclosure provisions of \u00a7 132 to be overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Similar considerations led the California Supreme Court in the case of <em>Carmel-By-The-Sea v Young, </em>2 Cal 3d 259, 269; 85 Cal Rptr 1; 466 P2d 225 (1970), to strike down a 1969 political reform act containing financial disclosure provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">\"The financial disclosure requirements of the statute now before us encompass indiscriminately persons holding office in a statewide agency regardless of the nature or scope of activity of the agency, as well as those whose offices are local in nature * * * . No effort is made to relate the disclosure to financial dealing or assets which might be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest; that is, to those having some rational connection with or bearing upon, or which might be affected by, the functions or jurisdiction of any particular agency, whether statewide or local, or on the functions or jurisdiction of any particular public officer or employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In light of our comments concerning the over-breadth of the intrusion into the right to privacy of some of the officials listed in \u00a7 131, we return to our analysis of the equal protection question. We find the single class created by \u00a7 131 to be an arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable grouping and, therefore, a violation of the equal protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>clause. The grouping indiscriminately combines officials without regard to their function or jurisdiction. We are unable to discover a single thread connecting all the named officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">As we conclude that the classification is over-broad, the entire statutory scheme set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 131 and 132 for disclosure by public officials must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Finally, \u00a7\u00a7 131 and 132 are challenged on the basis that they violate the constitutional provisions against unreasonable searches and seizures. This section of the Constitution does not forbid all searches and seizures but only all <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures. <em>Elkins v United States, </em>364 US 206, 222; 80 S Ct 1437; 4 L Ed 2d 1669 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">\"We have recently held that 'the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places,\u2019 * * * and wherever an individual may harbor a reasonable ^expectation of privacy,\u2019 * * * he is entitled to the free <em>from^unreasonable </em>governmental intrusion.\u201d <em>Terry v Ohio, </em>392 US 1, 9; 88 S Ct 1868; 20 L Ed 2d 889 (1968). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">In our discussion concerning the right to privacy, we found that the government could make reasonable intrusions upon that right. Therefore, if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that compelled disclosure is a search, we believe that it would be a reasonable search if it is accomplished by the least intrusive method.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Certified Question VIII \u2014 Disclosure as Oath</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The Legislature requests us to test the constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 131 and 132 against the provisions of art 11, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution. That article contains the oath of office required to be taken and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>subscribed by all legislative, executive and judicial officers. This section also provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">\"No other oath, affirmation, or any religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We find no conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 131 and 132 of the act and this section of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The oath, affirmation or religious test provision contained in art 11, \u00a7 1 was designed to protect a right which the citizens of our state and nation hold most dear: freedom of belief. While the government may legitimately impose restrictions upon the expression of one\u2019s beliefs, it is wholly without power to compel or require a citizen to adopt a belief. Cases involving \"loyalty oaths\u201d fall within that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Essentially in both <em>Dapper v Smith, </em>138 Mich 104; 101 NW 60 (1904), and <em>Harrington v Secretary of State, </em>211 Mich 395; 179 NW 283 (1920), the Court upheld the right of belief of the citizen in the face of the government attempt to force the citizen to make a decision. In <em>Harrington, </em>the Court held that the government could not force a potential candidate to choose a political philosophy. In <em>Dapper, </em>the potential candidate could not even be forced to decide if he wanted to be a candidate. The situation we have in this case is vastly different from that in <em>Dapper </em>and <em>Harrington. </em>Sections 131 and 132 do not require the potential candidate to form a belief or choose between differing thoughts. The financial disclosure requirements are not analogous to the filing of an oath, affirmation, or religious test. We believe they are more analogous to affidavits required by MCLA 168.557; MSA 6.1557 (change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>name) and MCLA 168.558; MSA 6.1558 (name, address, residency, etc.). We find no violation of art 11, \u00a7 1 by \u00a7\u00a7 131 and 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Certified Question IX \u2014 Lobby Disclosure: Free Speech</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The issue raised by certified question IX is whether chapter 5,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> which contains the lobbyist disclosure provisions, removes political power inherent in the people; restricts the right of people to consult for the common good; inhibits the instructing of representatives; restricts or inhibits the petitioning of government for the redress of grievances; or abridges freedom of speech in violation of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, or 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Chapter 5 requires lobbyists and lobbyist agents<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> to register annually with the Secretary of State and to pay a $5 registration fee. At that filing, the lobbyist must disclose the names of all of his lobbyist agents in the state, and lobbyist agents must declare the name, address, and nature of business of everyone who is compensating them.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Quarterly reports must be filed by each lobbyist detailing:</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">(1) all expenditures in any way related to lobbying, including expenses for advertising and mass mailings;</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">(2) all financial transactions between the lobbyist and public officials or their families over $50, except those in the ordinary course of business;</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">(3) each contribution or membership fee of $500 or more in the current fiscal year paid to a lobbyist whose primary purpose is lobbying, with the name, address, and occupation of the source of such funds; and</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">(4) a brief description of the lobbying activities engaged in.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Public officials are to be notified when their names are included in a lobbyist\u2019s report and quarterly and annual summaries of these reports are to be published and given wide public dissemination.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Lobbyists are to obtain and preserve for five years all the documentation necessary for the information required in these reports filed with the Secretary of State. Lobbyist agents are in turn responsible for furnishing their employer (the lobbyist) with a full accounting on a quarterly basis of all lobbying and expenditures related thereto which must be included in the lobbyist\u2019s quarterly report. The information disclosed in these reports may not be used for commercial purposes, although it can be used for the solicitation of campaign contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Lobbyist agents may not accept employment on a contingent fee basis and gifts by lobbyists and lobbyist agents to public officials and their families are prohibited. In general, public officials are prohibited from accepting compensation for lobbying. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Fines and penalties are imposed for violations of the chapter\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">We find with regard to regulation of lobbyist activities involving <em>direct </em>communication with officials in the executive and legislative branches that the disclosure provisions are not violative of the constitutional provisions cited above. We find more troublesome, however, the disclosure provisions as they relate to the \"soliciting of others to communicate\u201d with officials. Resolution of any problems which may arise respecting the interpretation and application of this language is better deferred until the issues are raised in a factual context.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The right of freedom of speech, of association, the right to consult for the common good, to instruct representatives, to petition the government, are all fundamental. As we have indicated elsewhere in this opinion, when the government seeks to regulate a fundamental right, the regulation may be upheld only if justified by a compelling state interest. While requiring lobbyists to disclose information constitutes regulation of fundamental rights, compelling state interest justifies such regulation. Both the electorate and public officials have a right to be informed of those interests represented by lobbyists. The constitutionality of legislation regulating the activities of lobbyists<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> has been upheld by the United States Supreme Court. <em>United States v Harriss, </em>347 US 612; 74 S Ct 808; 98 L Ed 989 (1954). However, those challenging the constitutionality of Michigan\u2019s act argue that when chapter 5 is closely scrutinized it is vague and overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Because criminal penalties attach to violations of this statute, fair notice must be provided to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>person of ordinary intelligence as to the conduct proscribed. The Michigan statute sufficiently delineates the type of conduct regulated: (1) that a person spend more than $1,000 in a 12-month period; (2) communicating directly with an executive branch or legislative official; or (3) soliciting others to such communication; and that (4) such communication be for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative action. The statute is more descriptive of the types of communication regulated than the Federal lobbying act discussed in <em>Harriss, supra. </em>Legislative and administrative actions are sufficiently defined in \u00a7\u00a7 12(1) and 2(1), respectively. Thus, we conclude that chapter 5 is sufficiently specific to withstand a vagueness challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The statute upheld in <em>Harriss </em>differs from the Michigan act in two respects:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">First, the Federal lobbying act as construed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Harriss </em>covered only the so-called professional lobbyists. Chapter 5 requirements of the Michigan legislation apply not only to those who are paid or pay others, but also those who lobby in their own behalf, provided their expenditures for such activities exceed $1,000. Second, unlike the Federal lobbying act, the requirements of chapter 5 are not restricted to direct communications between the lobbyist or lobbyist agent and the public official. Under \u00a7 12(3) lobbying is also defined as \"soliciting others to communicate with an official in the executive branch or an official in the legislative branch for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative action\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">In our opinion, the rights of legislators, public officials and the public to know the source of monies expended to influence governmental action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>applies equally to professional lobbyists and those representing their own interests. By imposing the $1,000 threshold, the Legislature has helped to insure that only significant expenditures need be disclosed. In order to avoid manifest overbreadth, however, the words \"soliciting others to communicate\u201d with an official \"for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative action\u201d must be interpreted to mean express and direct requests to so communicate. Even as so construed, the validity of restraints placed upon such requests is more appropriately tested in the factual context of an actual case or controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Certified Question X \u2014 Lobby Disclosure: Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The final question is whether restrictions placed upon lobbyists and lobbyist agents deny them equal protection of the law. This issue concerns the definition of \"lobbyist\u201d contained in \u00a7 12(4) and the exceptions to the definition of \"lobbyist\u201d carved out by \u00a7 12(6).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> These exceptions include political parties, \u00a7 12(6)(d), religious organizations, \u00a7 12(6)(f), and persons whose annual expenditure or compensation for lobbying is $1,000 or less, \u00a7\u00a7 12(4) and 12(5). None of the above classifications constitutes a violation of equal protection. Political parties have long been subject to distinct and separate regulatory treatment.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The Michigan Constitution recognizes that religious groups have been traditionally accorded special status. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 4. Finally, we cannot say in this factual vacuum that the $1,000 threshold is wholly without rationality. See <em>Buckley v Valeo, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>82-83. In our opinion, the foregoing restrictions do not constitute a denial of equal protection of the law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b614-5\">Williams, Coleman, Fitzgerald, and Lindemer, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-10\"> <em>Advisory Opinion on Constitutionality of 1975 PA 227 (Question 1) </em>396 Mich 123; 240 NW2d 193 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b575-11\"> MCLA 169.1 <em>etseq.; </em>MSA 4.1701(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A9s\"> Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">\"No law shall embrace more than one object, which shall be expressed in its title.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b576-12\"><em> </em>MCLA 169.40; MSA 4.1701(40).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\"> MCLA 169.31; MSA 4.1701(31).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\"> MCLA 169.38; MSA 4.1701(38).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b577-10\"> MCLA 169.178; MSA 4.1701(178).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b578-9\"> The act does not provide a definition of the term \"publish\u201d.
