The trial judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial on two counts and quashed the other three counts. The Court of Appeals reinstated the jury verdicts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">During this general, investigatory proceeding, the defendant\u2019s attorney was outside the grand jury room, and the defendant was advised of his right to consult with his attorney;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he did so on several occasions. The defendant did not request that his attorney be present in the grand jury room.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The record discloses that the issue has not been properly preserved for review and therefore warrants no further study. We conclude that leave to appeal was improvidently granted. <em>DePew v De</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number><em>Pew, </em>373 Mich 162; 128 NW2d 533 (1964); <em>Sinnott v Noble, </em>390 Mich 91; 211 NW2d 842 (1973); <em>People v Watson, </em>390 Mich 732; 212 NW2d 708 (1973).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The appeal is dismissed, and the cause remanded to the Oakland Circuit Court for imposition of sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b823-5\">Kavanagh, C.
