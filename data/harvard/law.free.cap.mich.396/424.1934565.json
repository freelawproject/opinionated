We hold that the defense of double jeopardy, as it affects whether a trial should have taken place at all, is not waived by a subsequent guilty plea. As this question is dispositive, we do not consider other issues raised by defendant, except we hold that the mere mention of a polygraph test without more does not constitute such manifest necessity as would justify a mistrial. We reverse the Court of Appeals and the trial court, and the defendant is discharged, as he was twice put in jeopardy, contrary to the mandate of the Federal and Michigan Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">I \u2014 Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Defendant Alvin Johnson\u2019s first trial, with co-defendant Eddie Perkins on the charge of armed robbery, ended in a mistrial when, two days into the trial, Johnson\u2019s attorney asked a prosecution witness, a police officer:</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Didn\u2019t he [Alvin Johnson] deny he was implicated, involved in the alleged holdup?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\"><em>\"Q. </em>Did he also ask you whether or not he could submit to a lie detector test?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The witness never answered as the prosecutor instantly objected and the jury was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The people moved for a mistrial, maintaining:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\"The people would make a motion. Any reference to a lie detector test has to be prejudicial, and I would ask for a mistrial, with reluctance. No reference to a polygraph or lie detector test has been given. There has been no reference to that at all and is absolute grounds for a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Perkins\u2019 counsel concurred. Johnson\u2019s counsel did not, maintaining, \"All I can say is I didn\u2019t realize it was improper\u201d. He also noted, \"I feel kind of small\u201d, but never directly commented one way or another on whether he would consent to a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The court took the motion under advisement and adjourned until the following day. When court reconvened, the prosecutor withdrew his motion, claiming \"that the inadvertent reference to a polygraph could be corrected by proper instructions from the court\u201d. Perkins\u2019 counsel, however, renewed his motion. \"I feel that the harm done by this statement that was taken hinders any due process.\u201d The trial court granted the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Before the second trial began, Johnson\u2019s counsel moved for dismissal on the grounds that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the mistrial. He maintained that the mere mention of the word polygraph would not be grounds for ending proceedings, that defendant\u2019s silence relative to mistrial signifies neither acceptance nor consent, and that consent must be affirmatively and knowingly given, which did not occur in the case of Johnson or his counsel. Further, he suggested that the court might have granted a mistrial as to defendant Perkins, who requested it, and could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>have permitted the trial to continue as to defendant Johnson. While the court observed this was a unique idea, the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">New counsel for Johnson subsequently moved to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. The judge denied the motion on the ground of self-induced error by counsel for defendant Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Shortly after impanelling of the jury for the second trial began, codefendant Perkins pled guilty to an added count of assault with intent to rob and steal while being unarmed, and was endorsed as a witness to testify against Johnson. Johnson then pled guilty to the same added count and was sentenced to 5 to 15 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The Court of Appeals granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to affirm the conviction. We granted leave, limited to \"the question of whether the grant of a mistrial over defendant-appellant\u2019s objection barred subsequent prosecution under double jeopardy provisions of the Federal and state Constitutions\u201d. 392 Mich 756 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">II \u2014 The Protection Against Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and article 1, \u00a7 15 of the Michigan Constitution guarantee an individual against twice being put in jeopardy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>\"The underlying idea [of the protection against double jeopardy] * * * is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d <em>Green v United States, </em>355 US 184, 187-188; 78 S Ct 221, 223; 2 L Ed 2d 199, 204 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Thus, once defendant has been placed in jeopardy,* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> unless he or she consents to the trial\u2019s interruption,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or a mistrial occurs because of manifest necessity,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the state is precluded from bringing him or her to trial again. Even if defendant benefits from a mistrial called for reasons short of those necessary to satisfy the manifest necessity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>standard, reprosecution is still prohibited.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, even where the mistrial was improperly-declared, it is not a bar to retrial if the action was taken with defendant\u2019s consent. <em>State v Fenton, </em>19 Ariz App 274, 276; 506 P2d 665, 667 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Mere silence or failure to object to the jury\u2019s discharge is not such consent, 19 Ariz App 274, 276; 506 P2d 665, 667.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In a very recent case in which defense counsel himself requested a mistrial, the United States Supreme Court has addressed this point as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\"The important consideration, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retains primary control over the course to be followed * * * \u201d, <em>United States v Dinitz, </em>\u2014 US \u2014, \u2014; 96 S Ct 1075, 1081; 47 L Ed 2d 267 (1976),</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">and the defendant must therefore do something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>positively in order to indicate he or she is exercising that primary control. Further,</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\"The circumstance that it is defense counsel who initiates the court\u2019s inquiry into a matter which ultimately results in an order of mistrial does not ipso facto transform counsel\u2019s expression of concern into an implied consent to such drastic ruling.\u201d <em>People v Compton, </em>6 Cal 3d 55, 62; 98 Cal Rptr 217, 221; 490 P2d 537, 541 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\"[A]n appellate court\u2019s assessment of which side benefited from the mistrial ruling does not adequately satisfy the policies underpinning the double jeopardy provision\u201d, <em>United States v Jorn, </em>400 US 470, 483; 91 S Ct 547; 27 L Ed 2d 543 (1971). Thus, in the absence of bright-line rules deliberately eschewed by the United States Supreme Court, 400 US 470, 486, we must first look to whether in the exercise of that control of the course of his own trial, highlighted by <em>Dinitz, </em>defendant Alvin Johnson approved termination of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">It is not difficult to require a trial court to inquire whether defendant consents. Therefore, in the absence of an affirmative showing on the record, this Court will not presume to find such consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">There was no such affirmative showing in this case. At best, defense counsel may be said to have been silent. At worst, he did not protest, but he did not assent. Therefore, we find that defendant did not personally consent to the end of the first trial. However, the finding of manifest necessity would still make the second trial permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Ill \u2014 Did Manifest Necessity Exist?</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">A judge has the power to abort a trial before a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>verdict is reached in order to prevent frustration of the ends of justice. Where \"the ends of substantial justice cannot be attained without discontinuing the trial\u201d, <em>Gori v United States, </em>367 US 364, 368; 81 S Ct 1523; 6 L Ed 2d 901 (1961), a mistrial declared for such \"manifest necessity\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> may be declared without defendant\u2019s consent,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and will not foreclose retrial even if it is over his or her objection. 367 US 364, 368. Because of its implications, this judicial discretion is properly exercised \"only in very extraordinary and striking circumstances\u201d. <em>United States v Coolidge, </em>25 Fed Cas 622, 623; 2 Gall 364, 365 (D Mass, 1815), cited in <em>Downum v United States, </em>372 US 734, 736; 83 S Ct 1033; 10 L Ed 2d 100 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\"A mere error of law or procedure * * * does not constitute legal necessity.\u201d <em>Curry v Superior Court, </em>2 Cal 3d 707, 714; 87 Cal Rptr 361, 365; 470 P2d 345, 349 (1970). \"[A] mistrial should not be declared in consequence of mere irregularities which are not prejudicial to the rights of the persons prosecuted.\u201d <em>People v Watson, </em>307 Mich 596, 606; 12 NW2d 476 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The question of whether merely mentioning the term polygraph constitutes more than such a \"mere irregularity\u201d has been considered by our Court of Appeals. In <em>People v Paul F Baker, </em>7 Mich App 471, 476; 152 NW2d 43 (1967), Judge, now Chief Justice, Kavanagh, found that references to a polygraph test within the context of a particular case did not constitute reversible error and could be cured by relevant instructions to the jury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Cautionary instructions would be inadequate, the Court of Appeals has suggested, where testimony is admitted regarding refusal to take a polygraph test. <em>People v Tyrer, </em>19 Mich App 48, 50; 172 NW2d 53 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Particularly helpful is <em>People v Paffhousen, </em>20 Mich App 346, 350; 174 NW2d 69 (1969), where the complaining witness explained she had changed her story because \"you don\u2019t fool a polygraph machine\u201d. The trial court denied counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\"Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial. <em>To so hold would be tantamount to requiring a mistrial every time the word ''polygraph\u2019 is mentioned in a criminal prosecution. </em>It was not established that the complainant had submitted to a polygraph examination nor was an attempt made to introduce the results of any such examination. The word 'polygraph\u2019 was not used by counsel, but was volunteered by the witness. It was properly objected to, and the trial court properly ruled that the subject not be pursued any further. It was not, in fact, pursued, and no prejudicial error resulted.\u201d 20 Mich App 351. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>In a case similar to that before us today, the Court of Appeals found reversible error barring retrial where the court did order a mistrial. <em>People v Maguire, </em>38 Mich App 576; 196 NW2d 880 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">During cross-examination of a detective by defense counsel, counsel asked:</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Did you know that Mr. Maguire [defendant] was challenged to submit to a lie detector test?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Before the witness responded, the prosecutor requested that the jury be excused. The judge granted a mistrial upon the prosecutor\u2019s request. 38 Mich App 578, 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The Court of Appeals, \"taking into account all of the circumstances of the case\u201d, 38 Mich App 581, found the judge committed error. The panel noted, \"There was no effort made by the judge to correct the statement by an'instruction\u201d. 38 Mich App 581. Also important was that \"[t]his is not a case of continued improper activity on the part of defense counsel after a ruling by the trial judge, but rather, one isolated instance\u201d. 38 Mich App 581. Further, the defense attorney did not ask for the mistrial, nor did he consent to it. 38 Mich App 582. Under the circumstances, therefore, the court did not find such \"manifest necessity which prevented the ends of public justice from being served by a continuation of the proceedings\u201d. 38 Mich App 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">A rule becomes clear, after reviewing the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>People v Brocato, </em>17 Mich App 277; 169 NW2d 483 (1969), where they found a mistrial would have been appropriate. 17 Mich App 292, fn 12. There, not only did the prosecutor insert the issue of a polygraph, 17 Mich App 291, but he apparently deliberately contravened the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>court\u2019s warning to discontinue this approach.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 17 Mich App 292. It is clear that the Court of Appeals believed a mistrial was warranted because \"[t]he prosecutor here made every conceivable effort to prevent the defendant from having a fair trial\u201d. 17 Mich App 291. They noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\"It is rare indeed that an appellate court is confronted with such an openly disclosed intent on the part of a trial attorney to place before a jury improper and prejudicial testimony or such flagrant disregard of a ruling by the court.\u201d 17 Mich App 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><em>Brocato </em>was not a case of inadvertence, or of a single inappropriate question. Rather, it was part of a pattern of contumacious conduct on the part of the prosecutor. In the former instance, without a showing of prejudice, a mistrial would not be appropriate. In the latter, it certainly would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">This is not true in the case before us. In the instant case, there was apparently an inadvertent question asked by defense counsel, which was instantly objected to, and therefore never answered. There was no overt effort to misuse the judicial system to prevent defendant from receiving a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Under the circumstances, it does not appear that legal necessity existed for the discharge of the jury. The trial court ordinarily is in a superior position to determine when manifest necessity demands a mistrial, and must exercise its discretion to protect the ends of justice. Such discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>however, should be exercised with the object of safeguarding defendant\u2019s double jeopardy protection. Because of the high value placed on defendant\u2019s not being required to undergo the discommodity of a second trial, the declaration of a mistrial should not be made lightly, even when it is made ostensibly for the protection of defendant. The trial judge must always consider the possibility of curing error with a warning.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In the instant case, we do not think sufficient prejudice was demonstrated to warrant a mistrial. We do not think the mention of a polygraph test, without more, was sufficient to justify granting a mistrial even to Perkins, who requested it, and certainly was not enough to support the mistrial as to defendant Johnson. A different issue might have arisen had the witness answered the question, but it is not necessary to resolve that matter now.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">IV \u2014 Effect of the Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">It is clear that in the instant case, defendant did not consent to the mistrial and it was not required by manifest necessity. Had the second trial not ended in a guilty plea, there is no question that it would have been improper as a violation of defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ant\u2019s constitutional right against twice being put into jeopardy. The main question of the case now faces us and that is whether the guilty plea waived that constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\n<em>A. What Guilty Plea Waives</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Clearly, the plea of guilty is itself an affirmative waiver of certain preconviction rights of the accused. See <em>Right to Appeal Plea Bargain Convic</em>tions, 69 Nw U L Rev 663, 664 and fn 3-6 (1974). <em>People v Zunno, </em>384 Mich 151, 156; 180 NW2d 17 (1970). The proper focus of Federal habeas corpus inquiry is the nature of the advice and voluntariness of the plea. <em>Tollett v Henderson, </em>411 US 258, 267; 93 S Ct 1602; 36 L Ed 2d 235 (1973).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Thus, in the guilty-plea trilogy of <em>Brady v United States, </em>397 US 742; 90 S Ct 1463; 25 L Ed 2d 747 (1970), <em>McMann v Richardson, </em>397 US 759; 90 S Ct 1441; 25 L Ed 2d 763 (1970), and <em>Parker v North Carolina, </em>397 US 790; 90 S Ct 1458; 25 L Ed 2d 785 (1970), and in <em>Tollett v Henderson, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized that \"a guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process. * * * [A criminal defendant] may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea * * * \u201d. 411 US 258, 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">However, despite the apparently sweeping na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ture of this language, the Supreme Court has not construed the effect of guilty pleas to preclude contesting all constitutional rights.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The <em>Brady </em>trilogy and <em>Tollett </em>did not change the established principle that a guilty plea does not waive defendant\u2019s right to contest whether a statute under which he or she is accused is constitutional, <em>United States v Ury, </em>106 F2d 28 (CA 2, 1939), or whether the information or indictment stated an offense, <em>Kolaski v United States, </em>362 F2d 847, 848 (CA 5, 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\n<em>B. What the Guilty Plea Does Not Waive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Generally, however, the guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional defects in the proceedings. See <em>People v Ginther, </em>390 Mich 436, 440; 212 NW2d 922 (1973). Why an accepted, unqualified<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> plea of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>guilty should cure error that a guilty verdict or finding would not<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> has probably been best answered by the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that a guilty plea is different \"in purpose and effect from a mere admission or an extra-judicial confession, it is itself a conviction\u201d. <em>Kercheval v United States, </em>274 US 220, 223; 47 S Ct 582; 71 L Ed 1009 (1927). Thus, in the case of a guilty plea, the conviction is based not on possibly tainted evidence, but on defendant\u2019s admission in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">\"A conviction after trial in which a coerced confession is introduced rests in part on the coerced confession, a constitutionally unacceptable basis for conviction. ** * * The defendant who pleads guilty is in a different posture. He is convicted on his counseled admission in open court that he committed the crime charged against him. The prior confession is not the basis for the judgment * * * .\u201d <em>McMann v Richardson, 397 </em>US 759, 773; 90 S Ct 1441; 25 L Ed 2d 763 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The Court has, itself, however, recognized that the double jeopardy defense is different from the <em>McMann </em>type of defenses qualitatively. In <em>Robinson v Neil, </em>409 US 505, 509; 93 S Ct 876; 35 L Ed 2d 29 (1973), Justice Rehnquist, speaking for a unanimous court, distinguished this protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>from others, such as the <em>Mapp v Ohio </em>exclusionary rule, designed to deter unlawful police conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\"While this guarantee [double jeopardy] * * * is a constitutional right of the criminal defendant, its practical result is to prevent a trial from taking place at all, rather than to prescribe procedural rules that govern the conduct of a trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Thus, the right is closer to those which were untouched by <em>Brady, et al., </em>such as the right to challenge the constitutionality of the statute under which the state proceeded, which may be asserted even after a plea of guilty. Defendant may always challenge whether the state had a right to bring the prosecution in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The first application of this approach came when the Supreme Court, in <em>Blackledge v Perry, </em>417 US 21, 31; 94 S Ct 2098; 40 L Ed 2d 628 (1974), applied the <em>Robinson </em>double jeopardy reasoning to find that a guilty plea did not foreclose a defendant from collaterally raising a due process right in attacking a plea-based conviction in Federal habeas corpus proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">First, the Court distinguished the due process right from those in the <em>Brady </em>trilogy and <em>Tollett.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">\"Although the underlying claims presented in <em>Tollett </em>and the <em>Brady </em>trilogy were of constitutional dimensions, none went to the very power of the State to bring the defendant into court to answer the charge brought against him. * * * In the case at hand, by contrast, the nature of the underlying constitutional infirmity is markedly different. Having chosen originally to proceed on the misdemeanor charge in the District Court, the State of North Carolina was, under the facts of this case, simply precluded by the Due Process Clause from calling upon the respondent to answer to the more serious charge in the Superior Court. Unlike the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>fendant in <em>Tollett, </em>Perry is not complaining of 'antecedent constitutional violations\u2019 or of a 'deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\u2019 411 US at 266, 267. Rather, the right that he asserts and that we today accept is the right not to be haled into court at all upon the felony charge.\u201d 417 US 21, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Then, using the <em>Robinson </em>double jeopardy reasoning, and applying it to the due process clause, the Court found:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\"While our judgment today is not based upon the Double Jeopardy Clause, we think that the [Robinson double jeopardy clause] language aptly describes the due process right upon which our judgment <em>is </em>based. The 'practical result\u2019 dictated by the Due Process Clause in this case is that North Carolina simply could not permissibly require Perry to answer to the felony charge. That being so, it follows that his guilty plea did not foreclose him from attacking his conviction in the Superior Court proceedings through a federal writ of habeas corpus.\u201d 417 US 21, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The foundation laid in <em>Blackledge </em>was completed by the Supreme Court in its per curiam opinion in <em>Menna v New York, </em>423 US 61; 96 S Ct 241; 46 L Ed 2d 195 (1975). There, citing <em>Black-ledge, </em>the Court rejected the state\u2019s reliance on <em>Tollett </em>and held that a guilty plea did not waive the double jeopardy defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\"Where the State is precluded by the United States Constitution from haling a defendant into court on a charge, federal law requires that a conviction on that charge be set aside even if the conviction was entered pursuant to a counseled plea of guilty.\u201d 423 US 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Thus, it is clear that the United States Supreme Court, while recognizing that certain rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>defendant may be waived by a subsequent plea of guilty, does not say that is true of all rights. Certainly it is true that those rights which might provide a complete defense to a criminal prosecution, those which undercut the state\u2019s interest in punishing the defendant,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or the state\u2019s authority or ability to proceed with the trial may never be waived by guilty plea.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These rights are similar to the jurisdictional defenses in that their effect is that there should have been no trial at all. The test, although grounded in the constitution, is therefore a practical one. Thus, the defense of double jeopardy, those grounded in the due process clause, those relating to insufficient evidence to bind over at preliminary examination and failure to suppress illegally-obtained evidence without which the people could not proceed are other examples. Wherever it is found that the result of the right asserted would be to prevent the trial from taking place, we follow the lead of the United States Supreme Court and hold a guilty plea does not waive that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">V \u2014 Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Defendant Alvin Johnson\u2019s first trial ended in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>an improperly called mistrial. Thus, defendant was placed in jeopardy twice in violation of his constitutional right. Because this right goes to the very heart of the government\u2019s ability to place defendant on trial, the subsequent guilty plea does not foreclose defendant from raising this defense.

Although the prosecutor withdrew his objection and motion, codefendant Perkins demanded a mistrial, saying, \"I feel that the harm done by this statement that was taken hinders any due process\u201d.

A second joint trial on the armed robbery charge was begun over defendant\u2019s claim of double jeopardy.

(This was after his codefendant had pled guilty to the same charge.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Now defendant claims (1) that the order of mistrial was improper, and (2) therefore, he could neither be tried on the original charge nor could he plead guilty to the reduced charge. He claims that the defense of double jeopardy is not waived by a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">This dissent is neither in agreement nor disagreement with the latter claim. Instead, it is directed to the conclusion that the order of mistrial was invalid in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">With the codefendant demanding mistrial, the judge had cause to believe that he could not win regardless of what he did. He chose to accede to codefendant\u2019s motion for mistrial under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The majority would find that the judge chose erroneously and would free defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The cases relied upon by the majority are inapposite. All refer to a prosecutor\u2019s motion or a judge\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">For instance, the majority quotes from <em>Gori v United States, </em>367 US 364; 81 S Ct 1523; 6 L Ed 2d 901 (1961), but does not relate the essence of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">In <em>Gori, </em>defendant was in the first day of a jury trial when the judge, <em>on his own motion, </em>declared a mistrial. Defendant was silent, neither objecting nor approving. The Supreme Court stated that reasons for the mistrial were unclear although the trial judge may have acted because of questioning by the prosecutor bringing out other crimes of defendant. The Court agreed with the Court of Appeals in characterizing the judge\u2019s action:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">\"In any event, it is obvious, as the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>concluded, that the judge 'was acting according to his convictions in protecting the rights of the accused.\u2019 282 F2d, at 46. The court below did not hold the mistrial ruling erroneous or an abuse of discretion. It did find the prosecutor\u2019s conduct unexceptionable and the reason for the mistrial, therefore, not 'entirely clear\u2019. It did say that 'the judge should have awaited a definite question which would have permitted a clear-cut ruling\u2019, and that, in failing to do so, he displayed an 'overzealousness\u2019 and acted 'too hastily\u2019. <em>Id., </em>at 46, 48.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><em>Gori, supra, </em>at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The Court commented on the role of the trial judge in declaring a mistrial re Fifth Amendment concerns:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\"><em>\"Where, for reasons deemed compelling by the trial judge, who is best situated intelligently to make such a decision, </em>the ends of substantial justice cannot be attained without discontinuing the trial, a mistrial may be declared without the defendant\u2019s consent and even over his objection, and he may be retried consistently with the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\"It is also clear that 'This Court has long favored the rule of discretion in the trial judge to declare a mistrial and to require another panel to try the defendant if the ends of justice will be best served * * * ,\u2019 <em>Brock v North Carolina, </em>344 US 424, 427 [73 S Ct 349; 97 L Ed 456, 459 (1953)] and that <em>we have consistently declined to scrutinize with sharp surveillance the exercise of that discretion. </em>\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\"><em>Gori, supra, </em>at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\"><em>Gori </em>states the better rule to follow under the instant facts which are distinguishable from those leading to the conclusion as to that defendant. Here codefendants are involved rather than a single defendant, and the codefendant made the motion for mistrial rather than the judge <em>sua </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>sponte. </em>Further, the rationale of <em>Gori </em>carries over to the instant case: (1) The trial judge is best situated to make a decision on whether a mistrial is necessary to achieve the ends of justice. (2) Although the mistrialAvas not \"in the sole interest of the defendant\u201d, Johnson, there were two defendants and the codefendant was equally interested. He demanded a mistrial, so the trial judge could reasonably find that the ends of justice required a mistrial. (3) Although reference to a polygraph may not be reversible error in every case, the judge\u2019s declaration of a mistrial would at least appear to be the product of the trial judge\u2019s solicitude and in the sole interest of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Moreover, the general underlying rationale for defense of double jeopardy does not exist in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\"The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the <em>State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict </em>an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\"><em>Green v United States, </em>355 US 184, 187-188; 78 S Ct 221, 223; 2 L Ed 2d 199, 204 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\"Judicial wisdom counsels against anticipating hypothetical situations in which the discretion of the trial judge may be abused and so call for the safeguard of the Fifth Amendment \u2014 cases in which the defendant would be harrassed by <em>successive, oppressive prosecutions, or in which a judge exercises his authority to help the prosecution, at a trial in which its case is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>going badly, by affording it another, more favorable opportunity to convict the accused. </em>\u201d(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><em>Gori, supra, </em>at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In the instant case, the mistrial was declared on motion of the codefendant, not the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In an eifort to avoid reversal on appeal, the trial judge in the instant case may have \"bent over backwards\u201d on behalf of the defendants in declaring a mistrial. However, careful judges are learning that they cannot be too careful \u2014 or can they?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Justice Frankfurter\u2019s comment in <em>Gori </em>at 369 applies equally to the majority opinion in the instant case:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\"><em>\"[W]e are unwilling, where it clearly appears that a mistrial has been granted in the sole interest of the defendant, to hold that its necessary consequence is to bar all retrial. </em>It would hark back to the formalistic artificialities of seventeenth century criminal procedure so to confine our federal trial courts by compelling them to navigate a narrow compass between Scylla and Charybdis.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">In the recent case of <em>United States v Dinitz, </em>\u2014 US \u2014; 96 S Ct 1075; 47 L Ed 2d 267 (1976), defendant was represented by several attorneys. The trial judge excluded the attorney in charge of the trial because of his repeated improper actions during the opening statement. The judge set three alternatives for the defendant: (1) stay or recess pending Court of Appeals review on expulsion of the attorney; (2) continuation of the trial with the remaining attorneys, or (3) declaration of a mistrial so defendant could get new counsel. A remaining attorney moved for a mistrial after consulting with defendant. It was not opposed by the prosecutor and was granted by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Before the second trial, defendant unsuccessfully moved for dismissal of the indictment on double jeopardy grounds. His subsequent conviction was reversed by the Court of Appeals on double jeopardy grounds because defendant was given no choice but to ask for a mistrial. The Court of Appeals treated the case as a declaration of mistrial over defendant\u2019s objection, ignoring his request for mistrial. Therefore, it was said that double jeopardy barred the second trial because there was no manifest necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that defendant did request a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The Court of Appeals had based its holding on a waiver theory, saying that when defendant requests a mistrial he waives his right to be tried by the first jury. Therefore, it was said that defendant did not voluntarily waive because the trial judge did not present enough alternatives \u2014 he was left with no choice other than mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The Supreme Court held that the waiver theory does not apply \u2014 defendant is always faced with a \"Hobson\u2019s choice\u201d in deciding whether to respond to judicial or prosecutorial error with a mistrial request. He must give up the first jury or continue in a trial which may contain error. The Court said that the inquiry should be <em>whether \"defendant retains primary control over the course to be followed in the event of such error\u201d. Dinitz, supra, </em>at 431. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\"><em>Dinitz </em>is not on \"all fours\u201d with the instant case, but the cases are similar because the complaining defendant\u2019s attorney in each case committed possible error during trial. In <em>Dinitz, </em>the judge took his action upon objection from the prosecutor and a resulting request for mistrial by defendant. In the instant case, the trial judge declared a mistrial at the request of the codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>However, the basic theory of <em>Dinitz </em>applies equally to the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">We must examine the circumstances surrounding the declaration of mistrial to discover whether defendant had primary control. Defendant\u2019s attorney asked the objectionable question, codefendant\u2019s attorney strongly objected and asked for a mistrial, and defendant\u2019s attorney essentially apologized, saying, \"[a]ll I can say is I didn\u2019t realize it was improper\u201d and, \"I feel kind of small\u201d. The court, on these facts, could find that defendant consented to the mistrial. Defendant had interests similar to those of the objecting codefendant and he apologized for the problem caused by his own question. Considering these facts, defendant had control over the events and, in the absence of a specific objection or denial of error at the time, the trial court could properly determine that defendant joined with the codefendant in seeking a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The majority opinion states that \"defendant must therefore do something positively in order to indicate he or she is exercising that primary control\u201d. However, <em>Dinitz </em>contains no such language. The proper inquiry, simply stated, is whether defendant had primary control. A reviewing court may examine the totality of the circumstances in considering whether such control existed. The totality of the instant facts reveal control. Defendant need not raise a red flag.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Finally, we note comments by the United States Supreme Court concerning the result which Justice William\u2019s opinion inevitably brings about:</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\"[It] * * * undermines rather than furthers the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause. In the event of severely prejudicial error a defendant might well consider an immediate new trial a preferable alternative to the prospect of a probable conviction followed by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>appeal, a reversal of the conviction, and a later retrial. Yet the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, in effect, instructs trial judges to reject the most meritorious mistrial motion in the absence of manifest necessity and to require, instead, that the trial proceed to its conclusion despite a legitimate claim of seriously prejudicial error. For if a trial judge follows that course, the Double Jeopardy Clause will present no obstacle to a retrial if the conviction is set aside by the trial judge or reversed on appeal. <em>United States v Ball, </em>163 US 662.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In this case, it also results in one codefendant convicted and another released after guilty pleas by each to identical offenses.
