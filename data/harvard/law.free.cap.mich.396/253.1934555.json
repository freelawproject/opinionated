Those words do not describe the showing of a motion picture film. A film is distributed or licensed by a producer directly or through a distributor to an exhibitor who shows or exhibits the film to the public. An exhibitor does not \"sell\u201d or \"distribute\u201d the film to the viewing public.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The words \"acquisition or possession\u201d in context appear directed at the permanent acquisition and possession<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the prohibited material rather than the temporary possession of one who, like a motion picture exhibitor, does not at any time acquire or possess any interest in the material and who is required to return it shortly.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In this connection it is significant that the gist of the complaint against a motion picture exhibitor is the showing of the allegedly obscene material, not its mere acquisition and possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Michigan\u2019s criminal obscenity statute reveals its purpose to cover the exhibition of motion picture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>film by the inclusion of the verb \"show\u201d and the noun \"motion picture film\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The criminal obscenity statute took its present form in 1957 (1957 PA 265).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The civil obscenity statute was first enacted in 1958 (1958 PA 126).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The earlier criminal statute expressly covers \"phonograph record\u201d, \"motion picture film\u201d, \"wire or tape recording\u201d, \"or recorded matter\u201d. The civil obscenity statute significantly does not include those words. This is even more striking when the descriptive language of the two acts is placed side by side and it is seen that the wording of the materials covered in the civil statute follows in precise sequence the language of the criminal statute with the noticeable elimination of \"newspaper\u201d (\"comic book\u201d substituted), \"phonograph record\u201d, \"motion picture film\u201d, \"wire or tape recording\u201d \"or recorded matter\u201d. Whether these deletions were because proceedings under the civil statute may be maintained by \"[t]he chief executive or legal officer of any city, village or charter township\u201d as well as the prosecuting attorney does not appear; whatever the reason, it is apparent that the Legislature chose to limit the operative effect of the civil obscenity statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The civil obscenity statute is not directed to the exhibition of a motion picture film.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b356-4\">Kavanagh, C.

Justice Levin asks us to believe that the Legislature desired to regulate that which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, indecent or disgusting more extensively through the criminal process than the civil. It is my opinion that the statute\u2019s distribution of such material covers the exhibition of \"The Devil in Miss Jones\u201d. It is my further opinion that the reading of the statute to eliminate motion picture film is strained. The statute does not say that the words \"picture, photograph, figure or image\u201d mean a picture, photograph, figure or image on writing paper or book paper. To so hold brings to mind Mr. Bumble who remarked:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\"If the law supposes that, * * * the law is a ass, a idiot.\u201d <em>Oliver Twist </em>by Charles Dickens.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\"><em>Miller v California, </em>413 US 15; 93 S Ct 2607; 37 L Ed 2d 419 (1973), establishes the standards applicable here.
