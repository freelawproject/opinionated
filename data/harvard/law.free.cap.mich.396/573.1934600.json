The Court, on the authority of <em>Breithaupt v Abram, </em>352 US 432; 77 S Ct 408; 1 L Ed 2d 448 (1957), declared that the result of such a test would be inadmissible in a Federal prosecution. Subsequently, in <em>Schmerber v California, </em>384 US 757; 86 S Ct 1826; 16 L Ed 2d 908 (1966), the United States Supreme Court concluded that the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments had not been violated by the extraction of blood without consent from an apparently drunken driver and the admission in evidence in a drunk driving prosecution of the result of a chemical test of the blood.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are asked to reconsider <em>Lebel </em>in light of <em>Schmerber.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">We see no need, however, to decide this case on constitutional grounds. Even if we were to conclude, on reconsideration of <em>Lebel, </em>that the drawing of blood from an apparently drunken driver does not violate his rights under the Michigan Constitution, the statute limits the authority of police officers to request the taking of blood and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>limits the use that may be made of a test result obtained pursuant to exercise of that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Section 625 of the Michigan Vehicle Code makes it an offense to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">In 1960, after <em>Lebel </em>was decided, \u00a7625a was added.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It made admissible in DUIL prosecutions the result of a blood alcohol test administered with the written consent of the driver. It additionally provided that the driver be advioed of his right to have or to refuse a test and established certain presumptions regarding the extent of intoxication based on the test result.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">After <em>Schmerber </em>was decided, \u00a7 625a was modified<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u00a7\u00a7625c-625g were added.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 625c <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>provides that a person who operates a motor vehicle \"is deemed to have given consent\u201d to a blood alcohol test if he is arrested while driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or while his ability to drive has been impaired due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Section 625d provides, however, that \"[a] person under arrest shall be advised of his right to refuse to submit to chemical tests; and if he refuses the request of a law enforcement officer to submit to chemical tests, no test shall be given\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">If the driver refuses to take a test, a sworn report is required to be forwarded to the Secretary of State who shall give notice of the right to request a motor vehicle license revocation hearing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the driver does not timely request a hearing, the Secretary of State shall suspend or revoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>his license for a period of not less than 90 days nor more than 2 years.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After a requested hearing the Secretary of State may suspend, revoke or deny issuance of a driving license.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In this case, the officer requested and the driver consented to the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">While \u00a7\u00a7 625c <em>et seq </em>are sometimes called the \"implied consent law\u201d and \u00a7 625c provides that a person who operates a motor vehicle \"is deemed to have given consent\u201d to a blood alcohol test, companion \u00a7 625d in terms provides that \"no test shall be given\u201d to a person who refuses to consent. Under the statute the issue is not viewed in the context of search and seizure, but solely in terms of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">The people rely on <em>State v Spry, </em>87 SD 318, 323-325; 207 NW2d 504, 507-508 (1973). The South Dakota statute requires the officer to advise the driver of his right to refuse to submit to a blood alcohol test and the consequences of such refusal in respect to the revocation of his driving privileges. Before Spry declined to exercise his right to refuse, he had asked the officer, who was aware that the driver of the other car had died, whether anyone was seriously injured and the officer responded, \"I\u2019m afraid so\u201d. The South Dakota Supreme Court said, \"It is clear that the results of the blood test were admissible despite the failure of the police officer to inform the defendant that the driver of the other car had died as a result of the accident. The statute makes no requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>that the subject be informed of any more than that he has a right to refuse and that his license will be suspended if he does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The South Dakota Court considered and rejected another contention of the defendant, adding: \"Aside from all that, however, we hold that a defendant\u2019s consent or refusal is irrelevant to the admission of the results of the blood test if the test is taken pursuant to a valid arrest\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">We can accept that dictum if the South Dakota Court meant that consent or refusal is irrelevant for purposes of the Federal constitution and the South Dakota statute. But consent is not irrelevant under the Michigan statute. The South Dakota statute speaks of presumptions that arise from certain test results but is silent regarding the admissibility of test results. The Michigan statute specifically provides that test results are admissible in DUIL prosecutions. The South Dakota statute does not provide that the driver be advised regarding the use that may be made of test results. The Michigan statute provides that the driver be informed that test results would be admissible in a DUIL prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Even though the taking of an automobile driver\u2019s blood without consent does not violate the Federal Constitution and even if on reconsideration of <em>Lebel </em>we were to conclude that it did not violate the Michigan Constitution, it would still be within the legislative prerogative to limit the right of police officers and others to take blood from allegedly drunken drivers. Whether consent is or is not constitutionally required, the Legislature may decide that the interest in enforcement of the drunk driving laws does not justify subjecting unconsenting drivers to blood alcohol tests \u2014 imposition of the sanction of revocation of driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>license for unreasonable refusal to consent to a test appropriately protects the public interest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Under the Michigan statute, consent is not only relevant but determinative of whether and to what extent the result of a test administered under the authority of the statute can be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The scope of the consent given in <em>Keen, </em>whether it extended to use of the test result in a criminal prosecution other than for DUIL, depends on a construction of the statute and what occurred when Keen\u2019s consent was solicited and given.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Since its original enactment in 1960, \u00a7 625a has limited the use that may be made of the results of a test administered with the driver\u2019s consent pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Section 625a begins: \"(1) In any criminal prosecution for<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d. The qualifying words, prosecution for \"driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d are repeated in the opening clause of both the first and second sentences of subparagraph (3):</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">\"(3) A person charged with driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor who takes a chemical test administered at the request of a police officer as provided in paragraph (1) and (2) hereof, <em>shall be informed that </em>he will be given a reasonable opportunity to have a person of his own choosing administer one of the chemical tests as provided in this section within a reasonable time after his detention, and <em>the results of such test shall be admissible and shall be considered with other competent evidence in determining the innocence or guilt of the defendant. </em>Any person charged with driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor <em>shall be informed that </em>he has the right to demand that one of the tests provided for in paragraph (1) shall be given him, and <em>the results of such test shall be admissible and shall be considered with other competent evidence in determining the innocence or guilt of the defendant. \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">We read the statute to mean that test results will be used only in determining guilt or innocence in a prosecution for driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or for driving while ability to operate a vehicle was impaired due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>no other purpose.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the context of an arrest for \"driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d, advice that results of a consensual test will be used to determine the innocence or guilt of the driver means innocence or guilt of the offense for which the driver was arrested.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The Secretary of State who, pursuant to the power granted to him,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> has prescribed the advice of rights to be given by police officers to persons arrested pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 625a-625 of the Michigan Vehicle Code, appears to have placed that construction on the statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The arresting officer is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>required to advise the driver:</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">(a) \"You have been arrested for the offense of driving a motor vehicle upon the highways of this state while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or while your ability to operate a motor vehicle has been impaired due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">(b) \"I am further advising you of your right to take a chemical test to determine the alcoholic content of your person * * * \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">(c) \"I further advise you * * * that the results of such tests shall be admissible and shall be considered with other competent evidence in determining your guilt or innocence in any prosecution relating to your driving a vehicle while either under the influence of intoxicating liquor or while your ability to operate a vehicle was impaired due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>A driver advised that he has been arrested for DUIL or for DI and that if he consents to a chemical test the test results shall be admissible and shall be considered evidence in determining his guilt or innocence in any prosecution for driving a vehicle while \"either\u201d under the influence of intoxicating liquor or while his ability to operate a vehicle was impaired through intoxication would justifiably conclude that if he were to consent to the requested test the test results would only be used in a prosecution for the offense for which he was arrested and that his consent obtained on that understanding would not warrant use of the test results for other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">It would exceed the scope of the consent given to allow test results obtained on the representation that they will be used in prosecutions where the maximum penalty for a first offender is 90 days imprisonment to be used in prosecutions for a felony with a maximum penalty of 15 years.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">A police officer has no statutory authority to request that a driver submit to a blood alcohol test unless the arrest is for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The officer is required to advise the driver that if he consents to a test, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>test results shall be admissible in DUIL and driving while impaired prosecutions. Test results obtained following consent obtained on that advice cannot properly be used in a prosecution for manslaughter. The test results are not admissible in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">We intimate no opinion on the continued viability of <em>Lebel. Lebel </em>does not preclude the Legislature from broadening the admissibility of test results where the driver consents to a test.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The Court of Appeals held that by reason of <em>People v Renno, </em>392 Mich 45; 219 NW2d 422 (1974), the defendant\u2019s past driving convictions and any other misdemeanor convictions could not be used at the trial solely for impeachment purposes. Keen states that he \"fears the attempt will be made to introduce these items on a 'pattern, habit or custom\u2019 basis\u201d. The prosecutor counters that since the people have not had a hearing on the prosecutor\u2019s theory for such use, the issue \"is untimely, premature and not ripe for decision\u201d by this Court. We agree that since the issue has not been developed at the trial level, it is not properly before us, but do not wish to be understood as approving or disapproving of such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b684-8\">Kavanagh, C.

It was first amended by 1964 PA 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">As originally enacted the section required that the allegedly intoxicated person give consent to a chemical test in writing and acknowledge in writing \"that he is not required by law to give his consent\u201d. This language was eliminated in 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">The 1964 amendment did provide, however, that \"[t]he person charged shall be advised of his right to refuse to take any test provided for in this act\u201d and both the 1960 and 1964 versions provided that \"refusal on the part of any person to submit to any such test shall not be admissible in any criminal prosecution relating to driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d. Conforming to other changes made by the 1967 act (1967 PA 253), this provision was eliminated and the following language substituted:</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">\"(4) The person charged shall be advised that his refusal to take a test as herein provided shall result in the suspension or revocation of his operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s license or his operating privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">In 1966, \u00a7625b was added making it an offense for any person to operate a motor vehicle \"when, due to consumption of intoxicating liquor * * * he has visibly impaired his ability to operate the vehicle.\u201d 1966 PA 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-17\">The 1960 and 1964 versions provided that if there was at the time of the test 0.05% or less by weight of alcohol it would be presumed that the defendant was not under the influence; if there was in excess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>of 0.05% but less that 0.15% such fact shall not give rise to any presumption but could be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant and if there was 0.15% or more it shall be presumed that the defendant was under the influence. The 1967 act retained the former presumption that the defendant was not under the influence if there was at that time 0.05% or less but reduced the area of no presumption to the range between 0.05% and less than 0.10%. If there was 0.10% or more it would be presumed that \"the defendant\u2019s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired within the provisions of section 625b of this act due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor\u201d.
