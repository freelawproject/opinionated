We are in agreement with the board\u2019s opinion after remand that the discipline imposed by Hearing Panel No. 11 was insufficient in view of the findings of that panel which were affirmed by the board. Pursuant to our power under Grievance Board Rule 16.23(h) to make such order as may be deemed appropriate, and because considerable time has elapsed since the October 23, 1973, order of Hearing Panel No. 11, we modify the discipline imposed upon respondent to suspension until October 23, 1978. This action is taken in view of the facts on record and the equities of this particular case. Respondent will be entitled to petition for readmission five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>years from the date that his license to practice law might have been appropriately ordered revoked. State Bar Rule 15, \u00a7 7(b). In all other respects, the order of the grievance board is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-6\">Kavanagh, C.
