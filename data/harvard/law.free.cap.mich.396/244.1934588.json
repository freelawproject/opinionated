The Illinois Court of Appeals, relying on an Illinois Supreme Court opinion which said that the statutory nuisance abatement procedure was applicable to houses of prostitution, concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\"><em>\"It appears to us too, that this statute is aimed solely and only at houses of prostitution. </em>Only if we can equate the statutory 'lewdness\u2019 with 'obscenity\u2019, would we be justified in characterizing 'places\u2019 for its dissemination and display as public nuisances. Obviously, <em>the words \u2019assignation\u2019 or \u2019prostitution\u2019 in the statute, even with considerable stretching, can hardly be said to cover obscenity. </em>* * * To fix purpose, we must read text in context and if a word is known by the company it keeps, then 'lewdness\u2019 is synonymous with prostitution. This aid contemplates that where two or more words of analogous meaning are employed together in a statute, they are understood to be used in their cognate sense, to express the same relations, and give color and expression to each other. For example, an 'assignation\u2019 could be an innocent appointment, a chaste tryst, or a rendezvous (even with destiny), at least those are meanings that can be so ascribed to it, but not here in its context with Tewdness\u2019 and 'prostitution\u2019. Thus 'assignation\u2019, a euphemism coined years ago to protect the hypersensitive, is synonymous with 'prostitution\u2019. So, too, with 'lewdness\u2019 \u2014 it must equate with 'prostitution\u2019, and 'assignation\u2019 in the sense just described, if we are to follow the rule of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>and adopt that sense of the word which best harmonizes with its setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">A California court of appeals similarly con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>eluded that California\u2019s red-light abatement statute does not apply to motion pictures.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\">We are in accord with decisions applying these abatement statutes only to houses of prostitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The meaning of the words \"lewdness, assignation or prostitution\u201d is clear in light of the history and purpose of these statutes and that meaning cannot properly be expanded by judicial construction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Our disposition of this case makes it unnecessary to reach First Amendment questions that would be raised by the closing of a theatre as a nuisance for showing films found to be obscene, thereby precluding the showing of other films not found to be obscene.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Kavanagh, C.
