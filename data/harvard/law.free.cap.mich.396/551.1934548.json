The trial court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection and asked the jury to disregard the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We hold that the proffered hearsay evidence was admissible as a declaration against penal interest and reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Harold Napora and Stevens (the victim) spent the evening of April 23, 1971 traveling from bar to bar in search of a prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">They met defendant Edwards who said he could find them a woman for $10. Edwards introduced them to Betty King. Napora, Stevens and King, however, were unable to agree on a price.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Napora testified that when it became apparent no agreement would be reached, he and Stevens started to drive away. Edwards pulled a gun and said, \"This is a stickup. Give me your money and don\u2019t take off.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As Napora drove away, he heard two shots fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">Stevens had been sitting on the passenger\u2019s side of Napora\u2019s truck. The door was partly open as they started to drive away and Stevens told Napora he thought he \"got grazed a little bit\u201d. They examined his side at Stevens\u2019 home. Napora testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>fied that they saw only a little red spot which did not look like a hole. Stevens was not bleeding and declined Napora\u2019s offer of a ride to the hospital. Napora, not knowing Stevens had been shot, went home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Stevens bled to death as a result of a gunshot wound of the liver. A .22-caliber bullet was removed from his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Edwards testified that after he introduced King to Napora and Stevens, he went to Skip\u2019s After Hour. He denied having a gun or firing any shots at Napora or Stevens.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5He said that Chester Blake came into Skip\u2019s trying to pawn a .22-caliber pistol for $10. Edwards said he gave Blake $10 for the gun, took it home and sold it to David Benton the next day. Stevens was killed with a .22.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">King\u2019s testimony tended to corroborate that of Edwards. She said that after she, Stevens and Napora failed to reach an agreement, \"some shooting started\u201d. She said she saw Chester Blake standing nearby with a gun.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">John Longuemire sought to testify that Chester Blake, then deceased, had told him* **<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that he (Blake) killed Stevens. The people\u2019s objection was sustained and the jury instructed to disregard Longuemire\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The general rule is that hearsay, an out-of-court statement offered as proof of the matter asserted, is inadmissible at trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">That rule is riddled with exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">One exception is for declarations against the pecuniary or proprietary interest of the declarant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Such statements are admissible as proof of the matter asserted if the declarant is unavailable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>for trial because they are considered inherently reliable. Wigmore states \"[t]he basis of the exception is the principle of experience that a statement asserting a fact distinctly against one\u2019s interest is unlikely to be deliberately false or heedlessly incorrect\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">While courts uniformly recognize the exception for declarations against pecuniary or proprietary interest, they have generally refused to admit declarations against penal interest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">This distinction, which has been criticized by courts, commentators and code drafters as without basis in law or logic,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was first made by the House of Lords in 1844 in the <em>Sussex Peerage </em>Case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Both Wigmore and McCormick state that the House of Lords ignored precedent in holding that a declaration against penal interest was not within the declaration against interest exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Wigmore characterizes the case as \"a backward step\u201d, \"an arbitrary limit\u201d that \"was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>plainly a novelty at the time of its inception\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that would perhaps in England \"no longer be observed\u201d.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> He labels the decision a \"barbarous doctrine which would refuse to let an innocent accused vindicate himself\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">\"It is therefore not too late to retrace our steps, and to discard this barbarous doctrine, which would refuse to let an innocent accused vindicate himself even by producing to the tribunal a perfectly authenticated written confession, made on\" the very gallows, by the true culprit now beyond the reach of justice. Those who watched (in 1899) with self-righteous indignation the course of proceedings in Captain Dreyfus\u2019 trial should remember that, if that trial had occurred in our own courts, the spectacle would have been no less shameful if we, following our own supposed precedents, had refused to admit what the French court never for a moment hesitated to admit \u2014 the authenticated confession of the absconded Major Esterhazy, avowing himself the guilty author of the treason there charged, and now known beyond a doubt to have been the real traitor.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Justice Holmes severely criticized recognition of the distinction by the United States Supreme Court in his oft-quoted dissent in <em>Donnelly v United States, </em>228 US 243, 277-278; 33 S Ct 449; 57 L Ed 820 (1913):</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\"The confession of Joe Dick, since deceased, that he committed the murder for which the plaintiif in error was tried, coupled with circumstances pointing to its truth, would have a very strong tendency to make any one outside of a court of justice believe that Donnelly did not commit the crime. I say this, of course, on the supposition that it should be proved that the confession really was made, and that there was no ground for connecting Donnelly with Dick. \u2014 The rules of evidence in the main are based on experience, logic and common sense, less hampered by history than some parts of the substantive law. There is no decision by this court against the admissibility of such a confession; the English cases since the separation of the two countries do not bind us; the exception to the hearsay rule in the case of declarations against interest is well known; no other statement is so much against interest as a confession of murder, it is far more calculated to convince than dying declarations, which would be let in to hang a man * * * ; and when we surround the accused with so many safeguards, some of which seem to me excessive, I think we ought to give him the benefit of a fact that, if proved, commonly would have such weight. The history of the law and the arguments against the English doctrine are so well and fully stated by Mr. Wig-more that there is no need to set them forth at greater length.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">And Judge Friendly in <em>United States v Annunziato, </em>293 F2d 373, 378 (CA 2, 1961), felt bound by but expressly disapproved what he characterized as \"the rather indefensible limitation\u201d on the declaration against interest exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">A number of state courts<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> have declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>follow the English rule and have held declarations against penal interest admissible as a common-law exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">In <em>Hines v Commonwealth, </em>136 Va 728, 740; 117 SE 843; 35 ALR 431, 439-440 (1923), a witness for the defense was permitted to testify as to a confession made by a then deceased person. The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">\"[W]e think it must be conceded that many of the courts and text-writers who stand for the doctrine [that declarations against penal interest are inadmissible] have felt called upon to apologize for their position, or, if not to apologize, to undertake to explain to the lay mind that, although a contrary doctrine would appear to be demanded by common sense and natural justice, nevertheless a trained professional eye could see the matter in a different light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In <em>Newberry v Commonwealth, </em>191 Va 445; 61 SE2d 318 (1950), the same Court held that a third person\u2019s written confession was properly admitted where he claimed his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The Supreme Court of California, in <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>Spriggs, </em>60 Cal 2d 868; 36 Cal Rptr 841; 389 P2d 377, 381 (1964), held admissible statements of defendant\u2019s companion that the heroin found by police was hers. The Court found declarations against penal interest \"no less trustworthy\u201d than declarations against pecuniary or proprietary interest: \"A person\u2019s interest against being criminally implicated gives reasonable assurance of the veracity of his statement made against that interest\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Additionally, the California Court stated that traditional analysis could be relied on to admit declarations against penal interest since conviction of a crime \"ordinarily entails economic loss\u201d.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The Supreme Court of Hawaii in <em>State v Leong, </em>51 Hawaii 581, 587; 465 P2d 560, 564 (1970), citing <em>People v Spriggs, supra, </em>agreed that there is \"no sound basis\u201d for excluding declarations against penal interest. They are \"no less trustworthy\u201d than other declarations against interest and the potential criminal liability \"will act as a stimulus to telling the truth, or as a deterrent to falsification\u201d.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The New York Court of Appeals, in adopting \"a more rational view of admissibility of declarations against interest\u201d, stated that \"the distinction which would authorize a court to receive proof that a man admitted he never had title to an Elgin watch, but not to receive proof that he had admitted striking Jones over the head with a club, assuming equal relevancy of both statements, does not readily withstand analysis\u201d.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">The Supreme Court of Missouri in 1945 adopted the view that declarations against penal as well as proprietary or pecuniary interest were admissible. In <em>Sutter v Easterly, </em>354 Mo 282, 296; 189 SW2d 284, 290 (1945), the Court, persuaded by Wigmore\u2019s analysis, refused to blindly \"adher[e] to the illogical English rule [the <em>Sussex Peerage Case]\u201d.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Similarly, the Supreme Courts of Idaho<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and Illinois,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the Maryland Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and appellate courts of Arizona,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Texas,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Jersey<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> have held hearsay declarations against penal interest admissible in particular circumstances.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The cases generally offer no reasoned justification for excluding declarations against penal interest beyond the simple statement that they are hearsay. It has been suggested that the underlying rationale is fear that the admission of such evidence would encourage fabrication.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>No one today would contend that because a criminal defendant has a lot \"at stake\u201d there is a risk of fabrication and he cannot take the stand or, before he can testify, a judge must first determine his credibility. We leave to the trier of fact whether to believe the defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Yet the same justification \u2014 the motive of the defendant to present false evidence to avoid conviction \u2014 is suggested as an appropriate reason for excluding exculpatory evidence and for allowing judges to rule on the credibility of defense witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In ruling on the admissibility of evidence, a judge does not make a preliminary determination regarding the truth or falsity of the proffered evidence or the weight the trier of fact should accord it.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The Supreme Courts of California<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and Hawaii,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the New York Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> in holding declarations against penal interest admissible, declared that credibility is for the trier of fact and is not an appropriate consideration where the question concerns the admissibility of evidence. The Virginia Court recognized that witnesses may lie and alleged confessions may \"be foisted on the courts and juries, but so may alleged admissions in civil cases, as, for example, regarding the location of a corner tree or other real estate controversy. As to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>both classes of admissions they must be admitted, if at all, because the evidence itself is important to the ends of justice, and because it may be assumed that no man will speak falsely to his own hurt. The truth of the admission itself, and the credibility of the witness who undertakes to repeat the admission, must, like the truthfulness of all other testimony, address itself to and be settled by the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Wigmore similarly rejects the \"possibility-of-procuring-fabricated-testimony\u201d argument, stating that it \"would be a good argument against admitting any witnesses at all, for it is notorious that some witnesses will lie and that it is difficult to avoid being deceived by their lies.\u201d He concludes that \"any rule which hampers an honest man in exonerating himself is a bad rule, even if it also hampers a villain in falsely passing for an innocent\u201d.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence, proposed that an exception to the hearsay rule be recognized for declarations against penal as well as pecuniary or proprietary interest. The committee noted that \"[qjuestions of possible fabrication are better trusted to the competence of juries than made the subject of attempted treatment by rule\u201d. Preliminary Draft of Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States District Courts and Magistrates (March, 1969), p 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The recommendation was not accepted. The rule which was enacted recognizes an exception to the hearsay rule for declarations against penal interest, but where such declarations are offered to exculpate the accused they are not admissible \"unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement\u201d.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The nature of the \"corroborating circumstances\u201d which would \"clearly indicate the trustworthiness\u201d of a declaration against penal interest is neither defined in the rules nor discussed in the notes.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> It appears from the editorial comments to the rules, however, that an important factor in the decision to require corroboration where defendants seek to introduce exculpatory declarations against penal interest was the fear of fabricated evidence, both perjured testimony by witnesses and false confessions of crime by declarants.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We are of the opinion that the circumstances surrounding the making or reporting of a third-party statement, whether \"assuring reliability\u201d, \"indicating trustworthiness\u201d, or \"rendering totally incredible\u201d, go to the weight to be given the testimony, not its admissibility. For a judge to exclude evidence because he does not believe it has been described as \"altogether atypical, extraordinary * * * <em>.\u201d'</em><footnotemark><em>42</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\"[0]ur adversary system reposes judgment of the credibility of all witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>in the jury.\u201d <em>Brooks v Tennessee, </em>406 US 605, 611; 92 S Ct 1891; 32 L Ed 2d 358 (1972). Cross-examination of the witness, penalties for perjury, and the good sense of the trier of fact to whom all other questions of possible fabrication are entrusted are adequate safeguards against false testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We reject the apparent double standard<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> of the compromise that a preliminary showing of trustworthiness is required only where the defendant offers a declaration against penal interest to exculpate himself. Such a rule is based on an assumption that criminal defendants are more likely to use perjured testimony. We refuse to predicate a rule of law upon such an assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>We parenthetically note that King\u2019s testimony tended to \"corroborate\u201d the excluded hearsay statement. If it be said that before the trial she gave an inconsistent statement (fn 6), so had Napora (fn 2), the principal witness for the people; it is for the jury as trier of fact to decide which of two impeached witnesses to believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Because we hold that a declaration against penal interest is admissible as a common-law exception to the hearsay rule, it is not necessary to address the constitutional question presented in this case. See <em>Chambers v </em>Mississippi, 410 US 284; 93 S Ct 1038; 35 L Ed 2d 297 (1973), where the United States Supreme Court held that under certain circumstances exclusion of hearsay testimony critical to the defense may constitute a denial of due process.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> See also <em>Commonwealth v Nash, </em>457 Pa 296; 324 A2d 344 (1974), where the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that under certain circumstances declarations against penal interest which tend to exculpate the defendant are admissible as part of the due-process right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b666-4\">Kavanagh, C.

Stevens and a friend, Harold Napora, had been looking for women. They met a man identified as Edwards who offered to get them one. He returned with Betty King who refused employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Betty King made a statement before trial.

She testified that Chester Blake had paid her to lie in the pretrial statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">During the investigation, Betty King had identified a picture of Ernest Edwards as being the man who shot Stevens. She now testified that the police had badgered her into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Although Blake died before the preliminary examination, she did not identify him then because they were very close, she said. Earlier, however, she had said she did not \"know Chester Junior, really, well, you know\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Defendant was apprehended and identified by Napora during a lineup. Edwards then made a statement. He said that after Betty King refused the two men, Stevens started cursing:</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">\"And so \u2014 I don\u2019t know. When he was going to get out of the truck, I pulled the gun out. I didn\u2019t point it at him. When he got back in, he had his hand in his sweater pocket, in his left sweater pocket, and I pointed the gun at him then and that\u2019s when the truck started to pull off and Betty, she hit my hand, tried to grab the gun out of my hand to stop me from shooting and the gun went off and it scared me and I shot again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Edwards said he got the gun from Irvin Johnson, who had bought it from Chester Blake.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">However, during the trial, defendant testified and denied shooting Stevens. He then said that after leaving Napora and Stevens, he had bought the pistol not from Irvin Johnson, but from Chester Blake. He said the pretrial statement was a confused attempt to avoid prosecution for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Howard Edwards, defendant\u2019s brother, said he was in Skip\u2019s Crap House on April 23rd. He said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Chester Blake came in about the time the shooting occurred and pawned a gun to Ernest for $10. Howard and Irvin Johnson said Blake had first tried to sell the pistol to Johnson. The gun had by this time been identified as the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The next defense witness, John Longuemire, said he was \"pretty close\u201d to and a \"very good friend\u201d of Chester Blake, who had died before the Edwards\u2019 trial. He also knew defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">John Longuemire had been in the jail where defendant was awaiting trial. They talked about the murder, he said. Although Chester Blake had supposedly confessed his guilt to Longuemire,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it was not reported to the police or mentioned to the defendant until Blake was dead. Longuemire supposedly wrote a statement at defendant\u2019s request while they were in jail, but this statement was never given to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Longuemire\u2019s uncorroborated<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> testimony about Blake\u2019s alleged confession was properly rejected as hearsay and becomes the principal issue in controversy. All of the other testimony was admitted for jury consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">It is agreed that declarations against penal interest may be admitted despite being hearsay. However, Justice Levin fashions Wigmore\u2019s position opposing the automatic exclusion of those statements into a rule requiring admission of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>such statements. The testimony should neither be rejected nor admitted indiscriminately. Statements against penal interest should be admitted if two criteria suggested by Wigmore are met: \"first, a necessity for resorting to hearsay * * * and, secondly, a circumstantial probability of trustworthiness\u201d, such as corroboration. 5 Wigmore, \u00a7 1455, p 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Under this test, there was no error in rejecting John Longuemire\u2019s testimony concerning the alleged confession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was no corroboration of the confession. There was no showing that the circumstances of the confession made it trustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The defense was that Chester Blake had shot Stevens. Blake was not identified as the murderer until after he was dead. Defendant had made a confession which he denied at trial. Betty King changed her testimony after the preliminary examination and pretrial statement to incriminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the deceased Blake. Defendant\u2019s brother and a friend (who was in jail with d\u00e9fendant) testified that Blake sold the pistol to defendant at a time shortly after the shooting. (Defendant earlier had said that he obtained it from Irvin Johnson who had bought it from Chester Blake.) This testimony was admitted into evidence and argued to the jury as proof of defendant\u2019s innocence. The jury weighed this testimony and found it wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">As to Longuemire\u2019s testimony, the defense did not support the authenticity of Blake\u2019s alleged confession.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is not a case where circumstances require that the statement be admitted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We do not have a written confession or a situation where the authorities obtained contradictory confessions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I did not find the \"circumstantial possibility of trustworthiness\u201d for admission of the testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">It must be stressed that defendant had a fair trial.

GCR 1963, 601 says \"rules of evidence shall be according to the common law except as modified by statute or court rule\u201d. In <em>People v Sartori, </em>168 Mich 308; 134 NW 200 (1912), a defense witness had discussed the murder with a man named Sacciucci. This included talk about who did the killing:</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">\"He was then asked for the conversation, which was objected to as hearsay, and the objection was sustained. The ruling was correct. Whether Sacciucci would have answered that he saw some one else commit the murder, or whether, as the record indicates was expected, he would say that Sacciucci told him that he himself committed the murder would be alike hearsay. The acts of Sacciucci having some relation to the crime and tending to show that he committed it instead of Sartori were competent and were admitted; his declarations, statements, and admissions not part of the <em>res gestae </em>were not competent.\u201d Sacciucci had apparently left the country and was unavailable. <em>Also see People v Stevens, </em>47 Mich 411; 11 NW 220 (1882) (one defendant\u2019s confession hearsay as to the other defendant), <em>People v Aikin, </em>66 Mich 460; 33 NW 821 (1887) (statements of deceased victim hearsay), <em>People v Fritch, </em>170 Mich 258; 136 NW 493 (1912) (statement of deceased victim hearsay) and <em>People v Cutler, </em>197 Mich 6; 163 NW 493 (1917) (statements of deceased victim hearsay but harmless as it strengthened defendant\u2019s case).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\"> Compare <em>Sutter v Easterly, </em>354 Mo 282; 189 SW 2d 284 (1945).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b670-10\"> Compare <em>People v Lettrich, </em>413 Ill 172; 108 NE 2d 488 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b670-11\"> Compare <em>Thomas v State, </em>186 Md 446; 47 A2d 43 (1946).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b670-12\"> See <em>Deike v Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, </em>3 Ariz App 430; 415 P2d 145 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
