J., and Williams and Levin, JJ., dissenting as follows:</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b903-9\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_i\">I dissent from the order, because it is, or appears to be, a decision on the merits, and this Court has not had adequate time to deliberate on the merits of the case.</p>\n<author id=\"b903-10\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIv\">This Court granted an interlocutory appeal to decide whether a criminal prosecution may be brought against a person committed as a criminal sexual psychopath and released 19 years later because the statute was declared unconstitutional. That question may be dispositive of this case and should be resolved before it proceeds to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">Our order granting leave to appeal limited consideration to the issues raised by defendant-appellant in his application. After the application was filed, in <em>Breed v Jones, </em>421 US 519; 95 S Ct 1779; 44 L Ed 2d 346 (1975), the United States Supreme Court held that criminal prosecution of a person for conduct for which a juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>court adjudicatory hearing had been held violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. This case, where defendant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct was the basis for his commitment under the criminal sexual psychopath statute, appears analogous.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b904-5\"><em>Frank J. Kelley, </em>Attorney General, <em>Robert A. Derengoski, </em>Solicitor General, <em>Donald A. Burge, </em>Prosecuting Attorney, <em>Stephen M. Wheeler, </em>Chief of Appellate Division, for the people. <em>Robert A. Burt </em>and <em>Francis A. Allen </em>for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b904-3\">It is now over 22 years since the crime was committed. We should dispose of questions whether the people may proceed at all before requiring the defendant to litigate and the trial court to resolve issues that may not be dispositive.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b904-4\">Kavanagh, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aca\">I dissent for the reasons stated by my Brothers Williams and Levin. I also dissent because one of the issues raised on appeal is whether the defendant and the people should be put to the expense and trouble of a criminal trial after 18 years. This order resolves that issue without specifying any reason for so doing, contrary to the mandate of \u00a7 6 of Article 6, Constitution 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"ABFv\">Reported below: 57 Mich App 556.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
