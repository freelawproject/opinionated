The production and distribution of child pornography produce harms to children of such intensity as to become compelling concerns of the State. <em>(Finlay v Finlay, </em>240 NY 429.) II. Article XVII of the New York Constitution mandates the protection of sexually exploited children from the harms of distribution of child pornography. <em>(Matter of Sanjivini K., </em>40 NY2d 1025; <em>Matter of Storar, </em>52 NY2d 363; <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>40 NY2d 543; <em>People v Ewer, </em>141 NY 129; <em>Sinhogar v Parry, </em>53 NY2d 424; <em>Matter of Bates v Toia, </em>45 NY2d 460; <em>Bartels v County of Westchester, </em>76 AD2d 517; <em>Matter of Lee v Smith, </em>43 NY2d 453; <em>Tucker v Toia, </em>43 NY2d 1; <em>Matter of Bernstein v Toia, </em>43 NY2d 437.) III. The State Constitution\u2019s protection of \u201cliberty of speech\u201d has no application to the statute in question, which is a proper exercise of the State\u2019s paternal power on behalf of sexually exploited children. <em>(Pathe Exch. v Cobb, </em>202 App Div 450, 236 NY 539; <em>Board of Educ. v Nyquist, </em>57 NY2d 27; <em>Matter of United Press Assns. v Valente, </em>308 NY 71; <em>Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v Leggett, </em>48 NY2d 430; <em>Richmond Newspapers v Virginia, </em>448 US 555; <em>People v Street, </em>20 NY2d 231; <em>Ali v Playgirl, Inc., </em>447 F Supp 723; <em>Chaplinsky v New Hampshire, </em>315 US 568; <em>Bookcase, Inc. v Broderick, </em>18 NY2d 71, app dsmd <em>sub nom.

This court should hold that section 263.15 of the Penal Law violates section 8 of article I of the New York State Constitution. <em>(Chaplin-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>sky v New Hampshire, </em>315 US 568; <em>People v Elwell, </em>50 NY2d 231; <em>Cooper v Morin, </em>49 NY2d 69, cert den <em>sub nom.

Bank of Boston v Bellotti, </em>435 US 765.) II. Alternatively, section 263.15 of the Penal Law should be construed and limited so as to reach only materials lacking serious literary, artistic, educational, scientific, medical or other similar value. <em>(Miller v California, </em>413 US 15.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b301-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b301-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The United States Supreme Court has remanded this case for our reconsideration. That court held, for the first time, that a State is not prohibited under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution from proscribing certain nonobscene sexual depictions of children. The Supreme Court has also indicated that such a law may be upheld unless it reaches impermissible applications <em>(New York v Ferber, </em>458 US_, 102 S Ct 3348, 3362). The only question remaining in this case is whether the defendant\u2019s rights under this State\u2019s Constitution were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The protection afforded by the State constitutional right of free expression (NY Const, art I, \u00a7 8) is as broad as that provided by the First Amendment and, as the Supreme Court has noted, may in fact provide greater protection <em>(PruneYard Shopping Center v Robins, </em>447 US 74). However, the type of performance prohibited by the statute, which was the subject of this prosecution, is not entitled to that greater protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Thus we conclude that the statute (Penal Law, \u00a7 263.15), as applied to this case does not violate the right of freedom of expression guaranteed by the State Constitution. We decline the invitation of the appellant and the <em>amici </em>to address or to anticipate questions as to the constitutionality of the statute as applied to other factual situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Meyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB9\">(concurring). While I agree that the statute as applied to the instant case does not violate the State Constitution, I would as a matter of State constitutional law recognize an affirmative defense for literary, scientific, educational, governmental or other similar justification, paralleling that now set forth in subdivision 1 of section 235.15 of the Penal Law. Each of the four Supreme Court opinions warns that the statute will have some unconstitutional applications <em>(New York v Ferber, </em>458 US , \u2014, \u2014, _, _, 102 S Ct 3348, 3363, 3364, 3365, 3366, 3367). In my view, without such a defense, the chilling effect of section 263.15 of the Penal Law upon serious depictions which do not actually threaten the harms addressed by that statute will cause greater harm to this State\u2019s interest in free expression than is constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Judge Meyer concurs in a separate opinion in which Judge Fuchsberg also concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Upon reargument, following remand by the United States Supreme Court, order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
