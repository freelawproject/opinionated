In particular, we are called upon to treat with article VI (\u00a7 12, subd d) of our State Constitution and SCPA 201 (subds 1, 3) and SCPA 202. At issue too is the impact, if any, of RPAPL 701 on the power of the Surrogate\u2019s Court to entertain a dispute over the possession of real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The three cases arise out of the administration of a parcel of improved realty held by Jean M. Piccione and Bernard Grossman as executors of the estate of Nicholas Piccione. When the executors received the property it was burdened by a lease which the decedent in his lifetime had entered into with All Craft Metals, Inc. (ACM), which later had assigned the lease to Fire Burglary Instruments, Inc. (FBI), and its subsidiary, All Craft Finishing, Inc. (ACF).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Shortly before the lease by its terms was to expire, the executors, to facilitate the winding up of the estate, entered into what they regarded as an advantageous contract for the sale of the property to a third party. The sale, conditioned on the awaited vacating of the premises, was set for a date subsequent to the one on which the lease was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>to terminate. However, though the executors wrote the tenants to remind them that they would be expected to leave at the expiration date, when the time to do so arrived, the tenants found it more convenient not to do so. After many weeks of unsuccessful efforts to get their tenants to depart, the executors brought a summary proceeding in the District Court of Nassau County to recover possession. The petition was dismissed when the court held that the letter in which they attempted to notify the tenants of their intention to terminate the lease was technically deficient (Real Property Law, \u00a7 232-b).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">At this juncture, the executors, apprehensive over a matured mortgage on the premises and the imminent exercise of the purchaser\u2019s right to cancel, brought on a proceeding in Surrogate\u2019s Court, Nassau County, to direct FBI and ACI to \u201cvacate and surrender the premises\u201d. The main thrust of the tenants\u2019 opposition, premised on the fact that the Surrogate\u2019s Court is not one of the courts mentioned in RPAPL 701 (subd l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was that the court was without subject matter jurisdiction. But the Surrogate, of the view that the proceeding \u201crelate[d] to the affairs of a decedent\u201d, concluded that the breadth of the constitutional delineation of his court\u2019s jurisdiction rendered its nonlisting in section 701 a matter of \u201cno consequence\u201d. Reaching the merits, he ordered the tenants to vacate the premises (106 Misc 2d 898, 902). For its part, the Appellate Division joined in the Surrogate\u2019s rejection of the tenants\u2019 section 701 argument, but, citing to <em>Matter of Lainez </em>(79 AD2d 78, 80, affd 55 NY2d 657), ruled the proceeding an \u201cindependent controversy * * * outside of the subject matter jurisdiction of the Surrogate\u2019s Court\u201d. Accordingly, it reversed on the law and dismissed the proceeding (85 AD2d 604, 605). The executors now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Soon after they repossessed the property, the executors commenced a second Surrogate\u2019s Court proceeding against FBI, ACF \u201cand/or Data Control Systems, Inc\u201d (Data), the last a guarantor of ACM\u2019s obligations under the lease. Entitled \u201cpetition to recover .assets of the estate\u201d, and treated by the Surrogate as a discovery proceeding brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>under SCPA 2103, its prayer demanded damages because the executors (1) had been \u201cforced to renegotiate the mortgage at a higher interest rate in order to prevent foreclosure\u201d, (2) during the holdover period advanced real estate and school taxes payable by ACF under the lease, (3) incurred expenses to repair damage to the premises and replace fixtures and equipment, each the responsibility of the tenants, and (4) incurred consequent legal fees and court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In their answer, FBI and ACF, aside from denying the executor\u2019s material allegations, again challenged subject matter jurisdiction. Data, arguing that its guarantee was not in effect after the expiration of the original lease, moved to dismiss. ACM, who had not been joined as a party, moved to intervene in order to move for summary judgment on a proposed counterclaim and cross claim for return of the security deposited when it executed the original lease, entitlement to which ACF was laying claim. Except to grant ACM\u2019s motion, the applications were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In the same decision, the Surrogate\u2019s Court rejected FBI and ACF\u2019s jurisdictional attack. Relying in the main on a 1966 report of the Temporary State Commission on Modernization, Revision and Simplification of Law of Estates,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Surrogate ruled that constitutional and legislative expansion of Surrogate\u2019s Court jurisdiction since 1962 sanctioned a Surrogate\u2019s Court proceeding for \u201cdamages arising out of a contract to lease real property, which later becomes an asset of the decedent\u2019s estate\u201d (108 Misc 2d 255, 258). With this the Appellate Division took issue. Opining that section 2103\u2019s reference to \u201cmoney or other personal property or the proceeds or value thereof\u201d now embraces such property as \u201ca fund of indeterminate amount (see, e.g., <em>Matter of Young, </em>80 Misc 2d 937), a determinate amount of money transferred by a decedent as the result of fraud or undue influence (see <em>Matter of Reiner, </em>86 Misc 2d 511) and rents and profits already collected where * * * ownership of the demised premises [is contested] (see <em>Matter of Hall, </em>54 Misc 2d 923)\u201d is within the reach of such a discovery proceeding, it thought the line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>should be drawn at \u201ccontingent, unliquidated damages resulting from tortious acts or breaches of contract\u201d. Finding that the executors\u2019 claim fell within the latter class, and citing again to <em>Matter of Lainez (supra), </em>it reversed on the law and dismissed in this case too (85 AD2d, <em>supra, </em>at pp 605, 606). From the order entered on this decision, the executors take their second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The third case in this trilogy finds the litigants exchanging roles. This time the tenants, FBI and ACF, were the suitors and the executors defendants. Alleging that the prosecution of the eviction proceeding was malicious and an abuse of process, the plaintiffs lodged their action in Supreme Court. On motion of the executors, that court removed the action to the Surrogate\u2019s Court. In so ordering, the Supreme Court stated that, while \u201c[a] suit for malicious prosecution or other tortious act of an executor is against the executor in his individual rather than representative capacity\u201d and that \u201ca substantial relationship between this matter and the affairs of a decedent\u201d in the end might not be found, it was not prepared to say that the conduct on which the complaint was based was not in furtherance of the administration of the decedent\u2019s estate. But the Appellate Division, still citing to <em>Matter of Lainez (supra), </em>reversed, this time because \u201c[t]his action is an independent matter involving living persons\u201d <em>(Fire Burglary Instruments v Piccione, </em>85 AD2d 594). The executors now appeal to this court by leave of the Appellate Division, which certified the following question \u201cWas the order of this court dated December 7, 1981, properly made?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">This as background, we first observe that at this stage we cannot reach the merits of the second appeal, i.e., the one from the order dismissing the discovery proceeding. ACM\u2019s counterclaim and cross claim, which are still pending, relate to the transaction encompassed by the order dismissing the petition. In consequence, the appeal is from an order which does not determine the proceeding within the meaning of the State Constitution (see NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 3). It follows that this appeal must be dismissed. (See <em>Lizza Inds. v. Long Is. Light. Co., </em>36 NY2d 754; <em>Walker v Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>36 NY2d 695; <em>Behren v Papworth, </em>30 NY2d 532; Cohen and Karger, Powers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the New York Court of Appeals [rev ed], pp 81, 84-93; cf. <em>Ratka v St. Francis Hosp., </em>44 NY2d 604, 609.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Concentrating then on the other two appeals, it is self-evident that their determination requires definition of the subject matter jurisdiction of the Surrogate\u2019s Court. Since September 1, 1962, this is grounded on article VI (\u00a7 12, subd d) of our State Constitution, which provides: \u201cThe surrogate\u2019s court shall have jurisdiction over all actions and proceedings relating to the affairs of decedents * * * administration of estates and actions and proceedings arising thereunder * * * and such other actions and proceedings, not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the supreme court, as may be provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Broad as this mandate is on its very face, to appreciate its full extent its antecedents and sequellae must be examined. When they are, it becomes apparent that the history of the Surrogate\u2019s Court during the twentieth century is one of steadily expanding jurisdiction (see, generally, 1 Warren\u2019s Heaton, Surrogates\u2019 Courts [6th ed], \u00a7 2, par 2, p 1-13). In essence, for a long time, its sole source of power was legislative. For the words by which the court\u2019s existence was enshrined in the Constitution of 1894 and so continued without change until 1962<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 \u201csurrogates\u2019 courts shall have the jurisdiction, legal and equitable, and powers now established by law until otherwise provided by the legislature\u201d \u2014 left it completely at the mercy of statutory enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">In actual practice, however, the legislative course was to repeatedly enlarge the Surrogate\u2019s power (see, e.g., L 1934, ch 352, granting the Surrogate\u2019s Court discretion to transfer actions to the Supreme Court for trial; L 1934, ch 539, adding Surrogate\u2019s Court Act, \u00a7 206-a, which greatly enlarged their former power to entertain discovery proceedings and direct payment of proceedings thereof; L 1937, ch 687, granting power over accounting of common trust funds). Of special significance for the point we make was section 40 of the former Surrogate\u2019s Court Act, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>conferred wide powers over claims that were merely incidental to those which the statutes had expressly committed to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">It was with section 40 before him that Chief Judge Cardozo, writing for a unanimous Bench, was prompted to indorse literal construction of the powers of the Surrogate\u2019s Court because \u201c \u2018[concentration of jurisdiction as to decedents\u2019 estates\u2019 * * * is the purpose clearly revealed in the statutory scheme\u201d <em>(Matter of Raymond v Estate of Davis, </em>248 NY 67, 72, quoting from <em>Matter of Haigh, </em>125 Misc 365, 368). This makes it more than noteworthy that section 40 endowed Surrogates with-authority \u201cto try and determine all questions, legal or equitable, arising between any or all of the parties to any proceeding, or * * * to be determined in order to make a full, equitable and complete disposition of the matter by such order or decree as justice requires\u201d. Moreover, the 1962 constitutional amendment was preceded by a report of the Tweed Commission urging the Legislature to minimize unnecessary shuttling from one court to another (McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, 1956, Temporary Commission on the Courts, 1956 Report, p 1405).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">All this culminated in the 1962 amendment, the obvious effect of which, among other things, was to secure the advances in Surrogate\u2019s Court jurisdiction over matters \u201crelating to\u201d the affairs of decedents against the possibility of legislative withdrawal. Absent the need for specific statutory authorization for a particular proceeding, the emphasis now shifted so that, \u201c \u2018for the Surrogate\u2019s Court to decline jurisdiction, it should be abundantly clear that the matter in controversy in no way affects the affairs of a decedent or the administration of his estate\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Young, </em>80 Misc 2d 937, 939 [Midonick, S.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Nevertheless it is suggested that the final clause of article VI (\u00a7 12, subd d) \u2014 \u201cas may be provided by law\u201d \u2014 be read to modify subdivision d in its entirety. If such a construction were correct, there would have been no reason for the framers of the amendment to specify two types of actions and proceedings, i.e., \u201cthose relating to the affairs of decedents\u201d and those \u201carising thereunder or pertaining\u201d to the \u201cadministration of estates\u201d, as being within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>jurisdiction of the Surrogate\u2019s Court, in addition to \u201csuch other actions and proceedings ** * * as may be provided by law\u201d. Indeed, there would have been no necessity to amend the Constitution at all. In short, the Constitution itself conferred absolute and unconditional jurisdiction over specified subject matter and also authorized the Legislature to confer additional authority by statute. This, as we know, the Surrogate\u2019s Court Procedure Act later did by enacting SCPA 201 (subds 1, 3) and SCPA 202.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Professor Siegel, in his Practice Commentary on SCPA 201 (subd 1) tells us, \u201cIn its listing of the specific categories of subject matter jurisdiction, section 12(d) appears to be self-executing; that is, it confers the listed items of jurisdiction itself and contemplates that no statute would be needed to aid it\u201d (Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 58A, SCPA 201, at p 43).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Nor properly read, is our decision in <em>Matter of Lainez </em>(55 NY2d 657, <em>supra), </em>to the contrary. The issue presented by <em>Lainez </em>was a limited one, i.e., whether the Surrogate\u2019s Court had jurisdiction over a dispute between a distributee of the decedent and a creditor of the distributee when resolution of the controversy would have no effect upon the estate itself. In reversing the order of the Surrogate\u2019s Court, the Appellate Division expressly limited its opinion to the facts of the case before it, and then merely held that no jurisdiction existed because \u201cthe power of the Surrogate\u2019s Court relates to matters affecting estates of decedents and not to independent matters involving controver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>sies between living persons\u201d (79 AD2d, at p 80). Because of the express limitations in the opinion, it is clear that <em>Lainez </em>stands only for the proposition, already well established by prior case law, that \u201cthe Surrogate\u2019s Court has no jurisdiction over a claim by a creditor against a distributee or legatee of an estate * * * absent a showing that the distributee assigned his share to the creditor\u201d (79 AD2d, at pp 80-81; accord <em>Matter of Jemzura, </em>65 AD2d 656, affd 52 NY2d 1067).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Applying these principles to the eviction matter, it would seem to follow that such a proceeding, brought by the executors in the process of attempting to wind up the administration of the estate, is cognizable in the Surrogate\u2019s Court. It is undisputed that the tenants were to be evicted so that the premises could be sold. It is further not denied that the proceeds of the sale were to go to the estate and no doubt it will be the Surrogate\u2019s Court which will ultimately decide how these will be distributed. Thus, it can hardly be said that this controversy \u201cin no way affects the affairs of the decedent or the administration of the estate\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Despite all of this, it nevertheless is contended that RPAPL 701 operates to divest the Surrogate\u2019s Court of jurisdiction. True it is that the Surrogate\u2019s Court is not a forum denominated in the statute. But it is clear from the legislative history that the courts which were identified were not intended to enjoy exclusive jurisdiction (Fourth Preliminary Report of Advisory Committee on Practice and Procedure, NY Legis Doc, 1960, No. 20, p 541). As with the Supreme Court, which, though also unlisted, may nonetheless look to the Constitution as an independent source of authority, so may the Surrogate\u2019s Court, procedurally unlimited as it is in its constitutional authority in matters \u201crelating to the affairs of decedents\u201d. And, since the main reasons for listing courts in RPAPL 701 was to encourage the bringing of such actions in lower courts (see, e.g., <em>Matter of 3505 Realty Corp. v Weinberger, </em>41 Misc 2d 254), it would be counterproductive to interpret it as to intend the fragmentation of the treatment of the affairs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>a decedent\u2019s estate (cf. <em>Lun Far Co. v Aylesbury Assoc., </em>40 AD2d 794). Fundamentally, of course, statutes are not to be interpreted to curtail constitutionally based jurisdiction <em>(People ex rel. Mayor of City of N. Y. v Nichols, </em>79 NY 582, 590).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Now reaching the action for malicious prosecution and abuse of process, each a tort involving the commission of an act which is motivated by an improper purpose (see <em>Board of Educ. v Farmingdale Classroom Teachers Assn., </em>38 NY2d 397, 400; Prosser, Torts [4th ed], \u00a7\u00a7 119,121), it is a long-established general principle that an executor who has committed such an act, even in the course of the administration of the estate, is liable therefor in an individual rather than representative capacity (see <em>Kirchner v Muller, </em>280 NY 23; see, generally, Estate\u2019s Liability for Tort of Executor, Ann., 82 ALR3d 892, 950-952). Therefore, unlike the eviction proceeding, at least in the present context, it cannot be said to relate to either the affairs of the decedent or the administration of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">For all these reasons, in Matter of Piccione (All Craft Finishing, Inc., and Fire Burglary Instruments, Inc., respondents), the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the order of the Surrogate\u2019s Court, Nassau County, reinstated; in Matter of Piccione (All Craft Finishing, Inc., and Fire Burglary Instruments, Inc., respondents; All Craft Metals Co., Inc., and Data Control Systems, Inc., appellants), the appeal should be dismissed and, in Fire Burglary Instruments v Piccione, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler and Meyer concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">In <em>Matter of Piccione </em>in the first above-entitled matter: Order reversed, with costs, and the order of Surrogate\u2019s Court, Nassau County, reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">In <em>Matter of Piccione </em>in the second above-entitled matter: Appeal dismissed, without costs, upon the ground that the order appealed from does not finally determine the proceeding within the meaning of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>In <em>Fire Burglary Instruments v Piccione: </em>Order affirmed, with costs. Question certified answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\">.
