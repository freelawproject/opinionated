Appellant\u2019s sentence of restitution, which does not set the amount and manner of payment and improperly delegates authority to do so, is violative of section 65.10 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the Penal Law. <em>(People v Lofton, 78 </em>Misc 2d 202; <em>People v Greene, </em>36 AD2d 826; <em>People v Marx, </em>19 AD2d 577; <em>People v Julye, </em>64 AD2d 614; <em>Matter of Feldman v Reeves, </em>45 AD2d 90; <em>People v Turner, </em>27 AD2d 141; <em>People v Oskroba, </em>305 NY 113; <em>People ex rel.

The sentencing court\u2019s pronouncement of the terms of the sentence need not be reviewed by this court as the rights of the parties will be unaffected by the relief sought. In any event, Justice Lang substantially complied with the statutory requirement that appellant be notified of the amount and manner of restitution. <em>(People ex rel. Benacquista v Blanchard, </em>267 App Div 663; <em>People ex rel. Perry v Cassidy, </em>43 Misc 2d 189, 23 AD2d 706.) II. The prearrest period was not unduly long and fully comported with due process requirements. <em>(People v Taranovich, </em>37 NY2d 442; <em>United States v Lovasco, </em>431 US 783; <em>United States v Marion, </em>404 US 307; <em>People v Bryant, </em>65 AD2d 333; <em>People v Singer, </em>44 NY2d 241; <em>People v Pollaci, </em>68 AD2d 71; <em>People v Masselli, </em>13 NY2d 1; <em>People v Scott, </em>56 AD2d 667; <em>People v Sylvester, </em>29 AD2d 985; <em>People v Lugo, </em>67 AD2d 1010.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b196-7\">Fuchsberg, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">This appeal, here by leave of a Judge of this court, presents us with our first opportunity to construe Penal Law sections authorizing the imposition of \u201crestitution\u201d or \u201creparation\u201d as part of a sentence (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 60.27, 65.10, subd 2, par [g]). As recently amended, these stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>utes, among other things, reflect both a more flexible penological approach and a heightened awareness of the \u201cconcerns and needs of the victims of crime\u201d (Hechtman, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law, \u00a7 60.27). In particular, we are asked to decide whether, under the statutory scheme, a sentencing court, broad as its discretion to mold an appropriate disposition otherwise may be, is free to delegate the power to fix the conditions of such restitution or reparation to the Probation Department. We now hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">A second question raised is whether, under the facts and circumstances in this case, a 21-month lapse of time between the discovery of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct and the time of her arrest violated her due process right to prompt prosecution. We find this issue to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Upon her plea of guilty, the defendant, Patricia Fuller, stands convicted of grand larceny in the second degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 155.35). This stemmed from her unlawful receipt, from September, 1973 to December, 1975, of $5,994 in public assistance moneys, in violation of section 145 of the Social Services Law by concealing the fact that she then was gainfully employed. Her conduct first came to the attention of public authorities when it was discovered by the Social Services Department in December, 1975, but the department did not so inform the District Attorney until December, 1976 and she was not arrested until September 20, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">It was on this delay that the defendant predicated her due process claim, urging it initially on an unsuccessful pretrial motion. Her guilty plea followed. At the sentencing,' the trial court imposed a five-year term of probation and. directed the defendant to make restitution \u201cin the amount of her defalcation in a manner consistent with that to be set by the probation department\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In implementing this delegation, the department thereupon required the defendant to sign a confession of judgment in which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>acknowledged a debt of $7,611.82 to the Social Services Department of the City of New York. That sum, substantially in excess of the $5,994 covered by the indictment, was arrived at by including additional benefits received during the 15 months following the completion of the crime charged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">On these facts, turning first to her restitution point, we note, preliminarily, that defendant registered no objection, either at sentence, by way of postjudgment motion or even on her appeal to the Appellate Division, to the fact that the Probation Department rather than the sentencing court passed on the amount and manner in which the restitution requirement was to be satisfied. Failure to challenge a procedure at a time when a trial court still has an opportunity to take effective correction action as a general rule will forfeit the right of review by this court (CPL 470.05, subd <em>2; People v Drummond, </em>40 NY2d 990, cert den <em>sub nom. New York v Luis J., </em>431 US 908). But it has long been the law that the \u201cessential nature\u201d of the right to be sentenced as provided by law, though not formally raised at the trial level, preserves a departure therefrom for review in this court <em>(People v Craig, </em>295 NY 116, 120; <em>People v Bradner, </em>107 NY 1, 4-5; Cohen and Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals [rev ed], \u00a7 199, pp 750-751).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Proceeding then to substantive consideration of the legality of the delegation of the restitution element of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>defendant\u2019s sentence, we observe that the power of a court to order offenders to compensate the victims of their crimes is not new to the criminal justice system. Provision for a court to direct restitution may be found in our early probation statutes at least as far back as 1910 (Code Crim Pro, \u00a7 483, subd 2; \u00a7 932) and its use has long been advocated by a variety of standard-setting bodies (National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, Standards on Probation and Parole, \u00a7 5.4, subd 2; \u00a7 5.5, subd 3; Model Sentencing Act, \u00a7 9; National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws, Study Draft [1970], \u00a7 3302; American Bar Association, Projects on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Probation, \u00a7 3.2, subds [a], [c], par [viii]; ALI Model Penal Code, \u00a7 301.1, subd [2], par [h]; cf. <em>Bradford v United States, </em>228 US 446).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, though the unfortunate current prevalence of crime has drawn renewed and intensified attention to sentencing in general and compensation for crime victims in particular,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the latter has long been an integral part of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Consistent with these developments, New York\u2019s implementing statutes vest a great deal of discretion in the sentencing authority. They also make clear that a decision to direct a defendant to make \u201crestitution of the fruits of his offense or reparation for the loss or damage caused [by his criminal conduct]\u201d rests with it alone (Penal Law, \u00a7 60.27, subd 2; \u00a7 65.10, subd 2, par [g]).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Perhaps above all, it is manifest that the Legislature\u2019s intention was to keep the responsibility for dealing with this increasingly emphasized feature of sentencing in the hands of our Judges and no one else. Nowhere does it as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>much as mention any other agency in this regard. Rather, section 60.27\u2019s subdivision 1 specifically speaks of \u201cdiscretion\u201d of \u201cthe court\u201d alone, while its subdivision 2 emphatically advises that it is \u201cthe court\u201d which must make a \u201cfinding\u201d as to the \u201cfruits\u201d or \u201cdamage\u201d resulting from the offense and that it is likewise \u201cthe court\u201d which is to conduct any hearing thought necessary for this purpose. Moreover, the section\u2019s subdivision 5 in particular refers to the \u201camount of restitution or reparation\u201d required \u201cby the court\u201d. Similarly, section 65.10 is precise in providing that it is \u201cthe court\u201d which \u201cshall fix the amount [of restitution or reparation and] the manner of performance\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Consonantly, the Appellate Division, Second Department, the only New York court to have ruled on the issue, has held that the court\u2019s responsibility for performing these functions may not be delegated to the Probation Department <em>(People v Julye, </em>64 AD2d 614; <em>People v Thigpen, </em>60 AD2d 860).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Thigpen, </em>the court recognized that the amount and manner of restitution was not a perfunctory matter, but one which required nisi prius to make \u201cfindings of the sum actually due, with appropriate allowances made for offsets or other factors which could properly reduce the total amount\u201d. Hardly less can be necessary under a statutory scheme which not only calls for a determination of the \u201cfruits of [the] offense\u201d or \u201creparation, in an amount [the defendant] can afford to pay\u201d (Penal Law, \u00a7 65.10, subd 2, par [g]).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">This is not to say that the Probation Department may play no part in ascertaining the appropriate amount to be set. On the contrary, a court may call on it to act as a preliminary fact finder and submit its recommendations in a written report. Nevertheless, in the end it is for the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>which alone must impose the sentence, to decide how much of the report, if any, to adopt and how much to reject. Since, in the present case, the court deviated from this course, the sentence cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We now come to the defendant\u2019s second contention, that she was denied her due process right to prompt prosecution by the passage of the 21-month interval between the time that her crime had been completed and the time of her arrest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">It is beyond dispute that, although a District Attorney, in representing the State, is vested with broad discretion to \u201cinitiate, prosecute and discontinue\u201d criminal prosecutions <em>(People v Zimmer, </em>51 NY2d 390, 394, and authorities cited thereat), unexplained and unreasonable delay in commencing a prosecution may constitute a denial of due process entitling a defendant to dismissal <em>(People v Singer, </em>44 NY2d 241, 253-254). True, a suspect\u2019s primary protection against protracted delay in being brought to bar ordinarily is the Statute of Limitations, but delay in arresting or lodging charges over a lesser period of time may, in special circumstances, impair the right to a fair trial <em>(People v Singer, supra, </em>at p 252, citing to <em>United States v Lovasco, </em>431 US 783, and <em>United States v Marion, </em>404 US 307).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">However, no special circumstances have been shown here. A 21-month delay is well within the period prescribed by the Legislature for the commencement of a class D felony prosecution (CPL 30.10, subd 2, par [b]). Furthermore, 12 of these months were not attributable to the District Attorney, the case having first been reported to him by the Department of Social Services in late December, 1976, but nine months before the arrest took place. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the interim, social services personnel apparently were attempting to deal with the matter on a welfare level. Surely, notice to such an agency, whose societal concerns are so different from those of the police department and the District Attorney, need not be regarded as notice to the criminal justice system (cf. <em>People v Masselli, </em>13 NY2d 1 [Correction Department]). Finally, there was no convincing support for defendant\u2019s routine-like claim of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">For all these reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the case remitted to Supreme Court, New York County, for resentence in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler and Meyer concur; Judge Gabrielli taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">. The defendant was sentenced under section 65.10 (subd 2, par [f]) of the Penal Law, effective July 23, 1980, this subdivision was relettered as paragraph (g) of subdivision 2 and was amended to require the sentencing court to \u201cspecifically state the date when restitution is to be paid in full prior to the expiration of the sentence of probation\u201d (L 1980, ch 471, \u00a7 22).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">. We are informed that defendant\u2019s period of probation is now at an end. It might, therefore, be suggested that the issue of the legality of defendant\u2019s sentence is moot. The record before us does not permit us to resolve that question conclusively. But, even if, as a practical matter, the issues tendered indeed could be said to be moot, we nevertheless have retained the appeal. Whether the sentencing court is authorized to delegate the determination of the particulars of a restitutional sentence is not only of ongoing and accelerating importance to the criminal justice system, but is almost certain to affect a very large number of cases on a continuing basis <em>(Matter of Oliver v Postel, </em>30 NY2d 171, 177-178; cf. <em>Matter of Hearst Corp. v Clyne, </em>50 NY2d 707, 714-718).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\">. To be distinguished is <em>People v McGowen </em>(42 NY2d 905). There the alleged sentencing error was held not to be reviewable following the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and failure to object. Claimed was a failure by the court to exercise discretion provided in the statute with respect to potential youthful offenders (CPL 720.20, subd 1, par [a]). In the case before us now, on the other hand, the court exercised its discretion by ordering restitution as a part of the sentence, but exceeded the statutory limit on that discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>when it delegated the power to fix the terms and conditions to the Probation Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b199-9\">. California\u2019s Constitution recently was amended to assure that persons who \u201csuffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to restitution * * * Restitution shall be ordered * * * in every case, * * * unless compelling and extraordinary reasons exist to the contrary (Cal Const, art I, \u00a7 28, subd b; see <em>Broshahan v Brown, </em>32 Cal 3d 236).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b199-10\">. The Legislature has evidenced its concern in other ways as well. For example, it has established a Crime Victims Compensation Board to aid victims of crime (see Executive Law, \u00a7\u00a7 620-635; Comment, Compensation for Victims of Crimes of Violence, 31 Alb L Rev 120).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\">. Courts in other jurisdictions, in construing statutes similar to section 65.10 of the Penal Law, have expressly found that courts have no authority to delegate the responsibility for imposing conditions of probation or the terms of those conditions (see, e.g., <em>State ex rel. D.G.W., </em>70 NJ 488; <em>People v Gallagher, </em>55 Mich App 613; <em>Cox v State, </em>445 SW2d 200 [Tex]). Among the concerns expressed in these decisions are the interest of the public in having the court supervise the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation, of which the payment of restitution is a part, and the defendant\u2019s right of due process in the determination of the amount of restitution to insure that it did not represent unliquidated damages (see <em>State ex rel. D.G.W., supra, </em>at p 503).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b201-8\">. [4] Since the due process claim arising from her protracted prosecution is predicated upon an asserted deprivation of a constitutional right to no longer be subjected to trial for a particular offense, if established, it would survive what ordinarily would be the waiver effected by her plea (cf. <em>People v Michael, </em>48 NY2d 1 [right not to be subjected to double jeopardy]). We thus reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\">. Because there is no time limitation placed upon the commencement of a prosecution for murder or any class A felony (CPL 30.10, subd 2, par [a]), in <em>Singer, </em>where there was a four-year delay, we found the Statute of Limitations an inadequate protection (see <em>People v Singer, supra, </em>at p 253).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
