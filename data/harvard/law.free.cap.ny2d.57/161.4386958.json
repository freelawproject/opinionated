The CPL article 710 notice served below was insufficient on its face and all alleged admissions should therefore have been suppressed. <em>(People v Utley, </em>77 Misc 2d 86.) II. Appellant had an attorney under retainer in connection with a pending criminal matter at the time all allegedly incriminating admissions herein were made and since that attorney never waived appellant\u2019s right to counsel in connection with any such admissions, all such admissions should have been suppressed. <em>(People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167; <em>People v Marrero, </em>51 NY2d 56; <em>People v Skinner, </em>52 NY2d 24; <em>People v Bartolomeo, </em>53 NY2d 225; <em>People v Settles, </em>46 NY2d 154; <em>People v Kazmarick, 52 </em>NY2d 322.) III. A retained attorney had appeared for appellant in connection with the questioning in the Velzy matter prior to the obtaining of any alleged admissions and had expressly foreclosed further questioning of appellant and all alleged admissions thereafter obtained should therefore have been suppressed. <em>(People v McLauren, </em>38 NY2d 123; <em>People v Marrero, </em>51 NY2d 56; <em>People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479; <em>People v Arthur, 22 </em>NY2d 325; <em>People v Gunner, </em>15 NY2d 226.) IV. Significant judicial activity had taken place prior to any admissions allegedly obtained at the time of arrest and any oral or written admissions allegedly obtained at the questioning following arrest and these admissions should therefore have been suppressed. <em>(People v Samuels, </em>49 NY2d 218; <em>Massiah v United States, </em>377 US 201.) V. A police agent was directed by the police to secure admissions from appellant and was thus required to furnish appellant with the <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to the elicitation of any alleged incriminating information. <em>(Massiah v United States, </em>377 US 201; <em>People v Skinner, 52 </em>NY2d 24.) VI. The so-called \u201cspontaneous\u201d admissions should have been suppressed as involuntary. <em>(People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167; <em>People v Lucas, </em>53 NY2d 678; <em>People v Stoesser, </em>53 NY2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>648.) VII. All admissions, written and oral, obtained at the State Police headquarters should be suppressed on the ground that they were involuntary as the product of circumstances involving intoxication, violence, threats and other untoward activities. VIII. All alleged admissions obtained at the State Police headquarters should have been suppressed upon the ground that appellant, after having protested his innocence, was not readministered his <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to allegedly confessing. <em>(People v Jackson, </em>41 NY2d 146; <em>Michigan v Mosley, </em>423 US 96.) IX. The warrants for the search of the car and the residence were b\u00e1sed upon statements by an unreliable informant and the unlawfully obtained confession and the evidence resulting from these warrants should therefore have been suppressed. <em>(Coolidge v New Hampshire, </em>403 US 443; <em>Johnson v United States, </em>333 US 10; <em>Lo-Ji Sales v New York, </em>442 US 319; <em>Silverthorne Lbr. Co. v United States, </em>251 US 385; <em>Agnello v United States, </em>269 US 20; <em>People v Bartolomeo, </em>53 NY2d 225.) X. The warrants authorized search only and therefore anything seized should have been suppressed. <em>(Coolidge v New Hampshire, </em>403 US 443; <em>Terry v Ohio, </em>392 US 1; <em>Sibron v New York, </em>392 US 40.) XI. The evidence dehors the admissions (and the fruits thereof) was not overwhelming but highly dubious and the admissions (and their fruits) were devastating. <em>(People v Almestica, </em>42 NY2d 222; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230.) XII. The People engaged in improper practices before the Grand Jury in connection with a key witness and the remaining count of the indictment should therefore be dismissed. XIII. The remaining count of the indictment should be dismissed in that, as a matter of law, appellant owed no duty as imputed to him by the said count. <em>(People v Kibbe, </em>35 NY2d 407; <em>Jones v United States, </em>308 F2d 307.) XIV. Assuming the existence of a relevant duty, the failure to perform that duty was not proven and the remaining count of the indictment should be dismissed. XV. Assuming the existence of a relevant duty and assuming that the failure to perform that duty was proven, the failure to perform that duty was not proven to be criminally culpable and the remaining count of the indictment should be dismissed. XVI. Assuming the existence of a relevant duty, the failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>to perform that duty and that that failure was criminally culpable, that failure was yet not proven to be the proximate cause of death, meaning that there was a concomitant failure to prove the corpus delicti and a concomitant failure to corroborate the confession, and the remaining count of the indictment should be dismissed. <em>(People v Schryver, </em>42 NY 1; <em>People v Plath, </em>100 NY 590; <em>People v Eaton, </em>25 AD2d 692.) XVII. The court below erred in denying appellant\u2019s pretrial motions for a change of venue and this court should order a new trial to be held in an appropriate different jurisdiction. <em>(Sheppard v Maxwell, </em>384 US 333; <em>People v Di Piazza, </em>24 NY2d 342.) XVIII. The trial court should have disqualified itself upon pretrial motions and a new trial should be ordered before a different Judge. XIX. Prejudicial error was committed below in connection with the admission into evidence of certain physical evidence and a new trial should be ordered. XX. The trial court improperly admitted into evidence color photographs of the inside of the head of the deceased. XXI. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s application that jury panel members be examined individually in private concerning the publicity that they had been subjected to and the effect thereof, instead requiring appellant to examine the jurors entirely in the presence of the other panel members and the public while foreclosing the defense from inquiring as to the nature and extent of the publicity that the individual panel members had been subject to, and a new trial should therefore be ordered. <em>(Nebraska Press Assn. v Stuart, </em>427 US 539.) XXII. The trial court, having concluded that sequestration of the jury was indispensable to a fair trial, should have sequestered the jury in a rational fashion rather than in a manner which substantially obviated the advantage of sequestration and a new trial should therefore be ordered. XXIII. The trial court improperly denied defense requests to charge certain lesser included offenses and a new trial should therefore be ordered. XXIV. The trial court erred in charging the jury that a person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his own act and a new trial should therefore be ordered. XXV. The sentence was harsh and excessive and it should be ameliorated.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>Colin E. Ingham, District Attorney, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az_\">I. The notice pursuant to CPL article 710, even if insufficient, does not require suppression. <em>(People v Huntley, </em>15 NY2d 72; <em>People v Briggs, </em>38 NY2d 319; <em>People v Rivera, </em>53 NY2d 1005.) II. An attorney had not entered the proceeding prior to defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel on January 1, 1978. <em>(People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167; <em>People v Skinner, 52 </em>NY2d 24; <em>People v Kazmarick, 52 </em>NY2d 322.) III. The police had no knowledge that a retained attorney had appeared for this defendant with regard to the matter under investigation. <em>(People v Cunningham, </em>49 NY2d 203; <em>People v Marrero, </em>51 NY2d 56; <em>People v Garofolo, </em>46 NY2d 592.) IV. No significant judicial activity had taken place which would activate defendant\u2019s right to counsel and thereby make defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel, absent counsel, impossible as a matter of law. <em>(People v Samuels, </em>49 NY2d 218; <em>Kirby v Illinois, </em>406 US 682; <em>People v Sugden, </em>35 NY2d 453; <em>People v Coleman, </em>43 NY2d 222; <em>People v Settles, </em>46 NY2d 154.) V. Arthur Hitt was not required to give defendant Knapp the so-called <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to engaging him in conversation concerning the Velzy death in a noncustodial situation. <em>(Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; <em>People v Yukl, 25 </em>NY2d 585.) VI. The utterances by this defendant at the grave site were spontaneous, and, as a result, were properly admitted at trial. <em>(People v Maerling, </em>46 NY2d 289; <em>People v Kaye, 25 </em>NY2d 139; <em>People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479; <em>People v Del Vermo, </em>192 NY 470; <em>People v Schompert, </em>19 NY2d 300, 389 US 874.) VII. Defendant\u2019s oral and written statements at the New York State Police barracks were not the product of coercion, duress, threats, or intoxication, as a result of which, they were properly admitted. VIII. The admissions made by defendant at the State Police barracks should not be suppressed as a result of the failure of the New York State Police to readminister the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to defendant during interrogation. <em>(People v Jackson, </em>41 NY2d 146.) IX. The warrants for the search of the car and the residence were properly obtained based on appropriate evidence, as a result of which, any evidence resulting from such search was legally admissible. <em>(People v Hicks, </em>38 NY2d 90; <em>People v Brown, </em>40 NY2d 183; <em>Spinelli v United States, </em>393 US 410; <em>Aguilar v Texas, </em>378 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>US 108.) X. The search warrants issued by the local magistrate anticipated seizure of evidence, as a result of which, said evidence was properly admissible. XI. If defendant\u2019s confession was wrongfully admitted into evidence, such error was harmless error and does not require the reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>(People v Knapp, </em>82 AD2d 971; <em>People v Kingston, </em>8 NY2d 384; <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230.) XII. The People did not engage in improper practices before the Grand Jury. XIII. The People established the guilt of defendant under Count No. 2 of the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v Reynolds, </em>25 NY2d 489; <em>People v Schwartzman, </em>24 NY2d 241, 396 US 846; <em>People v Kibbe, </em>35 NY2d 407.) XIV. The evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the death of Linda Jill Velzy was a foreseeable result and reasonably related to the acts of defendant. XV. The evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant\u2019s conduct evinced a depraved indifference to human life resulting in death. XVI. The actions of defendant were sufficient direct cause of the death of Linda Jill Velzy to warrant the imposition of a conviction for murder in the second degree. XVII. The court below did not improperly deny defendant\u2019s motion for a change of venue. <em>(People v Davies, </em>275 App Div 726, 300 NY 506; <em>People v Di Piazza, </em>24 NY2d 342; <em>People v Bonier, </em>189 NY 108.) XVIII. The trial court did not err in refusing to disqualify itself. <em>(People v McDonald, </em>8 Misc 2d 50; <em>People v Rowley, </em>48 Misc 2d 26.) XIX. The admission of certain physical evidence was not prejudicial error. XX. The trial court did not improperly admit into evidence the photographs of the interior of the decedent\u2019s head. <em>(People v Singer, </em>300 NY 120.) XXI. The court properly conducted selection of the jury in terms of pretrial publicity. <em>(People v Biondo, </em>41 NY2d 483; <em>People v Corbett, </em>68 AD2d 772; <em>People v Genovese, </em>10 NY2d 478.) XXII. The trial court properly sequestered the jury. <em>(Matter of Oliver v Postel, </em>30 NY2d 171.) XXIII. The trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s request to charge lesser included offenses under the indictment. <em>(People v Asan, </em>22 NY2d 526; <em>People v Battle, </em>22 NY2d 323.) XXIV. The court below did not commit error in charging the jury with respect to the presumption that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>person intends the natural consequences of his own act. <em>(Sandstrom v Montana, </em>442 US 510; <em>People v Getch, </em>50 NY2d 456.) XXV. The sentence imposed by the court was not excessive nor harsh under the circumstances.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b210-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b210-6\">Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Incriminating statements made by defendant to the police after they had been informed that he had an attorney, as well as physical evidence thereafter seized from his automobile, must be suppressed as obtained in violation of his State constitutional right to counsel. The erroneous admission of this evidence cannot be regarded as harmless, nor can it be concluded on this record that the evidence was admissible on any theory of an emergency exception to the right -to counsel rule as now advanced by the dissenters.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Linda Jill Velzy, an 18-year-old student attending the State University College of Arts and Sciences at Oneonta, was last seen alive at approximately 6:00 p.m. on Friday, December 9, 1977. She had just finished visiting several young women who were seeking another roommate to share their apartment. On leaving she told them that she would walk back to the college campus or perhaps hitch a ride. She was reported missing by her roommate the following day. An intensive search was begun and carried out as a missing person investigation. The New York State Police, the Oneonta city police and the college campus security guards joined forces, co-ordinating their efforts and establishing a single command post in the Municipal Building on Main Street in the City of Oneonta. A search was made of the surrounding countryside and woods which included the use of helicopters and bloodhounds. The police interviewed and questioned over a hundred people, including defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">When he was questioned defendant informed the investigating officers, Detective Angellotti of the Oneonta police and Investigator Dabreau of the State Police, of his whereabouts on the evening of December 9 and denied any knowledge of the Velzy disappearance. During the course of this conversation, at the request of the officers, defendant agreed to submit to a polygraph examination. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>police thereafter from time to time continued to question defendant and communicated with his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Defendant at the time was under indictment returned by the November, 1977 Grand Jury in which he was charged with sodomy in the first degree \u00e1nd unlawful imprisonment in the first degree. He had been arraigned on these charges on November 9, 1977 and at that time had appeared with his attorney, John H. Owen, Otsego County Public Defender, although the latter had not then been formally appointed to represent him. Defendant again appeared on this indictment before the Otsego County Court on December 12, 1977 on an application to relieve the Public Defender and to permit defendant to retain counsel of his own choosing. The court granted defendant two weeks to obtain an attorney and adjourned the matter to December 28, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">As a consequence of the earlier police request that defendant take a polygraph examination, he contacted attorney Owen, who advised him not to submit to the test. The police continued questioning of defendant on December 12, 13 and 15, until on December 15 or 16, attorney Owen telephoned Detective Angellotti, informed him that he had advised his client not to take the polygraph test, and directed that the police either arrest defendant or cease their harassing questioning of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Although direct attempts to question defendant ended in compliance with Owen\u2019s demand and were not resumed until after defendant\u2019s subsequent arrest, later that month members of the consolidated investigating team arranged to question defendant indirectly through an informer named Arthur Hitt. During the course of the missing person investigation Hitt\u2019s attorney had approached the State Police indicating that his client possessed certain information with respect to the Velzy matter. Hitt, the owner of a logging site, for whom defendant occasionally worked, faced pending felony charges. The police were told by Hitt that on Monday, December 12, defendant had asked him to tell anyone who might inquire that he was with Hitt until 8:00 p.m. on Friday, December 9, the evening of Miss Velzy\u2019s disappearance. Although defendant did not then tell Hitt why it was important for him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>establish an alibi for that Friday evening, Hitt reported the incident to his own attorney. Thereafter (and after attorney Owen had expressly directed the police to cease questioning defendant about the Velzy matter), on December 21 at a conference in the chambers of the County Court Judge attended by the Judge, the prosecutor, Hitt and Hitt\u2019s attorney, it was agreed that Hitt would be permitted to plead guilty to charges not requiring incarceration and would, in fact, not be sentenced to incarceration, in exchange for his co-operation in the Velzy investigation, provided such co-operation led to the arrest of at least one person criminally responsible for Velzy\u2019s disappearance. Hitt\u2019s attorney testified that he understood the objective at the time to be \u201cto get Knapp\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">During the next 10 days, Hitt made several telephone calls to defendant which were recorded by State Police investigators. In the same period the State Police also outfitted Hitt with recording equipment for several face-to-face meetings with defendant. In only two of these more than half dozen recorded conversations was any relevant or incriminating statement made. Defendant twice repeated his request, without elaboration, that Hitt support defendant\u2019s alibi for Friday evening, December 9. In exchange for Hitt\u2019s agreement to do that, defendant agreed to support an alibi for Hitt\u2019s own pending unrelated charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">On December 31 the case finally broke open when it was disclosed why it was that defendant wanted an alibi for December 9. It was then that defendant confirmed to Hitt that he had killed Linda Velzy. In an unrecorded conversation, defendant related that he had picked up the Velzy girl while she was hitchhiking on West Street in the City of Oneonta around 6 o\u2019clock or a little after on December 9, that he had had a sexual encounter with her, that as they were coming back into town differences arose between them and she got all upset and jumped out of the car, that she lay in the ditch semiconscious, that he got out of the car and put her in the back seat and told her that he was going to take her to the hospital, and that instead he drove over into Delaware County where he hit her in the throat three times with his fist, killing her. He added that he wanted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>move the body to Hitt\u2019s logging site, and Hitt agreed to assist.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Hitt alerted the State Police and on January 1, 1978 informed them that defendant and he were going to move the body of Linda Velzy from the place where it was then located to a grave on Hitt\u2019s logging site on Winney Hill Road. On the basis of this information the police set up a stakeout to await the arrival of defendant and Hitt with the deceased girl\u2019s body. Shortly after 6:00 p.m. defendant and Hitt arrived at the logging site, and defendant was observed dragging the frozen body to a grave which had been prepared by use of a bulldozer furnished by Hitt. The police announced their presence and thereupon seized and arrested defendant. It was the testimony of some of the police witnesses that as he was being grappled to the ground he blurted out, \u201cI am sorry; I am sorry. I killed her. I am no good. Please shoot me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Defendant was taken to the State Police station in Unadilla where he was given his constitutionally mandated preinterrogation warnings. He waived his right to counsel and made a full confession of his involvement in the disappearance and death of Linda Jill Velzy which was reduced to typewritten form and signed by him. Based entirely on Hitt\u2019s sworn testimony as to admissions made to him by defendant, the police obtained a warrant to search the car defendant had been driving on December 9. The search uncovered a contact lens, wood chips, cat and dog hairs, blonde human hair and Christmas decoration \u201cglitter squares\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The January, 1978 Otsego County Grand Jury returned an indictment charging defendant with two counts of murder in the second degree. In count one it was alleged that defendant intentionally caused Linda Velzy\u2019s death by beating her about the head and neck with his fists (Penal Law, \u00a7 125.25, subd 1), and in count two it was alleged that defendant, in circumstances evincing a depraved indiffer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ence to human life, recklessly created a grave risk of her death and caused her death by failing to transport her for medical care (Penal Law, \u00a7 125.25, subd 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">On pretrial motions by defendant, the trial court denied suppression of the blurted-out expression of guilt and remorse made by defendant when he was apprehended at the grave site, of the two detailed confessions (the oral admissions made to Arthur Hitt before defendant\u2019s arrest and the signed typewritten confession made to the police after his arrest), and of the various items of physical evidence seized from defendant\u2019s car pursuant to the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">At trial, although none of the taped recordings of defendant\u2019s conversations with Hitt were offered in evidence, Hitt was himself permitted over objection to testify with respect to the statements made to him on December 31 in which defendant detailed his participation in the disappearance of Linda Velzy and the associated subsequent events. The prosecution was also permitted to introduce the items of physical evidence taken from defendant\u2019s car and his signed typewritten confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Defendant took the stand and testified that, by Hitt\u2019s own admission to him, it was Hitt rather than defendant who had had the sexual encounter and who had killed the Velzy girl, that Hitt supplied the car and drove it and also furnished the shovel, sheet and bulldozer for the reburial and that it was Hitt who took defendant to the site of the original placement of the body in Delaware County and then requested defendant\u2019s assistance in reburying the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">At the conclusion of the trial the jury was instructed that it could find defendant guilty of either count or neither count but not both. After deliberation the jury acquitted defendant of intentional murder but convicted him of reckless murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">On appeal, the Appellate Division rejected all but one of the several contentions advanced on defendant\u2019s behalf. As to that contention, each Judge on the panel agreed that the signed typewritten confession had been obtained in violation of defendant\u2019s State constitutional right to counsel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Concluding, however, that the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was so overwhelming that the written confession was merely surplusage, the majority affirmed the conviction on a harmless error analysis. One Justice dissented from this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Although we agree that only the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress merits our discussion, we are compelled under settled principles of State constitutional law to conclude that violation by the police of defendant\u2019s right to counsel required suppression not only of the signed typewritten confession but also of testimony as to his earlier oral admissions made to Hitt, as well as of all physical evidence seized from his car. Only the blurted-out expression at the grave site was admissible. Because the evidence which should have been suppressed constituted the very core of the People\u2019s case, it cannot be concluded that its admission was harmless. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed and the case remitted for further proceedings on the second count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">We find no ground to disturb the denial of suppression of the police testimony as to the statement that defendant blurted out when he was arrested; both courts below have found that it was spontaneous (cf. <em>People v Lanahan, </em>55 NY2d 711).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">For the purpose of determining whether the admissions made by defendant to Hitt should have been suppressed it must be concluded that at the time, December 31, Hitt was acting as an agent for the police pursuant to the arrangement for that purpose made in the County Judge\u2019s chambers on December 21. It was the State Police who directed and supervised Hitt in his role as their informer, and, of course, they were chargeable with knowledge of the direction given by defendant\u2019s attorney to the Oneonta police that defendant was not to be questioned further in relation to the Velzy matter (cf. <em>People v Garofolo, </em>46 NY2d 592; <em>People v Pinzon, </em>44 NY2d 458). In employing Hitt as their agent to obtain incriminating statements from defendant who was represented by counsel, the police violated defendant\u2019s State constitutional right to counsel (cf. <em>People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167). It follows that Hitt\u2019s testimony as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the incriminating statements made by defendant to him must be suppressed notwithstanding that defendant was not in police custody at the time the statements were made <em>(People v Skinner, </em>52 NY2d 24).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">By similar reasoning the physical evidence obtained pursuant to the search warrant issued on the basis of Hitt\u2019s testimony as to defendant\u2019s admissions to him must be suppressed (cf. <em>Wong Sun v United States, </em>371 US 471).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Finally, as all the Justices at the Appellate Division agreed, defendant\u2019s signed typewritten statement made after his arrest while he was in police custody, at a time when to their knowledge he was represented by counsel who had directed the termination of all questioning, should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">It remains only to comment briefly on the views advanced in the dissent. Whatever may be said of a missing-person-emergency exception to the right of counsel rule \u2014 an issue as to which we decline to express any opinion \u2014 it suffices for the purposes of the present appeal to observe that there has been no address to any such theory by either the People or defendant in their briefs or on oral argument. Nor is there any suggestion that this contention was considered by County Court or at the Appellate Division, and neither court made any factual determination on which such an argument could be predicated. Accordingly, it would be jurisprudentially both inappropriate and imprudent for us at this stage to base an affirmance of defendant\u2019s conviction on any such ground. If there is to be an emergency exception in right to counsel cases, its recognition should be based on full development of an evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>record and come after the implications and ramifications of such an exception have been explored and considered with full participation of counsel, both at nisi prius and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Moreover, even if the missing-person-emergency rule were to be recognized, its application in this or any other individual case would necessarily depend on a preliminary factual determination, and, as stated by Judge Meyer, the present record would not permit us, as a matter of law, to make the prerequisite factual determination that the police activities with respect to defendant after December 21, 1977 were in furtherance of any emergency search for a missing person. Although the police in a co-ordinated task force initially launched an extensive missing person investigation following Linda Velzy\u2019s disappearance on December 9, the evidence now before us is not so overwhelming as to compel the conclusion that the purpose of the December 21 conference in the County Judge\u2019s chambers and the use of Hitt by the police as their agent on December 31 was in furtherance of the search for Linda and not to obtain evidence of criminal activity on the part of defendant. The lapse of time as well as the other circumstances of the arrangement with Hitt disclosed in the record give rise to no inference that the police entertained an expectation of finding Linda Velzy alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Nor would it be proper, in our view, to send the case back for a new hearing, the introduction of new evidence and the possible development of a new theory on which to sustain the admission of the evidence which should, on the present record, have been suppressed (cf. <em>People v Havelka, </em>45 NY2d 636). There is no contention that, had they chosen to do so, the People could not have offered any evidence available to them to sustain such an emergency exception at the original suppression hearing. That such a theory appears not to have occurred to anyone (until postargument deliberation in our court) provides no justification to grant \u201cthe People a second chance to succeed where once they had tried and failed\u201d <em>(People v </em>Bryant, 37 NY2d 208, 211).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">For the reasons stated, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, defendant\u2019s conviction vacated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>testimony as to his oral admissions to Hitt, his signed typewritten confession, and the physical evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant suppressed, and the case remitted to Otsego County Court for further proceedings on the second count in the indictment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">. At trial, the lens was matched to one missing from Miss Velzy\u2019s right eye, the wood chips were shown to be similar to a chip found in her pubic hair, the animal hair was proved consistent with hair found on the interior surfaces of her clothing, the human hair was established to be consistent with her own hair, and the glitter squares were seen to be the same as those found in the sheet in which her body was partially wrapped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\">. In this case there is no room for a contention that the purpose of the police in their use of Hitt as an informer was to elicit evidence from defendant as to the commission of a subsequent, discrete criminal transaction (cf. <em>People v Ferrara, </em>54 NY2d 498; <em>People v Middleton, </em>54 NY2d 474). Defendant\u2019s incriminatory statements on December 31 were unrelated to any new crime. The record discloses that they were elicited entirely independent of defendant\u2019s request for an alibi; defendant was relating the details of his past crime for a purpose independent of his request for an alibi. In any event any crime of hindering prosecution had been fully committed on December 12 when defendant made his request and when that request was repeated in taped conversations, apparently prior to December 21. There was no occasion for the continued use of Hitt with respect to any such crime. There can be no doubt that on December 31, Hitt was acting as police agent to obtain evidence as to defendant\u2019s participation in Linda Velzy\u2019s disappearance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b218-5\">Meyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ8\">(concurring in result). Although I harbor no doubt that there is an emergency exception to the constitutional right to counsel and when next presented with the opportunity to do so will vote in favor of such an exception, no court has yet so held and the possibility that any court might, so far as the present record discloses, was never suggested at the December 21 hearing or to any of the three courts considering this case, or indeed until the conference of this court after argument. I, therefore, cannot agree with my dissenting colleagues that defendant Knapp\u2019s conviction should simply be affirmed, for to do so would be to deny him the opportunity to which due process clearly entitles him to contest whether his statement of December 31 to Hitt, improperly obtained as it otherwise clearly was <em>(United States v Henry, </em>447 US 264, 274, n 11; <em>Brewer v Williams, </em>430 US 387; <em>Massiah v United States, </em>377 US 201; see <em>Rhode Island v Innis, </em>446 US 291, 300, n 4), was obtained in a manner within that emergency exception. There <em>is </em>a point beyond which the fact that a person is missing may no longer be reasonably viewed as constituting an emergency. To pose \u00a3 <em>reductio ad absurdum, </em>the dissenters would not suggest that in a prosecution for the murder of Judge Crater, missing now these many decades, the introduction of a statement obtained under the same circumstances as was the statement obtained from Knapp could be justified on an emergency basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Whether an emergency exists is a question of fact, in which the fact that a person is missing is a highly important factor. It is not, however, the <em>only </em>relevant factor (compare Justice Blackmun dissenting in <em>Brewer v Williams, </em>430 US 387, 439, <em>supra, </em>with <em>State v Beede, </em>119 NH 620, cert den 445 US 967, reh den 446 US 993). To hold as a matter of law, as would the dissenters, that that fact alone justifies the deliberate, court-sponsored invasion of Knapp\u2019s right to counsel is to permit the exception to swallow the rule and to violate Knapp\u2019s right to due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>process in order to justify the violation of his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The evidence strongly suggests that Knapp is guilty of the murder of Linda Velzy. But I would rather see one guilty man go free than sanction in the interest of justifiably limiting the right to counsel an exception that will render the rule meaningless in many cases and which in this case cannot be reached without violating the due process clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In my view the matter should be remitted for a further suppression hearing at which the facts concerning the basis on which the police acted could be presented by the State, upon which rests the burden of proof (cf. <em>People v Hodge, </em>44 NY2d 553, 557; <em>People v Mitchell, </em>39 NY2d 173, 180), and Knapp would be afforded the opportunity to which due process entitles him to contest those facts.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Such a hearing would be permissible in view of the massive media coverage of Linda Velzy\u2019s disappearance which would provide a sufficient check on possible distortion <em>(People v Havelka, </em>45 NY2d 636, 644; <em>People v Lypka, </em>36 NY2d 210; <em>People v Horowitz, </em>21 NY2d 55).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\"> What is overlooked in footnote 4 of the dissent is that there can be no unfairness to the People in permitting Knapp to contest an issue which it was the People\u2019s burden to present.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b219-6\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkY\">(dissenting). Although I did not acquiesce in prior holdings of this court adopting the broad right of counsel rule <em>(People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167, 175-178; <em>People v Marrero, </em>51 NY2d 56, 59-61; <em>People v Skinner, 52 </em>NY2d 24, 32-36; <em>People v Bartolomeo, </em>53 NY2d 225, 236), which would seem to necessitate a reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction of reckless murder, in spite of overwhelming evidence of guilt, I believe that there comes a point at which an appellate court, such as ours, must recognize that the dictates of common sense and reason must be considered in striking a balance between a suspect\u2019s fundamental right to counsel and the fundamental duty of the police to aid persons in trouble, particularly those who may be the victims of violent crimes. A rule that turns criminals free can be justified only by clear and convincing evidence that its benefit to society outweighs its cost to society. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>my view, the benefits from applying an inflexible per se right of counsel rule to the particular facts and circumstances surrounding this case falls far short of meeting that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In my opinion, the analysis presented by Judge Wachtler in his dissenting opinion, whether viewed as an emergency exception<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to the right of counsel rule or as a limitation on the further development of that right as it relates to an emergency police inquiry, recognizes the practical realities of a missing persons investigation and the inappropriateness of further applying the per se right of counsel rule enunciated in <em>People v Skinner (supra). </em>Such an investigation by its very nature requires the police to act expediently in the hope of finding a person whose life may be in danger and who may be in need of immediate assistance. While it may be true that the person is missing because of the criminal acts of another, the rights of a potential defendant should not hamper an investigation directed primarily to aid the victim. <em>(Snyder v Massachusetts, </em>291 US 97, 122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Nor is it practical to suggest that the police should know the precise moment their investigation changes from primarily a missing persons investigation to an accusatory investigation. In fact, many such emergency investigations will in the natural course of good police work uncover criminal activity and evidence related to that activity. In recognizing a demarcation between investigatory and accusatory police work, for the purpose of applying the right to counsel rule, we would be fulfilling our obligation to locate the proper balance between competing demands for effective police protection and strict observation of a suspect\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights. However, as a policy matter, we should allow the police adequate discretion to conduct this type of emergency investigation until it is clearly established that a crime has been committed, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>which point the investigation would be termed accusatory in nature and would focus only on determining responsibility for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In the insulated environment of an appellate court, which naturally deals in hindsight, it is easy to pinpoint when such a change in an investigation occurred, but I do not believe that the Constitution requires the police to make such fine distinctions during an emergency investigation oriented to locating a missing 18-year-old college student. <em>(People v Rogers, supra; People v Skinner, supra; People v Middleton, </em>54 NY2d 474; <em>Hoffa v United States, </em>385 US 293, 310.) To do otherwise would result in the accused going free, not because the constable blundered, but because the constable lacked the foresight to ascertain the precise nature of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">It is for this reason that I believe this case is distinguishable from the prior precedents of this court which extended the constitutional right to counsel to the investigatory stages of police work. In <em>People v Skinner </em>(52 NY2d 24, <em>supra), </em>it was ascertained that a murder had been committed and finding the person responsible was the focus of the police investigation. There were no competing concerns regarding the victim\u2019s safety or fate. Nor was there any compelling time constraint such as exists when it is thought that a person may be being held captive. Thus, I believe there is a very real practical distinction to be drawn between a disappearance investigation and the situation where the police know the precise nature of the crime and are conducting an investigation to establish a person\u2019s involvement in that already ascertained crime. I welcome the opportunity to join my dissenting colleagues in recognizing the compelling nature of those practicalities which makes this case distinguishable from prior precedents of this court. <em>(People v Rogers, supra; People v Skinner, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">To hold otherwise would constitute yet another expansion of a person\u2019s right to counsel in a noncustodial setting during the course of an investigation. In my view, this would be an unwarranted expansion of the right to counsel which, once again, would elevate the rights of the potential defendant above the compelling interests of the State. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>(People v Rogers, supra.) </em>Furthermore, it may well have the dangerous effect of barring the police not only from investigating a crime, but also from aiding a citizen who is the victim of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">For all of these reasons, I would affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\"> I see no reason to require a hearing on the question of whether or not an emergency existed. In my view, an emergency existed by virtue of the missing persons investigation. Thus, the scope of right to counsel in light of the emergency nature of the investigation can be addressed by this court even though it was not considered by the courts below. The very nature of a missing persons investigation, combined with the facts as found by the courts below, clearly constitutes an emergency situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b222-6\">Wachtler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkE\">(dissenting). The police should not be prohibited from using an informant to obtain information from a person represented by counsel when the police are trying to find and possibly rescue a missing person. The rule precluding the police from questioning a person represented by counsel in order to solve a crime known to have been committed, or to gather evidence for conviction of such a crime, has not been applied, and should not be extended to hinder police officers actively engaged in attempting to provide emergency assistance to those who are or may be in danger. When a person has been reported missing under unusual circumstances the police may reasonably proceed on the assumption that the person may be in danger or in need of police assistance. It should not be for the courts to say that at a certain point, to be revealed after the event, intensive rescue efforts should cease because the police should, as a matter of law, abandon all hope of finding the missing person alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In this case the defendant murdered Linda Velzy, an 18-year-old college student, while he was released on bail awaiting trial on an indictment charging him with sodomy and unlawful imprisonment of another young woman. He admitted his guilt on three separate occasions: first, to an erstwhile friend, Arthur Hitt, who was assisting the police in locating the missing student; second, at the time of his arrest while attempting to dispose of his victim\u2019s body; and third, at the police station shortly after his arrest. Additional evidence of his guilt was discovered in his car pursuant to a warrant based entirely on the defendant\u2019s conversations with Hitt. The defendant made a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence claiming some unspecified violation of his constitutional rights. The trial court denied the motion and the jury found the defendant guilty of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The Appellate Division held that the defendant\u2019s third confession at the station house should have been suppressed, but found the error harmless in light of the other evidence of guilt and thus affirmed the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">On appeal to this court the defendant urges that all of this evidence, except the dead student\u2019s body, should be suppressed. He argues that the police should not have approached him or accepted the aid of his confidant, Arthur Hitt, to determine what if anything the defendant knew of Miss Velzy\u2019s disappearance because the police knew that the defendant had recently been indicted for abducting and sexually molesting another young woman in the area, and therefore knew that on that pending charge he had an attorney, who in fact had, at the defendant\u2019s request, directed the police to discontinue their efforts to obtain information from the defendant concerning the missing person. It is contended by the defendant, and the majority, that our prior cases construing the State constitutional right to counsel mandate suppression of the evidence under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In my view the Appellate Division was correct and the conviction should be affirmed. A careful reading of the facts and applicable law shows that the defendant\u2019s argument calls for an extension and, in my view, an unwarranted extension of the right to counsel into an area in which it has never been held to apply, and should not be held to be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The most important fact in the case is that Linda Velzy disappeared on December .9, 1977 and was not found until January 1, 1978. When informed of her mysterious disappearance on December 10 the Oneonta police opened a \u201cfile 5\u201d which, it was noted at the hearing, is the official designation for a missing persons investigation. They also enlisted the aid of the State Police and the campus security force and established a special command post to co-ordinate their efforts to find Miss Velzy.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The search continued throughout December. Large numbers of police officers searched the surrounding woods, helicopters were employed, as well as bloodhounds, and apparently even spiritualists. The police also interviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>over a hundred people including the defendant. Thus accepting Hitt\u2019s offer to determine what, if anything, the defendant might know about Miss Velzy\u2019s disappearance and present whereabouts was just one of the many leads pursued by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">All of the defendant\u2019s statements to Hitt were made during this first stage of the investigation, while the police were attempting to locate and possibly rescue a missing person. The only statements the police obtained from the defendant after it was determined that a crime had been committed in connection with the young woman\u2019s disappearance were the second and third confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Although the police naturally considered it possible that she might be dead, they had no evidence supporting that theory until the day before the defendant\u2019s arrest when the defendant informed Hitt that he had killed her. The corpus delicti of the crime was not established until January 1, 1978 when the defendant was arrested dragging her body to a newly dug grave. Prior to that time the police did not know whether she was dead or alive, sick or well, voluntarily absent or criminally abducted and thus were conducting a missing persons investigation, not a homicide case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">A missing persons investigation is not a criminal investigation, as the majority opinion assumes. This is not just a semantic difference. It is a constitutionally recognized distinction (see, e.g., <em>People v Mitchell, </em>39 NY2d 173), and a point of the utmost significance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The primary function of the police is to protect the public by preventing crime and rendering emergency assistance to those whose lives or safety may be in jeopardy. After a crime has been committed the police assume their secondary role of determining who is responsible and gathering evidence for prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The State constitutional rule prohibiting the police from questioning a person represented by counsel in the absence of counsel, limits the investigative techniques available to the police (see, e.g., <em>People v Middleton, </em>54 NY2d 474). In some cases this merely delays the investigation, in others it may completely frustrate it. Thus far this type of restriction has been imposed on the police only in cases where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>they are investigating a crime known to have been committed in order to solve the crime or obtain evidence which would insure a conviction (see, e.g., <em>People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479 [robbery reported]; <em>People v Settles, </em>46 NY2d 154 [police officer killed]; <em>People v Singer, </em>44 NY2d 241 [young woman found murdered]; <em>People v Garofolo, </em>46 NY2d 592 [young woman murdered]; <em>People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167 [robbery reported]). Significantly, in <em>People v Skinner </em>(52 NY2d 24), which the majority believes to be dispositive in this case, the police found the victim\u2019s dead body on June 25, 1975 and obtained the damaging admissions from the defendant on March 10,1977 nearly two years later. Thus that was also a case in which the victim had been found and any information the police might obtain from the defendant could only serve to aid them in their secondary role of establishing criminal responsibility for a crime known to have been committed some time ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In short, the critical distinguishing factor between our prior cases and the one now before us is this: In none of our prior cases was there any possibility that the life or safety of an innocent third party, perhaps in imminent danger, might depend upon the success of the police investigation. Limiting the power of the police to investigate a crime known to have been completed, by precluding them from obtaining information from a person who has retained an attorney, may result in the guilty party going free. Imposing the same restrictions on the police when they are attempting to rescue a person potentially in danger may, and in many cases undoubtedly will, have the added consequence of contributing to the death or injury of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Well-founded judicial reluctance to interfere with the emergency functions of the police has served as the basis for recognizing limitations on other constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Thus, for instance, the <em>Miranda </em>rule does not require the police to pause and advise an individual of his rights when the officers are merely investigating a suspicious and possibly criminal incident but have not yet determined whether there has been a \u201cdefinite\u201d and \u201cconcluded\u201d crime <em>(People v Huffman, </em>41 NY2d 29; <em>People v Greer, </em>42 NY2d 170). The \u201cemergency doctrine\u201d applied in Fourth Amendment cases is the most well-developed example. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>adopted by this court in <em>People v Mitchell </em>(39 NY2d 173, supra) where the police had conducted a \u201croom-by-room\u201d search of a hotel to locate a missing maid, who was eventually found dead in the defendant\u2019s room. The police concededly had no warrant and no probable cause to believe the defendant had committed a crime. However, we noted (at p 178) that the \u201cmaid\u2019s disappearance was a mystery and it was not known whether she had been stricken with some illness, suffered an accident or possibly fallen victim to a crime. Each of these three alternatives was possible\u201d. In upholding the police officers\u2019 actions we held that the police have the right to enter and investigate in an emergency inherent in the nature of their duties as peace officers and noted (at p 180) that \u201c \u2018[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would greatly endanger their lives or the lives of others\u2019 <em>(Warden v Hayden, </em>387 US 294, 298-299).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Recognizing that the police should not be bound by the unusual restrictions imposed by this State\u2019s constitutional right to counsel when they are conducting a missing persons investigation is consistent with constitutional principles generally and is justified by the demands of that type of investigation. The need to make wide-ranging inquiries is no less important than the need to make sweeping search when the police are attempting to locate a missing person. Delay or frustration of the investigation can be equally fatal for the missing person whether it is occasioned by unrealistic restrictions on the right to search or on the right to inquire. Indeed, the broadened power of the police to search for a missing person is of little value if the authorities do not have the corresponding power to obtain leads by making inquiry of all segments of the community. When a person has disappeared under unusual circumstances, law-abiding citizens or those without attorneys are not the only ones, or even the most likely, to have useful information.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">As is the case with other constitutional rights, there are limits to the rule prohibiting the police from obtaining statements from a person who has retained or requested the assistance of counsel <em>(People v Middleton, </em>54 NY2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>474, <em>supra; People v Ferrara, </em>54 NY2d 498). In the <em>Middleton </em>case where the defendant, arrested for a traffic infraction, offered the arresting officer a $10,000 bribe after invoking the right to counsel, we concluded that further inquiry by the police as to the reason for the bribe was not prohibited, noting that a contrary holding would (at p 482) \u201cunrealistically * * * limit investigatory procedures relating to bribe offers\u201d. It is even more unrealistic, if not completely irresponsible, to require police officers attempting to locate a missing person, potentially in danger, to abandon a promising lead simply because it would require the use of an informer to obtain information from a person represented by counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The case now before us is an appropriate one to recognize that a defendant cannot employ the right to counsel to frustrate or delay police officers searching for a missing person. Although we now know, as the defendant did from the beginning, that the missing student had been killed or fatally injured on December 9, this was not known by the police on December 21 when they formally accepted Hitt\u2019s offer to attempt to learn if the defendant knew anything about her disappearance. All the authorities knew at that point was that, when last seen, Miss Velzy had indicated that she would probably walk or hitchhike back to the campus; that the defendant had recently been arrested for abducting and sexually assaulting another hitchhiking coed and that he had asked his friend Hitt for a false alibi for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the evening of December 9. This, of course, was a lead worth following but it obviously did not provide solid proof or even probable cause to believe that the defendant was responsible for Miss Velzy\u2019s disappearance or that she was dead. Missing persons, even those who have been abducted, are often found alive long after their disappearance, as we know from the Patti Hearst case, and others of lesser notoriety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s attempt to obtain an alibi for the night of the disappearance was nothing more than a suspicious circumstance. But even if the police had firmer grounds to suspect him, his involvement in Miss Velzy\u2019s disappearance would not necessarily establish a homicide or rule out other possibilities. Significantly the pending indictment charged the defendant with sodomy and unlawful imprisonment, suggesting that at some point the girl that he had abducted in that case must have been released alive. We do not know how much time elapsed in that case but it is interesting to note that on the trip to Binghamton the defendant had informed Hitt that \u201che wanted to pick up another girl and take her off in a cabin or something back in the woods out of the way and keep her there for a couple of weeks and then just do away with her\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The record is not deficient, nor is there any need to remit for additional findings, simply because it does not reveal the subjective intent of the officers involved in the investigation or has lead some to speculate that they were only intent on obtaining evidence against the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With three police forces and so many individuals actively involved in the search over several weeks, it is unlikely that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>we will find unanimity or any persistently held beliefs. With the limited information available to the police any individual belief would be little more than a hunch. The only practical approach for the courts is to recognize that when a person has disappeared under mysterious circumstances, the police may reasonably proceed on the assumption that he or she may be in danger or in need of police assistance. It does not matter whether all, most, or only some, of the officers assigned to the investigation are fully committed to that belief, whether their supervisors share it, or whether a Judge asked to assist in the case entertains the belief. Until the person has been found, or conclusive evidence of death has been presented there is no reason for the police to abandon all hope of rescue. Neither should the courts say, with hindsight, that the police should have conducted the investigation as if no hope remained. Thus the record as it stands is sufficient and supports our view that the emergency doctrine is applicable to this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The issue presented by the facts in this case cannot be ignored or avoided because of any perceived failure on the part of the People to urge that we adopt an emergency exception to the State constitutional right to counsel. Strict requirements with respect to the sufficiency of the record and appellate arguments of counsel have not previously deterred us from reaching the merits when the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>constitutional right to counsel is involved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In any event the defendant\u2019s contention that his right has been violated necessarily involves consideration of the scope and limits of the right. A defendant\u2019s constitutional rights cannot be extended by default. If the People had completely neglected to submit a brief, or had been precluded for failure to present a timely brief (22 NYCRR 500.7 [b]), we would not be bound to accept the defendant\u2019s arguments simply because they were unopposed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed even if the People had expressly conceded the defendant\u2019s point, that would not \u201crelieve us from the performance of our judicial function * * * [or] require us to adopt the proposal urged upon us\u201d <em>(People v Berrios, </em>28 NY2d 361, 366-367; see, also, <em>People v Lewis, </em>26 NY2d 547, 550; <em>People v McGowen, </em>42 NY2d 905, 907; <em>Sibron v New York, </em>392 US 40, 58; <em>Young v United States, </em>315 US 257, 258).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In sum, when the police are investigating a report that a person has disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and has not yet been found, the State constitutional right to counsel should not prohibit the police from approaching any member of the community who may have useful information, including those who have a record of prior convictions or pending charges or who have retained counsel to immunize themselves from police inquiries. A missing persons investigation is not a homicide case when no body has been found and there was no reason why the police in this case should have been bound to conduct the investigation as if Miss Velzy\u2019s life or safety did not depend upon the success of their efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The defendant\u2019s conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judge Fuchsberg concur with Judge Jones; Judge Meyer concurs in result in a separate opinion; Judge Jasen dissents and votes to affirm in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>another opinion; Judge Wachtler dissents and votes to affirm in an additional opinion in which Judge Gabrielli concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\">. Contrary to the majority\u2019s holding, the principle recognized in the <em>Middleton </em>and <em>Ferrara </em>cases provides an additional basis for admitting the defendant\u2019s conversations with Hitt. When the defendant requested Hitt to give false information to the police he committed the crime of criminal solicitation (see Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 100.00-100.15), because he was asking Hitt to commit the crime of hindering prosecution (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 205.50-205.65), known at common law as an accomplice after the fact (La Pave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law, \u00a7 66, p 523). Statements made in furtherance of a criminal act are not the type of statements entitled to protection under the State Constitution <em>(People v Middleton, supra; People v Ferrara, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Although as the majority notes this new crime was complete when the defendant made the request, it does not follow that there was no need for the police to utilize Hitt to further investigate the matter. This argument overlooks the fact that <em>evidence </em>of the crime would not be complete until it could be shown that some earlier crime had been committed which the defendant was attempting to cover up (see Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 205.50-205.65, 100.00-100.15). Indeed the degree or precise nature of the defendant\u2019s offense would depend upon the nature of the earlier crime (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 100.00-100.15). Nor is it realistic to focus on the intent of the police in such an investigation. A police officer investigating to determine whether a defendant\u2019s request for a false alibi is an attempt to cover up some earlier crime, cannot do so without also intending to uncover the earlier crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\">. The example chosen by Judge Meyer in his concurring opinion is not apt or helpful. In this case we are concerned with a potential victim missing approximately 20 days, and not with an historical curiosity which occurred over 50 years ago.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\">. The subjective intent of police officers is relevant in Fourth Amendment cases where the emergency doctrine is employed to physically intrude upon the defendant\u2019s person or property, without a warrant, and, indeed without probable cause (see, e.g., <em>People v Mitchell, </em>39 NY2d 173). It has not been considered relevant in cases involving emergencies where the police conduct is less intrusive. For instance, when the police merely converse with the defendant in order to determine the nature of suspicious, possibly dangerous and presumably criminal activity, the police officer\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose\u201d in making the inquiry has played no part in determining whether it was proper to dispense with <em>Miranda </em>warnings (see, e.g., <em>People v Huffman, </em>41 NY2d 29; <em>People v Greer, </em>42 NY2d 170). The same rule should apply in this case where the police were merely attempting to determine, by conversations with the defendant and through their agent Hitt, whether the defendant possessed information concerning Miss Velzy\u2019s mysterious disappearance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b229-6\">. The view expressed in Judge Meyer\u2019s concurring opinion, that it would be unfair to the defendant to recognize the emergency limitation on his rights at this stage is, at least, ironic. First, it should be emphasized that the defendant never submitted any facts in support of his motion to suppress. He simply claimed, without elaboration, that his statements should be suppressed because they \u201cwere involuntary and otherwise obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under the United States Constitution and otherwise\u201d. Thus he presented no factual basis for suppression or factual issues entitling him to a hearing and was only afforded a hearing because the People consented to grant him one. Secondly, at the suppression hearing which extends through two volumes of the record, the defendant made no legal argument whatsoever in support of his conclusory contention that his rights had been violated, made no attempt to identify for the court or disclose to his adversary the legal basis for the relief he sought, and therefore never afforded the People an opportunity to respond at the hearing to the arguments he has presented on this appeal. As a general rule the defendant\u2019s failure to present the issue in the trial court would preclude the defendant from raising it on this appeal. However, once again, the defendant has been granted a special dispensation because the right to counsel issue happens to be one of those rare points that need not be preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In short, the defendant has been afforded more of a hearing, both in this court and the trial court, than he would be generally entitled to under the law. The only unfairness is to the People because the conviction is being set aside for their \u201cfailure\u201d to respond to an argument the defendant never made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\">. When the record shows that this right has been violated we have consistently granted relief even though the defendant has failed to properly preserve the issue in the trial court (see, e.g., <em>People v Samuels, </em>49 NY2d 218, 221; <em>People v Charleston, </em>54 NY2d 622) or has neglected to argue the point on appeal <em>(People v Carmine A., </em>53 NY2d 816). Similarly, we should deny relief if the record shows that there has been no violation even though the People may not perceive that the defendant\u2019s arguments would extend the right into areas where it would not be applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\">. Despite the fact that I write in dissent for three Judges, including myself, it is plain from Judge Meyer\u2019s concurring opinion that at least four Judges of this court are now prepared to recognize the emergency doctrine in principle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
