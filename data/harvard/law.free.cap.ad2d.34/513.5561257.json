Though for the purposes of this decision we overlook the informal manner in which the defendants\u2019 motion for renewal was made, we must note nevertheless the impropriety of the practice followed at Special Term. On the merits, we find that it was proper in the first instance to hold that there were special circumstances justifying the examination of the two banks. Since pretrial examination of the individual nonparty witnesses may disclose matter rendering unnecessary the examination of the banks, a motion may be made at Special Term to vacate the order for their examination following the examination of the individual witnesses. Defendants-respondents-appellants appeal from the order of July 24, 1969 dismissed. Concur \u2014 McGivern, J. P., Markewieh, McNally and Tilzer, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
