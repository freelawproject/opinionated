Order reversed insofar as appealed from, on the law and the facts, with $10 costs and disbursements, and defendant\u2019s motion denied. In view of the fact that the judgment had awarded custody of the parties\u2019 five children to plaintiff, it was an improvident exercise of discretion for the Special Term to direct that the contract of sale he signed by her <em>(Zahler </em>v. <em>Zahler, </em>28 A D 2d 925). Under these circumstances, there can be no doubt that now is not the earliest practical time when the premises can be sold. If the trial court had indeed anticipated an immediate sale of the premises, in computing the alimony award, then the court has the power, upon proper application, to modify the alimony award upon the basis of the change in circumstances in the parties\u2019 financial condition which this decision will bring about. We do not reach the question as to whether the court has the power to direct sale of the house. Beldock, P. J., Christ, Munder, Martuscello and Kleinfeld, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
