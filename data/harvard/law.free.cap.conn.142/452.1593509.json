The defendant pleaded a general denial and, in a special defense, the one-year Statute of Limitations, \u00a7 8324. The plaintiff demurred to the special defense, and the trial court sustained the demurrer. After trial to the court a judgment was rendered for the plaintiff, and the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The facts are as follows: The plaintiff was struck and injured by an automobile operated by Henrietta Warner when he was crossing Franklin Avenue in Hartford at 10 p.m. on November 3, 1950. The defendant, Bernard Lucas, was the owner and permit-tee of a restaurant and tavern on Franklin Avenue. The only people who worked there were the defendant and his wife and two bartenders. Mrs. Lucas worked in the kitchen during the day. One bartender worked full time during the day and the other part time at night. Shortly before the accident, Mrs. Warner had entered the defendant\u2019s restaurant and tavern and ordered a glass of beer. She had been drinking beer elsewhere and was intoxicated. The defendant, or a waiter employed by him, served her a glass of beer, which she paid for and drank. She left the tavern, entered an automobile and had driven it a short distance on Franklin Avenue when she struck the plaintiff. At the time, of the accident and immediately afterwards she was intoxicated. The plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the consequence of her intoxication. This action was instituted by a writ, summons and complaint served upon the defendant on November 18, 1952. The trial court concluded that the defendant, by himself or his agent, had sold alcoholic liquor to Henrietta Warner while she was intoxicated and that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the consequence of her intoxication, and ordered judgment entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The appeal presents two questions of law: (1) Does the one-year limitation for an action for damages imposed by General Statutes, \u00a7 8324, bar this action? (2) Is the finding that the defendant, by himself or his agent, sold alcoholic liquor to Henrietta Warner while she was intoxicated sufficient to fix liability on the defendant under \u00a7 4307 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Section 8316 of the General Statutes imposes a three-year limitation upon all actions \u201cfounded upon a tort.\u201d The pertinent provisions of \u00a7 8324 state that \u201c[n]o action to recover damages for injury to the person, or to real or personal property, caused by negligence, or by reckless or wanton misconduct, or by malpractice of a physician, surgeon, dentist, chiropodist, chiropractor, hospital or sanatorium, . . . shall be brought but within one year from the date of the act or omission complained of.\u201d In <em>Tuohey </em>v. <em>Martinjak, </em>119 Conn. 500, 177 A. 721, we reviewed the legislative history of the precursors of these two sections, which were then \u00a7\u00a7 6006 and 6015 of the Bevision of 1930. We held (p. 507) that \u00a7 6015, presently \u00a7 8324, applied to all actions to recover damages for injury to the person, whether or not that injury was caused by negligence. This holding was by reason of the fact that in \u00a7 6015 there was no comma after the word \u201cproperty,\u201d so that the phrase \u201ccaused by negligence\u201d qualified only \u201cinjury to personal property,\u201d and not \u201cinjury to the person.\u201d Id., 503. In an amendment of the statute adopted in 1935, a comma was inserted after the word \u201cproperty.\u201d Cum. Sup. 1935, \u00a7 1680c. The effect of this punctuation was to make the phrase \u201ccaused by negligence\u201d qualify the phrase \u201cinjury to the person\u201d as well as the phrase \u201cinjury ... to real or personal property.\u201d This amendment nullified the interpretation of the statute made in the <em>Tuohey </em>case. <em>Anti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>nozzi </em>v. <em>D. V. Frione &amp; Co., </em>137 Conn. 577, 579, 79 A.2d 598; see <em>Lametta </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>139 Conn. 218, 219, 92 A.2d 731. An action for injury to the person, as well as one for injury to real or personal property, falls within the one-year limitation imposed by \u00a7 8324 only if the injury is caused by negligence or by reckless or wanton misconduct or by malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The defendant argues that \u00a7 8324 applies in the case at bar because the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by negligence or wanton misconduct. The gravamen of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is not negligence or wanton misconduct but rather a violation of \u00a74307.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This statute establishes a cause of action based upon a specified course of conduct and the consequences of such conduct. It creates a new tort liability which is subject to the three-year limitation fixed by \u00a7 8316 for tort actions not caused by negligence. The court properly sustained the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The defendant contends that the court\u2019s finding that \u201c[t]he defendant, or a waiter employed by the defendant,\u201d and its conclusion that \u201c[t]he defendant, by himself or his agent,\u201d sold alcoholic liquor to Mrs. Warner, without specifying which one, is not sufficient to fasten liability upon him. The complaint alleged that \u201cthe Defendant, acting himself or through one of his agents,\u201d sold the alcoholic liquor to an intoxicated person. No more specific statement of this alternative allegation was demanded. A sale by either one meets the requirement of the statute. It could not advantage the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>claim that not he, but his waiter or bartender, sold the alcoholic liquor unless he was prepared to prove that it was sold by his employee in violation of his instructions and without his knowledge \u2014 a defense not offered in this case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamperelli, </em>141 Conn. 430, 435, 106 A.2d 762. The sale was made in the defendant\u2019s restaurant and tavern. Only the defendant, his wife and two bartenders were employed there at the time. These facts are sufficient to support a conclusion that a sale was made by the defendant or his authorized agent, within the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamperelli, </em>supra; Barnes v. <em>State, </em>19 Conn. 398, 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">1\u2019n this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-15\"> \u201cSec. 4307. liquor seller liable por damage by intoxicated person. If any person, by himself or his agent, shall sell any alcoholic liquor to an intoxicated person, and such purchaser, in consequence of sueh intoxication, shall thereafter injure the person or property of another, sueh seller shall pay just damages to the person injured, to be recovered in an action under this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\"> The substance of this statute, enacted in 1933 (Cum.
