Upon appeal by the plaintiff, the Court of Common Pleas rendered judgment dismissing the appeal. From that judgment the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The facts as stipulated by the parties are as follows: Whalley Avenue in New Haven is a public highway. It contains curbs which separate the portions devoted to vehicular traffic from the sidewalks used by pedestrians. At about 3:30 p.m. on August 22, 1954, the plaintiff was operating his motor vehicle easterly in traffic on Whalley Avenue near its. intersection with Dayton Street. The overhead signal light, which was located above the portion of the highway used by moving traffic on Whalley Avenue, turned red. The plaintiff stopped his car behind five cars which had also been proceeding in an easterly direction. About ten seconds after his automobile had been stopped and while it was still stationary, a motor vehicle operated in an easterly direction on Whalley Avenue by Theodore E. Hillinski ran into the plaintiff\u2019s car, causing damage to it and injury to Mary Knoll and her daughter. Thereafter, the plaintiff received notice of an order of the defendant directing the plaintiff to deposit $680 with the defendant under the provisions of \u00a7 1051c<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>of the 1953 Cumulative Supplement to the General Statutes. The plaintiff requested a hearing, and one was had on October 28, 1954. On that day, he was informed by the defendant that his right to operate motor vehicles had already been forfeited and that the registration certificate issued to him had been revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The plaintiff claims that he was the operator and owner of a motor vehicle which was legally parked at the time of the accident; that therefore, under the provisions of \u00a7 1053c,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the requirements as to security and suspension specified in \u00a7 1051c do not apply; and that the court erred in concluding that the defendant properly suspended the plaintiff\u2019s driving license and registration. The sole question determinative of this appeal is whether the plaintiff\u2019s car was legally parked at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The plaintiff relies upon the following definition, contained in \u00a72350 (30) of the General Statutes: \u201c \u2018Parked vehicle\u2019 shall mean a motor vehicle in a stationary position within the limits of a public highway.\u201d Section 2350, the first of chapter 110, which also contains \u00a7\u00a7 1051c and 1053c, provides at the very beginning: \u201cTerms used in this chapter shall be construed as follows, unless another meaning is clearly apparent from the language or context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>or unless such, construction is inconsistent with, the manifest intention of the general assembly: . . .\u201d The defendant maintains that the plaintiff\u2019s car was not legally parked but was being operated at the time of the collision. He contends that the provisions contained in \u00a7 2509 of the General Statutes clearly show that the car was not, and could not have been, legally parked. The claimed material portion of, \u00a7 2509 is quoted in the footnote.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This portion was contained in \u00a7 1653 of the Bevision of 1930. The precursor of \u00a72350 (30), defining \u201c [pjarked vehicle,\u201d was not included in our statutes until 1939. Public Acts 1939, c. 6; Cum. Sup. 1939, \u00a7 478e. Furthermore, the definition in exactly the same words as it is now was not in the statutes until 1943. Public Acts 1943, c. 319; Sup. 1943, \u00a7 330g.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The presumption is that the legislature enacted what is now \u00a7 2350 (30) in view of the then existing relevant statute, which is now \u00a7 2509, and intended \u00a7 2350 (30) to be read with \u00a7 2509 so as to make one consistent body of law. <em>Hartley </em>v. <em>Vitiello, </em>113 Conn. 74, 82, 154 A. 255. \u201cThe General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them. And it is always presumed to have intended that effect which its action or non-action produces.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Staub, </em>61 Conn. 553, 566, 23 A. 924; <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>Darling, </em>116 Conn. 643, 646, 166 A. 70; <em>Hartley </em>v. <em>Vitiello, </em>supra. Subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>(30) of \u00a7 2350, read together with \u00a7 2509, does not repeal the latter by implication. \u201cThe intent of the General Assembly in passing the act, as expressed by it, is the controlling factor, and in ascertaining this \u2018the application of common sense to the language, is not to be excluded.\u2019 <em>Rawson </em>v. <em>State, </em>19 Conn. 292, 299.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bello, </em>133 Conn. 600, 604, 53 A.2d 381. The act of parking a car on the highway is \u201cthe voluntary act of leaving a par on the highway when not in use.\u201d <em>Kastler </em>v. <em>Tures, </em>191 Wis. 120, 124, 210 N.W. 415. The word \u201cpark\u201d means something more than a mere temporary or momentary stoppage on the road for a necessary purpose. <em>Dare </em>v. <em>Boss, </em>111 Ore. 190, 197, 224 P. 646. It is clear, as maintained by the defendant, that a motor vehicle is parked upon a public highway within the contemplation of \u00a7 2350 (30) only when it is placed upon the highway in the manner contemplated by the provisions of \u00a7 2509. It follows that the plaintiff\u2019s car was not \u201clegally parked,\u201d at the time of the accident, within the meaning of \u00a7 1053c. The court did not err in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\u25a0 In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\"> \u201cSec. 1051c.
