Subsequently, the board issued its complaint and, with an accompanying notice of the time and place for a hearing, served it on the company. After holding numerous hearings, at which voluminous evidence was submitted by the parties, the board reached the conclusions, among others, that the company had interfered with its employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed by \u00a7 7392, that it had discharged five employees because of their union activities, and that it had refused to negotiate in good faith with the union. The board thereupon issued an order that the company (1) cease and desist from interfering with its employees in their pursuit of the right to organize and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choice, (2) proceed, upon request, to bargain collectively with the union, and (3) offer to reinstate three of the discharged employees whom it had refused to rehire, with compensation for the loss of pay suffered by them. Claiming to be aggrieved by the order, the company appealed to the Superior Court. The court affirmed the action of the board, except in one particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>concerning which, the parties raise no question, and from the judgment rendered the company has appealed to this court. The appeal presents two assignments of error, first, the failure of the court to set aside the findings of fact and conclusions of the board, and, second, the ruling of the court that the individuals whom the company was ordered to offer to reinstate were employees when the order was issued. We shall examine these in sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Chapter 370 of the General Statutes is entitled \u201cLabor Relations Act.\u201d Originally enacted in 1945,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it was predicated upon, and its phraseology patterned after, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-166. For this reason, the judicial interpretation frequently accorded the federal act is of great assistance and persuasive force in the interpretation of our own act. See <em>Arnold College </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>131 Conn. 503, 507, 41 A.2d 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The labor relations board, created by General Statutes, \u00a7 7389, is required to hold hearings on all complaints charging an employer with any of the enumerated unfair labor practices. \u00a7\u00a77394 (4), 7392. The employer is given the right to file an answer and to appear in person or otherwise to defend against the complaint. Ibid. \u201cIf, upon all the testimony, the board determines that the employer has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair labor practice, it shall state its finding of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such employer an order requiring him to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and shall take such further affirmative action as will effectuate the policies\u201d of the chapter. \u00a77394 (5). The legislature has provided that any person aggrieved by a final order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the hoard may obtain a review thereof in the Superi- or Court by filing a petition praying that the order be modified or set aside. \u00a7 7395 (4). One phase of the procedure for review is dissimilar to that followed in appeals from awards of workmen\u2019s compensation and unemployment commissioners. In those appeals, a motion to correct the finding is not only permitted but on most occasions foreshadows the decisive assignment of error that there was no evidence to support specific subordinate facts found. In cases originating before the labor relations board, a motion to correct is not available. The review is had upon the entire record, which the board must certify and file in court. \u00a7 7395 (4). This record includes what \u00a7 7394 (5) calls a \u201cfinding of fact.\u201d Such a finding need not incorporate the set of subordinate facts customarily included in a finding. It complies with the statute if it states the ultimate finding upon each charge of unfair labor practice. The Superior Court, to which the aggrieved person comes, does not try the matter de novo. Its function is not to adjudicate the facts. <em>Lanyon </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>139 Conn. 20, 28, 89 A.2d 558; see <em>DeMond </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>129 Conn. 642, 645, 30 A.2d 547. It can do nothing more, on the factual questions, than to examine the record to determine whether the ultimate findings of the board were supported, as the statute requires, by substantial evidence. \u00a77395 (2). If it is determined that they were, the findings cannot be disturbed. Ibid.; see <em>Carper </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>139 Conn. 515, 520, 95 A.2d 378; <em>Almada </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>137 Conn. 380, 391, 77 A.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Substantial evidence is evidence that carries conviction. <em>Matter of Di Nardo </em>v. <em>Monaghan, </em>282 App. Div. 5, 7, 121 N.Y.S.2d 119. It is such relevant evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>dence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Consolidated Edison Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S. Ct. 206, 83 L. Ed. 126. It means something more than a mere scintilla and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established. <em>Purity Food Co. </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations, </em>17 Conn. Sup. 199, 204; <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S. Ct. 501, 83 L. Ed. 660; <em>McCague </em>v. <em>New York, C. &amp; St. L.R. Co., </em>225 Ind. 83, 89, 71 N.E.2d 569; <em>Pennsylvania State Board </em>v. <em>Schireson, </em>360 Pa. 129, 133, 61 A.2d 343. To be sure, the statute provides that the board shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence prevailing in the courts. \u00a77394 (4). This provision was undoubtedly adopted by the General Assembly to give this administrative agency more freedom to investigate than a court enjoys. But this freedom does not permit the board to base its orders on evidence having no rational probative force. <em>Consolidated Edison Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>supra, 230; <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Director, </em>331 Mass. 101, 103, 117 N.E.2d 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">.. The question, then, that the court had to answer was whether there was substantial evidence before the board to warrant its ultimate findings. Prom the evidence submitted by the parties, the board could reasonably have found the following facts: The company is engaged in the laundry and dry-cleaning business in Waterbury. During the time of these narrated events, Milton A. Gardner, vice president, and Gerald T. Beuter, sales manager, were in active charge of the business. On June 3, 1952, the company had in its employ forty-five persons, some classified as inside, and others as outside, employees. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>latter consisted of five delivery drivers, John J. Bergin, Sr., John F. Reilly, Maurice St. Pierre, Henry J. Collette and Lomer R. Belval. During the preceding January, a movement to organize the employees was begun. The plan was to organize the inside workers into one bargaining unit and the five drivers into another. From the very beginning, the movement was bitterly opposed by Gardner and Reuter. On first hearing about it, they arranged for and held meetings with the inside workers. On those occasions, Gardner and Reuter tried to discourage membership in the proposed local and referred to the union\u2019s organizers in a disparaging and offensive manner. To counteract the movement, the company granted the inside employees certain economic benefits such as additional paid holidays and a free hospitalization and medical program. Furthermore, the company promised that it would apply to the office of price stabilization for a change in rates, which, if granted, would permit a wage increase. The antiunion hostility of the company was so strong that on January 31, 1952, Reuter discharged one inside worker and on the following day Gardner discharged another because of their union activities. By methods such as those described above, the company succeeded in thwarting the unionization of the inside workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The company was equally antagonistic toward the plan of the drivers to organize, but its efforts proved unsuccessful. On January 17, 1952, the drivers joined the union and on January 29 unanimously designated it as their exclusive bargaining representative. The company, however, continued its attempt to interfere. Early in February, it offered $1000 to one of the drivers as an inducement to have him exert his influence over the other four and urge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>them to withdraw from the union. On February 5, the board certified the union as the exclusive representative of the drivers for collective bargaining purposes. Negotiations began shortly thereafter and continued intermittently until April 2. During February, the drivers complained about the dilatory tactics of the company in negotiating a contract and threatened to strike. After an agent from the state board of mediation and arbitration interceded at the company\u2019s request, negotiations were resumed and culminated in an oral agreement concerning the terms and conditions of the proposed contract. The parties agreed that their understanding should be reduced to writing by the attorney for the company and that the attorney for the union should prepare a joint application to be forwarded to the wage stabilization board for approval of an increase in commissions and certain fringe benefits. Certain data needed to comply with the requirements of the wage board were to be obtained by the company and submitted to the union. This was never done. After April 2, the company continued its efforts to frustrate the union. Miss Mary McCarthy, the president and chief stockholder of the company, tried to persuade the drivers to abandon their membership in the union. On one occasion she told one of the drivers that a certain lawyer could tell him how they could withdraw from the union and still retain their jobs. She gave him the lawyer\u2019s telephone number, and, in her presence, the driver telephoned the lawyer and made an appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The union, by letter dated May 5, 1952, advised the company that unless the contract was signed by May 10, 1952, it would conclude that the company was not bargaining in good faith. The contract still remained unsigned on June 1. On the evening of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>that day, all the drivers except Belval met with the union\u2019s representatives. The men knew of the contents of the letter of May 5 and believed that the company had no intention of executing the contract at any time. Pursuant to a plan devised at the meeting, all five drivers went to the laundry on the following morning but refused to make deliveries on their various routes until the contract was signed. They stayed around the laundry the entire day, limiting themselves to making and correcting tickets for use in the addressograph, and a few other odd jobs. On the following day, June 3, they again appeared at the laundry at the customary starting time. They again said that they would not work their routes until the contract was signed. About 11:45 a.m., Reuter met with and asked them whether they were going to make deliveries. Upon being told that they would not do so until the company signed the contract, Reuter discharged them. Two of the drivers, Collette and Belval, were later notified that they had not been discharged but merely suspended. They were subsequently reinstated. The three other drivers were not re-employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The mere recital of the foregoing is ample to demonstrate that there was substantial evidence of all save one<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the unfair labor practices charged in the complaint. Contrary to the provisions of \u00a7 7391,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the company indulged in a course of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>duct designed to interfere with, its employees\u2019 right of self-organization and of engaging in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining. The company also violated certain provisions of \u00a7 7392<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and by so doing has been guilty of unfair labor practices. Because of its findings, the board entered a cease and desist order against the continued violation of these statutes. The board also ordered that the company offer to reinstate Bergin, Reilly and St. Pierre and that they be given back pay less any wages earned by them since June 3. This phase of the board\u2019s action is seriously challenged and brings us to a discussion of the second assignment of error. This assignment is, as previously stated, that the court erred in affirming the order because, as a matter of law, Bergin, Reilly and St. Pierre had been discharged for cause and were not employees of the plaintiff when the order was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The board has jurisdiction only over those between whom there exists the relationship of employer and employee. The contention urged by the company that the board acted without jurisdiction in ordering the reinstatement of the three drivers with back pay rests on the assumption that the relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ship of employer and employee had come to an end when, on June 3,1952, the company discharged them. This contention ascribes a fallacious significance to the oral words of discharge uttered by Reuter on that day. Under certain circumstances, the relationship existing between employer and employee is not terminated, for the application of the Labor Relations Act, in so cavalier a manner. The act enlarges the ordinary concept of the status of an employee. It provides that the word \u201cemployee\u201d shall \u201cinclude, but shall not be restricted to . . . any individual whose employment has ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor practice, and who has not obtained any other regular and substantially equivalent employment.\u201d \u00a77388 (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The Labor Relations Act does not interfere with the normal exercise of an employer\u2019s right to discharge his employees. The discharge, however, must not amount to a subterfuge to circumvent the provisions of the act. <em>Williams Motor Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>128 F.2d 960, 964. Discharge is legally possible as long as the employer does not, under cover of his rights, attempt to intimidate or coerce his employees with respect to their self-organization and representation. <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation, </em>301 U.S. 1, 45, 57 S. Ct. 615, 81 L. Ed. 893. Where employees have been discharged as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor practice, their employment has not been terminated. See <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Cape County Milling Co., </em>140 F.2d. 543, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The company relies almost exclusively, in justifying its claimed discharge, upon the events of June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>2 and 3. This is too narrow a view to take. The whole history of the events which had occurred since the employees began to organize must be considered. The attitude of the drivers on June 2 and 3 is not to be commended but, under the circumstances, is not controlling. As the court so aptly observed in its memorandum of decision, \u201cWhen the men adopted their misguided course of conduct on June 2nd and 3rd which cannot be approved of as lawful concerted activities, the employer promptly discharged them. No assurance was then given them that the contract, so long delayed, would be forthcoming. They did one wrong thing and were promptly penalized although the Laundry had done one wrong thing after another for five months. From this whole picture the Board has drawn the inference that the insubordination was not the real reason for the discharge but was merely a pretext, avidly seized upon to get rid of these men for the unwelcome union activities.\u201d The cases cited by the company are clearly distinguishable. The court was correct in ruling that the order of the board involved individuals who still remained employees of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\"> General Statutes, Sup. 1945, \u00a7\u00a7 933b-946h.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-5\"> Among the several charges, set forth in the complaint, of interference by the company with the rights of the employees to organize was one alleging that the interference consisted of \u201c[cjhanging the working conditions of certain of the employees resulting in a loss in their weekly earnings, for the purpose of discouraging their interest, activity and membership in the union.\u201d The board expressly found that, this charge had not been established and dismissed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\"> \u201cSec. 7391. rights 03? employees.
