The tax has been as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>sessed with respect to property disposed of under a power of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The stipulated facts, taken from the pleadings and exhibits, follow: John Moran died a resident of New Haven on June 17, 1951. He left his wife, Agnes Moran, surviving, but no close blood relatives. He was seventy-eight years old. His wife was eighty-eight. They had been married fifty-four years. His will was dated December 28,1950. After bequeathing his automobile, jewelry and apparel to his wife, and modest sums to four persons who had worked for him or for two corporations in which he was interested, he provided, in article five, for the division of his residuary estate, amounting approximately to $2,000,000, into two trust funds. One, designated trust A, was to provide for his wife. The other, trust B, was a charitable trust in favor of certain religious and charitable organizations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Trust A was set up to provide a comfortable living for Mrs. Moran; all the income from it was payable to her. To make certain that she should not want, John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Moran gave bis trustees the power to apply the principal of trust A and so much of the income of trust B as they might deem necessary, without securing the consent of the beneficiaries of trust B, to her maintenance during her lifetime. He also gave her a general power of appointment over the principal of trust A. If she failed to exercise this power, the two trust funds were to be combined into one after her death, and the income was to he paid to the beneficiaries of trust B. None of the income from trust B was to he paid to the beneficiaries thereof until Mrs. Moran died. Thereafter, they were to receive the income until certain stock in The Guilford-Chester Water Company and The Clinton Electric Light and Power Company, two local utilities which John Moran controlled, was sold, or until twenty years after Mrs. Moran\u2019s death, whichever occurred first. The principal was then to be apportioned among them pursuant to percentages stated in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">John Moran\u2019s estate was valued for tax purposes at nearly $2,000,000. A federal estate tax of $71,316 has been assessed and paid. It is estimated that the state succession tax will he about $93,000. After all deductions, including federal and state taxes assessed against his estate and payable out of trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>B, approximately $971,000 will be allocable to trust A and $798,000 to trust B.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In article eight, at the end of his will, John Moran provided for the payment of inheritance, transfer and estate taxes out of the funds allocable to trust B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The interpretation of this article presents the issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Agnes Moran died on March 30, 1952, before her husband\u2019s estate was settled. Neither trust A nor trust B had been set up. She had made a will on July 13, 1951, twenty-six days after her husband\u2019s death, in which, in article six, she exercised the power of appointment given to her in her husband\u2019s will in favor of a brother and eight nieces and nephews. The power having been exercised in this manner, the estate of Mrs. Moran became subject to a federal estate tax estimated to be approximately $271,000. The allocation of the ultimate burden of so much of this tax as is attributable to the exercise of the power of appointment affords the basis for the present controversy. The questions presented in the reservation appear in full in the footnote.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The answers to these questions require that we find and effectuate John Moran\u2019s intent with respect to the payment of this tax. We look to the will as an entirety and examine the particular words and language used in the light of the circumstances under which they were written. <em>Chase National Bank </em>v. <em>Guthrie, </em>139 Conn. 178, 182, 90 A.2d 643. Do they express an intention that the funds in trust B shall be used to pay the federal estate tax assessed against the estate of Agnes Moran because she exercised the power of appointment? The will appears to have been prepared by an expert draftsman. At this point, it is well to state that John Moran disposed of his estate in a manner allowed by law to obviate the payment of large estate and inheritance taxes. The corpus of trust B is exempt as a bequest for charitable purposes. Int. Rev. Code of 1939, \u00a7 812(d), as amended, 64 Stat. 959 (1950). By giving his widow a power of appointment over the corpus of trust A, from which she was to receive support during her lifetime, he qualified this corpus for the federal estate tax marital deduction provisions. Int. Rev. Code of 1939, \u00a7 812(e) (1) (A), (F), added by 62 Stat. 118 (1948). In default of the exercise of the power, the corpus of trust A would pass to charitable purposes and would likewise be exempt from the federal estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Succession taxes are payable by the recipients of the property with respect to which the tax is as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>sessed. <em>Hackett </em>v. <em>Bankers Trust Co., </em>122 Conn. 107, 126, 187 A. 653; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 2052, 2060. Prior to 1945, estate taxes were payable out of the general estate; <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Green, </em>136 Conn. 138, 140, 69 A.2d 289; <em>Ericson </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>124 Conn. 66, 81, 198 A. 176. Chapter 102 of the General Statutes, enacted in 1945, provides that estate taxes are payable pro rata by the recipients of the taxable property in essentially the same manner as are succession taxes. The operation of these rules can be altered or avoided by testamentary direction. <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Watrous, </em>116 Conn. 448, 451, 165 A. 459; <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>89 Conn. 190, 194, 93 A. 241. The testamentary direction, however, must be expressed in specific and unambiguous language because, in most cases, it can have a very material effect upon those who share in that part of the estate from which it is directed that the taxes are to be paid. <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In article eight, John Moran directed that \u201call\u201d taxes \u201clevied or assessed upon or with respect to any property which is included as a part of [his] gross estate for the purpose of any such tax\u201d should be paid solely out of the portion of his estate comprising trust B and that they should not \u201cbe prorated or apportioned among or charged against the respective devisees, legatees, beneficiaries, transferees or other recipients, nor charged against any other property passing or which may have passed to any of them.\u201d It is true that the recipients of the corpus of trust A under the power of appointment exercised by Agnes Moran derive their title from John\u2019s, and not from Agnes\u2019, estate. <em>McMurtry </em>v. <em>State, </em>111 Conn. 594, 601, 151 A. 252. This, however, is not determinative of our question. The value of the corpus of trust A is included in Agnes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Moran\u2019s gross taxable estate, not because her estate had title to it but because she exercised a power of appointment over it. Int. Rev. Code of 1939, \u00a7 811(f), as amended, 65 Stat. 91 (1951). Article eight by its very terms is concerned with taxes assessed with respect to property included in the gross estate of John Moran \u201cfor the purpose of any such tax,\u201d i.e. for the purpose of legacy, succession, inheritance, transfer and estate taxes on his estate. It anticipates the circumstances he believed would exist at the time of his death. It directs that the taxes so referred to shall be paid by his executors solely out of the property comprising the portion of his estate known as trust B and shall not be \u201ccharged against any other property passing or which may have passed to [his beneficiaries].\u201d The will thus deliberately deals only with transfers already made or those to be made by its direction. It concerns only the taxes normally payable in the course of the settlement of John Moran\u2019s estate, and not the taxes to be assessed in the future with respect to some other person\u2019s gross taxable estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Although Agnes Moran was an aged woman, John could not foresee how long she might outlive him. He took every precaution to care for her. However, he could not know when or whether the power of appointment would be exercised. His widow might exercise it in favor of someone unknown to him. The amount of any tax on the exercise of the power of appointment or, indeed, whether there would be any tax was also problematical. A testator who caused a will to be drafted with such meticulous attention to the incidence of taxes could not conceivably have intended by article eight to leave so much to chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The language and the intent of article eight are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>not unusual. This article is taken almost verbatim from the form recommended by the committee on bank and bar relations of the Connecticut Bar Association and the Connecticut Bankers Association in a pamphlet dated August 1, 1946. See 3 Locke <em>&amp; </em>Kohn, Conn. Probate Practice, p. 160; <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Green, </em>136 Conn. 138, 145, 69 A.2d 289. This tax clause was obviously designed to nullify the effect of the statute on proration of federal and state estate taxes, now chapter 102 of the G-eneral Statutes, enacted the previous year. Sup. 1945, \u00a7\u00a7 314h-319h, 322h. Since the proration statute by its terms covered only taxes on the decedent\u2019s own estate, it may fairly be inferred that the testator, by using the clause drafted by the joint committee, referred only to taxes on his own estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">This is a case of first impression in Connecticut. The courts of Illinois, New York and Pennsylvania, however, have held, for reasons which appear persuasive to us, that clauses similar to the one in the case at bar do not apply to taxes assessed against the estate of a person to whom a testator had given a power of appointment. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>342 Ill. App. 352, 356, 96 N.E.2d 634; <em>Matter of Duryea, </em>277 N.Y. 310, 317, 14 N.E.2d 369; <em>Matter of Vanderbilt, </em>180 Misc. 431, 436, 39 N.Y.S.2d 941, aff\u2019d, 295 N.Y. 964, 68 N.E.2d 50; <em>Marvin\u2019s Estate, </em>26 Pa. D. &amp; C. 527, 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Accordingly, we answer question (a) \u201cNo.\u201d In the view we take of the case, question (b) cannot be answered categorically, at least without construing the tax clause in the will of Agnes Moran and considering the nature and devolution of her other taxable estate. Since the interpretation of her will has not been argued before us, we decline to answer the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>No costs will be taxed in this court in favor of any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\"> \u201cabtioi.e five.
