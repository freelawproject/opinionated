His case was tried to the court. He was found guilty on each of the three counts and has appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">The facts are as follows: On or about February 23, 1946, the defendant, by his attorney, filed with the commission of opticians his application for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>permit as a licensed optician. In an accompanying letter, it was stated that the defendant had reservations as to the validity of the statutes providing for the licensing of opticians and that the application was filed without waiver of his rights. The commission approved his application for a license and notified him to appear in Hartford on April 18, 1946, for an examination. By letter to the commission dated April 17, his attorney claimed that \u00a7 665h of the 1945 Supplement to the General Statutes, then in effect, neither permitted nor required the taking of an examination as a prerequisite to obtaining a license and stated that the defendant would not submit to the examination. In addition, it was claimed that, if \u00a7 665h did require the defendant to take an examination, it was discriminatory and unconstitutional. On October 30, 1946, the commission notified the defendant to appear for examination on November 11. On November 5, his attorney notified the commission that the defendant again refused to take any examination, on the grounds previously stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">On February 5 and 11, 1954, the defendant produced and reproduced ophthalmic lenses, mounted them to supporting materials and fitted them by mechanical means. He also operated an optical store in Bridgeport where he made and dispensed reproductions of optical glasses. He had not obtained any of the licenses provided for by \u00a7\u00a7 4508 and 1702c. For at least eleven years he had engaged in business as an optician and had maintained an optical establishment in Bridgeport.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The defendant claims that \u00a7 4508, the violation of which was charged in the first count, is unconstitutional and invalid, \u201cin that it, together with Section 665h of the 1945 Supplement to the General Statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>and Section 767i of the 1947 Supplement to the General Statutes, as amended,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> constitutes a grant of exclusive public emoluments or privileges, deprives him of liberty and property without due course or process of law, abridges his privileges and immunities and denies him the equal protection of the laws. He asserts that \u00a7 4508 had its origin in \u00a7 665h, which was, he contends, as he did in 1946, unconstitutional and invalid because of the provisions contained in its subsections (e), (d) and (e). He takes the position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>that licenses held by others at the time he was convicted under \u00a7 4508 were renewals of licenses which were issued without examination by the commission under, and by the purported authority contained in, subsections (c), (d) and (e) of \u00a7 665h and which were invalid because they had been granted to holders of licenses or renewals of licenses previously issued, without examination, under and by the provisions of \u00a7 1164c of the 1935 Cumulative Supplement to the General Statutes, which was held invalid for uncertainty in <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Keegan, </em>132 Conn. 33, 38, 42 A.2d 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The rationale of the contention of the defendant that \u00a7 4508 is unconstitutional is that he was discriminated against in being tried and convicted under it while other persons who had invalid licenses, obtained without examination and under the provisions of invalid statutes, were permitted to make and fit ophthalmic products. He does not maintain that the provisions of \u00a7 4508 or those of any other existing statute permitted or caused the situation of which he complains. On the contrary, he relies upon invalid provisions of \u00a7 1164c of the 1935 Cumulative Supplement, which was repealed in 1945, at the time when \u00a7 665h became effective; Sup. 1945, \u00a7 667h; and claimed invalid provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 665h and 767i, which were repealed when the 1949 Eevision, which included \u00a74508, became effective on January 15, 1949. General Statutes \u00a7 8894; Public Act No. 8, Spec. Sess., Aug. 1948. Any discussion of the claims of error as to matters in the determination of which \u00a7\u00a7 1164c, 665h and 767i were involved would be academic as far as the decision of this case is concerned. It is the established policy of this court not to decide issues of that nature. <em>Anastasio </em>v. <em>Gulf Oil Corporation, </em>131 Conn. 708, 719, 42 A.2d 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>It is true that the trial court did conclude that the validation of licenses, permits and certificates of others and the denial of an optician\u2019s license to the defendant under \u00a7 665h did not abridge his privileges or immunities, did not deny him the equal protection of the laws, did not deprive him of liberty and property without due process of law and did not constitute a grant of exclusive public emoluments or privileges. The correctness of these conclusions, however, is immaterial if the conclusion that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of violation of \u00a7 4508, as charged in the first count, is supported by other valid grounds. <em>Chouinard </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>139 Conn. 728, 732, 97 A.2d 562; <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>American Brass Co., </em>135 Conn. 10, 16, 60 A.2d 661; <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>107 Conn. 117, 119, 139 A. 702; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc., \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Section 4508 authorizes the commission of opticians \u201cto issue license certificates ... to all persons who lawfully apply for the same, upon their submitting to the commission an acceptable written application, and after they have passed examinations\u201d as thereinafter provided. It contains no provision empowering the commission to issue a license certificate to any person who has not passed the required examination. The statute under which the defendant was convicted in the first count is not unconstitutional on the grounds claimed by him. If it should be determined in a proper proceeding that other persons who, as claimed by the defendant, had invalid licenses were making and fitting ophthalmic products in violation of the provisions of \u00a7 4508, their having done so would not relieve the defendant from complying with its requirements. In any event, it is not for us to determine in this case whether others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>have violated the law. The trial court did not err in finding the defendant guilty on the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The defendant also maintains that he should not have been found guilty on the second and third counts, in which he was charged with operating an optical establishment without an optical license selling permit and with processing optical glasses and instruments without an optical license processing permit, as required by the provisions of \u00a7 1702c of the 1953 Cumulative Supplement. He contends that the same considerations apply as in the case of the optician\u2019s license provided for in \u00a7 4508, on the .ground that \u00a7 665h permitted the commission to practice the same claimed arbitrary discrimination in issuing licenses for the operation of optical establishments as in issuing opticians\u2019 licenses. Our discussion of his claim that \u00a7 4508 is unconstitutional answers this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">His next claim is that \u00a7 1702c is inoperative since it is entirely dependent on \u00a7 4508 and since it permits the issuance of a license for operating an optical establishment only if it is under the supervision of an optician holding a license issued in accordance with the provisions of \u00a74508, which he claims is unconstitutional. As we hold that \u00a74508 is constitutional, no discussion of this claim is required. Notwithstanding his assertion that \u00a7 1702c is entirely dependent on \u00a7 4508, he contends that chapter :217 of the General Statutes, which embraces \u00a7\u00a7 4500 to 4524 inclusive and \u00a7\u00a7 1700c to 1704c of the 1953 Cumulative Supplement, is void for uncertainty in so far as it provides for the licensing of optical establishments. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Counsel for the defendant stated, during oral argument, that the defendant did not, at the times \u2022charged in the information and for many years prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>thereto, have a license for the reason that he was not required to have one because of the claimed invalidity of the statutes. In spite of this, the defendant claims that his conviction for violating \u00a7 1702c cannot be sustained, since it does not appear that he did not hold, under \u00a7 4507, an optical license permit, which he contends would permit the doing of the acts with which he was charged in the second and third counts. A short and sufficient answer to-this claim is that, since it was not included in the claims of law made by him at the trial, we are not bound to consider it. <em>England </em>v. <em>England, </em>138 Conn. 410, 416, 85 A.2d 483; <em>Petrillo </em>v. <em>Maiuri, </em>138 Conn. 557, 562, 86 A.2d 869; Maltbie, Conn.
