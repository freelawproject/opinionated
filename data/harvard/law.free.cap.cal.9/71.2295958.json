Sometime in the same month, Hill recovered a judgment in said Justice's Court, against McAllister, for $185. No execution was issued on this judgment. Subsequently Haycock purchased of McAllister a mining-claim, and paid for the same by satisfying this judgment. Hill assented to this arrangement, and agreed to look to Haycock for the amount of the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">The money on the Newman execution was put in Haycock\u2019s safe; Hill was notified of its collection, and that the money was ready for him. Hill said that he had no use for it, and that if Haycock wished to use it he could do so. Haycock afterwards used the money. Three or four months after this Hill called on Haycock for the money, and, he not being able to pay it, it was agreed that Haycock should pay interest on the amount, at the rate of two per cent, per month. Haycock paid $50 of the amount, to Hill\u2019s attorney. Judgment was rendered in favor of defendants, from which plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b86-6\"><em>C. J.
