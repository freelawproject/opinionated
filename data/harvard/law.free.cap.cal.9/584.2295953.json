The plaintiff was a tenant of defendant, occupying a wooden house, and defendant wishing to erect, on the lot so occupied by plaintiff, a brick building, made with the plaintiff the following written agreement :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-10\">\u201cKnow all men by these presents, that I, Rosa Hermosilla, of Sacramento city, California, in consideration of the giving up of a lease, now held by John Hash, of same city, to a wooden building situated on J street, south side, Ho. 220, next to the corner of Eighth street, owned by me, do promise, well and faithfully to perform, to wit: erect a brick building to cover the lot, or such portion of lot, now occupied by aforesaid Hash, as will be satisfactory to him, and the said Hash to have possession within three weeks; and on completion, the aforesaid party is to have possession for six months, with the privilege of twelve months or more, and in case of failure on my part to fulfill my promise as above, I will pay the said Hash the sum of five hundred dollars damages.

R., 258, the case of Williams <em>v. </em>Dakin is cited and approved, and an agreement, nearly in the same terms used in the bond sued on in this case, is held to be for liquidated damages.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b600-9\"><em>Cross &amp; Marshall </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-10\">1. When several covenants are to be performed, and a large sum is named at the end of the covenants to be paid upon the breach of performance of either, it must be considered as a penalty. Chitty on Contracts, 758; 2 Greenleaf on Evidence, 268, \u00a7 258.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-11\">The sum of $500 was intended as collateral security for the faithful performance of the several promises mentioned in the agreement, and must be considered as a penalty. Moore <em>v. </em>Platte Co., 8 Missouri, 267; 2 Grreenleaf\u2019s Evidence, 268, \u00a7 258.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-12\">The intention of the parties was to secure to the plaintiff the possession of the brick store within a reasonable time, which was the principal object, and the enjoyment of that object must be considered as the principal intent of the agreement, and the $500 a penalty. Spencer <em>v. </em>Tilden, 5 Cowen\u2019s Rep., 144, and note B on p. 150; Dennis <em>v. </em>Cummins, 3 Johns. Cases, 297.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-13\">When a sum of money in gross is to be paid for the non-performance of an agreement, it is considered as a penalty. Tayloe <em>v. </em>Sandiford, 7 Wheaton, 13.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-14\">The only breach assigned by the plaintiff is that the defendant failed to give him possession in three weeks, then the only damage sustained by the plaintiff would be the amount of rent that he paid, above the amount he agreed to pay the defendant during the time he was kept out of possession beyond the three weeks mentioned in the agreement. That amount a jury could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>ascertain with a reasonable certainty, therefore the gross sum. of \u00a7500 must be considered as a penalty. Hoag <em>v. </em>McGinnis, 22 Wendell, 163; Spear <em>v. </em>Smith, 1 Denio, 464.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-5\">The gross sum of \u00a7500 mentioned, will not, of course, be considered as liquidated damages, and it will be incumbent on the party claiming them as such, to show that they were so considered by the contracting parties. This has not been shown, and the amount stated must be considered as a penalty. Tayloe <em>v. </em>Sandiford, 7 Wheaton, 13.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-6\">In general it is the tendency and preference of the law to regard a sum stated to be \u00a1payable if a contract is not fulfilled, as a penalty, and not as liquidated damages, because then it may be apportioned to the loss actually sustained. Moore <em>v. </em>Platte Co., 8 Missouri Rep., 467.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b601-7\">Burnett, J., delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Terry, C. J., concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The cases upon this subject are numerous, and it is difficult to deduce from them any certain and definite rule. In fact, the transactions of individuals are so various, and the circumstances of many cases so peculiar, that no certain rule can be adopted for all cases. But, from the decisions, the following results seem to be substantially correct:</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">1. When the party stipulates to pay a stated sum for a given period of time during the continuance of the failure, then the damages are to be considered as liquidated. (Aylet <em>v. </em>Dodd, 2 Atk., 238 ; Fletcher <em>v. </em>Dyck, 2 Term R., 32 ; Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 Wend., 468.)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">2. When the agreement is not to cany on trade at a particular place ; not to run a stage-coach on a particular road; not to publish a rival newspaper; not to run a rival steamer on a particular route. In all these cases, the sum stated must be taken as liquidated damages. (Green <em>v. </em>Price, 13 Meeson &amp; W., 695; Leighton <em>v. </em>Wales, 3 ib., 545; Williams <em>v. </em>Dakin, 22 Wend., 401; Cal. Steam Nav. Co. <em>v. </em>Wright, 6 Cal., 258.)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">3. When the party stipulates to marry no other person; to convey land or pay a named sum, the price of the land having been received by him; the damages are liquidated. (Lowe <em>v. </em>Peers, 3 Burr., 225; Slasson <em>v. </em>Beadle, 7 John., 71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">4. When a named sum is to bo paid for every acre of land ploughed up contrary to agreement; when a stated sum is to be paid for each article not delivered; the damages must be considered as liquidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">5. When the party stipulates to erect a building in a particular manner, within a given time, and upon failure to pay a named sum, it must be considered in the nature of a penalty. (Tayloe <em>v. </em>Sandiford, 7 Wheaton, 13 ; Moore &amp; Hunt <em>v. </em>Platte County, 8 Mo., 467.)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>In Taylor <em>v. </em>Sandiford, Chief Justice Marshall said : \u201cIn general, a sum of money in gross, to be paid for the non-performance of an agreement, is considered as a penalty. * * It will not, of course, be considered as liquidated damages; and it will be incumbent on the party who claims them to show that they were so considered by the contracting parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The present case seems to fall within the rule applicable to building contracts. In this case, the defendant stipulated that she would erect a brick building to cover such portion of the lot as would be satisfactory to plaintiff, and give him possession within three weeks; the plaintiff to have possession for six months, with the privilege of twelve months, or more; and upon failure to perform the agreement, she was to pay to plaintiff the sum of five hundred dollars damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">It will be seen that there are several things for the defendant to do, a failure to perform any one of which would have been a violation of the agreement. If the building had been erected upon a portion of the lot not satisfactory to the plaintiff, or the house not finished for a single day beyond the stipulated time, the defendant would have been liable for the whole sum, upon the theory of the plaintiff's counsel. So, too, if the plaintiff had been disturbed in his possession for one day, during the term of six months, or denied the privilege of the additional term. There is no statement in the agreement that the sum was to be taken as liquidated damages. If the defendant had failed to erect a suitable brick building, although finished within the time specified, it would have been a violation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">We are of opinion that the damages mentioned were not liquidated, but a mere penalty to secure the performance of the contract, or the payment of such damages as the plaintiff might be entitled to under the circumstances. In building contracts, it may be difficult to say what amount of injury the plaintiff has sustained by reason of the non-completion of the building within the exact time stated. And yet this difficulty in ascertaining the amount of the injury occasioned by the delay, has not induced the Courts, in such cases, to consider the sum as liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
