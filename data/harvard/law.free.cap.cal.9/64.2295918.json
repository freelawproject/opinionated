Collyer on Part., \u00a7\u00a7 245, 246.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-6\">It appears that plaintiff and defendants Steel, Gould, and Til-den, are partners. Plaintiff and defendant Steel each owning one-third interest, and defendants Gould and Tilden one-third. It also appears, that there is due plaintiff, from the firm, the sum of $4,580, and that defendant Porter holds two mortgages against the interest of defendants Gould and Tilden, which were given to secure the purchase-money of said Gould\u2019s and Tilden\u2019s interest in the firm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-7\">At the time of Porter\u2019s sale to Gould and Tilden, there were no demands against the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-8\">The Court decreed a dissolution of the partnership, according to the prayer of the complaint, but further decreed, that one-third part of the proceeds of the sale be paid into Court, to abide its farther order, upon the determination and adjustment of the priority of liens upon that portion of the property belonging to defendants Gould and Tilden, and that the remaining two-thirds of the proceeds of sale be applied to the payment of the $4,580.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-9\">The error consisted in subjecting the share of the defendants Gould and Tilden to the satisfaction of Porter\u2019s mortgage, prior to the satisfaction of partnership debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-10\">A partner has no interest in the partnership stock, beyond the share remaining after the partnership debts are paid.

J., delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Burnett, J., concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">This was an action for a dissolution of a partnership and account.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">From the record, it appears that plaintiff, under contract with the Empire Mill Company, furnished material and performed labor, in building a race and flume for their use, and that the company were indebted to him, on account of such labor and material, in the sum of $4,580; that the Empire Mill Company was composed of plaintiff, and defendants Steel, Gould, and Til-den, plaintiff and Steel owning each one-third interest, and defendants Gould and Tilden owning one-third; that the interest of Gould and Tilden had been purchased from one Porter, and was mortgaged to him to secure the purchase-money.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">The Court decreed a dissolution of the partnership, and a sale of the property; and that, after payment of costs, the proceeds of the two-third parts of the property, belonging to plaintiff and defendant Steel, should be applied to the payment of plaintiff\u2019s demand; and that the remaining one-third interest, belonging to defendants Gould and Tilden, be reserved for the future decision of the Court as to priority of liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">This portion of the decree was erroneous. The debts of a partnership must be discharged from the joint-property, before any portion of it can be applied to the payment of the individual debts of the partners. \u201c Until the affairs of a copartnership are wound up and settled, the claim of a partner is, strictly speaking, merely equitable; for, until then, no action can in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>general be maintained at law, by one partner against another/\u2019 etc. Williams <em>v. </em>Henshaw, H. Peck, 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u25a0 The fact that Porter held a mortgage on the interest of Gould and Tilden was immaterial; they could convey only such interest as they had, which was merely an undivided third of the property which should remain after the debts of the firm were discharged. \u201c At common law, a partnership stock belongs to the partnership, and one partner has no interest in it but his share of what is remaining, after all partnership debts are paid, he also accounting for what he may owe to the firm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Consequently all debts due from the joint-fund must first be discharged, before any partner can appropriate any part of it to his own use, or to the payment of any of his private debts; and a creditor to one of the partners cannot claim any interest but what belongs to his debtor, whether his claim be founded on any contract made with his debtor, or on a seizure of the goods on execution. (6 Mass., 243 ; Coll, on Part., \u00a7 126:)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">That portion of the decree which directed the plaintiff\u2019s claim to be satisfied out of the proceeds of the shares of Chase and Steel, is erroneous. But inasmuch as the case appears to have been fairly tried, and the judgment in other respects to be fully sustained by the facts, as disclosed by the record, it is not necessary that a new trial should be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Judgment reversed, and the Court below directed to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
