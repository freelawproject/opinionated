Peterson was indicted by the grand jury of the County of San Francisco, for converting to his own use certain coin and gold-dust, the property of John A. Clary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The material averment of the indictment is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-5\">\u201cThat Charles M. Peterson, of the city, county, and State, aforesaid, on the twentieth day of June, a. d. one thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven, at the said city and county, beiog then and there the bailee of forty pieces of gold coin usually called twenty-dollar pieces, of the value of eight hundred dollars, and of fifteen ounces and four-fifths of an ounce of gold dust, of the value of two hundred and seventy dollars, the money, goods, and chattels, of John A. Clary, of whom he, the said Charles M. Peterson was then and there the bailee, did then and there as such bailee, as aforesaid, feloniously convert the said forty twenty-dollar gold-pieces, of the value of eight hundred dollars, as aforesaid, and the said gold dust, of the value of two hundred and seventy dollars, to his own use, with the intent, then and there, feloniously to steal the same, contrary to the form, force, and effect of the statute in such case made and provided,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\">To this indictment the defendant plead not guilty, and was tried and convicted, as charged in the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-7\">Defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a new trial, and also in arrest of judgment. Both motions were denied. The motion in arr\u00e9st of judgment was based upon the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-8\">1. That the indictment does not substantially conform to the requirements of sections 237 and 238 of the Criminal Practice Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-9\">2. That the facts stated in the indictment do not constitute a public offence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-10\">The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-11\"><em>W. W. Chipman </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-12\">The indictment is bad in that it does not set out the specific character of the bailee, nor the nature of the bailment, whether <em>depositum, mandatam, commodatum, </em>or any kind. Many \u201cparticular circumstances\u201d are omitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-13\">The facts stated do not constitute a public offence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-14\"><em>Attorney-General </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-15\">This case involves precisely the same questions as that of The People <em>v. </em>Maekinley. Reference is therefore made to the brief on file in that case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b328-16\">Burnett, J., delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Terry, C. J., and Field, J., concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b328-17\">The defendant was indicted, tried, and convicted for the convers\u00f3n to his own use, whilst bailee, of certain coin and gold-dust, the property of one John A. Clary. Motions were made in arrest of judgment and for a new trial, which were overruled by the Court below, and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The indictment is defective in not stating the <em>character of </em>the bailment, and in the description of the coin. (The People <em>v. </em>A. A. Cohen, 8 Cal. R., 42.) It is unnecessary to notice the other points made by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">It is but just to state that the indictment was drawn and the trial had before the decision of this Court in the case of Cohen was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
