J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">This lawsuit, instituted as a class action, was brought on behalf of all riparian property owners who claimed to have an interest in property located on Forked River, Oyster Creek, Barnegat Bay and various lagoons, canals and inlets which are tributaries of those waterways. Defendant is Jersey Central <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Power &amp; Light Co. (JCP&amp;L), a public utility of the State of New Jersey which constructed a nuclear power reactor plant near plaintiffs\u2019 properties. Plaintiffs contend that certain processes employed at the plant have caused damage to their properties by the creation of a warm water environment allowing for the proliferation of shipworms which have, in turn, destroyed wooden docks, appurtenances and other structures which extend into the waterways.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The complaint was filed on November 19,1975, seeking money damages and a restraint against further operation of the plant in such a manner as to cause damage to plaintiffs and other members of subclasses. Eight theories of liability were set forth in the complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">1. Negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">2. Nuisance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">3. Trespass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">4. Strict Liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">5. Violation of N.J. Water Pollution Control Statutes <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>23:5-28, <em>N.J. S.A. </em>58:10-23.1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-11\">6. Violation of Refuse Act of 1899, 33 <em>U.S.C. </em>407.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-12\">7. Violation of the Federal Water Pollution Prevention &amp; Control Act, 33 <em>U.S.C. </em>1251 <em>et seq. </em>and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-13\">8. The unlawful taking of private property without just compensation or inverse condemnation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">A demand for jury trial of all issues was made. Defendant made a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, contending federal law had preempted the field. The trial judge, in an opinion reported at 152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391 (Law Div.1977), relying in part upon <em>State v. Jersey-Central Power and Light Co., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>102 (1976), ruled that \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 attempts to seek money damages through the vehicle of tort claims constitutes at least an indirect interference with defendant\u2019s Radwaste Discharge System. Such state interference is impermissible. This court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims based upon tort liability and statutory violations.\u201d 152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 403. He entered an order dismissing the first seven counts of the complaint. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>fendant\u2019s motion was denied with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 inverse condemnation claim. Additional pretrial motions resulted in the entry of relevant orders:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">1. Dividing plaintiffs into nine subclasses related to geographic areas delineated on a subclass map;</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">2. Bifurcating the action as to liability and damages and</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">3. Directing that the issues of liability on the inverse condemnation claim be tried before a judge without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">At the conclusion of the nine-day trial on liability the judge ruled, in essence, that as to subclass one defendant had caused the shipworm invasion in the area of the subclass, but that plaintiffs had not carried the burden of proving that the claimed damage had been caused by shipworm infestation. As to the other subclasses the judge ruled plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that defendant\u2019s nuclear generating station had proximately caused the complained of damage. The complaint was dismissed. On this appeal plaintiffs challenge three rulings of the trial court. They contend it was error for the trial judge to</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">I. Rule that federal law had preempted the field;</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">II. Deny them a jury trial on the liability phase of the claim for damages based on inverse condemnation;</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">III. Hold that plaintiffs\u2019 had failed to demonstrate that their damages were proximately caused by defendant\u2019s operation of the Oyster Creek nuclear generating station (OCNGS).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">\n<em>Federal Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">The history of the licensing, construction and operation of defendant\u2019s plant is reviewed in detail in the opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>102, 105-106 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">Defendant commenced operation of the nuclear generating station in December 1969. Plaintiffs allege that certain proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>dures established for its continued operation has resulted in a significantly altered marine environment in the south branch of the Forked River-Oyster Creek waters in the area in which plaintiffs\u2019 properties are located. They contend that the operation of the plant, in particular the cooling system, has resulted in higher salinity levels, increased water flow and increased water temperatures. These changes, they allege, have permitted the proliferation of shipworms which have attacked and destroyed wooden docks, bulkheads and appurtenances belonging to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Starting in 1966 Oyster Creek and Forked River were extensively altered in preparation for the nuclear generating station. Both were deepened, straightened and widened to allow for the construction of intake and discharge canals to service the generating station. Salinity levels in portions of the creek which had been brackish to freshwater were changed to higher salinities more characteristic of the bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The south branch of the Forked River serves as the intake canal and the flow of water is toward the generating station whenever the station is in operation and is no longer dependent upon the tidal flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Plaintiffs argue that the cooling system used by the generating station caused or contributed to the shipworm infestation by increasing water flow and releasing a fan-shaped area of warm water at the discharge canal outlet called a thermal plume. The evidence presented to the trial court of the effect of marine environment upon the proliferation of the various species of shipworms is extensively reviewed in the opinion of the trial court in 152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 396-398.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">It is generally agreed that shipworm growth, survival and reproduction is dependent upon the presence of an untreated wood supply, water with constant salinities within certain ranges and water temperature within certain ranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">At the center of this issue of preemption is the cooling system used by defendant. It was described by the trial judge as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Defendant\u2019s nuclear power plant utilizes a once-through cooling system to cool the steam produced by the defendant\u2019s condenser. Water used for this system is brought from the south branch of Forked River and is discharged into Oyster Creek. When water is drawn from the south branch of Forked River, this causes a partial reversal of the normal flow of the river. Through a suction-type operation, saline water is drawn from Bamegat Bay to Forked River, thereby making part of the river saline instead of its natural fresh water state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The issue of federal preemption as it applies to this nuclear generating station and its cooling system was considered by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co. supra. </em>After noting that a nuclear power plant cannot operate without a license from the Atomic Energy Commission and that it must \u201cfunction in accordance with the license terms, including all technical specifications set forth in or attached to the license,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 112, the court held \u201cInterference by the State, whether by statutory penalty, injunction or monetary damages, with these facets of nuclear power generation, regulation of which has been vested exclusively with the AEC, is not permissible.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Plaintiffs concede that this is so but argue here, as they did in the trial court, that the exclusive authority granted to the AEC to license and regulate relates solely to facility construction and operation with respect to radiological hazards, leaving the State free to regulate activities relating to the power plant for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards. Plaintiffs argue further that the exclusive federal regulatory jurisdiction over radiological hazards \u201cin no way deprives a private citizen who has suffered personal or property damage from non-radiological impacts from pursuing his state tort claims against a licensee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Plaintiffs contend the first seven counts of the complaint seek recovery for damages arising from the construction and operation of the nuclear generating station \u2014 claims based solely upon injuries resulting from the plants nonradiological hazards caused by thermal pollution and environmental changes having no bearing upon the future operation of the plant\u2019s system for discharge of radioactive waste. To the contrary, the trial judge found that the alteration of water temperature is directly related to the cooling system which was authorized, approved and licensed by the AEC. Defendant is licensed to operate as it does; it cannot operate in any other manner. He found that the radioactive waste disposal system is an integral part of the cooling system. 152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 398. That factual finding has ample support in credible evidence present in the record as a whole and we will not disturb it. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The conclusions of the trial judge that plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of tort and statutory claims for damages constitute at least an indirect interference with defendant\u2019s radioactive waste discharge system is affirmed, substantially for the reasons expressed by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\n<em>Right to Jury Trial on Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">From the inception of this litigation plaintiffs have demanded a jury trial of all issues. Defendant moved for a nonjury trial on the liability aspect of plaintiffs\u2019 inverse condemnation claim. That motion was granted and that ruling is challenged as error. The parties agreed that plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the eighth count of the complaint was a claim for damages grounded in inverse condemnation. It was also conceded that should the liability of defendant be established, plaintiffs were entitled, as a right, to a jury trial on damages. The dispute concerned plaintiffs\u2019 claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>that they were entitled to a jury trial on the liability aspect of their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Plaintiffs initially argue that the trial judge improperly relied on the convenience aspects of a judge trial as opposed to a jury trial, since it was represented the case would be lengthy and complicated. It is clear that neither complexity nor length of trial is sufficient to deprive a party of a jury trial if he is entitled to it as a matter of right. <em>Keiffer v. Food Products Trucking Co., </em>73 <em>N.J.Super. </em>285, 297 (App.Div.1962), certif. den. 37 <em>N.J. </em>524 (1962); <em>Longo v. Reilly, </em>35 <em>N.J.Super. </em>405, 410 (App.Div.1955), certif. den. 25 <em>N.J. </em>45 (1957). There is no complexity exception to the right of trial by jury under either the Seventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or under the New Jersey Constitution. <em>In re U. S. Financial Securities Litigation, </em>609 F.2d 411 (9 Cir. 1979), <em>(cert. </em>den. in <em>Gant v. Union Bank, </em>446 <em>U.S. </em>929,100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1866, 64 <em>L.Ed.M </em>281 (1980), leaving standing the decision in 609 F.2d 411. However, reading the conclusion of the trial judge on this motion as a whole, we are satisfied he did not base his decision to grant defendant\u2019s motion upon the complexity of the issues or the convenience of a nonjury trial. He was of the view that there was no right to a jury trial on liability in a condemnation case, and he so ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Plaintiffs argue their case involves basically an action for damages based upon a taking of plaintiffs\u2019 properties. They contend they are not seeking the equitable relief of a condemnation, or contesting a condemnation. They claim their action is akin to a tort action \u2014 that a taking had occurred and they were simply seeking damages. They argue that as in any tort action the issues for factual determination were: (1) whether the taking (or tort) had occurred, (2) were defendant\u2019s actions the proximate cause of the same and (3) damages. They argue that they did not seek equitable, injunctive or declaratory relief and that they were entitled to a jury trial as of right. They buttress their arguments by citation to cases in seven other jurisdictions which, they claim, have decided that an inverse condemnation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>plaintiff has a right to a jury trial on liability as well as damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u201cThe constitutional guarantee that \u2018The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate <em>. . .,\u2019 N.J.Const. </em>(1947), Art. I, par. 9, merely preserves the right to a jury trial that existed at common law at the time the <em>New Jersey Constitution </em>of 1776 was adopted.\u201d <em>Peterson v. Albano, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>503, 506 (App.Div. 1978), app. dism. 78 <em>N.J. </em>337 (1978); <em>Plaza v. Flak, </em>7 <em>N.J. </em>215, 224 (1951); <em>Montclair </em>v. <em>Stanoyevich, </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>479, 485 (1951); <em>Steiner v. Stein, </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>367, 378-379 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">There are many civil proceedings known to the common law which were not triable as of right to a jury and hence were not embraced in the constitutional guarantee which came into force July 2, 1776. <em>Steiner v. Stein, </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>at 379; <em>cf. Montclair v. Stanoyevich, </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>at 483. There are also contemporary proceedings which were unknown at common law and which are outside the orbit of the constitutional guarantee of a jury trial (for a partial listing of such actions see 2 <em>Schnitzer &amp; Wildstein, N.J. Rules Service </em>AIV 1256-1260).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Among such contemporary actions which are not triable to a jury as of right are proceedings to condemn property under the power of eminent domain. <em>In re Newark Housing Auth., </em>126 <em>N.J.L. </em>60, 64 (E. &amp; A. 1941); <em>Morris v. Comptroller, </em>54 <em>N.J.L. </em>268, 273 (Sup.Ct.1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Condemnation proceedings are instituted by the condemning authority to assure that the landowner whose property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>has been taken will receive proper compensation. Inverse condemnation proceedings are initiated by the landowner whose property has been taken <em>de facto </em>to obtain proper compensation. <em>In re Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 544 (App.Div.1979). Both actions are controlled by the same statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-1 <em>et seq. Bayshore Sew. Co. v. Dep\u2019t, Environmental Protection, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>184, 202 (Ch.Div.1973), aff\u2019d 131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>37 (App.Div.1974). The owner\u2019s action of inverse condemnation is based on an alleged violation of both federal and state constitutional guarantees of just compensation for property taken for public use. This action is a modern-day concept and post dates the constitutional right to jury trial. New Jersey\u2019s first Constitution of 1776 made no reference to the taking clause. It did not appear until the New Jersey Constitution (1844), Art. I. If 16, Art. VII, 18. It appears in the United States Constitution in Amendments V and XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The right to maintain such proceedings is foreign to the common law and as.such the constitutional right to a jury trial does not attach. <em>Kugler v. Market Develop. Corp., </em>124 <em>N.J.Super. </em>314, 319 (Ch.Div.1973); <em>Quinchia v. Waddington, </em>166 <em>N.J. Super. </em>247 (Law Div. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Although plaintiffs cite out-of-state cases in support of their contention that they are entitled to a jury trial, this issue is one that is decided by the individual states because the issue is related to the constitution, statutes and rules of procedure of the individual State. (See <em>Port of N.Y. Auth. v. Heming, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>144 (1961), <em>cert. </em>den. 367 <em>U.S. </em>487, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>1676, 6 L.Ed.2d 1241 (1961), where the court (at 156) noted the different procedures employed by the individual states in condemnation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">There are two basic issues involved in plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The second is damages, but before that issue can be reached there must first be a determination as to whether there has been a taking, and if there has been, what is the nature and extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the taking. The taking cannot be presumed. And as to that issue there is no right to a jury trial. We affirm the ruling of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\n<em>The Trial Court\u2019s Factual Findings and Conclusions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_h\">Plaintiffs\u2019 point heading on this issue is as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">The Trial Court\u2019s Findings and Conclusions That The Dock of The Subclass 1 Plaintiff Had Not Been Destroyed by Shipworms, That JCP&amp;L Had Not Proximately Caused The Shipworm Damages Suffered By The Other Plaintiffs, And That JCP&amp;L Had Not Proximately Caused The Erosion Of Properties Owned By Plaintiffs In Subclasses 1, 2, 7 and 8 And The Siltation At Properties Owned by Plaintiffs In Subclasses 1 and 8 Were Clearly Mistaken and So Plainly Unwarranted That The Interests Of Justice Require That They Be Reversed And Corrected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the trial judge\u2019s \u201cgeneral findings of fact\u201d and the \u201cfactual findings relating to each Subclass,\u201d as well as his conclusions, are patently in error and correction and reversal by this court is warranted. Plaintiffs argue that the dispute does not center around credibility but rather involves the judge\u2019s failure to properly evaluate the underlying facts and the implications to be drawn therefrom. Plaintiffs rely upon <em>Pioneer Nat'l Title Ins. Co. v. Lucas, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>332 (App. Div.1978), aff\u2019d o.b. 78 <em>N.J. </em>320 (1978), where the standard of review was stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">If we are satisfied that the trial judge\u2019s findings and result could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence in the record as a whole, his determination should not be disturbed. However, if we are thoroughly satisfied that the findings and the ultimate conclusions are clearly mistaken and so plainly unwarranted that the interests of justice demand intervention and correction, we should appraise the record as if we were deciding the matter at inception and make our own findings and conclusions. This feeling of \u201cwrongness\u201d arises where our review of the proofs leaves us with the definite conviction that the judge went so wide of the mark that a mistake must have been made. It can arise in many ways \u2014 from manifest lack of inherently credible evidence to support significant findings, obvious overlooking or underevaluation of crucial evidence, or a clearly unjust result, [at 338]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Defendant, on the other hand, argues that credibility of expert witnesses, as well as the \u201cfeel of the case\u201d is involved and that the proper standard of review is that articulated in <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. 474, </em>484 (1974), where the court said that findings on which a judgment in a nonjury case are based should not be disturbed unless \u201cthey are so wholly unsupportable as to result in a denial of justice.\u201d Stated otherwise, the factual findings and legal conclusions of the trial judge will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that they are so manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the interests of justice. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">At the end of the nine-day trial the judge' made findings and conclusions as to each of the subclasses. Each of the subclass representatives claimed to have suffered damages to one or more wood structures consisting of pilings, docks and bulkheads. The trial judge noted that no damage appeared to have occurred to structures constructed of pressure-creosoted materials and pointed out that the conflicting testimony raised an issue as to whether the damages complained of resulted from shipworm infestation or were the result of winter freezes of lagoon water which damaged pilings and docks.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The testimony presented was technical, complicated and voluminous. The resolution of the sharply divergent factual statements and expert opinions required a delicate weighing and balancing of the evidence presented. Our review of this record satisfies us that there was sufficient credible evidence presented as to each of the subclasses on which the trial judge could base his conclusions. We reach the same result applying either the test as it is stated in <em>Rova Farms </em>or <em>Pioneer Nat\u2019l Title Ins. </em>In our review of the record we did not encounter a feeling of wrongness, nor did we find the ultimate conclusions of the trial judge clearly mistaken or plainly unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, <em>Pub.L. </em>93\u2014438, 88 Stat. 1233, which became effective January 19, 1975, abolished the Atomic Energy Commission and transferred its functions to two new agencies, Energy Research and Development Administration and Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
