We add the following comment. Defendant asserts that the trial court erred in discounting the \u201ccomparable\u201d sale of Lot 1, Block 377. The court noted there were improvements on the property and that \u201cthe flood hazard regulations were not in effect at the time of the sale.\u201d Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>argues that plaintiff\u2019s property was also not subject to the flood plain regulations when it was sold. While we do not disagree with the trial judge\u2019s handling of this \u201ccomparable\u201d sale, nevertheless it is appropriate to point out that defendant\u2019s argument is probably counterproductive since it is likely that the value of both properties was adversely affected by the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The parties are in accord that there is a computation error in the judgment. In view of this agreement we assume that a consent order may be prepared correcting the judgment. Accordingly we remand the matter to the Tax Court for entry of a corrected order. If the parties are unable to agree upon the terms of the order, then the judge of the Tax Court may, after such hearing as shall be appropriate, enter a corrected order.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Affirmed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
