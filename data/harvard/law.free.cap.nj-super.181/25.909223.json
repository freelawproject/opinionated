A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">This appeal concerns the power of a municipality to pay for the expense of electrical current for street lights on the privately-owned streets of a retirement community. The controlling statute in pertinent part empowers a municipality to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">. .. make, amend, repeal and enforce ordinances to cause the governing body of the municipality to repair and maintain and provide for the removal of snow, ice and other obstructions from, and <em>provide for the lighting of, any roads or streets upon which the travel is sufficient, in the opinion of said governing body, to warrant such expenditures, even though such roads or streets shall not have </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>been taken over by said municipal governing body or dedicated and accepted as public highways. </em>Roads or streets so serviced, which are not shown on the official map of the municipality, may, at the option of the governing body of said municipality, be suitably improved in accordance with any requirements established pursuant to the \"Official Map and Building Permit Act (1958),\u201d <em>P.L. </em>1953, c. 434 (C. 40:55-1.30 <em>et seq.), </em>and dedicated to the municipality, within 2 years from the effective date of any ordinance adopted pursuant to the provisions of this act. [L. 1975, c. 243, \u00a7 1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:67-23.1 (emphasis supplied)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Pursuant to this statute the Monroe Township Council adopted this ordinance on August 4, 1980:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">The Council of the Township of Monroe may provide for the lighting of any roads or streets upon which the travel is sufficient, in the opinion of said governing body, to warrant such expenditures even though such roads or streets shall not have been taken over by said municipal governing body or dedicated and accepted as public highways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Later that month this complaint in lieu of prerogative writs was filed by plaintiff, a taxpayer. He alleged that the ordinance was invalid as (1) unauthorized by the statute, (2) constitutionally prohibited and (3) in conflict with the Condominium Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8B-1 <em>et seq. </em>The Law Division judge rejected these contentions and entered summary judgment for defendant township.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">The dispute here focuses on the private interior roadways of two adult condominium communities in the township \u2014 Clear-brook and Rossmoor. These communities are designed for and limited to inhabitants over the age of 48 years. The street lights are in place, having been constructed by the developer. The question is whether the township may pay the electrical bill for lighting the communities\u2019 streets. The township currently pays the street lighting bill for all public streets in the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">The streets in Clearbrook and Rossmoor are not dedicated to and accepted by the township as public highways. There are gates at the entrances to these communities which preclude uninterrupted and random travel through them. Entrance through the gates is permitted by an attendant to any person announcing a legitimate reason for entering the communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">The record discloses that in 1980: (1) the combined population of the developments was 4,573, or 31% of the township\u2019s total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>population; (2) the combined assessed valuation was $92,142,000, or 37% of the township\u2019s total valuation and (3) the combined total of units was 2,740, or 42% of the township\u2019s housing stock. Rossmoor, with 1,700 units, is 80% developed; Clearbrook, with 1,040 units, is 50% developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s first contention is that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:67-23.1 was never intended to apply to purely private roadways. But the statute clearly says that a municipality may</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">. .. provide for the lighting of, any roads or streets upon which the travel is sufficient, in the opinion of said governing body, to warrant such expenditures, even though such roads or streets shall not have been taken over by said municipal governing body or dedicated and accepted as public highways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The plain language of the statute defeats plaintiff\u2019s contentions. The act applies to any streets or roads, whether dedicated and accepted as public highways or not. As long as the governing body is satisfied that \u201ctravel is sufficient ... to warrant such expenditures,\u201d it may act. <em>See Island Improvement Ass\u2019n v. Ford, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 574 (App.Div.1978), where we stated that while a municipality has no legal obligation with respect to private roads it may, by virtue of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:67-23.1, voluntarily \u201cassume a part or all of that obligation.\u201d Additionally, we note that plaintiff made no attack in the trial division on the judgment of the governing body that travel upon the roads in the retirement communities was \u201csufficient ... to warrant [municipal] expenditures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Plaintiff next contends that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:67-23.1 was intended solely to permit all forms of local government to engage in activities previously permitted only to boroughs and townships. The two predecessor statutes to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:67-23.1 provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">The governing body of any borough may, at the expense of the borough, repair and maintain and provide for the removal of snow, ice and other obstructions from any roads or streets upon which the public travel is sufficient, in the opinion of said governing body, to warrant such expenditures, even though such roads or streets shall not have been taken over by said borough or dedicated and accepted as public highways. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>40:88-10.1, <em>L. </em>1944, c. 35, \u00a7 11</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The township committee of any township may, at the expense of the township, repair and maintain, provide for the removal of snow, ice and other obstructions from, and provide for lighting of, any roads or streets upon which the public travel is sufficient, in the opinion of said township committee, to warrant such expenditures, even though such roads or streets shall not have been taken over by said township or dedicated and accepted as public highways. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>40:150-1, <em>L. </em>1945, c. 35, \u00a7 1]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Plaintiff maintains that the presence in these repealed statutes of the phrase \u201cany roads or streets upon which the <em>public </em>travel is sufficient\u201d (emphasis ours) evinced a legislative intent to require unrestricted public access as a precondition for municipal services for undedicated and unaccepted roadways. He asserts that the adoption of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:67 \u2014 23.1 (L. 1975, e. 243, \u00a7 1) and the contemporaneous repeals of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:88-10.1 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:150-1 (L. 1975, c. 243, \u00a7 2) merely bestowed the powers enumerated in the former statutes upon all municipalities. Plaintiff contends that the only substantive amendments to pre-existing law effected by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:67 \u2014 23.1 dealt with circumstances under which dedication to the municipality would occur and that the deletion of the reference to public travel on the private roadways was \u201cthrough inadvertence or clerical error.\u201d He urges that because of the constitutional implications it is doubtful the Legislature would have desired to effect such a change and delete the requirement of public access \u201cwithout more explicitly announcing its intention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The general rule is that what \u201cthe Legislature omits the courts will not supply.\u201d <em>Kennan v. Essex Cty. Freeholders, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 507 (Law Div. 1968), aff\u2019d 106 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312 (App.Div.1969). But, of course, courts can supply \u201capparent omissions\u201d in statutes. <em>Saslow v. Previti, </em>17 <em>N.J.Misc. </em>29, 32 (Sup.Ct.1939). \u201c[W]here words have been omitted from a statute by inadvertence, or through clerical error, and the intent of the legislature is clearly ascertainable from the context, the court will insert the words necessary to carry out that manifest intent.\u201d 17 <em>N.J.Misc. </em>at 32. The insertion of words in a statute \u201cis a power which is exercised with unusual caution.\u201d 2A <em>Sutherland, Statutory Construction </em>(4 ed. 1973), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u00a7 47.38 at 172, cited with approval in <em>Property Owners Assn. of N. Bergen v. N. Bergen Tp., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>327, 338 (1977), which states: \u201cBut where the path is not clear, then the courts should refrain from usurping the legislative function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We find nothing in the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:67-23.1 itself, or the statute as originally introduced on March 25, 1974 (Assembly Bill 1358), or the Senate amendments, or the Statement by the Senate County and Municipal Government Committee, dated February 27, 1975, to support plaintiff\u2019s contention of inadvertent omission of the word \u201cpublic\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the contrary, the available history supports the view that the Legislature intended to broaden local power to render services on streets not taken over by the municipality when conditions of sufficient travel warranted. We conclude that the absence of the word \u201cpublic\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:67 \u2014 23.1 was by design, not oversight; we refuse to insert it in the statute as plaintiff requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Plaintiff next contends that the contemplated expenditures are prohibited by <em>N.J.Const. </em>(1947), Art. VIII, \u00a7 III, pars. 2 and 3, which provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">2. No county, city, borough, town, township or village shall hereafter give any money or property, or loan its money or credit, to or in aid of any individual, association or corporation, or become security for, or be directly or indirectly the owner of, any stock or bonds of any association or corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">3. No donation of land or appropriation of money shall be made by the State or any county or municipal corporation to or for the use of any society, association or corporation whatever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Both parties agree that the constitutionality of the ordinance is governed by the three-pronged test for determining whether a public expenditure violates the constitutional proscription <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>against the advancement of public monies to or for the use of any private individual, association or corporation for private purposes promulgated by Justice Francis in <em>Roe v. Kervick, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>191 (1964). Plaintiff characterizes the <em>Roe </em>three-pronged test as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">(a) whether the legislation served a legitimate public purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">(b) whether the nature of the scheme involved was likely to effectuate that public purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">(c) whether there were sufficient safeguards to protect the public from the harms sought to be avoided by the Constitution. [Id. at 207, 212, 222, 231 and 232]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Defendant concurs in this characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Plaintiff maintains that the ordinance does not satisfy the first prong of the <em>Roe </em>test because no \u201cpublic purpose is served by municipal assumption of a private residential complex\u2019s streetlighting expenses.\u201d He asserts that, while \u201c[government appropriations to assist poor persons on fixed incomes may be defensible in the context of a welfare program,. . . no such justification can be offered by the Township in this case.\u201d Plaintiff points out that \u201cnot only is there no general welfare program operative in the Township, but no rational basis exists for presuming these residents are in need of such assistance.\u201d In sum, he contends that direct subsidies to senior citizens for private street lighting serve no public purpose and that such \u201cdirect subsidies from the public till are inappropriate, especially in the absence of demonstrated need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">On the contrary, defendant asserts that the ordinance serves two public purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-12\">... Expenditures for the maintenance, repair and lighting of heavily travelled private roadways clearly promotes the public health, safety and welfare by reducing the likelihood of accidents and generally facilitating the ease of travel on such roads. More specifically with regard to roads in planned retirement communities, the ordinance and statute promote the public purpose of providing safe, suitable, and affordable housing to New Jersey\u2019s elderly citizens by subsidizing the upkeep and lighting of heavily travelled roads in such communities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-13\">... Certainly, the maintenance and lighting of heavily travelled private roadways in planned retirement communities benefits the community as a whole by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>protecting all motorists who may have occasion to visit the communities and by providing a safer and more affordable living environment for senior citizens. Moreover, the maintenance and lighting of streets and highways have traditionally been recognized as public and governmental functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">As Judge Stroumtsos of the Law Division correctly pointed out at the hearing, the public purpose served by the ordinance is \u201cto provide adequate street lighting for the residents in Ross-moor and Clearbrook who apparently are in substantial number\u201d and such street lighting \u201cprimarily benefits those who live in the development and incidentally benefits those who choose to enter.\u201d He properly emphasized that, under the ordinance, the need required to be shown in order to justify municipal expenditures for street lighting was not economic need on the part of the residents living on those streets but the need for adequate street lighting arising from the level of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:67-23.1 and the township ordinance allow for the provision of lighting on \u201cany roads or streets upon which the travel is sufficient.\u201d If the particular road or street is private with limited public access, it does not matter if the residents living along such a road are rich or poor so long as the travel on the road is sufficient, in the opinion of the municipal governing body, to warrant the expenditures necessary to provide for lighting the road. The public purpose served by the ordinance is the protection of those who live on and those who use sufficiently travelled streets in the municipality and the facilitation of traffic on such streets. The lighting and maintenance of streets \u201chas been traditionally recognized as a public and government function.\u201d 18 <em>McQuillin, Municipal Corporations </em>(3 ed. 1977), \u00a7 53.44 at 246. We conclude that the first prong of the Roe test is adequately satisfied and that there is no merit in plaintiff\u2019s contention here that no public purpose is served by \u201cmunicipal assumption of a private residential complex\u2019s street-lighting expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Plaintiff finally contends that the contemplated expenditures are contrary to the provisions of the Condominium Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8B-1 <em>et seq. </em>Although not clear from the record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>plaintiff asserts in his brief that the Rossmoor and Clearbrook developments are comprised of discrete sections, each constituting a separate condominium as defined by the Condominium Act and that the \u201cmaster deeds of all existing sections, as well as the public offering statements . . . treat interior roads\u201d in the developments as part of the common elements. Defendant does not dispute these factual assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Plaintiff argues that under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8B-14(a) the pertinent condominium association involved in each development</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">. . . shall be responsible for the performance of the following duties, the costs of which shall be common expenses: ... The maintenance, repair, replacement, cleaning and sanitation of the common elements.. ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">and therefore that any agreement contrary to this provision is void. He contends that because the ordinance is contrary to the mandatory assessment mechanism of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8B-14, this court should declare it void under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8B \u2014 7 which states: \u201cAny agreement contrary to the provisions of this act shall be void.\u201d We do not think that a municipal ordinance enacted pursuant to the authority of a state statute should be deemed the type of \u201cagreement\u201d referred to in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8B-7. Obviously, private and consensual agreements among those parties subject to the Condominium Act were meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-11\">The Senate Committee's statement said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">Assembly Bill 1358 allows any municipality, by ordinance, to repair, maintain and provide for the removal of snow, ice and other obstructions from and provide for the lighting of any roads or streets even though such roads or streets shall not have been taken over by the municipality or dedicated and accepted as public highways; provided that the municipality is satisfied that there is sufficient travel on said roads or streets to warrant such expenditures.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
