He has appealed from the judgment which was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-16\">Pursuant to Mr. Cooper\u2019s request for counsel this court appointed William N. Foley of the Sacramento Bar to represent Mr. Cooper on this appeal. Mr. Foley has informed this court that after a review of the record and interviews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>with the appellant he has not found any meritorious grounds for an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">We have reviewed the record and have concluded that the evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction and that appellant Cooper received a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The evidence shows that two men, one of whom was Cooper, entered Cal\u2019s Liquor Store in Sacramento about 10 p.m. on the night of August 22, 1961. Cooper\u2019s companion, who had a revolver, told the clerk, \u201cYou know what this is?\u201d The clerk then gave Cooper\u2019s companion approximately $50 and the robbers left.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">One who participates in the commission of a robbery in which a deadly weapon is used is a principal and may be convicted for robbery in the first degree, even though he does not handle the weapon or take the property. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>71 Cal.App.2d 646 [163 P.2d 59].)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">Pierce, P.
