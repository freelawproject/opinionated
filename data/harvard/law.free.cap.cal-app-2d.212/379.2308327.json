The husband was also ordered to pay to the wife the sum of $259 per month for her support and maintenance (from which she was to make certain house payments) and the husband was to pay the wife as and for the support and maintenance of the minor children the sum of $100 each, or a total of $459 per month. Further, it was ordered that the husband pay the attorney for the wife $1,500 on account for attorney\u2019s fees. There were other orders made at the time with which we are not particularly concerned on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">The husband was found to be guilty of contempt of court for his failure to comply with some of the orders made on May 26, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">On August 16, 1960, after a full and complete hearing, the order of May 26, 1960, was modified in part to provide, among other things, that the husband pay to the wife for her support and maintenance the sum of $309 per month in lieu of $259 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">On August 2, 1961, the wife had a further order to show cause issued to the husband, wherein among other things she in effect sought an increase in the allowance for her and the children\u2019s support and maintenance, and further for an allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>anee for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in an appeal taken by the wife from an order of dismissal with reference to certain defendants in the cause. At the same time the wife sought an order of contempt of court with reference to the husband\u2019s refusal to comply with certain of the court\u2019s orders theretofore made.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">On September 14 and 15, 1961, a full and complete hearing was conducted. On September 22, 1961, the court ordered that the order of May 26, 1960, as modified by the order of August 16, 1960, be further modified to provide that the husband pay to the wife $350 a month for her support and maintenance, beginning October 1, 1961. The husband was further ordered to pay to counsel for the wife an additional $150 attorney\u2019s fee, and $150 court costs on the appeal taken by the wife from an order of dismissal of certain defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The husband now asserts in substance that the trial court abused its discretion in increasing by $50 per month the temporary support and maintenance of the wife \u201cbecause there was no change of circumstances to justify any increase, \u2019 \u2019 that the court in fact abused its discretion in refusing to reduce the amounts to be paid by the husband for the support and maintenance of the wife, and further that the court abused its discretion in allowing attorney\u2019s fees upon the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Paraphrasing what was said in <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>55 Cal.2d 118, 126 [10 Cal.Rtpr. 261, 358 P.2d 533] it is not the function of this court to reweigh conflicting evidence and redetermine the matter at hand, neither is this court vested with discretion to be exercised in the premises. Our function has been fully performed when we find in the record substantial evidence which supports the holding of the trial court. In other words we in effect \u201cequate abuse of discretion with lack of evidence. \u201d  Or, as stated in <em>Frizzell </em>v. <em>Frizzell, </em>158 Cal.App.2d 652, 655 [323 P.2d 188] :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u201c [3] In <em>Sharpe </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>55 Cal.App.2d 262, 256 [130 P.2d 462], the rule is stated as follows: \u2018Unless a clear ease of abuse is made to appear, an appellate court will not substitute its opinion and thereby divest the trial court of the discretionary power reposed in it. [Citation.] The burden is on appellant to establish an abuse of discretion [citing a ease], and an appellate court is never justified in substituting its discretion for that of the trial court unless there has been a miscarriage of justice. [Citing a case.] \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">\u2018 \u2018 [4] An appellate court can interfere with the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>on such matters only where the ruling of the trial court exceeds the bounds of reason. [5] An abuse of discretion cannot be presumed but must be affirmatively established by the party complaining of the order. <em>(Berry </em>v. <em>Chaplin, </em>74 Cal. App.2d 669 [169 P.2d 453].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\u201c [6] The rule that there must be a showing of \u2018changed circumstances\u2019 has no application where the trial court has modified a decree. That rule only applies where the trial court has refused to modify a decree and it is contended an abuse of discretion occurred. To show such abuse there must be a showing of changed circumstances. <em>(Kelly </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>75 Cal. App.2d 408 [171 P.2d 95] ; <em>Dotsch </em>v. <em>Grimes, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 418 [171 P.2d 506].)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Without reciting at length the evidence in this case suffice it to say that we have read the complete record and among other things it demonstrates that the husband was the executive vice-president of several family corporations and as such was active in the management of the business, he was one of the principal shareholders and used an automobile at company expense and had various credit cards for his use. His mode of living had improved at the time of the hearing. The expenses of the wife had increased and her mode of living had worsened.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">There was an adverse change in the wife\u2019s living conditions and circumstances as compared with circumstances and conditions at the time of the prior order. However, even had there not been an adverse change in her circumstances the order of modification might well be valid.  It is said in <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>197 Cal.App.2d 289, 309-311 [17 Cal. Rptr. 186] (hearing denied) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">\u201cThe many cases which appellant cites to the effect that a showing of change of circumstances is a prerequisite to modification of a temporary award of alimony are not controlling in a case such as this one where the original order of allowance is expressly limited \u2018until further order of Court.\u2019  Even if those cases be deemed applicable it seems evident that mere change in circumstances is enough and the sufficiency of such change is a question to be determined by the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">\u201cThe instant situation suggests an analogy to modification of a custody order under section 138, Civil Code, which says: \u2018In actions for divorce or for separate maintenance the court may, during the pendency of the action, or at the final hearing or at any time thereafter during the minority of any of the children of the marriage, make such order for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>custody of such minor children as may seem necessary or proper and may at any time modify or vacate the same. . . .\u2019 In this connection the courts have reduced the \u2018change of circumstances\u2019 rule to a mere matter of \u2018evidence that the court may consider in the exercise of its discretion\u2019 <em>(Urquhart </em>v. Urquhart, 196 Cal.App.2d 297, 301-302 [16 Cal.Rptr. 469]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\"><em>\u201cGoto </em>v. <em>Goto, </em>53 Cal.2d 118, 123 [338 P.2d 450] : \u2018This court has declared the so-called \u201cchanged circumstance\u201d rule to be subject to exceptions where the welfare of the child requires it. \u201cWe do not wish to be understood as holding that \u2018the change of circumstance\u2019 rule is an absolutely iron-clad rule and that there can be no possible exception to it. It is perhaps possible to conceive of a case in which, despite the fact that there was apparently no change of circumstances, nevertheless, the welfare of the child might require that the previous order of custody be changed. ...\u201d <em>(Foster </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>8 Cal.2d 719, 728 [68 P.2d 719].) \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\"><em>\u201cKelly </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 408, 415-416 [171 P.2d 95] : \u2018It seems to us that the question of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d is but another form of evidence which the court may consider in the exercise of its discretion to hear and decide the question of modification of custody orders previously made. But notwithstanding \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d there can be no doubt that once jurisdiction attaches to grant a divorce and award custody of the minor children of the marriage, our statute provides that such jurisdiction is continuing and the power to amend, modify or annul an award of custody as existing conditions demand ever after remains. . . . The so-called rule means only that the action of the court in refusing to modify an order of custody unless there is a showing of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d does not amount to an abuse of discretion. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\"><em>\u201cFrizzell </em>v. <em>Frizzell, </em>158 Cal.App.2d 652, 655 [323 P.2d 188] : \u2018The rule that there must be a showing of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d has no application where the trial court has modified a decree. That rule only applies where the trial court has refused to modify a decree and it is contended an abuse of discretion occurred. To show such abuse there must be a showing of changed circumstances.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">\u201cTo the same effect see <em>Dotsch </em>v. <em>Grimes, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 418, 421 [177 P.2d 506] ; <em>McKee </em>v. <em>McKee, </em>76 Cal.App.2d 728, 731 [174 P.2d 18] ; <em>Horsley </em>v. <em>Horsley, </em>77 Cal.App.2d 442, 446-447 [175 P.2d 580]; <em>Noon </em>v. <em>Noon, </em>84 Cal.App.2d 374, 380 [191 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>P.2d 35] ; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 788, 792 [9 Cal. Rptr. 300] ; <em>Stack </em>v. <em>Stack, </em>189 Cal.App.2d 357, 369-370 [11 Cal.Rptr. 177]. In <em>Stack </em>the court says, at page 370: \u2018The only \u201crule\u201d consistently applied is that the court may modify or vacate its order \u201cat any time.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 138; cf. <em>Exley </em>v. <em>Exley, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.2d 835 [226 P.2d 662].) The mother\u2019s principal reliance is upon the change of circumstances \u201crule.\u201d As we have seen, it is no longer a rule, if it ever was one.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">\u201cThis reasoning seems logically applicable to exercise of a court\u2019s reserved power to modify or revoke support orders \u2018at any time during the pendency of the action except as to any amount that may have accrued prior to the order of modification or revocation.\u2019 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 137.2), especially where the order subject to modification was expressly made to continue only \u2018until further order of Court.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">\u201cIllustration of what has just been said concerning a change of circumstances is found in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>141 Cal.App.2d 233, 243 [296 P.2d 592], wherein this court reduced an attorney fee award because it had proved excessive in the light of subsequent events. The ruling is supported by <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>34 Cal.2d 838, 841 [215 P.2d 20], therein quoted. [18] The determination of whether the change in circumstances is so substantial as to warrant a modification of the support allowance, rests with the trial judge to be exercised in his sound discretion. Quoting <em>Howard </em>again, at page 239: \u2018 The award thus reached cannot be set aside in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion. On the former appeal of this case, 128 Cal.App.2d 188, this court said at page 190 [275 P.2d 93] : \u201cAbuse of discretion is never presumed. It must be affirmatively established. A reviewing court is not authorized to revise the lower court\u2019s judgment even if it should be of the opinion that it would have made a different award had the matter been submitted to its judgment in the first instance, in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d In <em>Newbauer </em>v. <em>Newbauer, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 36, 40 [212 P.2d 240], the court put it thus: \u201cThe discretion was the trial judge\u2019s, not ours; and we can only interfere if we find that under all the evidence, viewed most favorably in support of the trial court\u2019s action, no judge could reasonably have made the order that he did.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The trial judge in this case could well have believed the wife and disbelieved the husband; indeed it seems that is what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The husband\u2019s contention that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial judge not to reduce the payments which he was to make to his wife is in effect answered when we hold, as we do, that there ivas no abuse of discretion upon the part of the trial judge in increasing the monthly support and maintenance allowances to be paid by the husband to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We think there was no error with reference to the matter of attorney\u2019s fees and costs which were allowed upon the appeal taken by the wife from an order of the court. The appeal obviously was not frivolous in any sense. The attorney\u2019s fee allowed by the trial judge was a nominal amount and could not be held to be exorbitant.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">This case is clearly one where the husband has the ability to comply with the orders of the trial court but not the inclination. In fact he seems determined at times not to comply with the court\u2019s orders as is evidenced by the contempt orders set forth in the original file which we have examined. The examination of the original file in this case is no easy task for it is approximately 3 inches thick and the cause is not as yet at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">There is no necessity for the wife to set out penny by penny her requirements as might be the ease if a creditor were suing upon such items. There need only be a showing upon which the court can determine approximately what the needs of the wife are. <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>104 Cal.App.2d 167, 173 [231 P.2d 128].)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The orders appealed from are and each of the same is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Wood, P.J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
