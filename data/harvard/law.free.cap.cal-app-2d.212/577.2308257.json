It is singular that appellant\u2019s briefs fail to set forth any specific assignment of error. It is not asserted that any error was committed by the court below in the admission or rejection of evidence, nor is there any claim that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>findings of fact. Appellant\u2019s arguments consist entirely of discussions of general rules of law which have been promulgated by our courts in the field of unfair competition. We are therefore impelled to infer that appellant\u2019s unexpressed contention herein is that the trial court erred in concluding that these stated rules were inapplicable in the context of the factual circumstances shown in the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\">The essence of the findings of fact (which are unchallenged and which this appellate court would be required to accept in any event, because unquestionably they are supported by substantial evidence) are fairly set forth in the following summary. Respondent Gladys Brinkley was employed from October 7, 1954, to August 1, 1959, as a switchboard operator or chief operator by the Around-The-Clock Telephone Exchange then operated by Mary Doe as sole proprietor. After August 1, 1959, this business was operated by appellant corporation, Mary Doe Enterprises, Inc. Respondent Brinkley remained on as chief operator until November 2, 1959, at which time her employment was \u201cterminated amicably and by mutual agreement by reason of ill health on [her] part. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">During her employment, respondent Brinkley acquired information \u201cconsisting in general of the names, addresses and telephone numbers of plaintiff\u2019s customers and information pertaining to the servicing of such customers\u2019 accounts; . . .\u201d Although the trial court found that \u201ca small part of such information was of a confidential character\u201d it is apparent from the record that this information was \u201cconfidential\u201d only in the sense that customers of telephone answering services impart personal information to their exchanges which they might not care to place in general circulation, but which is not \u201cconfidential\u201d in the sense of being a business secret that would be helpful to a competitor. For example, there were the constantly changing instructions given the exchange regarding the manner in which the customer\u2019s business was being conducted, the different places at which the customer might be found if not in his office, the disposition to be made of anticipated calls from the customer\u2019s clientele, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Findings also were made to the effect that at the time her employment was terminated, respondent Brinkley had no plan to enter into competition with appellant; that very little of the information which she had acquired concerning appellant\u2019s approximately five hundred customers could be, or was, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>membered by her; that whatever information she might have remembered was of no value in securing or retaining the business of any customers who were former customers of plaintiff <em>\u25a0 </em>that none of the information acquired, whether or not confidential in the sense above described, would have been helpful to a competing telephone exchange; and that the contacts between appellant\u2019s customers and its employees were wholly impersonal so that patronage depended entirely upon the efficiency and price of the services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Thereafter, on October 1, 1960, respondent corporation, formed by seven persons, five of whom were doctors practicing in the area, entered into competition with appellant and with \u201cseveral other telephone answering exchanges engaged in a similar business in the area served by telephones with a \u2018STate\u2019 prefix.\u201d Although respondent Brinkley was a shareholder in this corporation, the court found that she had imparted no \u201cconfidential\u201d information acquired during her employment by appellant to respondent corporation; that no such information was ever used in soliciting appellant\u2019s customers; and that the only information useful to a competitor of appellant could be obtained from the telephone directory, the Los Angeles County Medical Association directory, \u201cthe medical staff list of the Valley Presbyterian Hospital, and the personal knowledge of the [doctors owning shares in respondent corporation], ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Finally, the court found that any solicitations made by agents of respondent corporation, including respondent Brinkley, were made \u201cwithout knowledge that the customer being solicited was then a customer of [appellant] \u201d and \u201cthat the type and field of practice of any customer of [appellant] who was solicited by [the members of the corporation] was known by [the member doctors]. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">From the foregoing statement of the facts, it is at once abundantly clear that the judgment of the trial court was correct in every respect. Neither respondent nor this court needs to question the validity of the reasoning or the holdings in the several cases cited by appellant, for it is apparent that they all support the determination made by the trial court rather than that urged by appellant. In the most recent California Supreme Court decision relied on by appellant, <em>Aetna Bldg. Maintenance Co. </em>v. <em>West, </em>39 Cal.2d 198 [246 P.2d 11], a judgment for the plaintiff in an unfair competition case was reversed, although the factual situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>there revealed was far more favorable to the plaintiff therein than that presented by appellant here.  As the court there stated at page 203: \u201cIn the absence of an enforceable contract containing negative covenants to the contrary, equity will not enjoin a former employee from soliciting business from his former employer\u2019s customers, provided his competition is fairly and legally conducted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\">As is also noted in the <em>Aetna </em>case at page 204: 11 The facts of this case do not justify the application of principles governing the rights of the parties in connection with retail delivery routes.\u201d The court then discussed the elements inherent in such cases as set forth in <em>George </em>v. <em>Burdusis, </em>21 Cal.2d 153, 159 [130 P.2d 399], and concluded: \u201cThese factors are here absent. Prospective customers are commonly known to the trade or may easily be discovered through business directories or by observation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Finally, the court in the <em>Aetna </em>case concluded at page 205: \u201cEquitable protection may be invoked against the subsequent use by a former employee of knowledge of the \u2018peculiar likes and fancies and other characteristics\u2019 of the former employer\u2019s customers where such knowledge will aid him in securing and retaining their business. [Citations.] This rule applies where friendly contact with customers is important to solicitors, a circumstance typical of the so-called \u2018trade route\u2019 cases. It has also been applied to situations involving a knowledge of the customer\u2019s desire for specialized information, his preference for certain products, and his buying habits. [Citations.] However, where, as here, superiority of product or service, rather than personal relationships or a secret speciality, is the basis for patronage, a knowledge of the customer\u2019s requirements is not sufficient reason for an injunction. [Citations.] Under circumstances of open competition, such knowledge is readily available to all in the trade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In the instant case, the information acquired by respondent Brinkley was not such that it could be used unfairly to solicit appellant\u2019s customers and the court found that no attempt was ever made so to use it. Obviously the businesses here under consideration were not founded upon respondent Brinkley\u2019s personal relationships with former customers, but either upon the superiority of the service rendered or upon the personal relationships of the doctors affiliated with respondent corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In addition, the information designated as \u201cconfidential\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>was, as previously indicated, merely \u201cpersonal\u201d to the customer. In the nature of things, this type of information would necessarily relate to constantly changing circumstances. If a customer did make a change, he would, of course, immediately impart his \u201cconfidential\u201d instructions to his new service. Finally, the court found in the present case that no attempt was ever made to use any information, confidential or otherwise, that respondent Brinkley might have acquired during her employment in soliciting customers for respondent corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Fox, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
