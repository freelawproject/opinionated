App. 238, 373 A. 2d 323 (1977) that the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, sitting in equity, \u201clacked jurisdiction to enjoin the State\u2019s Attorney of Anne Arundel County from summonsing a sign language interpreter to appear before the grand jury of Anne Arundel County and testify regarding communications made by [the accused, David Barker], a deaf mute to the interpreter in the presence of the deaf mute\u2019s attorney, mother and brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">At oral argument counsel acknowledged that the sign language interpreter never appeared before the grand jury but that it nevertheless indicted Barker. Under these circumstances the case is now moot and we dismiss it. See <em>Bishop v. Governor, </em>281 Md. 521, 380 A. 2d 220 (1977); <em>State v.
