At separate bench trials in the Circuit Court for Frederick County, Smith was convicted under the 1st count and Duncan under the 2nd count. In each trial a motion to suppress the stolen goods as seized upon an unlawful search of an automobile was denied and the evidence was admitted. Maryland Rule 729. Smith and Duncan appealed from the respective judgments entered, and the two appeals were submitted to the Court of Special Appeals in one record. Each appellant attacked the denial of his motion to suppress. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>judgments in a single opinion, concluding with respect to the search and seizure issue that appellants had not demonstrated standing to contest the search and seizure and that the \u201cautomatic standing\u201d rule of <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 80 S. Ct. 725 (1960) was not available to them because <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 U. S. 377, 88 S. Ct. 967 (1968) had eroded that rule to the point of extinction. <em>Duncan and Smith v. State, </em>27 Md. App. 302, 310-325, 340 A. 2d 722 (1975). On review by way of certiorari we disagreed. We held that automatic standing was still the constitutional law of the land and applicable to appellants. We remanded the case with direction that the Court of Special Appeals determine \u201cwhether the evidence in question was properly admitted.\u201d <em>Duncan and Smith v. State, </em>276 Md. 715, 716, 351 A. 2d 144 (1976). The Court of Special Appeals then held that the motions to suppress the evidence were properly denied and affirmed the judgments. <em>Duncan v. State, </em>34 Md. App. 267, 366 A. 2d 1058 (1976). We granted appellants\u2019 petition for. the issuance of a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The question presented on review is the propriety of the denial of the motions to suppress the challenged evidence. The answer to the question lies in the determination of whether the evidence was obtained by the police in violation of the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. As in all Fourth Amendment cases, we are obligated to look to all the facts and circumstances of this case in light of the principles set forth in decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U. S. 364, 375, 96 S. Ct. 3092 (1976). \u201c[W]hether a search and seizure is unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. . . .\u201d <em>Cooper v. California, </em>386 U. S. 58, 59, 87 S. Ct. 788 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\n<em>THE FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The facts material to the question of the admissibility of the challenged evidence were submitted to us by an agreed statement included in appellants\u2019 brief and supplemented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>small part in the brief of the State. Maryland Rule 828 g. We summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The events leading to the conviction of appellants began in the late afternoon of 18 June 1973 when two unidentified customers of the J. C. Penney Store in the Fredericktowne Mall in Frederick County told a sales clerk that \u201ctwo black men had stuffed clothing from the store into plastic bags and put the bags in trash cans on the parking lot next to a nearby restaurant.\u201d The clerk gave this information to a store security guard who placed the trash cans under surveillance. Around 4:00 p.m. he saw \u201ca white Mercury containing two black men stop near the trash cans momentarily and then speed away.\u201d He reported the incident, including a description of the automobile and its license number, to Officer Kirby Maybush of the Frederick City Police Department, who was at the store investigating a shoplifting complaint. Maybush had the description of the automobile broadcast over the police radio network with the request that if the car \u201cwas spotted, to stop it, that I wanted to talk to the subjects in reference to possible stolen clothing.\u201d He was informed by the Department of Motor Vehicles that the automobile was registered in the name of Shirley Ann Duncan of Baltimore, and, on further check he learned that it had not been reported stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Mary Jo Maher lived on Grove Hill Road in Frederick County near the point at which the road \u201cjoins U. S. Route 40 directly across from the Fredericktowne Mall.\u201d About 4:00 p.m. on 18 June 1973 she saw an automobile pull off Grove Hill Road (there were no curbs or sidewalks) \u201cand park by the side of the road on her property.\u201d Appellants got out of the vehicle and walked away. \u201cSuspicious about the presence of the two unfamiliar black men in the neighborhood, she called the State Police, who responded within moments.\u201d The automobile on the Maher lawn was the one described in the lookout broadcast. A State Trooper searched the automobile for a registration card but did not find one.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Maybush, cruising around looking for the automobile, received word over the radio of its whereabouts. He went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the seene, and shortly thereafter his superior, Lt. Gary Heerd, arrived. The two officers conferred, and Maybush went to the Mall parking lot to look for the suspects. Ten or fifteen minutes later he saw appellants. They left the parking lot, crossed Route 40 and walked up Grove Hill Road toward the automobile. \u201cHe radioed this information to Lt. Heerd and the two officers converged on the appellants, arrested them at gunpoint on suspicion of larceny, handcuffed them and placed them in a patrol car. They identified themselves as James Fitz and Sherman Duncan. They were driven a short distance to the Maher property where, at 4:30 p.m., Mrs. Maher identified them as the men she saw getting out of the car. Both appellants denied any connection with the automobile.\u201d They said it was not their car, that they did not know whose it was or who had it or how it got there. They declared that they had never seen it before. As one witness put it: \u201c[A]t the time they denied any knowledge of the car that was parked in the yard. They repeatedly stated they had no connection with it, had not driven it there, and had not parked it there and answers of that nature.\u201d They were taken to police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Heerd sent for a Frederick City Police Department Criminal Investigation Division (C.I.D.) unit. \u201cHe said he did not search the car when he first arrived on the scene \u2018[d]ue to the fact I had reason to believe it might have been used in a crime and I wasn\u2019t going to have the car searched until I had C.I.D. men come and check for fingerprints or for whatever might have taken place at that time.\u2019 \u201d Detective Corporal George Himes, Jr. was the C.I.D. man who responded. He was given all the information known to the police at that time and briefed on what action had been taken. \u201c[T]here had been a previous larceny from J. C. Penney\u2019s store and that a suspected vehicle in the theft had been found parked in front of the Maher property on the lawn.\u201d The police had detained \u201ctwo colored male subjects which were seen acting in a suspicious manner in the area and that these two colored male subjects denied any connection with the vehicle as to owning it,\u201d and that they had identified themselves as James Fitz and Sherman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Duncan. The automobile had not been reported stolen and was registered in the name of Shirley Ann Duncan. Although the police had been unable to reach her by telephone, a message had been left at her home to call the Frederick City Police Department. A registration card had not been found upon a check of the automobile by a State Trooper. \u201cHimes entered the car, searched the glove box, overhead visors, console between the bucket seats and under the seats. He found the keys under the driver\u2019s seat and then proceeded to the trunk and opened it.\u201d He vowed that \u201cthe search of the car was not made pursuant to his investigation of the larceny at J. C. Penney and that the larceny played no part in his decision to search. He said he felt that it was either a stolen or abandoned vehicle and he entered the trunk to \u2018verify ownership of the vehicle\u2019 and \u2018to secure the vehicle, to check the vehicle for valuables and for all types of items to be secured into our possession until the owner can be contacted.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The evidence which served as the basis of the charges against appellants and their convictions was found in the trunk. When Himes unlocked and raised the trunk lid he saw two large green heavy duty plastic trash bags. \u201cA couple pieces of clothing were protruding from the bags. On one piece there was attached a two-part Montgomery Ward tag with both parts intact.\u201d Himes knew that when an article is purchased at Montgomery Ward the parts of the tag \u201care separated. One piece stays with the article and one piece stays with the store.\u201d The bags and clothing were seized. Himes testified that he did not know then that the items had been stolen from Montgomery Ward, as was later established, but, he declared, he had \u201creasonable suspicions they were.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Upon these facts and circumstances the Court of Special Appeals thought that \u201c[t]he entire case hinge[d] upon the question of whether the police, upon the merits of the Fourth Amendment, were or were not acting reasonably when they conducted the warrantless search of the trunk of the automobile.\u201d <em>Duncan v. State, supra, </em>34 Md. App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>270-271. It held that the police action was not unreasonable. It based that holding on alternative grounds. It believed that the police action was \u201cultimately reasonable\u201d either because it was authorized under a \u201cnew constitutional notion that the police have a \u2018community caretaking function\u2019 with respect to automobiles which bears upon the question of Fourth Amendment reasonableness,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 271, or because the automobile had been abandoned, <em>id. </em>at 275. We shall ascertain the law relating to each ground and look to all the facts and circumstances in light of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\n<em>THE LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\n<em>The Fourth Amendment and Police Community Caretaking Functions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABq\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\u201cThe basic purpose of this Amendment ... is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\u201d <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U. S. 523, 528, 87 S. Ct. 1727 (1967). To this end, \u201c[t]he mandate of the Fourth Amendment is that the people shall be secure against <em>unreasonable </em>searches.\u201d <em>United States v. Rabinowitz, </em>339 U. S. 56, 65, 70 S. Ct. 430 (1950). The standard of reasonableness embodied in the Fourth Amendment \u201cturns, at least in part, on. the more specific commands of the warrant clause,\u201d <em>United States v. United States District Court, </em>407 U. S. 297, 315, 92 S. Ct. 2125 (1972), and a search warrant, by the express terms of the Amendment, may issue only upon \u201cprobable cause.\u201d \u201cThus the most basic constitutional rule in this area is that \u2018searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U. S. 443, 454-55, 91 S. Ct. 2022 (1971). <em>See Katz v. United States, </em>389 U. S. 347, 357, 88 S. Ct. 507 (1967); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>357 U. S. 493, 499, 78 S. Ct. 1253 (1958); <em>United States v. Jeffers, </em>342 U. S. 48, 51, 72 S. Ct. 93 (1951); <em>McDonald v. United States, </em>335 U. S. 451, 456, 69 S. Ct. 191 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The search of an automobile is one of the class of carefully defined cases which constitutes at least a partial exception to the general rule that a search of private property without proper consent is \u201cunreasonable\u201d unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U. S. 433, 439, 93 S. Ct. 2523 (1973). Although automobiles are \u201ceffects\u201d in the contemplation of the Fourth Amendment, \u201cthere is a constitutional difference between houses [or offices] and cars.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U. S. 42, 52, 90 S. Ct. 1975 (1970). <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>supra, </em>428 U. S. at 367-68, points out the twofold reason for this distinction. \u201cFirst, the inherent mobility of automobiles creates circumstances of such exigency that, as a practical necessity, rigorous enforcement of the warrant requirement is impossible. <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U. S. 132, 153-54 (1925); <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U. S. 443, 459-60 (1971).\u201d Second, \u201cless rigorous warrant requirements govern because the expectation of privacy with respect to one\u2019s automobile is significantly less than that relating to one\u2019s home or office.\u201d <em>Opperman </em>at 367. This is so because \u201c[i]n discharging their varied responsibilities for ensuring the public safety, law enforcement officials are necessarily brought into frequent contact with automobiles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367-68. Further, \u201c[o]ne has a lesser expectation of privacy in a motor vehicle because its function is transportation and it seldom serves as one\u2019s residence or as the repository of personal effects.... It travels public thoroughfares where both its occupants and its contents are in plain view.\u201d <em>Cardwell v. Lewis, </em>417 U. S. 583, 590, 94 S. Ct. 2464 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The ofttimes police-citizen contact involving automobiles was recognized in <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, </em>413 U. S. at 441:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">Because of the extensive regulation of motor vehicles and traffic, and also because of the frequency with which a vehicle can become disabled or involved in an accident on public highways, the extent of police-citizen contact involving automobiles will be substantially greater than police-citizen contact in a home or office. Some such contacts will occur because the officer may believe the operator has violated a criminal statute, but many more will not be of that nature. Local police officers, unlike federal officers, frequently investigate vehicle accidents in which there is no claim of criminal liability and engage in what, for want of a better term, may be described as <em>community caretaking functions, </em>totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Inventory searches of automobiles are frequently made pursuant to these \u201ccommunity caretaking functions.\u201d It seems, however, that none of the Supreme Court decisions was dispositive of the issue whether the Fourth Amendment permits such routine inventory searches of automobiles. <em>See South Dakota v. Opperman, supra, </em>428 U. S. at 377 (Powell, J. concurring). The Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Opperman, </em>however, stated that the holdings in <em>Cooper v. California, supra, Harris v. United States, </em>390 U. S. 234, 88 S. Ct. 992 (1968), and <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, </em>pointed the way. And it found that the state courts \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d and a majority of the Federal Courts of Appeals have sustained inventory procedures as reasonable police intrusions. <em>Opperman </em>at 370-75. The opinion of the Court in <em>Opperman </em>found, on the record of that case, that the inventory search was not. \u201cunreasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 376. Its reasoning followed these lines. Activities concerning automobiles carried out by local police officers in the interests of public safety and as \u201ccommunity caretaking functions\u201d frequently result in the automobile being taken in custody. \u201cVehicle accidents present one such occasion. To permit the uninterrupted flow of traffic and in some circumstances to preserve evidence, disabled or damaged vehicles will often be removed from the highways or streets at the behest of police engaged solely in caretaking and traffic-control activities. Police will also frequently remove and impound automobiles which violate parking ordinances and which thereby jeopardize both the public safety and the efficient movement of vehicular traffic. The authority of police to seize and remove from the streets vehicles impeding traffic or threatening public safety and convenience is beyond challenge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368-69. It is the legal impoundment of an automobile which permits the inventory search of the vehicle. \u201cWhen vehicles are impounded, local police departments generally follow a routine practice of securing and inventorying the automobiles\u2019 contents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>369. These procedures developed in response to three distinct needs: (i) protection of the police from danger; (ii) protection of the police against claims and disputes over lost or stolen property; and (iii) protection of the owner\u2019s property while it remains in police custody. \u201cIn addition,\u201d the Court observed, \u201cpolice frequently attempt to determine whether a vehicle has been stolen and thereafter abandoned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">So it is that a search of an automobile meeting the requirements of an inventory search need not be justified by \u201cprobable cause.\u201d That standard \u201cis peculiarly related to criminal investigations, not routine, noncriminal procedures. ... In view of the noncriminal context of inventory searches, and the inapplicability in such a setting of the requirement of probable cause, courts have held \u2014 and quite correctly \u2014 that search warrants are not required, linked as the warrant requirement textually is to the probable-cause concept .... With respect to noninvestigative police inventories of automobiles lawfully within governmental custody . .. the policies underlying the warrant requirement . . . are inapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>note 5, at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\"><em>Opperman </em>did not definitively establish the permissible scope of the inventory search. It stated that cases decided by the Federal Courts of Appeals \u201chave recognized that standard inventories often include an examination of the glove compartment, since it is a customary place for documents of ownership and registration ... as well as a place for the temporary storage of valuables.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372. It noted that the inventory there conducted was not unreasonable in scope. \u201c[0]nce the policeman was lawfully inside the car to secure the personal property in plain view, it was not unreasonable to open <em>the unlocked glove compartment, </em>to which vandals would have had ready and unobstructed access once inside the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>note 10, at 376 (emphasis added). Powell, J. in his concurring opinion carefully pointed out that \u201c[a]s the Court\u2019s opinion emphasizes, the search here was limited to an inventory of the unoccupied automobile and was conducted strictly in accord with the regulations of the Vermillion Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380. He noted, at 380, note 6: \u201cA complete \u2018inventory report\u2019 is required of all vehicles impounded by the Vermillion Police Department. The standard inventory consists of a survey of the vehicle\u2019s exterior \u2014 windows, fenders, trunk, and hood \u2014 apparently for damage, and its interior, to locate \u2018valuables\u2019 for storage. As part of each inventory a standard report form is completed. The report in this case listed the items discovered in both the automobile\u2019s interior and the unlocked glove compartment. The only notation regarding the trunk was that it was locked. A police officer testified that all impounded vehicles are searched, that the search always includes the glove compartment, and that the trunk had not been searched in this case because it was locked.\u201d The dissenting opinion of Marshall, J. observed, at 385, note 1: \u201cThe Court does not consider, however, whether the police might open and search the glove compartment if it is locked, or whether the police might search a locked trunk or other compartment.\u201d In <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, </em>the Court held that the search of an automobile trunk during a caretaking search and the seizure of a gun therefrom was, not unreasonable. But the Court made clear that the officer reasonably believed that the trunk contained a gun and that the trunk was vulnerable to intrusion by vandals. <em>Id. </em>at 448. <em>See also id. </em>at 436-437.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Despite the narrowness of the <em>Opperman </em>holding, necessarily restricted to the facts of that case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> there emerges from the Court\u2019s opinion a doctrine, viable even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>though not fully developed, which permits as reasonable by Fourth Amendment standards, the inventory search of an automobile under certain conditions. We find the present stage of the doctrine to be that the police may, without regard to probable cause, and, thus, absent a warrant, constitutionally enter an automobile and unlocked compartments therein, and inventory and seize articles found, provided the vehicle had been otherwise legally taken into police custody and the inventorying was pursuant to a standard police procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\n<em>THE DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE CARETAKING GROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Exercising our independent judgment on the underlying constitutional issue presented by the facts of this case, as we are obligated to do, <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, </em>413 U. S. at 443, we conclude that the seizure of the challenged evidence here cannot be held to be \u201creasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment standard as an exercise of police caretaking functions. The procedure failed to meet the fundamental element present in all caretaking searches that the automobile be lawfully in police custody. The evidence is clear that the automobile was parked on private property, not on a public highway or street. It patently was not impeding traffic or threatening public safety and convenience. We cannot agree with the bald declaration of the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cwhere a homeowner has called the police to make a complaint, the taking of the automobile into police custody because it is illegally parked upon a woman\u2019s front lawn is as compellingly reasonable as the taking of an automobile into police custody after it has been damaged at an accident scene. The present case of getting the automobile off of the lawn is more compelling than the impounding of a vehicle which has violated the parking ordinances.\u201d <em>Duncan v. State, supra, </em>34 Md. App. at 273. The Court of Special Appeals cites no law authorizing the police, at the time of the incident here, to impound a vehicle parked on private property, and we have not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>referred to such a law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Maryland Code (1957, 1970 Repl. Yol.) Art 66V2, \u00a7 11-1004 (e) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">No person shall stop, stand, or park a vehicle on any private property not owned by the owner or driver of the vehicle after he has been requested by the property owner, his tenant, or his agent to remove the vehicle from the premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">There was no evidence that the property owner here requested appellants to remove the automobile. It appears that the police had no authority to impound the automobile merely because it was parked on private property without permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The short of it is that the search here simply did not involve a standard caretaking procedure such as has been uniformly upheld by the state and federal courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>contrary, unlike <em>Opperman </em>and <em>Cady, </em>and despite the disavowal of the searching officer, in light of the information' within the knowledge of the officer and the scope of the search, there is the strong suggestion that the search was actually a pretext concealing an investigatory police motive. The Court of Special Appeals recognized in <em>Dixon v. State, </em>23 Md. App. 19, 20-21, 327 A. 2d 516 (1974) that \u201c[w]ith the possible exception of the \u2018dropsy\u2019 cases, no aspect of Fourth Amendment litigation has afflicted law enforcement with the yawning credibility gap wrought by inventory searches.\u201d That yawning credibility gap is present on this record. As the police were not indisputably engaged in a caretaking search of a lawfully impounded automobile, the search and seizure cannot be said to be reasonable under the caretaking doctrine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\n<em>THE LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\n<em>Abandonment and the Fourth Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">We start again with the basic concern of the Fourth Amendment \u2014 to protect the privacy and sanctity of one\u2019s property against arbitrary intrusion by governmental officials. However, \u201c[w]ithout question, abandoned property does not fall within that category in which one has a legitimate expectation of privacy to bring it within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>protection of the Fourth Amendment .. . .\u201d <em>Everhart v. State, </em>274 Md. 459, 483, 337 A. 2d 100 (1975). <em>See Hester v. United States, </em>265 U. S. 57, 58, 44 S. Ct. 445 (1924). It is the expectation of privacy which is at the heart of the test for abandonment. \u201c \u2018The proper test for abandonment is not whether all formal property rights have been relinquished, but whether the complaining party retains a reasonable expectation of privacy in the articles alleged to be abandoned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Venner v. State, </em>279 Md. 47, 53, 367 A. 2d 949 (1977), quoting <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>472 F. 2d 901 (9th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U. S. 868 (1973). So, one who abandons property thereby surrenders any expectation of privacy therein, removes himself from the protection of the Fourth Amendment, and \u201ccannot complain with effect of the later seizure of such property by the police, or of its use against him in court.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Warden, </em>237 Md. 519, 523, 206 A. 2d 793 (1965); <em>Matthews v. State, </em>237 Md. 384, 387-388, 206 A. 2d 714 (1965). \u201c[Wjhether property is abandoned is generally a question of fact based upon evidence of a combination of act and intent.\u201d <em>Everhart v. State, supra, </em>274 Md. at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">There can be no doubt that the abandonment doctrine applies to automobiles. One may \u201cabandon\u201d or \u201cdiscard\u201d an automobile in his possession to avoid arrest or detection as he may rid himself of other incriminating articles. <em>People v. Smith, 409 P. 2d 222, </em>237 (Cal. Sup. Ct. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>388 U. S. 913 (1967), analogizing circumstances in <em>Abel v. United States, </em>362 U. S. 217, 80 S. Ct. 683 (1960), in which evidence seized from a wastebasket in a rented room after the petitioner had vacated the room was found to have been abandoned, with the abandonment of a rented automobile. <em>See Hawley v. Commonwealth, </em>144 S.E.2d 314, 317 (Va. Sup. Ct. App. 1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>383 U. S. 910 (1966). Many of the cases in which the courts have dealt with the abandonment of an automobile concern flight from the vehicle on sighting the police, particularly where the occupant deserts the automobile while under \u201chot pursuit.\u201d <em>See, for example, United States v. Moody, </em>485 F. 2d 531, (3rd Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>441 F. 2d 749 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>Wade v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Warden, </em>278 F. Supp. 904 (D. Md. 1968); <em>Jefferson v. State, </em>220 S.E.2d 71 (Ga. Ct. App. 1975); <em>Whitlock v. State, </em>185 S.E.2d 90 (Ga. Ct. App. 1971); <em>People v. Harper, </em>185 N.E.2d 865 (Ill. Sup. Ct. 1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U. S. 966 (1963); <em>State v. Barr, </em>126 Vt. 112, 223 A. 2d 462 (1966). In other cases, in which sudden flight was not a circumstance, courts have found abandonment by looking to such factors as the condition of the vehicle, its location, and the length of time it has remained there. <em>United States v. Calhoun, </em>510 F. 2d 861 (7th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U. S. 950 (1975); <em>McIntosh v. United States, </em>341 F. 2d 448 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 U. S. 947 (1965); <em>United States v. Angel, </em>201 F. 2d 531 (7th Cir. 1953); <em>Croker v. State, </em>150 S.E.2d 294 (Ga. Ct. App. 1966); <em>Hawley v. Commonwealth, supra, </em>all finding abandonment. <em>Compare People v. James, </em>46 Misc. 2d 138, 259 N.Y.S.2d 241 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1965), holding that the mere presence of an automobile at a specified location for two days did not constitute abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The abandonment doctrine is not without limitations. It does not apply when the abandonment was the result of an unlawful police action. <em>Beale v. State, </em>230 Md. 182, 186 A. 2d 213 (1962). <em>See Hobson v. United States, </em>226 F. 2d 890 (8th Cir. 1955); <em>Glover v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 454, 287 A. 2d 333 (1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>265 Md. 737 (1972).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Because Fourth Amendment concerns are not applicable when an automobile is in fact abandoned, it may be seized by the police without a warrant and examined with no limitations on the scope, intensity, or objectives of the examination. It and its contents may be retained for use as evidence otherwise admissible against the one who abandoned it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\n<em>THE DECISION WITH RESPECT TO ABANDONMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">As we have indicated, intention is a prime factor in considering whether there has been an abandonment. Intent must be ascertained from what the actor said and did; intent, though subjective, is determined from the objective facts at hand. <em>Hawley v. Commonwealth, supra, </em>144 S.E.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The case <em>sub judice, </em>on the facts as presented to us, patently does not fall within that class of cases in which abandonment was found by the act of flight in hot pursuit. Nor does it fit into those cases in which the condition of the vehicle, its location and the length of time it remained there were determinative. Although the automobile was parked on private property without permission of the owner of the property, it was by the side of a public road which contained no curbs or sidewalks. The police were notified of its presence by the property owner immediately after it was parked and the two occupants had left, apparently in the direction of the nearby shopping mall. When appellants were arrested, they were walking back toward the automobile, only a short time after the car had been parked. There is nothing to indicate to this point, that appellants, later shown to have been the occupants of the automobile, intended to abandon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The issue boils down to whether, in the circumstances, appellants\u2019 unequivocal disclaimer of the automobile satisfied the test for its abandonment by them. We think it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>did. We find <em>United States v. Colbert, </em>474 F. 2d 174 (5th Cir. 1978), relied on by the Court of Special Appeals, <em>Duncan v. State, supra, </em>34 Md. App. at 277-78, to be most persuasive. The <em>Colbert </em>court\u2019s recognition of the doctrine of abandonment in regard to the Fourth Amendment is the same as ours. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">Abandonment is primarily a question of intent, and intent may be inferred from words spoken, acts done, and other objective facts. ... All relevant circumstances existing at the time of the alleged abandonment should be considered. . . . Police pursuit or the existence of a police investigation does not of itself render abandonment involuntary. . . . The issue is not abandonment in the strict property-right sense, but whether the person prejudiced by the search had voluntarily discarded, left behind, or otherwise relinquished his interest in the property in question so that he could no longer retain a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to it at the time of the search. <em>Colbert, supra, </em>474 F. 2d at 176 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Not only was the law in <em>Colbert </em>the same as that in this jurisdiction, but it was applied to a factual situation which was comparable to that of the case in hand. Defendants Colbert and Reese were walking down the street carrying briefcases. A police officer noticed that Colbert fit the description of a wanted suspected felon, and he and another officer approached the men to question them. At the officer\u2019s approach the defendants set their briefcases on the sidewalk. \u201cThey identified themselves as book salesmen but, when the officers asked to see their wares, i.e. the contents of the briefcases, [defendants] replied they did not have to show the officers anything and denied that they owned the briefcases or had any knowledge about them. The officers frisked Colbert and Reese. [Defendants] then began to walk away from the officers, leaving the briefcases on the sidewalk. The officers stopped them again and demanded of each to see some identification document. Reese produced a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Georgia driver\u2019s license, and Colbert said he had no identification card with him. The officers then asked each [defendant] to produce his draft card; when each denied possessing one, the officers arrested them for failure to carry a Selective Service registration certificate, a violation of 50 U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7 462, and placed them in the patrol car. While in the parked car Reese again denied knowing anything about the briefcases. One of the officers then returned to the briefcases, opened them, and found the sawed-off shotguns inside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175. Defendants were indicted for possession of the unregistered shotguns with illegal barrel lengths, and, after the trial court denied their motions to suppress, they were convicted. The court found that the facts showed \u201cconclusively\u201d that Colbert and Reese abandoned their briefcases before the searches took place. Their words and acts were in no way compelled by the police. Under the circumstances the defendants could entertain no reasonable expectation of privacy in the briefcases. Therefore, the search and seizure did not violate the Fourth Amendment and the evidence was admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 177. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>441 F. 2d 749, 753 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>Lurie v. Oberhauser, </em>431 F. 2d 330, 333 (9th Cir. 1970); <em>Gugliotta v. State, </em>160 S.E.2d 266, 268 (Ga. Ct. App. 1968); <em>State v. Brown, </em>341 N.E.2d 325, 326-327 (Ohio Ct. App. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">We find it plain that the words of Duncan and Smith showed conclusively that they abandoned any right they possessed to object to a search of the automobile. Clearly by what they said they surrendered any expectation of privacy therein. They do not now challenge the legality of their arrest or the voluntariness of their statements. They do note in their brief: \u201cThe fact that |the statements were made after the arrest is significant. Before arrest, the police are mere observers. After arrest, defendants can rightly consider the police as antagonists and act accordingly.\u201d Brief for appellants, note 4 at 9. We do not see the materiality of the significance in the circumstances. Surely police are not \u201cmerely observers\u201d when they are pursuing a suspect or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>when they are engaged in an investigation, and neither police pursuit nor the existence of an active police investigation centering on a suspect renders abandonment involuntary. <em>See United States v. Colbert, supra, </em>474 F. 2d at 176; <em>United States v. Edwards, supra, </em>441 F. 2d at 751-752. By the same token we do not think that the arrests of themselves compelled appellants to disclaim any knowledge of the automobile nor did they render the disclaimers involuntary. <em>See Abel v. United States, supra, </em>362 U. S. at 221-225 and 239-241. The \u201cabandonment\u201d of the automobile was no more \u201ccompelled\u201d by the arrests of Duncan and Smith than it would have been \u201ccompelled\u201d by a hot pursuit of them. As we have seen, abandonment under hot pursuit has been consistently upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Appellants assert: \u201c[T]he question of 'abandonment\u2019 is a preliminary question involving standing,\u201d and suggest that we foreclosed the Court of Special Appeals from adjudicating any preliminary standing question when we remanded the case with the direction \u201cto examine the proceedings to determine whether the search and seizure was proper.\u201d <em>Duncan and Smith v. State, supra, </em>276 Md. at 732-733. They claim that \u201c[t]here is no search and seizure when the police obtain possession of contraband after the defendant discards it,\u201d and they argue that our mandate did \u201cnot permit consideration of whether there was a search and seizure but only whether the search and seizure was proper.\u201d Brief for appellants at 7-8. It does not follow from the standing of appellants to object to the search and seizure that they must prevail on the merits. They may question whether they abandoned the automobile, but the answer is not preordained by the automatic standing bestowed by <em>Jones v. United States, supra. </em>The <em>Jones </em>rule of standing was not intended to prevent the State from showing voluntary pre-search abandonment or to apply to a possession prosecution when such abandonment is shown. <em>United States v. Colbert, supra, </em>474 F. 2d at 177. Such abandonment by appellants was shown here and, therefore, the search and seizure was reasonable as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>We hold that the trial judge did not err in denying the motions to suppress the challenged evidence and that the Court of Special Appeals properly sustained the judgments of the Circuit Court for Frederick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellants to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ahl\">. As we have indicated, the Court of Special Appeals decided the case on the belief that the action of the police was to be tested under Fourth Amendment strictures. We accept this for the purpose of decision, noting, however, that the Supreme Court has not squarely decided that the taking of an inventory by the police under their community caretaking function is characterized as a \u201csearch.\u201d In South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364, 96 S. Ct. 3092 (1976), Burger, C.J. delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Blackmun, Powell, Rehnquist, and Stevens, JJ. joined. Powell, J. filed a concurring opinion. White, J. filed a dissenting statement. Marshall, J. filed a dissenting opinion, in which Brennan and Stewart, JJ. joined. The Court\u2019s opinion spoke of the conclusion of some state courts, applying the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness, that \u201ceven if an inventory is characterized as a \u2018search,\u2019 the intrusion is constitutionally permissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370-371. It observed that some courts have concluded that an inventory does not constitute a search for Fourth Amendment purposes and others have expressed doubts as to whether the intrusion is classifiable as a search. It noted that the \u201cPetitioner, however, has expressly abandoned the contention that the inventory in this case is exempt from the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>note 6, at 370. Powell, J., concurring, considered the inventory procedure to be a search. <em>Id. </em>note 1, at 377. The dissenting opinion by_ Marshall, J. deemed the inventory taking to be a search in the contemplation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>note 2, at 385.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\"><em>. </em>The concurring opinion of Powell, J. in South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364, note, 10 at 382 cited United States v. Mapp, 476 F. 2d 67, 76 (2nd Cir. 1973) as listing then-recognized exceptions to warrant requirement: (i) hot pursuit; (ii) plain view doctrine; (iii) emergency situation; (iv) automobile search; (v) consent; and (yi) incident to arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\">. \u201cThe ... police were indisputably engaged in a caretaking search of a lawfully impounded automobile .... The inventory was conducted only after the car had been impounded for multiple parking violations. The owner, haying left his car illegally parked for an extended period, and thus subject to impoundment, was not present to make other arrangements for the safekeeping of his belongings. The inventory itself was prompted by the presence in plain view of a number of valuables inside the car. As in <em>Cady, </em>there is no suggestion whatever that this standard procedure, essentially like that followed throughout the country, was a pretext concealing an investigatory police motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u201cOn this record we conclude that in following standard police procedures, prevailing throughout the country and approved by the overwhelming majority of courts, the conduct of the police was not \u2018unreasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d South Dakota v.
