The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County denied both petitions. An in banc panel of three judges, however, convened pursuant to Art. IV, \u00a7 22 of the Maryland Constitution, to which the County had submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>reserved points and questions, reversed the chancellor and granted the County\u2019s petition. Donna\u2019s natural mother, Linda Hicks, appellant here, took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, but we granted certiorari before the case was heard by that court. We agree that the chancellor\u2019s decision should be reversed, but, for reasons that follow, we remand to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The events culminating in this dispute began shortly after appellant\u2019s marriage \u2014 her second \u2014 to Donald Guy on October 27, 1972. She was a registered nurse who had suffered since 1968 from alcoholism and drug abuse. Donna was born on May 30, 1973. Prior to her birth, however, the Guys were experiencing serious marital discord. Their marriage took a decided turn for the worse some three months before Donna\u2019s birth, when Mr. Guy informed appellant that he wished to sever the marriage and to place their expected child for adoption. Although appellant initially acquiesced, she ultimately decided against adoption. When she brought the child from the hospital to their home in Cheverly, her husband reacted violently and began heaping considerable abuse on appellant. She found herself unable to cope with this situation and began drinking heavily.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Conditions deteriorated to the point where a representative of Catholic Charities found it necessary to remove Donna and appellant\u2019s other daughter by her first marriage. The older daughter ultimately went to live with her father. These developments led to a finding by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, sitting as a Juvenile Court, that Donna was a dependent child in need of care and supervision, and to a decision that she be committed to the care and custody of the Department of Social Services for temporary placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">In September 1973, Donna commenced to reside with foster parents (the Bakers) in Prince George\u2019s County. She continued to live with them until March 1974, when she was described as suffering from cerebral palsy, a diagnosis which later was proved incorrect. At that time, when she was nine months\u2019 old, her custody was transferred to another foster couple (the Covers), who were the petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>in the adoption proceeding heard by the chancellor. Given the erroneous diagnosis of cerebral palsy, the Bakers believed themselves emotionally incapable of dealing with a child stricken with such a disease. It was after Donna began to live with the Covers, who accepted her on the assumption that she was afflicted with cerebral palsy, that the earlier diagnosis proved to be incorrect. In any event, Donna has continuously resided with the Covers since March 1974, and according to the evidence appears to have responded favorably to that environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Following Donna\u2019s placement in the Baker home, appellant continued to reside in Prince George\u2019s County and therefore visited her daughter regularly. She maintained the same schedule even after moving in November 1973 to Baltimore City, where she found employment as a registered nurse at a hospital. Her visits virtually ceased in December, however, when she entered a treatment program for alcoholics in Baltimore. It was during this period that she met her present husband, also a recovering alcoholic, whom she later married in April 1975. She began drinking again in early 1974, but after entering Alpha House, a short-term treatment center, she discontinued her drinking, and has not done so since February 21, 1974. This represents by far her longest period of abstinence since the onset of her drinking problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In March 1974, appellant and Mr. Hicks entered Just House, where they successfully underwent a long-term treatment program. There, she was advised by the director of that program, as she had previously been counselled at Alpha House, that she not visit her daughter while undergoing treatment and recovery. She complied and visited her only twice during the first 18 months of Donna\u2019s stay at the Cover household. Appellant did, however, maintain telephone contact with the County. On these occasions, she reported to county social workers the progress made by her and Mr. Hicks, who had recovered to the point where he was operating a successful home improvement business. She included in her reports the news of her marriage to Mr. Hicks, the birth of their son in June 1975, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>and their occupancy of an attractive house in the city, as each event occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">On September 22, 1975, two years and four days from the date on which the juvenile court judge had signed the order assuming jurisdiction over Donna\u2019s case, a county social worker wrote to appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">\u201cYour daughter, Donna Guy, has been in foster care for two years now. Our Agency would like to make a definite plan for Donna\u2019s future. You have had very little involvement with and shown little interest in Donna since I became her caseworker over a year ago. I would like to see her placed permanently in her foster home. In order to do this it is necessary to obtain your consent to grant guardianship of Donna to the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services so that she may be released for adoption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">\u201cFoster care is meant to be only a temporary placement for a child until a permanent plan can be arranged. Please give careful thought to this matter and consider what would be in the best interest of Donna. You may call me collect.... I am waiting to hear from you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">This letter elicited an immediate response from appellant, who promptly went to Prince George\u2019s County to see the social worker. On that occasion appellant refused to sign a consent to adoption and commenced a schedule of weekly visits with Donna.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Appellant then filed a petition seeking a review of the juvenile court commitment. Following a hearing on that petition in January 1976, the juvenile court master, before whom appellant and her husband testified, requested a report from the Department of Social Services of Baltimore City on the Hicks\u2019 and on their home. The master then concluded the hearing with this observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">\u201cWell, I can tell you this. The Court is definitely impressed with the progress of the mother and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>present husband and they have indicated to my satisfaction ... their real honest desire to have this child returned... .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">A representative of the Department of Social Services promptly visited the Hicks\u2019 home in Baltimore and then forwarded to the County a report that was favorable to appellant, recommending that Donna be returned to her. The County never delivered a copy of the report to the master or to appellant, but instead filed its guardianship petition in April 1976, after obtaining a consent to adoption from Mr. Guy.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The chancellor heard testimony from appellant and the Covers, and both county and city employees of the Department of Social Services. In general, the city social workers, who were thoroughly acquainted with the Hicks and their home, but not with the Covers, strongly supported appellant in her efforts to have Donna. Conversely, the county social workers, who were familiar only with the other side of the picture, were equally firm in recommending that the petitions be granted. Additionally, a pyschiatrist, who was also unfamiliar with the Hicks\u2019, testified that it would be detrimental to Donna for her then to be taken from the Covers. At the conclusion of the hearing, the chancellor denied both petitions, but, as we have indicated, the in banc panel, which heard the case only on an appeal taken by the County, reversed and granted the guardianship petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Appellant advances six grounds for reversal in this Court, all of which focus on errors allegedly committed by the court in banc. Among those arguments are claims that her rights to procedural due process under both the Federal and State Constitutions, and her right to equal protection under the Federal Constitution, were violated by the County. She also contends that the court in banc lacked jurisdiction because the appeal to that tribunal was not properly perfected. <em>But see Medical Examiners v. Steward, </em>207 Md. 108, 111, 113 A. 2d 426 (1955) (court in banc had power to decide question of its own jurisdiction). We need not reach any of the questions posed by appellant, even assuming arguendo that we can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>review alleged errors of the court in banc, <em>but see Buck v. Folkers, </em>269 Md. 185, 187, 304 A. 2d 826 (1973); <em>State Roads Comm. v. Smith, </em>224 Md. 537, 540, 168 A. 2d 705 (1961); <em>Costigin v. Bond, </em>65 Md. 122, 124, 3 A. 285 (1886), since, in any event, the chancellor misapplied the controlling statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Prior to 1973, when \u00a7 75 was added, the consent requirement in cases of both guardianship preceding adoption and adoption was governed solely by Maryland Code (1957, 1966 Repl. Vol., 1972 Cum. Supp.) Art. 16, \u00a7\u00a772 and 74. In a long line of cases, we have read those provisions, particularly \u00a7 74,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to mean that adoption should not be granted over parental objection unless that course was clearly justified, since such proceedings result in drastic and permanent severing of the strongest and most basic relationships. <em>Dawson v. Eversberg, </em>257 Md. 308, 313, 262 A. 2d 729 (1970); <em>Lippy v. Breidenstein, </em>249 Md. 415, 420, 240 A. 2d 251 (1968); <em>Beltran v. Heim, </em>248 Md. 397, 401-402, 236 A. 2d 723 (1968); <em>Walker v. Gardner, </em>221 Md. 280, 284, 157 A. 2d 273 (1960). This has not meant, of course, that the natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>parent is permitted an absolute, arbitrary veto. <em>Walker v. Gardner, </em>221 Md. at 284; <em>Lagumis v. Ex Parte Lagumis, </em>186 Md. 97, 106, 46 A. 2d 189 (1945); <em>Nutwell v. Pr. Geo\u2019s Co. Soc. Serv., </em>21 Md. App. 100, 106, 318 A. 2d 563 (1974). The primary considerations are the welfare and best interests of the child. <em>Lippy v. Breidenstein, </em>249 Md. at 420; <em>Walker v. Gardner, </em>221 Md. at 284. Nevertheless, as one commentator was moved to observe from our earlier cases, adoption will not be decreed \u201cover the expressed objection of the natural parent or parents, save in very strong cases.\u201d Strahorn, <em>Adoption in Maryland, </em>7 Md. L. Rev. 275,295 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">By its terms, \u00a7 74 requires as a precondition to adoption that the natural parents consent if they \u201chave not lost their parental rights through court action or voluntary relinquishment or abandonment\u201d; it further provides, however, that the court may dispense with this requirement if it \u201cfinds that such consent or consents are withheld contrary to the best interests of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">One of the primary considerations, then, in determining whether a consent is withheld contrary to the best interests of the child is whether there was wilful abandonment on the part of the natural parent. <em>Logan v. Coup, </em>238 Md. 253, 257, 208 A. 2d 694 (1965). Other important considerations are failure to contribute to support, neglect to see or visit the child, and unfitness of a natural parent. <em>Shetler v. Fink, </em>231 Md. 302, 308, 190 A. 2d 76 (1963). \u201cAbandonment,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 74, \u201cimports any wilful and intentional conduct on the part of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child, and, to renounce and forsake the child entirely.\u201d <em>Logan v. Coup, </em>238 Md. at 257-58. <em>Accord, Beltran v. Heim, </em>248 Md. at 402; <em>Nutwell v. Pr. Geo\u2019s Co. Soc. Serv., </em>21 Md. App. at 106-107. This test manifestly imposes a difficult, if not frequently insurmountable, burden on anyone alleging abandonment on the part of a natural parent. <em>See, e.g., Beltran v. Heim, </em>248 Md. at 402 (failure to support not necessarily abandonment; nor were marital indiscretions); <em>Logan v. Coup, </em>238 Md. at 258-59 (naming child as beneficiary of life insurance despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>cessation of visits and financial support held sufficient to rebut abandonment).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">It was against this background of statutory and decisional law that the General Assembly enacted Chapter 296 of the Laws of 1973, effective July 1 of that year, which added a new section 75 to Article 16.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In effect, the Legislature carved out an exception in foster care cases to the existing requirements concerning the consent of natural parents to guardianship and adoption. It did so by creating a presumption in those instances in which the child had been in continuous foster care for two years under the custody of an authorized agency, to the effect that, in the best interests of the child, the agency should be awarded guardianship with the right to consent to adoption or long-term care short of adoption <em>without </em>the consent of the natural parent or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>parents. Where the burden of proof had been on the agency, it is now shifted to the natural parent in those cases in which \u00a7 75 is applicable. In addition, the new statute imposed criteria required to be considered by the court on the question whether the presumption has been rebutted and standards of proof to be sustained by the natural parent in overcoming the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">It was in the application of \u00a7 75 to the facts of this case that the chancellor erred. As we suggested earlier, that section was applicable to this case because Donna had been in continuous foster care for a period of two consecutive years under the custody of an agency authorized by law to make placements. In fairness to the chancellor, who rendered a comprehensive and thorough oral opinion at the conclusion of the testimony, he made what appears to be a studied effort to consider all of the criteria set forth in subsection b of the statute. In light of our disposition of this case, no useful purpose would be served by a detailed reference to his summary. The error occurred, however, in his interpretation of \u00a7 75, demonstrated by his statement that \u201cany evidence tending to show that there was not an abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of a child is sufficient to overcome the presumption created by Article 16 Section 75 ....\u201d Thus, said the chancellor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">\u201c... I do hold that the presumption applies in this case, the presumption created by Article 16 Section 75, but I also hold that there has been sufficient evidence to rebut that presumption, and that there has been evidence which shows that there was not an abandonment on the part of the mother ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\u201cSo I would conclude and find that the consent was not withheld contrary to the interests of the child in these cases ... .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">In so holding, the chancellor failed to apply the \u00a7 75 (c) standard of proof required to rebut the presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>favoring the County. To rebut that presumption, subsection c requires \u201csubstantial proof\u2019 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201c(1) The natural parent will be able to resume his or her parental duties within a reasonable period of time; <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">\u201c(2) The natural parent has played a constructive role in the child\u2019s welfare during the time he has been in foster care.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Subsection c also includes additional factors to be considered by the court in \u201cevaluating the parent\u2019s role.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The court in banc, which gave equally careful consideration to this case, as reflected in its extensive written opinion, correctly noted the requirements of \u00a7 75, but rather than rest its decision on the chancellor\u2019s incorrect application of the statute, determined that appellant had \u201cfailed to produce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption contained in Article 16, \u00a7 75.\u201d In addition, despite its appellate status, it acted as a trier of fact in weighing the evidence presented by the County against that produced by appellant, and then proceeded to an ultimate disposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">\u201c. . . Though the decision is a difficult one, the Court, in reaching the result it has chosen, stresses the fact that Donna\u2019s future with her natural mother is uncertain and problematical, while her future in the continued care and custody of the Petitioner, Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services, appears certain and optimistic. . . .\u201d (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>To the extent, then, that he applied non-abandonment by the natural mother as the test in this case, where the presumption created by Art. 16, \u00a7 75 was the decisive issue, the chancellor misconceived the statute. The appropriate course to be taken in this circumstance, however, is a remand to the circuit court, where, in light of this opinion, the chancellor should apply the statute to the evidence which has been presented, and make a new determination under the County\u2019s petition. It should be clear that we express no opinion as to the ultimate disposition to be made by the chancellor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\n<em>Decree of Circuit Court reversed and remanded to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion; costs to abide the result.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-6\">.
