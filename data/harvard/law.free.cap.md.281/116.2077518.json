A group of plaintiffs consisting of trade associations, bottling companies and retail beverage dealers successfully challenged the tax by obtaining declaratory and injunctive relief in their favor in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The County appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, but we granted certiorari before the case was heard by that court. Since we disagree with the circuit court, we now reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">To gain complete perspective in viewing this case, it is necessary that we begin, not with the enactment of the tax law in question, but with its predecessor, which also failed to survive a test in the circuit court. In 1975 the Montgomery County Council, after overriding a veto of the County Executive, enacted Bill No. 30-75, which imposed a \u201cBeverage Container Tax\u201d upon \u201cevery distributor who <em>sells </em>... beverages in non-reusable beverage containers ...\u201d at the rate of four cents for each container with a normal capacity up to and including 16 fluid ounces and nine cents for each container with a normal capacity in excess of 16 fluid ounces, (emphasis added.) The avowed purpose of that tax was \u201cto derive from a major source of solid waste some of the revenue needed to fund public expenditures for the collection and disposal of solid waste.\u201d The tax was to become effective on March 1, 1976, and by its own terms was to expire on December 31, 1977; thereafter, apparently, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>was to be supplanted by a law imposing a deposit on non-reusable containers. Although Bill No. 30-75 was challenged on several grounds in an equity suit seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, the primary ground for the challenge there, as is also the case regarding the tax in controversy here, was that Bill No. 30-75 established a sales tax which the County was prohibited from imposing by state law. In striking down that tax, the chancellor rested his decision on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Within a matter of weeks, the County Council responded with Bill No. 14-76, imposing a tax upon \u201cevery distributor who <em>supplies </em>to a dealer in Montgomery County non-reusable beverage containers containing beverages\u201d at the rate of two cents for each container with a normal capacity up to and including 16 fluid ounces and four cents for each container with a normal capacity in excess of 16 ounces, (emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cDealer\u201d is defined, in part, as a person engaging in \u201ca retail business\u201d and \u201cDistributor\u201d as one who, in part, \u201csupplies beverages in beverage containers to a dealer in Montgomery County.\u201d The term \u201cBeverage\u201d is defined as \u201cany beer, ale or other malt beverages, soft drinks, carbonated water and iced tea in liquid form intended for human consumption.\u201d The verb \u201csupplies\u201d is defined as the act of \u201cproviding, furnishing, delivering, distributing or transmitting non-reusable beverage containers by a distributor to a dealer in Montgomery County.\u201d Criminal penalties are provided for violators. Unlike its precursor, the tax in question here has no fixed expiration date; nor is its purpose expressly declared by the County Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Again, a court challenge followed in which injunctive and declaratory relief was sought. The plaintiffs, who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>appellees here, attacked Bill No. 14-76 on the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">1. That Bill No. 14-76 imposed a sales tax, which the County was prohibited by state law from enacting.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">2. That Bill No. 14-76, as amended by Bill No. 22-76 to become effective on September 1, 1976, violated \u00a7 52-1 of the Montgomery County Code (1972, 1975 Cum. Supp.i, which provides that \u201call ... taxes shall be levied for a taxable year beginning on July 1. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">3. That Montgomery County had not been granted valid authority by the General Assembly to enact the tax imposed by Bill No. 14-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">4. That the beverage container tax constituted a tax on alcoholic beverages, which state law prohibits the County from imposing.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">5. That Bill No. 14-76 imposed a burden on interstate commerce and thereby violated the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">6. That Bill No. 14-76 violated the Federal Constitution for the further reason that it was void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">7. That Bills No. 14-76 and 22-76 violated Article XI-A, \u00a7 3 of the Maryland Constitution, which prohibits charter counties from enacting laws for any incorporated municipality within their boundaries on any matters covered by the powers lawfully granted to the municipality. This issue was injected into the case by the City of Rockville (the City I, which was granted leave by the circuit court to intervene as a party plaintiff, and which is also an appellee here.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">Subsequent to the filing of its answer to the bill of complaint, the County filed a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs countered with an answer to the motion in which they alleged that there was \u201ca dispute\u201d as to issues 1, 5, 6 and 7. The City, in an answer to the motion for summary judgment, also claimed that a \u201cgenuine dispute\u201d existed in regard to issue 7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In striking down the tax, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>chancellor not only rejected the County\u2019s motion, but entered summary judgment for appellees pursuant to Maryland Rule 610 d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The chancellor rested his decision solely on the ground that Bill No. 14-76 imposed a prohibited sales tax, and did not reach the remaining issues. Though noting the changes in Bill No. 14-76 as opposed to its predecessor, particularly the substitution of the word \u201csupplies\u201d for \u201csells,\u201d the chancellor observed that the County Council was merely \u201cattempting to do indirectly that which [it is] prohibited from doing directly.\u201d He concluded, relying upon the ruling in the first case, that the tax in this case was also one imposed on sales, which the County was expressly prohibited from imposing by state law. Thus, he issued a decree declaring the tax \u201cvoid and of no effect,\u201d and enjoined its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In this Court, the County not only argues that the chancellor erred in ruling that the tax in question was a sales tax prohibited by state law, but also urges that we pass on the remaining questions raised by the bill of complaint. Accordingly, it has briefed and argued each of those issues. Appellees take the position that even if we should reverse the chancellor on the first issue, we must then remand the case to the circuit court for a determination of the remaining questions, since factual disputes are involved which would require the presentation of evidence. We have carefully reviewed the record in light of the points raised by appellees in the circuit court, and addressed here by the County, and we conclude that all but the federal constitutional questions presented by issues 5 and 6 can and should now be decided by this Court. The factual disputes in respect to those constitutional questions are not framed with precision, to say the least, but in an excess of caution we shall remand the case solely for a determination of those two questions. As to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>those questions, therefore, we carefully refrain from expressing any opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">As we shall demonstrate, the remaining points raise purely legal issues and by no stretch of the imagination turn on any factual disputes. Appellees argue, however, that the remaining issues are not properly before us in light of Rule 885, which provides that this Court \u201cwill not ordinarily decide any point or question which does not plainly appear by the record to have been tried and decided by the circuit court.\u201d Thus, appellees maintain, were we to reach those questions, we would be departing from our appellate role, and would be improperly engaging in original fact-finding. This argument is without substance. We cannot, of course, make a factual finding, <em>Hartley v. State, </em>238 Md. 165, 168, 208 A. 2d 72 (1965), but, as we have already stated, no factual dispute exists in respect to these questions, which are purely of a legal nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Rule 885 also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">\u201c. . . [B]ut when a point or question of law had [sic] been presented to the court and a decision of that point or question of law by this Court is necessary or desirable for the guidance of the circuit court, or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal to this Court, the point or question of law may be decided by this Court even though it was not decided by the circuit court.. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Although the oral argument before the chancellor was not made part of the record, apparently because it was not transcribed, it is evident that all of the issues were \u201cpresented\u201d to him. This is apparent from the extensive legal memoranda filed below. That the chancellor chose to rest his decision on one of several alternative grounds presented to him, and found it unnecessary to decide the remainder, does not preclude us from reaching them. <em>Panamerican Co. v. Broun, </em>238 Md. 438, 447, 209 A. 2d 575 (1965); <em>Kent v. Mer.-Safe Dep. </em>&amp; <em>Tr. Co., </em>225 Md. 590, 593, 171 A. 2d 723 (1961); <em>Heat Exchangers v. Map Constr., </em>34 Md. App. 679, 681-82, 368 A. 2d 1088 (1977); <em>Sanitary Facilities II v. Blum, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>22 Md. App. 90, 101, 322 A. 2d 228, <em>cert. </em>denied, 272 Md. 748 (1974); <em>see Montgomery County v. Glassman, </em>245 Md. 192, 198, 225 A. 2d 448 (1967). Not only were the issues presented below, but also they have been thoroughly briefed here; moreover, we think a decision here may reduce, if not eliminate, the expense and delay of another appeal. We hold that all but the federal constitutional questions are properly before us and are ripe for appellate review. We turn first to the question whether Bill No. 14-76 enacted a sales tax which the County is prohibited from imposing by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Our determination of whether the tax in controversy here is a sales tax which the County is prohibited from imposing necessarily begins with a reference to the pertinent state statutes. We recognize at the outset that the statewide sales tax provided in Maryland Code (1957, 1975 Repl. Vol.) Art. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 324-371 is by express definition a retail sales tax.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is clearly established not only by both its inclusion in Article 81 under the subtitle \u201cRetail Sales Tax Act\u201d and number of definitions in \u00a7 324 which mention the word \u201cretail,\u201d but also by \u00a7 325 which, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">\u201cFor the privilege of selling certain tangible personal property at <em>retail </em>as defined [in \u00a7 324] and for the privilege of dispensing certain selected services defined as sales at <em>retail </em>by \u00a7 324 (fl of this subtitle a vendor shall collect from the purchaser a tax at the rate specified in this section on the price of each separate <em>retail sale </em>made in this State .... The tax imposed by this section shall be paid by the purchaser . ...\u201d (emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>We draw closer to the problem at hand, however, when we consider the subtitle \u201cLocal Sales Tax\u201d in Article 81, which encompasses \u00a7\u00a7 411A, 411B and 411C. Section 411A authorizes Baltimore City, Anne Arundel County and Baltimore County to impose \u201ca retail sales tax\u201d within their respective jurisdictions, the administration of which is to be conducted by the State Comptroller. By its own various terms, the tax authorized by \u00a7 411A is closely meshed with the statewide retail sales act. Section 411C authorizes Anne Arundel County to impose \u201ca sales or use tax upon fuels and utilities used by commercial and industrial businesses; residential, commercial and industrial telephone service; and space rentals.\u201d It is \u00a7 411B, however, that becomes the focal point for the contention that Montgomery County is prohibited by state law from imposing the tax in question. In relevant part, \u00a7 411B provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\u201cFrom and after July 1, 1971, no county, municipality or any other political subdivision within this State shall have the power to levy or impose a sales tax or use tax, or any excise tax on the issuance of motor vehicle certificates of title. .. .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">At first glance, an issue arises which might suggest a simple answer to the argument that the County was prohibited from imposing the beverage container tax. Arguably, the sales tax which is denied the political subdivisions of this state by \u00a7 411B is limited to the retail variety. Under this theory, the \u201csales tax\u201d prohibited by \u00a7 411B partakes of the character of the retail sales tax established by various preceding provisions in Article 81, particularly \u00a7 411A. Thus, \u00a7 411A, although expressly providing for a \u201cretail sales tax,\u201d uses that term interchangeably with \u201csales tax.\u201d In its brief, the County asserted this position and argued that the beverage container tax, even if deemed a sales tax, was not a retail sales tax; consequently, it was not proscribed by \u00a7 411B, which, under this theory, would prohibit only retail sales taxes. At oral argument, however, the County retreated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>from this position and conceded, correctly in our view, that it was prohibited by \u00a7 411B from imposing any sales tax, whether of the retail genre or not. The decisive issue, then, is whether the beverage container tax in question is a sales tax. In considering this question, we shall make limited reference to those definitions contained in \u00a7 325 which we regard as relevant here, even though that section deals with the retail sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The nature of any sales tax can best be determined by a reference to the particular statute creating it. Moreover, few if any sales tax laws are alike. Consequently, it is not possible to formulate a general definition of the term \u201csales tax,\u201d or even to identify with any uniformity the elements of such a tax. Two ingredients, however, are commonly found in most sales taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The first and most obvious attribute of a sales tax is the taxable event which triggers payment of the tax \u2014\u25a0 the sale. Due, <em>The Nature and Structure of Sales Taxation, </em>9 Vand. L. Rev. 123 (1956). <em>See generally </em>Ball, <em>What Is A Sale for Sales Tax Purposes?, </em>9 Vand. L. Rev. 227 (1956). The tax here, as Bill No. 14-76 clearly states, is imposed upon the distributor \u201cwho <em>supplies </em>to a dealer in Montgomery County non-reusable beverage containers.\u201d The pivotal event occurs when the distributor \u201csupplies,\u201d rather than sells, the containers to a dealer. \u201cSupplies\u201d is defined as \u201cthe act of providing, furnishing, delivering, distributing or transmitting\u201d the containers; nowhere is a sale mentioned or required. The chancellor dismissed the language of the act with the implication that the County was merely imposing a prohibited sales tax under the guise of another label. Or, as the chancellor observed, the County was \u201cattempting to do indirectly\u201d what it was \u201cprohibited from doing directly.\u201d Appellees take the same position here, but we do not agree. Not only does Bill No. 14-76 carefully exclude the word \u201csale\u201d from the definition of \u201csupplies,\u201d but also the definition of \u201cdistributor\u201d includes \u201cany multiple outlet retail chain store which supplies beverages in beverage containers to its individual outlets in Montgomery County.\u201d Thus, the tax is imposed regardless of the method by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the central distributor distributes the beverages to its own individual outlets. For purposes of the tax here, it matters only that the distributor supplies the beverages. This demonstrates, then, that the taxable event need not, and frequently will not, be a sale. Consequently, there is no justification for the bald conclusion that the tax is dependent upon the occurrence of a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">A second identifying characteristic of a sales tax is the standard by which it is measured. Under Art. 81, \u00a7 325, the state retail sales tax is imposed by applying the tax rate to the purchase price of the commodity. <em>Lane Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>228 Md. 90, 94, 178 A. 2d 904 (1962); <em>see Balto. Country Club v. Comptroller, </em>272 Md. 65, 73, 321 A. 2d 308 (1974) ; <em>cf. Szabo Food Service, Inc. of Cal. v. State Bd. of Equal., </em>46 Cal. App. 3d 268, 119 Cal. Rptr. 911, 913 (1975) (employer subsidized cafeteria; held, subsidy payments were not subject to sales tax); <em>Penton Publishing Co. v. Kosydar, </em>45 Ohio St.2d 16, 340 N.E.2d 396, 398 (1976) (free distribution of magazine held to be a sale, where entire cost of distribution and printing was borne by advertisers; thus, sales of materials to publisher were tax-exempt); <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Corp. v. Kosydar, </em>43 Ohio St.2d 186, 331 N.E.2d 440 (1975) (dispensing equipment loaned to retailers was not acquired for a consideration and thus was not taxable). In one form or another, then, sales taxes are measured by the purchase price or consideration paid for the items. The beverage container tax, however, is measured by neither. Rather, it is the number and capacity of the non-reusable containers supplied by a distributor to a dealer which determines the amount of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">In sum, the beverage container tax imposed by Bill No. 14-76, not arising from sale and not being measured by purchase price or consideration, is lacking the two most vital identifying characteristics of a sales tax. We therefore hold that the tax was not a sales tax and, consequently, was not prohibited by Article 81, \u00a7 411B.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Appellees contend that Bill No. 14-76, as amended by Bill No. 22-76 to become effective on September 1, 1976, is in conflict with \u00a7 52-1 of the Montgomery County Code (1972, 1975 Cum. Supp.'i, which, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqV\">\u201cIn the county ... all ... taxes shall be levied for a taxable year beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30 in the next calendar year . ...\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFZ\">A short answer to this contention is that Bills No. 14-76 and 22-76 were enacted, not upon the authority of \u00a7 52-1, but upon \u00a7 52-17, which contains no requirement that a tax imposed thereunder become effective as of any particular date.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Furthermore, \u00a7 52-1 is limited in its application to taxes on property, both real and personal, and appellees concede that the beverage container tax is not a property tax, but a form of excise tax. Unlike a property tax, an excise tax is not based on the valuation of property. <em>Herman v. M. </em>&amp; <em>C. C. of Baltimore, </em>189 Md. 191, 197, 55 A. 2d 491 (1947); <em>Blaustein v. Tax Commn., </em>176 Md. 423, 426, 4 A. 2d 861 (1939). The terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u201cdate of finality\u201d \u201csemiannual date of finality,\u201d and \u201ctaxable year,\u201d as used in \u00a7 52-1, have no meaning except when considered in the context of property taxes. <em>See State Tax Commission v. Armco, 226 </em>Md. 533, 540, 174 A. 2d 327 (1961). <em>See also St. Dep\u2019t of A. &amp; T. v. Greyhound Comp., </em>271 Md. 575, 597, 320 A. 2d 40 (1974). Section 52-1 was originally enacted by the General Assembly as part of a public local law, Chapter 278 of the Laws of 1941, prior to the advent of home rule in Montgomery County. Consequently, the term \u201cdate of finality\u201d in 52-1 bears the same connotation as it, does in Art. 81, \u00a7 2 (20), in which \u201c \u2018date of finality\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201cthe date as of which assessments become final for the taxable year.\u201d Section 2 (20c) defines the term \u201ctaxable year\u201d as \u201cthe period by or for which <em>property </em>taxes are computed, levied, and collected.\u201d (emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The terms in \u00a7 52-1, then, have no application to the beverage container tax, which is an excise tax. Chapter 278 itself, moreover, removes any possible doubt that \u00a7 52-1 applies only to property taxes. Section 6 expressly provides that \u201cnothing in this Act shall be construed, in any way, to affect the date of finality or the taxable year for the levying and collection of ordinary state taxes.\u201d Ordinary taxes have been defined as direct taxes imposed upon real and personal property. <em>Rapley v. Montgomery County, </em>261 Md. 98, 110, 274 A. 2d 124 (1971); <em>Latrobe v. Comptroller, </em>232 Md. 64, 70, 192 A. 2d 101 (1963). We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 52-1 presents no barrier to the enactment of Bills No. 14-76 and 22-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Appellees advance their contention that the County lacks authority from the State to enact Bill No. 14-76 in the form of two alternative arguments. First, they take the position that the only power to tax which the General Assembly has granted to the County by public general law is found in Art. 25A, \u00a7, 5, the Express Powers Act. They refer particularly to \u00a7 5 (O), entitled \u201cAssessments, Levy and Collection of Taxes\u201d for the first prong of their contention: that \u00a7 5 (O l <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>only authorizes the County to establish a property tax, a proposition which the County makes no effort to resist.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In the alternative, appellees maintain that although \u00a7 5 (Oi confers only the power to levy a property tax, that provision nevertheless embraces the entire subject of taxation for purposes of Art. XI-A, \u00a7 4 of the Maryland Constitution, which provides that \u201cno public local law shall be enacted by the General Assembly for [the] . . . County on any subject covered by the express powers granted as above provided.\u201d Clearly, the County relies for its authority to enact Bill No. 14-76 on \u00a7 52-17 of the Montgomery County Code, a public local law enacted by the General Assembly as Chapter 808 of the Laws of 1963, some 15 years after the County had adopted its charter. Thus, appellees argue, the County was without any authority to impose the tax here in view of the constitutional proscription against such enactment of local legislation by the General Assembly.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Since the County does not contest the argument that \u00a7 5 (0) grants only the power to provide for a property tax and that the Express Powers Act grants no other taxing power, we address the novel but unpersuasive argument that \u00a7 5 (0) somehow covers the entire field of taxation within the meaning of Art. XI-A \u00a7 4, so as to bar any local legislation by the General Assembly on that subject. Just how the Express Powers Act can grant the power to establish only a' property tax, but at the same time cover the entire subject of taxation is not revealed to us. In any event, virtually the identical argument was advanced and soundly rejected in <em>Reinhardt v. Anne Arundel Co., </em>31 Md. App. 355, 373, 356 A. 2d 917 (1976), where a similar attack was mounted on Art. 81, \u00a7 411C, which we mentioned earlier. As the court there observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">\u201c... The Legislature ... in enacting the Express Powers Act\u2019s grant of taxing power.\u201d (emphasis in Baltimore City and to those Counties of the State who elected to adopt a charter form of government. It did not surrender its right to enact local taxation legislation in areas not included within the Express Powers Act\u2019s grant of taxing power.\u201d (emphasis in original, l</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We likewise agree that the entire subject of taxation is not \u201ccovered\u201d by the Express Powers Act within the meaning of Art. XI-A, \u00a7 4 of the Maryland Constitution. We therefore hold that \u00a7 52-17 of the Montgomery County Code, though enacted by the General Assembly as a public local law, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>not violate that constitutional prohibition by granting the County the power to impose additional forms of taxation beyond the property tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Appellees next contend that Bill No. 14-76 constitutes an impermissible tax on alcoholic beverages in contravention of not only \u00a7 52-17 of the Montgomery County Code, but also Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol.) Art. 2B, \u00a7 135, which expressly denies to the political subdivisions of this state the power \u201cto impose any tax on distilled spirits, beer, wine or any other alcoholic beverage.\u201d Under this argument, Bill No. 14-76, by allegedly imposing a tax \u201con the quantity of beer in a container\u201d is consequently a tax on beer, and is therefore prohibited by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">A complete refutation of appellees\u2019 argument is contained within the language of Bill No. 14-76 itself. The act imposes a tax on every distributor who supplies certain non-reusable beverage containers to a dealer in Montgomery County. Bill No. 14-76 neither taxes the contents of the containers nor measures the amount of the tax by those contents. That a container subject to the tax might happen to contain beer, which concededly cannot be the subject of a county tax, does not convert a tax on certain distributors of non-reusable containers into one on alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">In sum, then, Art. 2B, \u00a7 135 prohibits political subdivisions from imposing a tax on alcoholic beverages. The beverage container tax imposed by the County, however, does not run afoul of the prohibition because it is merely a tax on the containers in which one particular kind of alcoholic beverage is sold. <em>Cf. Bowie Inn v. City of Bowie, </em>274 Md. 230, 248-49, 335 A. 2d 679 (1975) (municipality\u2019s mandatory container deposit law held not to conflict with state preemption of alcoholic beverage regulation!.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">YI</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">The final issue to be decided here arises from the intervention of the City, which contends that Bills No. 14-76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>and 22-76 are regulatory measures, rather than revenue legislation, and therefore violate Art. XI-A, \u00a7 3 of the Maryland Constitution. That provision prohibits a charter county from enacting \u201claws or regulations for any incorporated . . . municipality in said County, on any matter covered by the powers granted to said .. . municipality by the Act incorporating it, or any subsequent Act or Acts amendatory thereto.\u201d The City argues that the effect of the beverage container tax is to regulate the depositing and disposal of all waste materials within the boundaries of Rockville, when Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 23A, \u00a7 2 (14) grants express power to such municipalities to \u201cregulate or prevent the throwing or depositing of any dirt, garbage, trash, or liquids in any public place and to provide for the proper disposal of such material.\u201d The City reminds us that this very same provision was held by us to be adequate authority for the container deposit ordinance, a regulatory measure by any standard, which we upheld in <em>Bowie Inn v. City of Bowie, </em>274 Md. 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The thrust of the City\u2019s argument, then, is that Montgomery County cannot adopt any measures regulating non-reusable beverage containers that would apply within the City\u2019s borders; hence the importance of a determination as to whether Bills No. 14-76 and 22-76, though labeled revenue enactments, are instead prohibited regulatory measures. As we have said in a similar context, \u201cregulatory Acts passed under the guise of revenue Acts must be held void.\u201d <em>Theatrical Corp. v. Brennan, </em>180 Md. 377, 385, 24 A. 2d 911 (1942); <em>see Anne Arundel County v. English, </em>182 Md. 514, 520-21, 35 A. 2d 135 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The imposition of taxes is, concededly, a recognized mode of regulating the use of non-returnable beverage containers. 1 F. Grad, <em>Treatise on Environmental Law </em>\u00a7 4.04[1] (1975); Ruchelman, <em>Municipal Regulation of Non-returnable Containers, </em>1 Envt\u2019l Law 257 (1971); <em>see Society of Plastics Indus., Inc. v. City of New York, </em>68 Misc. 2d 366, 326 N.Y.S.2d 788, 794-95 (Sup. Ct. 1971). The theory underlying such a tax is that in one form or another it is passed on to the consumer, who will be encouraged to purchase beverages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>in returnable containers, thereby reducing the amount of solid waste with which the local community must deal. Among the several possible alternatives for alleviating the problem, the tax is suggested as the equitable solution, since it forces \u201cthe consumer who purchases the throwaway to pay for collection of container litter.\u201d Greef &amp; Martin, <em>Beverage Container Legislation: A Policy and Constitutional Evaluation, </em>52 Texas L. Rev. 351, 361 (1974). The question here, then, is whether the beverage container tax was in reality such a regulatory measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">To support its argument that Bills No. 14-76 and 22-76 are regulatory measures, the City points to the fact that Bill No. 30-75, the predecessor which was previously struck down, was included in a package of three bills aimed at regulating non-returnable beverage containers; and that this purpose was clearly emphasized in the testimony presented to the County Council prior to passage. Our difficulty with this argument is that it refers to Bill No. 30-75, not to those in dispute here. Moreover, if legislative enactments otherwise establish themselves as valid revenue measures, we do not examine the motives of legislators who voted for them, even assuming that regulation was their objective. <em>Brown v. State, </em>177 Md. 321, 328-29, 9 A. 2d 209 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In <em>Theatrical Corp. v. Brennan, </em>180 Md. at 381-82, we enunciated the criteria for determining whether a particular legislative act is a revenue measure or a regulatory enactment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">\u201c. .. A regulatory measure may produce revenue, but in such a case the amount must be reasonable and have some definite relation to the purpose of the Act. A revenue measure, on the other hand, may also provide for regulation, but if the raising of revenue is the primary purpose, the amount of the tax is not reviewable by the courts. There is no set rule by which it can be determined in which category a particular Act primarily belongs. In general, it may be said that when it appears from the Act itself that revenue is its main objective, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the amount of the tax supports that theory, the enactment is a revenue measure. \u2018. .. [W]here the fee is imposed for the purpose of regulation, and the statute requires compliance with certain conditions in addition to the payment of the prescribed sum, such sum is a license proper, imposed by virtue of the police powers; but where it is exacted solely for revenue purposes and its payment gives the right to carry on the business without any further conditions, it is a tax.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><em>Accord, American Nat\u2019l v. M. &amp; C. C., </em>245 Md. 23, 33-34, 224 A. 2d 883 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Here, the amount of the tax rate is significant. The fact that it is moderate by comparative standards tends to confirm that it is primarily a revenue raising device, rather than a means of regulating non-reusable beverage containers. If the tax rate were high, then it would more likely serve as a deterrent to the use of such containers, and if high enough, could be regarded as a thinly veiled method of banning the containers. <em>See </em>Note, <em>State and Local Regulation of Nonretumable Beverage Containers, </em>[1972], Wis. L. Rev. 536, 540. As we have intimated, however, even a relatively modest tax may cause a burden to the distributor who must pay it, or to the consumer who may ultimately bear its burden. But what the Supreme Court said in this regard in <em>Sonzinsky v. United States, </em>300 U.S. 506, 513-14, 57 S. Ct. 554, 81 L. Ed. 772 (1937), is instructive here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201cEvery tax is in some measure regulatory. To some extent it interposes an economic impediment to the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed. But a tax is not any the less a tax because it has a regulatory effect . .. and it has long been established that an Act of Congress which on its face purports to be an exercise of the taxing power is not any the less so because the tax is burdensome or tends to restrict or suppress the thing taxed. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">\u201cInquiry into the hidden motives which may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>move Congress to exercise a power constitutionally conferred upon it is beyond the competency of courts. . . . They will not undertake, by collateral inquiry as to the measure of the regulatory effect of a tax, to ascribe to Congress an attempt, under the guise of taxation, to exercise another power denied by the Federal Constitution. . . .\u201d (citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><em>Accord, United States v. Ross, </em>458 F. 2d 1144, 1145 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U. S. 868 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In our view, Bills No. 14-76 and 22-76 are revenue measures, since the raising of revenue is their dominant thrust. Stripped of the imposition of the tax itself and the necessary accompanying definitions, the bills would be virtually meaningless. In no real sense is any effort made in the bills to regulate those distributors directly affected by the tax. Nor is it properly our concern that a possible collateral economic effect of the tax may be to regulate the consumer\u2019s purchasing habits. Since the bills are revenue measures, they were not enacted in contravention of Article XI-A, \u00a7 3 of the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">As we indicated earlier, we shall remand the case solely for a determination of the two federal constitutional issues, which, we were assured, present factual disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\"><em>Judgment reversed; remanded for further' </em>proceedings. <em>in conformity with this opinion; appellees to pay costs.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\">. As with Bill No. 30-75, the County Council found it necessary to override a veto of the County Executive in enacting Bill No. 14-76. Although by its original terras, the tax was to become effective on July 1,_ 1976, its effective date was delayed, presumably because of the veto, until August 15th. In the meantime, the County Council, on July_ 13th, enacted emergency legislation in the form of Bill No. 22-76, which delayed the effective date of the tax until September 1st.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-13\">.
