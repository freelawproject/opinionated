We reverse the judgment of the trial court in part and affirm it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Tyrese Jenkins, Hopeton Wiggan, David D., Kenny Cloud and Brucie B. were members of a gang <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> named after a housing project located in the Fair Haven section of New Haven. On October 7, 1996, at approximately 11:15 p.m., the gang went to a housing project, also located in New Haven and referred to as \u201cthe ghetto,\u201d to settle a dispute with the defendant and others, who were members of a rival gang that resided there.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Cloud stayed in the car, while Jenkins, Wiggan, David D. and Brucie B., with guns at their sides, went looking for the defendant. The four men entered the housing project through a hole in a fence and, as they approached, they noticed the defendant along with three others, namely, Duane Clark, Bobby \u201cB.O.\u201d Cook and Ryan Baldwin, standing and talking near a green electrical box. When the defendant and the others saw the gang members approaching, Clark exclaimed, \u201cShoot the motherfucker,\u201d and a gunfight ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">When the first shots were fired, Wiggan and Brucie B. ran for cover behind a dumpster. Jenkins ran diagonally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>across a parking lot located in the complex. Both sides exchanged a barrage of gunfire. As Wiggan, Brucie B. and Jenkins retreated from the complex, Jenkins was shot in the leg. Jenkins hobbled quickly away from the complex, but another bullet struck him and he collapsed. Wiggan and Brucie B. went back into the complex and found Jenkins sitting up against a wall. The two picked up Jenkins and carried him to the car. Cloud, David D., Brucie B. and Wiggan took Jenkins to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where he died from his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Leroy Townsend, a local man, witnessed the beginning of the disturbance as he stood near the electrical box, smoking marijuana.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At trial, Townsend testified that he had heard Clark say, \u201cShoot the motherfucker,\u201d and that he saw the defendant shoot Jenkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Arkady Katsnelson, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on the victim. Katsnelson testified that Jenkins suffered two bullet wounds, one of which was fatal. One bullet, a nine millimeter round, entered the lower front portion of Jenkins\u2019 right leg and exited through the back of it. The other bullet, a .44 caliber round, which caused the fatal wound, entered through the upper right side of Jenkins\u2019 chest just below his collarbone and then penetrated the chest wall, the right lung, the heart, the diaphragm, part of the liver, the organs of the abdomen and eventually lodged in some soft tissue located in his abdominal cavity. We will provide additional facts as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">The defendant first claims that the evidence presented by the state was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain his conviction for conspiracy to commit murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 53a-54a (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state concedes, and we agree, that Clark, who was tried with the defendant, may not be considered as a coconspirator.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the state failed to prove at trial that the defendant had agreed with someone else to murder Jenkins, the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-54a (a). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>250 Conn. 611, 657-58, 737 A.2d 404 (1999), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>529 U.S. 1060, 120 S. Ct. 1568, 146 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">At the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief and again at the close of all of the evidence, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the basis of the insufficiency of the evidence. The court denied both motions. After the verdict, and again during the sentencing proceeding, the defendant made several oral motions for acquittal. The court denied each of these motions as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [trier of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>237 Conn. 390, 435, 678 A.2d 1338 (1996). In this process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 510, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u201cWhile the [trier of fact] must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be [proven] beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . If it is reasonable and logical for the [trier] to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the [trier] is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Newsome, </em>238 Conn. 588, 617, 682 A.2d 972 (1996). Moreover, [i]n evaluating evidence that could yield contrary inferences, the [trier of fact] is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>236 Conn. 189, 195, 672 A.2d 488 (1996). As we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>230 Conn. 686, 693, 646 A.2d 147 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>[229 Conn. 328, 332, 641 A.2d 123 (1994)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>194 Conn. 665, 671-72, 485 A.2d 913 (1984); nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the [trier], would have resulted in an acquittal. . . . On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [trier\u2019s] verdict of guilty. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 196; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115,134, 646 A.2d 169 (1994).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 177-78, 728 A.2d 466, cert, denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999). On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the defendant conspired to murder Jenkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u201cTo establish the crime of conspiracy under \u00a7 53a-48 ... it must be shown that an agreement was made between two or more persons to engage in conduct constituting a crime and that the agreement was followed by an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy by any one of the conspirators. The state must also show intent on the part of the accused that conduct constituting a crime be performed. . . . Further, the prosecution must show both that the conspirators intended to agree and that they intended to commit the elements of the underlying offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 657-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u201cTo establish the crime of conspiracy [to commit murder . . . the state must show] that an agreement was made between two or more persons to engage in conduct constituting [the crime of murder] and that the agreement was followed by an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy by any one of the conspirators. . . . While the state must prove an agreement [to commit murder], the existence of a formal agreement between the conspirators need not be proved because [i]t is only in rare instances that conspiracy may be established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>by proof of an express agreement to unite to accomplish an unlawful puipose. . . . [T]he requisite agreement or confederation may be inferred from proof of the separate acts of the individuals accused as coconspirators and from the circumstances surrounding the commission of these acts. . . . Further, [conspiracy can seldom be proved by direct evidence. It may be inferred from the activities of the accused persons.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>242 Conn. 485, 491-92, 698 A.2d 898 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Here, the only evidence that the state presented in support of a conspiracy consisted of Clark\u2019s statement to \u201c[s]hoot the motherfuckers\u201d and the subsequent gunfight that ensued between the two gangs. As stated previously, the jury acquitted Clark of the conspiracy to commit murder charge, and, thus, he does not qualify as a coconspirator. <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>213 Conn. 243, 250-53, 567 A.2d 1173 (1989). Moreover, although the state alleged that the defendant also conspired with Cook and Baldwin, the record is devoid of any evidence of an agreement. The record simply does not contain evidence of separate acts and circumstances to support a prior agreement between the defendant and any of the alleged coconspirators. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s conviction of conspiracy to commit murder must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly concluded that sufficient evidence existed in the record to support his conviction of murder as an accessory in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 53a-54a (a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Specifically, the defendant claims that there is insufficient evidence in the record to prove beyond a reasonable doubt either that he aided the person who murdered Jenkins or that he acted with the specific intent to murder him. The state responds that ample evidence exists in the record to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of murder under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-54a. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We first articulate the standard of review applicable to the defendant\u2019s claim. \u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency [of the evidence] claim, we apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>254 Conn. 472, 478-79, 757 A.2d 578 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u201cThe statutory provision governing accessory liability, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8, provides in relevant part that [a] person, acting with the mental state required for the commission of an offense, who . . . intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct . . . as if he were the principal offender. We have previously stated that a conviction under \u00a7 53a-8 requires [the state to prove the defendant\u2019s] dual intent . . . [first] that the accessory have the intent to aid the principal and [second] that in so aiding he intend to commit the offense with which he is charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>202 Conn. 520, 525-26, 522 A.2d 277 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>252 Conn. 714, 748, 751 A.2d 372 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u201cIntent is generally proven by circumstantial evidence because direct evidence of the accused\u2019s state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of mind is rarely available. . . . Therefore, intent is often inferred from conduct . . . and from the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence and the rational inferences drawn therefrom. . . . This does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt . . . because this court has held that a jury\u2019s factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable. . . . Nevertheless, because intent to cause the death of a person is an element of the crime . . . that intent must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Furthermore, [ijntent to cause death may be inferred from the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 748-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Thus, to convict the defendant of murder as an accessory, the jury had to conclude that the defendant had the intent to aid Cook or Baldwin in the crime and that he had the intent to commit the crime itself. The jury logically could not have concluded that the defendant aided Clark because it acquitted Clark of the conspiracy and accessory charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The jury reasonably could have found that the defendant had the intent to kill Jenkins. The record contains evidence that the defendant had an ongoing dispute with the victim and the rival gang. Townsend identified the defendant, Clark, Cook and Baldwin as being at the scene of the crime. Moreover, Wiggan testified that the defendant, as well as Cook and Baldwin, were at the scene.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The evidence established that the defendant fired multiple shots from his nine millimeter handgun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>at the victim and the other members of the rival gang who were involved in the fight. The fact that the defendant fired multiple shots from a nine millimeter handgun at the victim, coupled with the fact that he did this in response to someone saying, \u201cShoot the motherfuckers,\u201d satisfies both of the intent requirements necessary for accessorial liability. See id. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence in the record is sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Next, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly instructed the jury to disregard Townsend\u2019s testimony that he smoked five marijuana cigarettes prior to making his observations because neither party presented evidence as to the effect that the marijuana had on the witness\u2019 ability to observe accurately the events on October 7, 1996. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court\u2019s instruction to disregard the evidence violated his constitutional rights to confront witnesses and to have the jury evaluate the credibility of witnesses on the basis of properly admitted evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Although the defendant concedes that he did not preserve this issue at trial, he argues that the claim is reviewable under the <em>Golding </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The state argues that the claim is not reviewable under <em>Golding </em>because the court\u2019s instruction did not deprive the defendant of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\u201cIt is well settled that a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the claim is of constitutional magnitude, alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>250 Conn. 807, 815, 740 A.2d 371 (1999). The first two <em>Golding </em>requirements involve whether the claim is reviewable, and the second two involve whether there was constitutional error requiring a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>supra, 815. This corurt may dispose of the claim on any one of the conditions that the defendant does not meet. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Heredia, </em>253 Conn. 543, 559-60, 754 A.2d 114 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">As a threshold matter, we note that although the defendant has framed these claims in terms of a denial of his right to confrontation and his due process right to a fair trial, the claims do not present constitutional issues, but rather evidentiary issues related to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. \u201cClearly, the defendant has put a constitutional tag on . . . nonconstitutional evidentiary ruling [s]. <em>State </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>203 Conn. 445, 455, 525 A.2d 101 (1987) .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>[207 Conn. 35, 46, 540 A.2d 42 (1988)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 403, 497 A.2d 956 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 18, 438 A.2d 867 (1982). <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>215 Conn. 1, 5, 574 A.2d 188 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>215 Conn. 653, 659, 577 A.2d 1036 (1990), cert, denied, 498 U.S. 1048, 111 S. Ct. 756, 112 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1991). \u201cJust as every claim of evidentiary error by the trial court is not truly constitutional in nature; see, e.g., <em>[State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 241]; eveiy claim of instructional error is not truly constitutional in nature. We have recognized, for example, that claimed instructional errors regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the elements of an offense; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 543, 613 A.2d 770 (1992); and claimed instructional errors regarding the burden of proof or the presumption of innocence; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 289, 623 A.2d 42 (1993); are constitutional in nature, so as to satisfy the second <em>Golding </em>requirement. We have also recognized, however, that claimed instructional errors regarding general principles of credibility of witnesses are not constitutional in nature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 738, 595 A.2d 322 (1991). Indeed, it would trivialize the constitution to transmute a nonconstitutional claim into a constitutional claim simply because of the label placed on it by a party because of a strained connection between it and a fundamental constitutional right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>242 Conn. 143, 151-52, 698 A.2d 297 (1997). Therefore, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim in the present case because it merely implicates general principles of credibility related to the evidence presented, rather than a violation of constitutional magnitude, involving a fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u201c \u2018The right to confrontation is fundamental to a fair trial under both the federal and state constitutions. <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.

The right of cross-examination is not, however, absolute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 284, 497 A.2d 35 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>42 Conn. App. 790, 794, 682 A.2d 513 (1996). ... [A] defendant\u2019s right of [cross-examination] is not infringed if the defendant fails to pursue a line of inquiry open to him. . . . The test is whether the opportunity to cross-examine existed, not whether full use of such opportunity was made. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 533, 673 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>1117 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>supra, [684].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>50 Conn.

There is no evidence as to what effect it had on him. Because there is no such evidence, you must not speculate that he was or was not affected by it.\u201d The record does not reflect, nor does the defendant claim, that the court placed any restrictions on his ability to cross-examine Townsend on the issue of his marijuana usage. Rather, the defendant argues that the court\u2019s instruction not to speculate as to the effect of Townsend\u2019s marijuana usage was improper because it impaired his right to confrontation by precluding the jury from considering a matter that was brought before it by the mere fact that the record contained evidence that Townsend used marijuana prior to making his observations. Although the defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine Townsend on this issue, he failed to make full use of that opportunity. Accordingly, the court\u2019s instruction that the jury should not speculate on what effect the marijuana had on Townsend\u2019s perceptions did not deprive the defendant of his constitutional right to confrontation. The defendant made a tactical decision not to ask the witness what effect the marijuana had on him. Therefore, because the defendant\u2019s claim does not involve the denial of a fundamental right, the defendant\u2019s claim is not reviewable under the second prong of <em>Golding.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Furthermore, we do not consider whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the court\u2019s charge was improper and, if so, whether the claimed impropriety requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly allowed the state to present evidence, through the testimony of Idella Davis, of an alleged prior crime that was not properly admissible. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court improperly admitted evidence that he illegally possessed firearms approximately one week prior to the shooting in the present case. In response, the state argues that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence because Davis\u2019 testimony did not unduly prejudice the defendant and because it established that the defendant had the means necessary to commit the crimes charged. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The state made an. offer of proof, outside the presence of the jury, regarding the admission of this evidence. The defendant objected to the evidence on the grounds that it unduly prejudiced him and that it was impermissible criminal propensity evidence.

The state further argues that the evidence did not prejudice the defendant. \u201cEvidence indicating that an accused possessed an article with which the particular crime charged may have been accomplished is generally relevant to show that the accused had the means to commit the crime. . . . The state does not have to connect a weapon directly to the defendant and the crime. It is necessary only that the weapon be suitable for the commission of the offense.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>46 Conn. App. 578, 584, 700 A.2d 96, cert, denied, 243 Conn. 938, 702 A.2d 644 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">Here, the state presented an offer of proof prior to the court\u2019s ruling on the evidence at issue. We conclude that the court properly admitted Davis\u2019 testimony because it helped the state to prove that the defendant had the tools necessary for committing the crimes charged. Further, the evidence was material to the state\u2019s case because it helped establish the elements of the crimes charged. Specifically, the evidence estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>lished that, prior to the crime, the defendant had a gun in his possession that was the same type of gun used in the shooting. From this evidence, the jury logically could infer that the defendant used the same gun that Davis saw him with to commit the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Finally, the court recognized the possibility of prejudice to the defendant and properly weighed the probative value of the evidence versus its prejudice to the defendant. The court minimized the possibility of prejudice by limiting the state\u2019s inquiry to the solicitation of evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s possession of a firearm. The court did not allow in extraneous prejudicial material such as the fact that the defendant allegedly held the gun to the witness\u2019 head during the encounter. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Davis\u2019 testimony that she witnessed the defendant in possession of a firearm similar to the type used to murder Jenkins approximately six days prior to the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury regarding the state\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The state responds that the court properly charged the jury on the burden of proof because the charge did not mislead the jury. The state further argues that the courts of this state have approved the use of similar language in charging the jury on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">The defendant challenges the following language that the court used to charge the jury: \u201cBefore you can render a verdict of guilty, the state must prove every essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. This phrase, reasonable doubt, has no technical or unusual meaning. You get the real meaning of the phrase if you emphasize the word reasonable. It is a doubt which is something more than a guess or sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>mise. A reasonable doubt is not such a doubt as is raised by one who questions simply for the sake of argument. It is not a doubt suggested by counsel which is not warranted by the evidence. A reasonable doubt is a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence offered in the case or in the absence of evidence.

A defendant who alleges that he has been the victim of purposeful racial discrimination in the use of a peremptory challenge carries the ultimate burden of persuasion. <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>[476 U.S. 79, 94 n.18, 106 S.

Once the defendant has established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>a prima facie case of purposeful racial discrimination, the burden shifts to the state to advance a neutral explanation for the venireperson\u2019s removal. . . . The defendant is then afforded the opportunity to demonstrate that the state\u2019s articulated reasons are insufficient or pretextual. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 641. Since the trial judge\u2019s findings in the context under consideration here largely will turn on evaluation of [the prosecutor\u2019s] credibility ... a trial court\u2019s determination that there has or has not been intentional discrimination is entitled to appropriate deference upon review on appeal. . . .

Therefore, we may overrule the trial court\u2019s conclusion only if we determine that it was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u201cIn <em>Holloway, </em>our Supreme Court departed from <em>Bat-son </em>to the extent that it held that an accused does not have to first make out a prima facie case to be entitled to an explanation from the state. The court in <em>Holloway </em>stated that rather than deciding, based on the existence of a prima facie case, whether an accused is entitled to an explanation of the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges, the better course to follow would be to hold a <em>Batson </em>hearing on the defendant\u2019s request whenever the defendant is a member of a cognizable racial group and the prosecutor exercises peremptory challenges to remove members of the defendant\u2019s race from the venire. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 646 n.4, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>293 S.C. 54, 57-58,358 S.E.2d 701 (1987). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>37 Conn.

It follows that the defendant can waive part of the process intended to protect his equal protection right, that is, his opportunity to demonstrate that the state\u2019s neutral explanation of its peremptory challenge is in fact pretextuai.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u201cThe <em>Patterson </em>court also held that, in such circumstances, waiver can be made by counsel, and it will ordinarily be inferred from the absence of an objection.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 376. In the present case, the record indicates that defense counsel did not join in the codefendant\u2019s objection to the venireperson\u2019s removal at trial. Moreover, the defendant did not take exception to the court\u2019s ruling denying his codefendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim or to the state\u2019s proffered race neutral reason for excusing the venireperson. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant waived his opportunity to make a <em>Batson </em>claim and his right to respond to the state\u2019s explanation of its peremptory challenge.

By so doing, the majority denies the jury, as the sole trier of fact and credibility, the right to consider facts from which it could draw inferences about the reliability and credibility of the witness. Thus, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that the court\u2019s instruction<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the jury could not consider the effect on the state\u2019s key witness of the witness\u2019 smoking of five marijuana joints shortly before the shooting did not violate a fundamental constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The majority asserts that we may only review the defendant\u2019s claim, if at all, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), because the defendant failed adequately to object to the claimed error in the instruction. Although I would find, as discussed in this dissenting opinion, that the four requirements of <em>Golding </em>have been met in this case, I would conclude that the defendant adequately preserved this claim for direct review by this court, thus obviating the need to resort to <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>It is undisputed that the codefendant, Duane Clark, objected to the instruction and took an exception at the time the court charged the jury. Our Supreme Court has held, in another case in which only one of two codefendants objected to inappropriate comments by the prosecutor during closing arguments, that \u201cthe failure by this defendant fully to challenge the conduct of the prosecutor at trial would not be dispositive, since his codefendant <em>adequately alerted the trial court to the possibility of error in a timely fashion. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>196 Conn. 32, 34, 490 A.2d 515 (1985); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>193 Conn. 70, 88, 475 A.2d 1087 (1984) (purpose of requiring party to except is to alert court to alleged impropriety while time exists to correct it without need for new trial). Here, the codefendant\u2019s exception to the instructions fully alerted the court to the alleged impropriety. Thus, the failure of <em>this </em>defendant to raise the same exception should not deprive him of the ability to challenge the instruction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The majority concludes that the defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly instructed the jury not to consider the effect of marijuana use on the credibility of the state\u2019s key witness is not reviewable under <em>Golding </em>because the instruction did not deprive the defendant of a fundamental constitutional right. I disagree with this characterization of the defendant\u2019s claim since the jury instruction at issue violated his right to confront and impeach a witness against him, a right guaranteed both by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution and by article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The majority reasons that not all claims of instructional error are constitutional in nature and cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>242 Conn. 143,152, 698 A.2d 297 (1997), for the proposition that \u201cclaimed instructional errors regarding <em>general principles of credibility </em>of witnesses are not constitutional in nature.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">While these two propositions put forth by the majority as its basis for dismissing this claim as nonconstitutional are true, they do not prove the point. First, the error claimed here is not about general principles of credibility of witnesses. The error claimed here concerns <em>one </em>instruction about the credibility of <em>one </em>witness. Second, the fact that not all instructional errors are constitutional in nature does not mean that <em>this </em>instructional error claim is not constitutional in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">As the United States Supreme Court stated in Davis: \u201c[I]t seems clear . . . that to make any [effort to impeach a witness] effective, defense counsel should [be] permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, <em>as the sole triers of fact and credibility, </em>could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 415 U.S. 318; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>224 Conn. 325,331, 618 A.2d 32 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>195 Conn. 475, 482, 488 A.2d 1239 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">This court previously has stated that \u201ca criminal defendant\u2019s right to impeach the witnesses against him implicates his constitutional right to confrontation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 393, 429 A.2d 919 (1980).

App. 345, 352, 650 A.2d 632 (1994), cert, denied, 232 Conn. 908, 653 A.2d 195 (1995); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>229 Conn. 60, 70, 640 A.2d 553 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Because the defendant elected a jury trial, he had a right to have all questions of fact decided by the jury, which courts have often referred to as \u201cthe sole triers of fact and credibility . . . .\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 415 U.S. 318; <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 331; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>60 Conn. App. 866, 869, 761 A.2d 789 (2000), cert, denied, 255 Conn. 942, 769 A.2d 59 (2001). In its capacity as the trier of fact, the jury \u201cis the judge of the credibility of all the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony and, therefore, has the right to accept part or disregard part of a witness\u2019 testimony. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Deana E., </em>61 Conn. App. 197, 208, 763 A.2d 45 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">This court previously has stated that the effect of alcohol consumption on a witness\u2019 ability accurately to observe and later recall what he observed \u201cis an effect which is common knowledge and is an inference which is clearly within the ability of the jurors, as laypersons, to draw based on their own common knowledge and experience. The jury may, without the aid of expert testimony, use the consumption of alcohol as a basis on which to <em>infer </em>impairment of ability to observe and recall accurately.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Heinz, </em>3 Conn. App. 80, 86, 485 A.2d 1321 (1984), citing <em>D'Amato </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>140 Conn. 54, 58, 97 A.2d 893 (1953) (intoxication and its accompaniments are matter of common knowledge).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">In addition, the state, on prior occasions, has successfully impeached a witness by inviting the jury to draw inferences from the witness\u2019 use of marijuana, and our Supreme Court has endorsed such a practice. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>215 Conn. 653, 577 A.2d 1036 (1990), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>denied, 498 U.S. 1048, 111 S. Ct. 756, 112 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1991), the state\u2019s attorney had questioned a defense witness about his use of marijuana. Justifying this line of questioning, the state\u2019s attorney argued: \u201cIt\u2019s highly relevant. I claim that as highly relevant. He has testified as far as <em>perceptions of what he observed, what he heard, what he saw, his observations. </em>And, my point here is that he was not in complete control of his faculties . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 661 n.4. Our Supreme Court noted that the state \u201csought to raise doubt as to [the witness\u2019] ability to observe and perceive events, an entirely permissible subject . . . .\u201d Id., 661. In addition, our Supreme Court noted in <em>Person </em>that \u201c[t]he <em>prosecutor </em>may not express his own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 666 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Person, </em>this court considered the use of testimony about drug use for impeachment purposes in <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>20 Conn. App. 115, 564 A.2d 626 (1989), aff'd, 215 Conn. 653, 577 A.2d 1036 (1990), cert, denied, 498 U.S. 1048, 111 S. Ct. 756, 112 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1991). In <em>Person, </em>we stated that, \u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s initial purpose in questioning [the witness] regarding his use of marijuana was to impeach his credibility by casting doubt on his ability to perceive and recall the events that were the subject of his testimony. The capacity of a witness to observe, recollect and narrate an occurrence is a proper subject of inquiry on cross-examination. . . . <em>Consumption of alcohol or drugs obviously can impair an individual\u2019s ability to perceive and recall accurately . . . .\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 121-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Where the issue of impeaching a witness\u2019 credibility by his drug or alcohol use has arisen in the past, neither this court nor our Supreme Court has required, as a predicate, that an expert witness instruct the jury as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>to the effects of alcohol or drugs on the witness\u2019 ability to perceive and recall events. This has been true whether the drug in question was alcohol, marijuana or cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">There have been a number of cases in which both this court and our Supreme Court have held that ordinary people, namely, jurors, can judge for themselves whether a witness\u2019 admitted use of drugs would, in their opinion, affect that witness\u2019 credibility. \u201cThe trier of fact <em>need not close its eyes to matters of common knowledge solely because the evidence includes no expert testimony on these </em>matters.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Way </em>v. <em>Pavent, </em>179 Conn. 377, 380,426 A.2d 780 (1979). In <em>Way, </em>the plaintiff had consumed ten glasses of beer and, without any expert testimony, the Supreme Court approved of permitting the jury to draw its own inferences on the effects of that quantity of alcohol, finding it to be a \u201c[matter] of common knowledge . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">If, in 1979, the effects of ten ten-ounce glasses of beer were common knowledge, then it is fair to say that in 2001, the effects of several marijuana cigarettes are common knowledge. In fact, in 1993, this court approved of a trial court\u2019s statement to a jury that \u201cthe effect of alcohol on a person and also the effect of marijuana on a person . . . [are] probably within your common knowledge, but [defense counsel] has asked me to allow this to be presented as an exhibit so that he could argue from this what he feels the marijuana and alcohol, what role they played in this case. So . . . it\u2019s offered solely for the purpose of explaining to you <em>something you already know, the effect of marijuana . . </em>. on a person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Charlton, </em>30 Conn. App. 359, 368-69 n.9, 620 A.2d 1297, cert, denied, 225 Conn. 922, 625 A.2d 824 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">I therefore would conclude that it was improper for the trial court to instruct the jury not to draw any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>conclusions in the absence of testimony, expert or otherwise, as to the probable effects of the witness\u2019 smoking of five marijuana joints shortly before the incident on the night of the shooting on his ability to perceive and recall accurately the events. I also would conclude, for the reasons stated previously, that this impropriety was constitutional in nature, as it violated the defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to confront his accusers.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Having concluded that the second requirement of <em>Golding </em>has been met, I address the other three requirements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is an adequate record. Although the defendant did not raise the issue at trial, his codefendant did so on several occasions. Because this was a joint trial, any claim by one defendant as to an improper jury instruction, unless the instruction was directed to the jury to apply only to that defendant, which was not the case here, put the trial court on notice of the claimed impropriety in its instructions. The failure by <em>this </em>defendant fully to challenge the conduct of the court at trial is not dispositive because his codefendant adequately alerted the court to the possibility of error in a timely fashion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The third <em>Golding </em>requirement, that the alleged violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial, also has been met in this case. The court\u2019s instruction precluded the jury from rejecting the witness\u2019 testimony as incredible on the basis of his use of marijuana. Absent this instruction, the jury might well have rejected his testimony in whole. Had the jury done so, it would inexorably have reached the conclusion that insufficient evidence existed to convict the defendant of murder as an accessory, since the witness sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>plied the only evidence that the defendant fired a gun at the scene. Precluding the jury from reaching this conclusion deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Finally, the fourth <em>Golding </em>requirement, that the state has failed to prove the harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt, has also been met. The witness whose credibility the defendant sought to place in doubt on the basis of his use of marijuana shortly prior to the shooting (a fact admitted by all parties and thus beyond question) provided the most harmful testimony against the defendant. He alone testified to seeing the defendant fire a gun and to hearing the codefendant instruct the defendant to do so. Without this testimony, the jury would have had no evidence that the defendant was in possession of a gun at the scene, the second count on which he was convicted. Without this testimony, the jury would have lacked the evidence the majority rightly points to as the two facts supporting the defendant\u2019s conviction of accessory to murder, namely, that the defendant \u201cfired multiple shots from a nine millimeter handgun at the scene\u201d and that the defendant \u201cdid this in response to someone saying, \u2018Shoot the mother . . . I cannot say that the alleged constitutional violation was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Because this action precluded the jury from considering important facts bearing on the credibility of the only witness<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> who placed the defendant at the scene and in possession of a gun, I would find that the instruction was improper and satisfies all of the <em>Golding </em>requirements. I therefore would reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\"> The relevant portion of the court\u2019s instruction is as follows: \u201cAlso you have heard testimony that [Leroy] Townsend smoked marijuana the night of the shooting. There is no evidence as to what effect it had on him. Because there is no such evidence, you must not speculate that he was or was not affected by it or how he was affected by it.\u201d Counsel for the codefendant, Duane Clark, objected to this portion of the charge, and the court declined to reinstruct the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>62 Conn. App. 182, 204, 774 A.2d 183 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right ... to be confronted by the witnesses against him . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\"> Because the majority concluded that the second prong of <em>Golding </em>was not satisfied, it did not analyze the other three prongs, as all four must be satisfied for a claim to be successful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\"> The witness\u2019 credibility was the key factor in the trial.
