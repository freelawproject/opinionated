J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ack\">The plaintiff, Susan Barese, appeals from the summary judgment rendered in favor of the defendant, James G. Clark. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendant, an assistant state\u2019s attorney, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>immune from a civil action that was based on his dealings with the plaintiff, who was a victim of a crime. Because we conclude that state\u2019s attorneys are immune from tort liability for acts committed in the performance of their duties as state\u2019s attorneys, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our consideration of the issue raised in this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In August, 1994, the plaintiff was the victim of an assault, robbery and burglary in her home. During the course of those crimes, the intruder bit the plaintiff, breaking her skin. The defendant successfully prosecuted the assailant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for those and other crimes, resulting in a lengthy prison sentence. The day before the assailant\u2019s scheduled sentencing, the plaintiff and the defendant spoke by telephone. In that conversation, the defendant asked the plaintiff to meet him at his office the next morning prior to the sentencing hearing, and the plaintiff agreed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">When the plaintiff arrived the next morning, the defendant informed her that the presentence investigation (PSI)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> report contained a statement by the assailant that he was HIV positive at the time of the incident. The defendant, however, informed the plaintiff that he did not believe the assailant\u2019s claim, but rather believed that the assailant said this only in an effort to obtain leniency in sentencing. The defendant also assured the plaintiff that he would not disclose this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>At the sentencing hearing, however, the defendant revealed to the sentencing court the assailant\u2019s claim that he was HIV positive. The defendant stated in deposition testimony for this case that he did so partially to reveal to the court that \u201cthere were two sides to [the assailant\u2019s] claim of having an illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a four count complaint against the defendant, alleging breach of the plaintiffs privacy, fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that because the conduct giving rise to this action was performed by him in his capacity as an assistant state\u2019s attorney, he was immune from civil liability for those actions. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion as to all counts of the plaintiffs complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">We first state our standard of review in summary judgment matters. \u201cThe standards governing our review of a trial court's decision to grant a motion for summary judgment are well established. Practice Book \u00a7 384 [now \u00a7 17-49] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u201cOn appeal, [w]e must decide whether the trial court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . Because the trial court rendered judgment for the [defendant] as a matter of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether [the trial court\u2019s] conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>appear in the record.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kroll </em>v. <em>Steere, </em>60 Conn. App. 376, 380-81, 759 A.2d 541, cert, denied, 255 Conn. 909, 763 A.2d 1035 (2000); see also <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>253 Conn. 381, 385-86, 752 A.2d 503 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Our Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court and the federal courts of appeal have long recognized the existence of, and the need for, prosecutorial immunity. Such immunity exists to allow prosecutors at the state and federal level to be free to perform their essential role in the judicial process without the possibility of civil liability hanging over their head as a sword of Damocles.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The United States Supreme Court addressed the issue of a state prosecutor\u2019s amenability to suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in <em>Imbler </em>v. <em>Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 96 S. Ct. 984, 47 L. Ed. 2d 128 (1976). Although that case arose under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and not under state common law, the court engaged in an extensive discussion concerning the existence of common-law immunities for prosecutors, the question at issue here. The court did so because it previously had held in <em>Tenney </em>v. <em>Brandhove, </em>341 U.S. 367, 71 S. Ct. 783, 95 L. Ed. 1019 (1951), that \u201cimmunities well grounded in history and reason had not been abrogated by covert inclusion in the general language of \u00a7 1983.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Imbler </em>v. <em>Pachtman, </em>supra, 418, quoting <em>Tenney </em>v. <em>Brandhove, </em>supra, 376. As the court in <em>Imbler </em>stated: \u201cThe decision in <em>Tenney </em>established that \u00a7 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>is to be read in harmony with general principles of tort immunities and defenses rather than in derogation of them.\u201d <em>Imbler </em>v. <em>Pachtman, </em>supra, 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u201cThe common-law immunity of a prosecutor is based upon the same considerations that underlie the common-law immunities of judges and grand jurors acting within the scope of their duties. These include concern that harassment by unfounded litigation would cause a deflection of the prosecutor\u2019s energies from his public duties, and the possibility that he would shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust.\u201d Id., 422-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">To allow a prosecutor to be subject to suit for actions performed as an integral part of the judicial process \u201cwould open the way for unlimited harassment and embarrassment of the most conscientious officials by those who would profit thereby. There would be involved in every case the possible consequences of a failure to obtain a conviction. There would always be a question of possible civil action in case the prosecutor saw fit to move dismissal of the case. . . . The apprehension of such consequences would tend toward great uneasiness and toward weakening the fearless and impartial policy which should characterize the administration of this office. The work of the prosecutor would thus be impeded and we would have moved away from the desired objective of stricter and fairer law enforcement.\u201d <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>6 Cal. App. 2d 277, 287, 44 P.2d 592 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Because the court stated in <em>Imbler </em>that the immunity of prosecutors derived from that of judges, some discussion about the contours of the latter type of immunity is necessary. The court explained this immunity, as well as its connection with that of prosecutors. \u201cThe immunity of a judge for acts within his jurisdiction has roots extending to the earliest days of the common law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>See <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>12 Coke 23, 77 Eng. Rep. 1305 (1608). Chancellor Kent traced some of its history in <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Landing, </em>5 Johns. 282 (N.Y. 1810), and this Court first accepted the rule of judicial immunity in <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>[80 U.S.] (13 Wall.) 335, [20 L. Ed. 646] (1871). . . . Courts that have extended the same immunity to the prosecutor have sometimes remarked on the fact that all three officials \u2014 judge, grand juror, and prosecutor \u2014 exercise a discretionary judgment on the basis of evidence presented to them. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Parman, </em>[101 Kan. 115,165 P. 663 (1917)]; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Gerking, </em>[111 Ore. 641, 228 P. 135 (1924)]. It is the functional comparability of their judgments to those of the judge that has resulted in . . . prosecutors being referred to as \u2018quasi-judicial\u2019 officers, and their immunities being termed \u2018quasi-judicial\u2019 as well.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>supra, 424 U.S. 423 n.20. The court concluded its discussion by stating: \u201cThe common-law rule of immunity is thus well settled.\u201d Id., 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Addressing a claim similar to the one pressed here, namely, that the immunity enjoyed by a prosecutor is not absolute, but instead is qualified, the court in <em>Imbler </em>explained: \u201cIf a prosecutor had only a qualified immunity, the threat of \u00a7 1983 suits would undermine performance of his duties no less than would the threat of common-law suits for malicious prosecution. A prosecutor is duty bound to exercise his best judgment both in deciding which suits to bring and in conducting them in court. The public trust of the prosecutor\u2019s office would suffer if he were constrained in making every decision by the consequences in terms of his own personal liability in a suit for damages. Such suits could be expected with some frequency, for a defendant often will transform his resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions to the State\u2019s advocate. . . . Further, if the prosecutor could be made to answer in court each time such a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>charged him with wrongdoing, his energy and attention would be diverted from the pressing duty of enforcing the criminal law.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 424-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The court concluded: \u201c[T]he considerations outlined above dictate the same absolute immunity under \u00a7 1983 that the prosecutor enjoys at common law. To be sure, this immunity does leave the genuinely wronged defendant without civil redress against a prosecutor [who acts] maliciously] or dishonestly] .... But the alternative of qualifying a prosecutor\u2019s immunity would dis-serve the broader public interest. It would prevent the vigorous and fearless performance of the prosecutor\u2019s duty that is essential to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system. Moreover, it often would prejudice defendants in criminal cases by skewing <em>post-conviction judicial decisions </em>that should be made with the sole purpose of insuring justice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 427-28. The court also noted: \u201c[W]e find ourselves in agreement with Judge Learned Hand, who wrote of the prosecutor\u2019s immunity from actions for malicious prosecution: \u2018As is so often the case, the answer must be found in a balance between the evils inevitable in either alternative. . . . [I]t has been thought in the end better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do then-duty to the constant dread of retaliation.\u2019 <em>Gregoire </em>v. <em>Biddle, </em>177 F.2d 579, 581 ([2d Cir.] 1949), cert, denied, 339 U.S. 949 [70 S. Ct. 803, 94 L. Ed. 1363] (1950).\u201d <em>Imbler </em>v. <em>Pachtman, </em>supra, 424 U.S. 428. The court concluded that \u201cin initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State\u2019s case, the prosecutor is immune from a civil suit for damages . . . .\u201d Id., 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In the years following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Imbler, </em>which set forth the contours of prosecutorial immunity, the United States Supreme Court has had occasion to fill in the outline set forth in <em>Imbler. </em>Summarizing <em>Imbler </em>a decade and one-half later, the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>States Supreme Court stated: \u201c[P]rosecutors are absolutely immune from liability . . . for their conduct in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State\u2019s case . . . insofar as that conduct is intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process .... It was recognized . . . that the duties of the prosecutor in his role as advocate for the State involve actions preliminary to the initiation of a prosecution and actions apart from the courtroom.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>500 U.S. 478, 486, 111 S. Ct. 1934, 114 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Our Supreme Court has relied on these and other United States Supreme Court cases, as well as cases from federal courts of appeal, as providing support for the existence of prosecutorial immunity from civil actions in state court. \u201cIt is in part due to the recognition that prosecutors are an integral part of the judicial system that courts have granted absolute immunity from civil actions to prosecutors. <em>Malley </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 342, 106 S. Ct. 1092, 89 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1986); <em>Imbler </em>v. <em>Pachtman, </em>[supra, 424 U.S. 420]. \u2018Prosecutorial immunity derives from the immunity attached to judicial proceedings.\u2019 <em>DeLaurentis </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>220 Conn. 225, 241, 597 A.2d 807 (1991). Such immunity covers acts that were performed by a prosecutor as an integral part of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Massameno </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>234 Conn. 539, 567-68, 663 A.2d 317 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Having set forth the parameters of prosecutorial immunity, we now address the plaintiffs claim on appeal. The plaintiff claims that this court should conclude that the immunity enjoyed by prosecutors does not extend to the actions of the assistant state\u2019s attorney in this case. The plaintiff points specifically to the fact that the acts she complains of, namely, the defendant\u2019s meeting with the plaintiff prior to the sentencing hearing and then his statements to the court in the sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>ing hearing, were not part of the defendant\u2019s role as an assistant state\u2019s attorney, but were \u201csurplusage to the prosecutor\u2019s role as an advocate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">As stated earlier, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>supra, 500 U.S. 486, quoting <em>Imbler </em>v. <em>Pachtman, </em>supra, 424 U.S. 430, stated: \u201c[P]rosecutors are . . . immune from liability . . . for their conduct . . . insofar as that conduct is intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">One cannot seriously question that the sentencing hearing is part of \u201cthe judicial phase of the criminal process.\u201d Several of our rules of procedure amply demonstrate this fact. These rules provide that the right to appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction accrues only upon sentencing. \u201c[I]t shall be the duty of the clerk of the court, immediately after <em>the pronouncement of the sentence </em>... to advise the defendant in writing of such rights as such defendant may have to an appeal . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 43-30. \u201cIn criminal cases where the appeal is from a judgment of conviction, the appeal period shall begin when sentence is pronounced in open court. . . .\u2019\u2019Practice Book \u00a7 63-1 (b). It follows that the sentencing hearing, a proceeding preliminary to the imposition of sentence, is part of the judicial phase of the criminal process. Accordingly, the cloak of prosecutorial immunity protects the defendant\u2019s actions in that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">In addition, the PSI report containing the assailant\u2019s claim that he was HIV positive is itself part of the judicial process. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 43-3 through 43-10 specifically address the preparation and use of a PSI report in the sentencing process. Practice Book \u00a7 43-3 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201cthe judicial authority <em>shall </em>order a presentence investigation . . . .\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>added.) Practice Book \u00a7 43-7 provides in relevant part that the \u201creport . . . shall be provided to the judicial authority.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 43-9 provides in relevant part that the report \u201cshall be available . . . for use in the sentencing hearing.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 43-10 (1) provides in relevant part that the court \u201cshall afford the parties an opportunity to . . . explain or controvert the presentence investigation report ... or any other document <em>relied upon by the judicial authority </em>in imposing sentence. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This provision envisions that the court will rely on the PSI report in determining the sentence to impose. The defendant\u2019s actions at the sentencing hearing, in which he undertook to explain the PSI report relied on by the <em>judicial </em>authority, are, therefore, an integral part of the <em>judicial </em>process.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Because the hearing at which the defendant made the statements that are at the root of the plaintiffs claim was \u201cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>supra, 500 U.S. 486; we conclude that the mantle of prosecutorial immunity protected the defendant throughout that hearing. We thus conclude that the court properly found that \u201cthere is no genuine issue of material fact as to [the defendant\u2019s] role in this matter and [that] he did not abandon his prosecutor\u2019s role by addressing the criminal defendant\u2019s HIV claim at the sentencing hearing . . . .\u201d Accordingly, the court properly rendered summary judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\"> Because this case is before us on appeal from the granting of a motion for summary judgment, we adopt the facts articulated by the court in its memorandum of decision on the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff has not claimed the existence of any dispute as to those facts as the basis for her appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-9\"> Although the assailant was a defendant in the criminal matter, we refer to him as the \u201cassailant\u201d to avoid confusion with the defendant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b81-10\"> The PSI is a document that is made available to the sentencing judge for use in determining the appropriate sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\"> The \u201csword of Damocles\u201d refers generally to impending disaster.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\"> Section 1983 of title 42 of the United States Code provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party ipjured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
