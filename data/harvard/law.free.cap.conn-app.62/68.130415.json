J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR_\">The petitioner, Wendell Minnifield, appeals from the judgment of the habeas court denying his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. He claims that the court improperly determined that (1) his counsel\u2019s investigation prior to the petitioner\u2019s plea of guilty was not insufficient, (2) there was no basis for suppressing the confession of the petitioner, and counsel\u2019s decision not to file a motion to suppress the confession did not prejudice the petitioner, and (3) counsel did not misinform the petitioner regarding his sentence. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The facts underlying the petitioner\u2019s arrest and claim of ineffective assistance of counsel are as follows. On June 21,1995, the Waterbuiy police were called to investigate a motor vehicle accident and possible shooting. When they arrived, they found the victim, a thirty year old male, in the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle that had struck a telephone pole, with a fatal gunshot wound to his left chest. Police later learned that the victim had been fighting with the petitioner\u2019s cousin. After the fight ended, the victim entered and remained inside his vehicle. The petitioner walked to the driver\u2019s side door and fired three shots at the victim, one of which entered his chest and resulted in his death. After the shooting, the victim tried to drive away, but sped into a telephone pole.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The petitioner, age sixteen at the time, was arrested the following day. He was advised of his rights and confessed to the murder in a written statement to the police. On June 25,1996, the petitioner, represented by attorney Jayne Kennedy, pleaded guilty to murder in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kennedy advised him to plead guilty. The court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of forty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">On February 11,1999, the petitioner filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel by Kennedy. The court denied the petition and granted certification to appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">We must first consider our standard of review. \u201cIn a habeas appeal, this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous, but our review of whether the facts as found by the habeas court constituted a violation of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>59 Conn. App. 302, 303, 755 A.2d 380, cert, denied, 254 Conn. 943, 761 A.2d 760 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u201cA criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to adequate and effective assistance of counsel . . . .\u201d <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>234 Conn. 139, 153, 662 A.2d 718 (1995). In <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the United States Supreme Court established that for a petitioner to prevail on a claim of ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>assistance of counsel, he must show \u201cthat counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of [the] conviction . . . .\u201d That requires the petitioner to show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Id.; see also <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>60 Conn. App. 313, 316-17, 759 A.2d 118 (2000). \u201cUnless a [petitioner] makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction . . . resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 317, citing <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 687; see also <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>211 Conn. 398,402, 559 A.2d 1094, cert, denied, 493 U.S. 981, 110 S. Ct. 512, 107 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1989); <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>211 Conn. 352, 357, 559 A.2d 206 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The first component of the <em>Strickland </em>test, generally referred to as the performance prong, requires that the petitioner \u201cshow that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 357. In <em>Strickland, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201c[j Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a [petitioner] to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. . . . A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the [petitioner] must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. . . . [C]ounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 60 Conn. App. 317-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u201cEven if a petitioner shows that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, the second prong, or prejudice prong, requires that the petitioner show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. ... In the context of a guilty plea, our Supreme Court has stated: [T]he petitioner must show that such a decision to plead not guilty would have been based on the likelihood that the introduction of the evidence for the defense that was not identified because of ineffective assistance of counsel would have been successful at trial. . . . [The United States Supreme Court stated that in] many guilty plea cases, the prejudice inquiry will closely resemble the inquiry engaged in by courts reviewing ineffective-assistance challenges to convictions obtained through a trial. For example, where the alleged error of counsel is a failure to investigate . . . the determination whether the error prejudiced the defendant by causing him to plead guilty rather than go to trial will depend on the likelihood that discovery of the evidence would have led counsel to change his recommendation as to the plea. This assessment, in turn, will depend in large part on a prediction whether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome of a trial.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>With that standard of review in mind, we examine each of the petitioner\u2019s claims. Additional facts will be discussed as necessary for the resolution of each claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The petitioner first claims that Kennedy was ineffective in failing to independently interview and investigate witnesses. Specifically, the petitioner claims that he would not have pleaded guilty had he been informed that two witnesses could have offered evidence contradicting that of the state\u2019s key witness, Antonia Curling. The petitioner further claims that he was prejudiced by Kennedy\u2019s failure to investigate the possible bias of Curling, namely, whether she had criminal charges pending against her, and whether she disliked him because he dated her sister. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. Mark Askew and Donna M. Franco gave statements to the police regarding their eyewitness accounts of the shooting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both stated that on June 21, 1995, at about 11 p.m. or 11:30 p.m., while riding in a vehicle in the area of North Main Street, they saw a black male wearing a black or blue visor, a flowered shirt and dark colored pants point a gun and shoot three times at a white male in the driver\u2019s seat of a beige, parked car. The witnesses stated that they drove around the block and that when they returned, they saw that the beige car had struck a telephone pole.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Curling, an owner of a business on North Main Street, also witnessed the shooting. She provided a statement that indicated that the victim and another male had been arguing on a street comer at approximately 11 p.m., and that the petitioner, whom she knew as Wen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>dell, had been at the scene. She stated that the petitioner saw the fight and ran briefly into an alley. When he returned to find the fight over, he questioned her as to the victim\u2019s whereabouts, to which she responded that she did not know. When he saw the victim\u2019s car, he walked around it to the driver\u2019s side and shot the victim \u201cat least two times, point blank.\u201d She further stated that the petitioner was wearing a white visor and white pants at the time of the shooting, but that afterward, he returned to the alley and emerged wearing a dark colored hood over his head and dark pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">At the habeas trial, Kennedy testified that she did not share the statements of Askew or Franco with the petitioner, nor did she recall having reviewed them. The court concluded, however, that the petitioner was not prejudiced by Kennedy\u2019s actions. We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">As we have stated, the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test requires the petitioner to show that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s inadequate representation. Our review of all three statements reveals that those of Askew and Franco corroborate the statement of Curling. All three place a black male, approximately nineteen years old, at the scene of the shooting. Each statement further provides that the male walked to the driver\u2019s side of a beige car and fired a weapon at the victim approximately three times at point blank range. The only discrepancies in the statements involve the description of the petitioner\u2019s clothing and hairstyle. Although Curling said that the perpetrator was wearing a white visor and white pants at the time of the shooting, the other two witnesses said that he was wearing a dark blue or black visor and dark pants. Askew and Franco stated that the perpetrator had dreadlocks, whereas Curling stated, \u201cI believe he has a sort of Afro style.\u201d We note that all of the witnesses saw the petitioner wearing a visor and that Curling said that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>changed into dark colored clothing shortly after the shooting. Curling also knew the petitioner by name and positively identified him.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In light of the minor discrepancies in the witnesses\u2019 statements, the petitioner\u2019s confession and Kennedy\u2019s testimony that her plea recommendation would not have changed if she had reviewed the statements of Askew and Franco, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to show that \u201cdiscovery of the evidence would have led counsel to change his recommendation as to the plea.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Kennedy could not recall at the habeas trial if she or her investigator had questioned Curling. In light of the fact that Curling\u2019s statement corroborates the petitioner\u2019s confession, we cannot conclude that Kennedy\u2019s failure to further examine the accuracy of Curling\u2019s statement was prejudicial to the petitioner. Moreover, the petitioner did not present evidence to show that had Kennedy investigated Curling\u2019s potential bias, she would have changed her plea recommendation. See <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 156-57. We therefore conclude that the petitioner did not meet his burden under <em>Strickland </em>because he failed to show prejudice resulting from Kennedy\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The petitioner next claims that Kennedy\u2019s performance was ineffective because she failed to file a motion to suppress his confession. The court found that Kennedy\u2019s failure to file a motion to suppress was not so deficient as to prejudice the petitioner. We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">As we have stated, the <em>Strickland </em>test requires the petitioner to show that counsel\u2019s performance was defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>cient and that it was prejudicial. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 687. \u201cA reviewing court can find against the petitioner on whichever ground is easier.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>57 Conn. App. 511, 518, 749 A.2d 666, cert, denied, 254 Conn. 913, 759 A.2d 509 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In this case, the petitioner failed to present any evidence to the habeas court that, had a motion to suppress been filed, his confession would have been suppressed. Moreover, in light of the fact that Curling named the petitioner as the perpetrator and two other witnesses also placed at the scene of the shooting a young man whose description matched that of the petitioner, we cannot conclude that even if the confession had been suppressed, the outcome would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">We therefore conclude that the court properly found that the petitioner failed to show sufficient prejudice because he did not prove that the outcome would have been different had Kennedy filed a motion to suppress the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The petitioner next argues that the court improperly denied his claim that Kennedy grossly misadvised him regarding the collateral effect of his sentence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">The petitioner testified that when he entered the plea of guilty on the basis of what Kennedy had told him, he expected that he would have to serve only half of the forty year sentence because of his age. Kennedy, on the other hand, testified that although she could not remember exactly what she told the petitioner, she was sure that he would have to serve at least 85 percent of his sentence and that she did not tell him that he would have to serve only 50 percent of his sentence. With respect to this claim, the court found that the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u201cfailed to present any credible evidence that he received ineffective counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The habeas court is the \u201csole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their specific testimony. ... It is the right of the trier of fact to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the facts that it finds to be proved. . . . We cannot substitute our judgment for that of the habeas court.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>36 Conn. App. 695, 703, 652 A.2d 1050, cert, denied, 233 Conn. 912, 659 A.2d 183 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Because nothing in the record supports the petitioner\u2019s contention that Kennedy told him that he would only have to serve half of his sentence, we conclude that the court properly found that her performance was not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-9\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.
