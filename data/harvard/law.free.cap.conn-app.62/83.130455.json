Lockwood, Call Peter, Inc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>and Frank Perrotti &amp; Sons, Inc. (guarantors), appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment confirming an arbitration award in favor of the plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the guarantors claim that the court improperly confirmed the award because (1) they never agreed to arbitrate disputes with the plaintiff and (2) the arbitrators exceeded their powers in making the award. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. In December, 1996, the plaintiff, Bernard Green, the holder of two promissory notes as trustee for Gerald T. Raynor, Alfred L. Bowes, Jr., and Mary E. Bowes, instituted a civil action against the debtor, the defendant Connecticut Disposal Service, Inc. (debtor), and the guarantors of the debts to collect the balances that were past due.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In January, 1997, the defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs action, claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute because of the arbitration clauses in the parties\u2019 agreements. The plaintiff countered that the proper vehicle under the circumstances was a motion to stay the proceedings. The court agreed and denied the motion to dismiss. In February, 1997, the defendants filed a motion to stay the proceedings pending arbitration, and, in April, 1997, the court granted that motion. In June, 1997, the plaintiff filed a motion to terminate the stay, which was successfully opposed by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>In October, 1997, the plaintiff, faced with the defendants\u2019 inaction, made a demand for arbitration, naming the defendants as respondents. The defendants filed an answer and special defenses, and the matter proceeded to arbitration in June, 1998. In August, 1998, the arbitrators found in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In September, 1998, the guarantors filed an application with the court to vacate the arbitration award as to them, claiming for the first time that they never agreed to arbitrate. The plaintiff filed an objection, and, after a hearing in November, 1998, the court denied the application to vacate the award. In a memorandum of decision dated February 9, 1999, the court found that the guarantors not only had agreed to arbitrate, but also actively and repeatedly had sought arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In April, 1999, the plaintiff filed a motion to confirm the award. The court granted the plaintiffs motion in May, 1999. The guarantors thereafter commenced this appeal from the order confirming the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The guarantors claim on appeal that they were not parties to the agreements that contained the arbitration clauses and, thus, that they never agreed to arbitrate disputes with the plaintiff. They claim that because they never agreed to arbitrate, all of the proceedings leading up to the arbitrators\u2019 award were between only the plaintiff and the debtor, and, therefore, the award as to the guarantors was improper. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Some additional facts are necessary for our consideration of this issue. The promissory notes at issue were executed in conjunction with the debtor\u2019s purchase of two refuse collection businesses from other parties not involved in this litigation. The plaintiff subsequently became the holder of the notes. Each transaction gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ated three documents: A purchase and sale agreement, a promissory note and a guaranty. The purchase and sale agreements each contained a broadly worded arbitration clause<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and explicitly named each guarantor. Although the guarantors were not signatories to the purchase and sale agreements, they did execute separate guaranty agreements that were listed as exhibits to the purchase and sale agreements. The promissory notes also were listed as exhibits to the respective purchase and sale agreements. The guarantors claim that because they were not parties to each purchase and sale agreement itself, they did not agree to arbitrate disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u201cBecause we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>White </em>v. <em>Kampner, </em>229 Conn. 465, 471, 641 A.2d 1381 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u201cArbitration is a creature of contract. ... It is designed to avoid litigation and secure prompt settlement of disputes and is favored by the law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spicer </em>v. <em>Spicer, </em>33 Conn. App. 152, 159, 634 A.2d 902 (1993), cert, denied, 228 Conn. 920, 636 A.2d 850 (1994). \u201c[A] person can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>compelled to arbitrate a dispute only if, to the extent that, and in the manner which, he has agreed to do so. . . . No one can be forced to arbitrate a contract dispute who has not previously agreed to do so.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 159-60. Further, pursuant to Connecticut\u2019s statutory arbitration scheme, that agreement must be expressed in a writing. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Meader, </em>208 Conn. 352, 364, 545 A.2d 553 (1988); see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-408.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u201cThe issue of whether the parties to a contract have agreed to arbitration is controlled by their intention. . . . The intention of the parties is, in turn, a question of fact. . . . The trial court\u2019s finding on that issue is not reversible by this court unless it was a finding that the court could not reasonably have made.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spicer </em>v. <em>Spicer, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 160. The guarantors can prevail on appeal, therefore, only if they are able to demonstrate that the court\u2019s finding that they agreed to arbitrate was clearly erroneous. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The court, after a hearing, considered the evidence and determined that the dispute between <em>all </em>of the parties had been presented properly to the arbitrators because valid agreements to arbitrate existed between the plaintiff and <em>both </em>the guarantors and the debtor. After reviewing the evidence, the pleadings in the record and the court\u2019s analysis, we hold that the court correctly found that the guarantors had agreed to arbitrate and, therefore, properly confirmed the arbitrators\u2019 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The court analyzed the purchase and sale agreements, promissory notes and guarantees within the framework of the \u201cpositive assurance test,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>also considered the guarantors\u2019 repeated prior submissions in which they claimed to have agreed to arbitration. It noted that the guarantors had actively sought the benefits of arbitration. Only after obtaining an unfavorable result did the guarantors claim that they were not parties to the agreement to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">A more detailed description of the procedural history of this case is necessary for our consideration of this issue. The plaintiff initially sought to resolve this dispute by commencing an action against <em>all of </em>the defendants in the Superior Court. In response, the defendants\u2019 attorney filed a motion to dismiss, clearly naming the debtor and the guarantors as parties and insisting that they were all parties to an arbitration agreement with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, in their supporting memorandum of law, the defendants argued that they were all parties to the arbitration agreements, that the guarantees clearly fell within the purview of those agreements and that the court could not reasonably interpret the agreements otherwise.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>At the January 21, 1997 hearing on the motion to dismiss, the defendants\u2019 attorney stated that he \u201crepresentad] all the defendants,\u201d and that the arbitration panel was \u201cthe body that the parties themselves agreed in the contract to go by.\u201d In their subsequent motion to stay the litigation pending arbitration, the defendants again manifested their intent to agree to arbitration and their desire to proceed accordingly.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Their supporting memorandum repeated the arguments from their memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The defendants again advanced these arguments in their June 6, 1997 memorandum of law opposing the plaintiffs motion for termination of the stay. That memorandum provided that \u201c[b]oth the promissory notes <em>and the guarantees </em>arose expressly and directly out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the Agreements and are, therefore, subject to arbitration.\u201d (Emphasis added.) At the hearing on the motion, the defendants\u2019 attorney stated that he represented the defendants, that \u201c[t]he agreement provides a very, very broad arbitration clause. It states pretty much any and all disputes between the parties regarding any matter in [or] arising under the agreement\u201d shall be submitted to arbitration, and that \u201cthe intention of the parties was [that] the notes . . . were part of the agreement and subject to arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The plaintiffs subsequent demand for arbitration named all of the defendants, including each guarantor, as respondents. Attached to the demand was an explanation of the nature of the dispute, naming the debtor and all of the guarantors and citing their roles in the dispute. The defendants\u2019 attorney filed an answer and special defenses, naming the debtor and all of the guarantors as respondents. At the arbitration hearing, he stated that he represented \u201cthe respondents, Connecticut Disposal Service, Inc., Frank Perrotti &amp; Sons, Inc., Call Peter, Inc., Ronald Bertasi, William Lockwood and Frank Perrotti, Jr.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Neither in these documents nor in the proceedings previously discussed did the defendants\u2019 attorney ever claim that the guarantors had not agreed to arbitrate. He never made any attempt to differentiate the guarantors\u2019 position from that of the debtor. He argued that the guarantors had not agreed to arbitrate only after the arbitrators issued a decision unfavorable to the guarantors.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u201c[T]he stated purpose of arbitration [is to avoid] the formalities, delay, expense and vexation of ordinary litigation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Meader, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 362-63. In support of this policy aim, the court correctly based its decision that the guarantors were parties to the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>agreements, in part, on the fact that they actively had sought the arbitration and resisted litigation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By all appearances, the guarantors sought the benefits of arbitration, presumably deciding that litigation was a less desirable option. We agree with the court and hold that, in light of the defendants\u2019 conduct and the assertions that they made in their motion to dismiss, motion to stay and motion in opposition to a termination of the stay, they are estopped from now arguing that they never agreed to arbitrate disputes with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u201cThere are two essential elements to an estoppel\u2014 the party must do or say something that is intended or calculated to induce another to believe in the existence of certain facts and to act upon that belief, and the other party, influenced thereby, must actually change his position or do some act to his injury which he otherwise would not have done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reinke </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital </em>Assn., 175 Conn. 24, 28, 392 A.2d 966 (1978). Further, \u201c[i]t is the burden of the person claiming the estoppel to show that he exercised due diligence to ascertain the truth and that he not only lacked knowledge of the true state of things but had no convenient means of acquiring that knowledge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u201c[Tjhere must generally be some intended deception in the conduct or declarations of the party to be estopped, or such gross negligence on his part as amounts to constructive fraud, by which another has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>been misled to his injury. . . .

Ct. 46, 78 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1983); see, e.g., <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>174 Conn. 592, 601, 392 A.2d 468 (1978) (defendant estopped from asserting statute of limitations defense); <em>First Connecticut Small Business Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Arba, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 168, 174-75, 365 A.2d 100 (1976) (defendant estopped from utilizing statute of frauds defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The principles behind the estoppel doctrine are advanced by our holding today. This is not a case in which a party has, from the outset, steadfastly argued that it never agreed to arbitrate. Here, the guarantors clearly argued to the court several times that they agreed to arbitrate disputes with the plaintiff. In so doing, their intent was to induce the plaintiff into pursuing an alternative dispute resolution strategy, which he in fact did. The plaintiff abandoned his initial effort to litigate the matter and instead complied with the guarantors\u2019 demand to arbitrate by not objecting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>their motion to stay and, ultimately, by submitting the dispute to the arbitrators. He prepared for and attended the arbitration hearing with the understanding that it would bring the matter to a close. In fact, all of the parties fully participated in the arbitration and none complained to the arbitrators that they had not agreed to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The guarantors, after such full and willing participation, obtained an unfavorable result at the arbitration hearing. They then sought another chance to retry the issues in a second forum and, thereby, to eliminate the advantages of speed, savings and finality that were contemplated in the parties\u2019 choice of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. Two and one half years after the plaintiff initially instituted his civil action, which the guarantors successfully caused to be stayed to allow for arbitration, the guarantors argued that the Superior Court was in fact the proper forum for the dispute. Essentially, they asked the court to approve their wasting of the plaintiffs time and to force the plaintiff to abandon the successful result he had secured at the arbitration hearing. The court, after considering all of the prior proceedings, had no difficulty discerning that the parties had agreed to arbitrate and rejected the guarantors\u2019 request to vacate the award. We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In <em>Sawmill Brook Racing Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Really Advisors, Inc., </em>39 Conn. App. 444, 455, 664 A.2d 819 (1995), we held that nonsignatories to an arbitration agreement had bound themselves to arbitrate via their conduct and were estopped from arguing after the fact that the statutory writing requirement was not satisfied. In that case, as in the present one, the defendants had accepted the benefits of the agreement and manifested their intent to arbitrate by willingly participating in the proceedings. They filed a counterclaim in the arbitration proceedings and a motion to dismiss pending litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>tion on the ground that the matters at issue were subject to arbitration. The proceedings in that case lasted three years, but the defendants objected only after an unfavorable award had been issued. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Here, the timing of the guarantors\u2019 objection is very similar, but their earlier conduct evidencing an agreement to arbitrate is much clearer. Along with the debtors, the guarantors petitioned the court for arbitration not once, but on three separate occasions. We note also that their agreement to arbitrate is expressed in several signed writings, that is, the motions that they submitted to the court demanding arbitration. Further, they filed an answer and special defenses with the arbitrator and, through their representative, attended and participated in the arbitration sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">It cannot be said that the plaintiff in this case, had he exercised due diligence, could have discerned that the guarantors, as nonsignatories to the purchase and sale agreements that contained the arbitration clauses, had not agreed to arbitrate the disputes over the promissory notes. In fact, the plaintiff initially assumed that the matter was not arbitrable and, therefore, instituted a civil action. The plaintiff had no reason to believe that the guarantors did not agree to arbitrate when the guarantors clearly and repeatedly stated that they <em>did </em>agree to arbitrate and made representations to the court of such an agreement, coupled with viable legal arguments supporting their assertions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiff reasonably relied on the guarantors\u2019 conduct and statements, and proceeded to arbitration on the assumption that the guarantors would not later contest their status as parties to the arbitration agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Like the defendants in <em>Schwarzschild </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>191 Conn. 316,321,464 A.2d 774 (1983), who unsuccessfully sought to have an arbitration award invalidated on the ground that there was no valid agreement to arbitrate, the guarantors in the present case sought the benefits of arbitration \u2014 avoiding the expense and delay of court proceedings \u2014 and then repudiated their agreement to participate after receiving an unfavorable result. Our response is the same: \u201cOne enjoying rights is estopped from repudiating dependent obligations which he has assumed; parties cannot accept benefits under a contract fairly made and at the same time question its validity.\u201d Id., citing <em>Mozzochi </em>v. <em>Luchs, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 19, 23, 391 A.2d 738 (1977). The guarantors may not accept the benefits of submitting their dispute to an arbitration panel, only to reject unfavorable results of that process.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The guarantors argue that the outcome of this case is instead dictated by our holding in <em>Scinto </em>v. <em>Sosin, </em>51 Conn. App. 222, 721 A.2d 552 (1998), cert, denied, 247 Conn. 963, 724 A.2d 1125 (1999). In <em>Scinto, </em>we concluded that a party who had executed a guaranty agreement ancillary to a construction contract containing an arbitration clause, but who did not sign the construction contract itself, was not bound to arbitrate. Id., 237-38. The guarantors urge us to reach the same result in this case. The facts of <em>Scinto, </em>however, are inapposite to those of the present case. The guarantors in <em>Scinto </em>resisted arbitration from the start. They sought and received injunctions barring arbitration proceedings against them. In contrast, the guarantors in this case actively and repeatedly insisted that they were parties to arbitration, made numerous submissions to the court in which they claimed to be parties to arbitration and participated fully as parties to the arbitration. Arbitration was completed quickly and a decision was issued soon thereafter. The guarantors objected only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>after an unfavorable result was obtained. To hold that no agreement to arbitrate existed and, therefore, to indulge the guarantors\u2019 sudden desire to litigate at this late stage would fully frustrate the aim of arbitration to provide a rapid and efficient alternative dispute resolution mechanism for parties who willingly choose to participate. Under the circumstances of this case, we have no difficulty holding that the court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the guarantors and the plaintiff had agreed to arbitrate and that the court correctly confirmed the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The guarantors also claim that the court improperly refused to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> because the arbitrators exceeded their authority in making the award. Specifically, they argue that the plaintiffs submission to the arbitrators did not make any demand against the guarantors or claim any interest in the guarantees.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>fore, the guarantors assert that the award against them went beyond the scope of the submission. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u201cThe scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is very narrow. Our courts favor arbitration as a means of settling differences and uphold the finality of arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>tion awards except where an award clearly falls within the proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418 of the General Statutes. . . . [A]ny challenge to an award ... on the ground that the arbitrators exceeded or imperfectly performed their powers is properly limited to a comparison of the award with the submission. ... If the award conforms to the submission, the arbitrators have not exceeded their powers.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Exley </em>v. <em>Connecticut Yankee Greyhound Racing, Inc., </em>59 Conn. App. 224, 228, 755 A.2d 990, cert, denied, 254 Conn. 939, 761 A.2d 760 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u201cIf the parties have agreed in the underlying contract that their disputes shall be resolved by arbitration, the arbitration clause in the contract is a written submission to arbitration. . . .
