We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Tyrese Jenkins, Hopeton Wiggan, David D., Kenny Cloud and Brucie B. were members of a gang named after a housing project in New Haven. On October 7, 1996, at approximately 11:15 p.m., the gang members went to a housing project, also located in New Haven and referred to as \u201cthe ghetto,\u201d to settle a dispute with the defendant and others, who were members of a rival gang.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Cloud stayed in the car, while Jenkins, Wiggan, David D. and Brucie B., with guns at their sides, went looking for the defendant. The four men entered the housing project through a hole in a fence. As they approached, they noticed the defendant with three others, namely, Charles Green, Bobby \u201cB.O.\u201d Cook and Ryan Baldwin, who were standing and talking near a green electrical box. When the defendant and the others noticed the gang members approaching, the defendant exclaimed, \u201cShoot the motherfucker,\u201d and a gunfight ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">When the first shots were fired, Wiggan and Brucie B. ran for cover behind a dumpster, and Jenkins ran diagonally across a parking lot located in the complex. Both sides exchanged a barrage of gunfire. As Wiggan, Brucie B. and Jenkins retreated from the complex, Jenkins was shot in the leg. He continued to hobble quickly away from the complex until another bullet struck him and he collapsed. Wiggan and Brucie B. went back into the complex and found Jenkins sitting up against a wall. The two picked up Jenkins and carried him to the car. Cloud, David D., Brucie B. and Wiggan took Jenkins to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Yale-New Haven Hospital, where he died from his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Leroy Townsend, a local man, was standing near the electrical box, smoking marijuana,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when he witnessed the beginning of the disturbance. At trial, Townsend testified that he saw the defendant at the scene with a pistol and that he heard him say, \u201cShoot the motherfucker,\u201d to Green.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Arkady Katsnelson, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on the victim. Katsnelson testified that Jenkins suffered two bullet wounds, one of which was fatal. One bullet, a nine millimeter round, entered the lower front portion of Jenkins\u2019 right leg and exited from the back of it. The other bullet, a .44 caliber round, which caused the fatal wound, entered through the upper right side of Jenkins\u2019 chest just below his collarbone and then penetrated his chest wall, right lung, heart, diaphragm, part of his liver and organs of his abdomen, and eventually lodged in his abdominal cavity. Additional facts will be provided as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly admitted evidence of prior uncharged misconduct committed by him because the admission of this evidence prejudiced him, and, therefore, he is entitled to a new trial. Specifically, the defendant contends that the court improperly admitted Idella Davis\u2019 testimony that she saw the defendant in possession of a nine millimeter handgun approximately one week prior to the shooting in the present case. In response, the state argues that the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>evidence because Davis\u2019 testimony did not unduly prejudice the defendant and because it established that the defendant had the means necessary to commit the crime. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The state made an offer of proof, outside the presence of the jury, regarding the admission of this evidence. The defendant objected on the grounds that the evidence was too far removed from the incident giving rise to the present case and that it unduly prejudiced him. The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection and admitted the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u201cThe standard of review is clear. The admission of evidence of prior uncharged misconduct is a decision properly within the discretion of the trial court. . . . [EJvery reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . .

Uncharged misconduct evidence must satisfy a two part test in order to be admitted as an exception. The evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the claimed exceptions and its probative value must outweigh its prejudicial effect. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>[supra, 427]. <em>Stale </em>v. <em>Wiedl, </em>supra, 35 Conn.

Also, the fact that they were with someone the state alleges is a coconspirator in this case. I don\u2019t, at this point in time, would not be claiming the activity in which she was held to the ground and so forth and the threats occurred. . . .

The state further argues that the evidence did not prejudice the defendant. \u201cEvidence indicating that an accused possessed an article with which the particular crime charged may have been accomplished is generally relevant to show that the accused had the means to commit the crime. . . . The state does not have to connect a weapon directly to the defendant and the crime. It is necessary only that the weapon be suitable for the commission of the offense.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Sivri, 46 Conn. App. 578, 584, 700 A.2d 96, cert, denied, 243 Conn. 938, 702 A.2d 644 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Here, the state presented an offer of proof prior to the court\u2019s ruling on the evidence at issue. We conclude that the court properly admitted Davis\u2019 testimony because it tended to show that the defendant had the tools necessary for committing the crimes charged. Further, the evidence was material to the state\u2019s case because it helped the state establish the elements of the crimes charged. Specifically, the evidence established that the defendant had a gun in his possession prior to the crime that was the same type of gun used in the commission of the crime. From this evidence, the jury logically could have concluded that the defendant used the same gun that Davis previously saw him with to commit the crime. Finally, the court recognized the possibility of prejudice to the defendant and properly weighed the probative value of the evidence versus its prejudice to the defendant. The court minimized that prejudice by limiting the state\u2019s inquiry to the solicitation of evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s possession of a firearm. The court did not allow extraneous prejudicial material into evidence such as the fact that the defendant allegedly held the witness\u2019 head to the ground during the encounter. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Davis\u2019 testimony that, approximately one week prior to the incident, she witnessed the defendant in possession of a firearm similar to the one that he had in his possession on the night of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly allowed the state to exercise a peremptory challenge against a prospective juror, who was a member of the defendant\u2019s racial group, without a racially neutral explanation reasonably related to the issues in the case. The defendant argues that the court\u2019s action violated his rights under the Connecticut constitution and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>United States constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response, the state argues that the court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the state provided a valid, race neutral explanation for excluding the prospective juror and that the defendant waived his right to challenge the state\u2019s reason for excluding the juror when the defendant failed to make an attempt to demonstrate that the state\u2019s reason was pretextual.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The following facts are necessary to our resolution of this claim. During voir dire of T, an African-American woman, the state\u2019s attorney questioned T about her understanding of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. After a discussion about the standard, the state\u2019s attorney exercised a peremptoiy challenge to strike T from the jury panel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant objected pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>Batson </em>and Holloway,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the court instructed the state\u2019s attorney to articulate his reasons for exercising the challenge. In response, the state\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>explained that T\u2019s responses indicated to him that she did not appear to understand his questions or that she did not perceive him as being clear. The state\u2019s attorney further stated that he had some concerns with the manner in which she responded to him, and whether she could understand and follow the court\u2019s instructions and not hold the state to a higher burden of proof than required by the law. The court accepted the state\u2019s explanation as sufficient. The defendant did not object or make any further attempt to establish that the state excused T on the basis of a pretextual explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u201cIn <em>Batson </em>[v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986),] the United States Supreme Court recognized that a claim of purposeful racial discrimination on the part of the prosecution in selecting a jury raises constitutional questions of the utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole. . . . The court concluded that [although a prosecutor ordinarily is entitled to exercise permitted peremptory challenges for any reason at all, as long as that reason is related to his [or her] view concerning the outcome of the case to be tried . . . the Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>potential jurors solely on account of their race .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>[237 Conn. 238, 243-44, 676 A.2d 384 (1996)]. Relying on the rationale underlying <em>Batson, </em>the United States Supreme Court has held that gender-based challenges also are impermissible. <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>[511 U.S. 127, 146, 114 S. Ct. 1419, 128 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1994)].</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u201cUnder Connecticut law, [o]nce a [party] asserts a <em>Batson </em>claim, the [opposing party] must advance a neutral explanation for the venireperson\u2019s removal. . . . The [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] is then afforded the opportunity to demonstrate that the [opposing party\u2019s] articulated reasons are insufficient or pretextual. . . . [T]he trial court then [has] the duty to determine if the [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] has established purposeful discrimination. . . . The [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] carries the ultimate burden of persuading the trial court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the jury selection process in his or her particular case was tainted by purposeful discrimination. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u201cWe have identified several specific factors that may indicate that [a party\u2019s removal] of a venireperson through a peremptory challenge was . . . motivated [by race or gender]. These include, but are not limited to: (1) [t]he reasons given for the challenge were not related to the trial of the case ... (2) the [party exercising the peremptory strike] failed to question the challenged juror or only questioned him or her in a perfunctory manner ... (3) prospective jurors of one race [or gender] were asked a question to elicit a particular response that was not asked of the other jurors ... (4) persons with the same or similar characteristics but not the same race [or gender] as the challenged juror were not struck ... (5) the [party exercising the peremptory strike] advanced an explanation based on a group bias where the group trait is not shown to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to the challenged juror specifically . . . and (6) the [party exercising the peremptory strike] used a disproportionate number of peremptoiy challenges to exclude members of one race [or gender], . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u201cIn assessing the reasons proffered in support of the use of a peremptory challenge . . . [a]n explanation . . . need not ... be pigeon-holed as wholly acceptable or wholly unacceptable . . . and even where the acceptability of a particular explanation is doubtful, the inquiry is not at an end. In deciding the ultimate issue of discriminatory intent, the judicial officer is entitled to assess each explanation in light of all the other evidence relevant to prosecutorial intent. The officer may think a dubious explanation undermines the bona fides of other explanations or may think that the sound explanations dispel the doubt raised by a questionable one. As with most inquiries into state of mind, the ultimate determination depends on an aggregate assessment of all the circumstances. . . . <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>[951 F.2d 22, 26 (2d Cir. 1991)]. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u201cFinally, the trial court\u2019s decision on the question of discriminatory intent represents a finding of fact that will necessarily turn on the court\u2019s evaluation of the demeanor and credibility of the attorney of the party exercising the peremptory challenge. <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 365, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1991); <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 98 n.21; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>supra, 951 F.2d 25; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>[206 Conn. 391, 395, 538 A.2d 210 (1988)]. Accordingly, a trial court\u2019s determination that there has or has not been intentional discrimination is afforded great deference and will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>[227 Conn. 301, 323-24, 630 A.2d 593 (1993)]; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 406-407. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>249 Conn. 645, 657-60, 735 A.2d 267 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Here, T\u2019s responses to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, coupled with the manner in which she responded to him, support the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for striking the prospective juror. \u201cA prosecutor, when exercising a peremptory challenge to remove a venireperson, may legitimately [base that decision] not only on answers given by the prospective juror to questions posed on voir dire, but also on the prosecutor\u2019s observations of the prospective juror. An impression of the conduct and demeanor of a prospective juror during the voir dire may provide a legitimate basis for the exercise of a peremptory challenge. . . . Thus, a prosecutor\u2019s explanation that a venireperson was excluded because he or she seemed, for example, inattentive or hostile to the government, if credible, is sufficient.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 238, 254-55 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Moreover, the defendant did not attempt to establish that the state gave a pretextual reason for excusing T. \u201cOnce the state met its burden of producing a race-neutral explanation, it was incumbent upon the defendant to persuade the trial court that the state\u2019s reasons were insufficient or pretextual. To have done so, the defendant could have advanced reasons that are salient to a showing of pretext. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Beltran, </em>246 Conn. 268, 280, 717 A.2d 168 (1998). The defendant\u2019s failure to provide the trial court with such reasons may be treated as acquiescence in the validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Id.; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arce, </em>997 F.2d 1123, 1126-27 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rudas, </em>905 F.2d 38,41 (2d Cir. 1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 249 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>662-63. In the present case, the defendant failed to meet his burden of establishing that the state\u2019s reasons for excluding T were pretextual. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the prosecutor to exercise a peremptory challenge against T.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the court improperly instructed the jury that it could not consider what effect, if any, a state witness\u2019 use of marijuana on the night of the shooting had on his ability to see and comprehend the events surrounding the shooting. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court\u2019s instruction to disregard this evidence violated his constitutional right to confront witnesses and to have the jury evaluate the credibility of witnesses on the basis of properly admitted evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of this issue. At trial, the state presented the testimony of its key witness, Townsend, who identified the defendant as being present at the scene of the crime and in possession of a pistol. Townsend testified that he did not come forward with his stoiy until officers from the New Haven police department stopped and incarcerated him for a traffic violation. The defendant cross-examined Townsend regarding his drug use, inquiring whether he had smoked marijuana or ingested any cocaine on the night of the shooting. Townsend acknowledged that he had smoked marijuana, but denied using any cocaine on that night. The defendant further cross-examined Townsend regarding inconsistencies in his story as to where the shooting occurred. Townsend admitted that although he previously had stated that he observed Jenkins get shot, he actually did not witness the shooting because he ran from the scene as soon as the shots were fired. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The defendant extensively cross-examined Townsend, however, he did not inquire into the effect that the marijuana had on Townsend\u2019s ability to see or comprehend the events on the night of the shooting.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">In its instructions to the jury regarding the credibility of witnesses, the court stated: \u201cThe credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are matters which are your function to determine. However, I may properly make certain suggestions to you. No fact is, of course, to be determined merely by the number of witnesses testifying for or against it. It is the quality, not quantity, of testimony which controls. In weighing the testimony of a witness, you should try to size him or her up. You should have in mind all those little circumstances which point to his or her truthfulness or untruthfulness. You should consider any possible bias or prejudice he or she may have whether for or against the state or a defendant, his or her interest or lack of interest of whatever sort in the outcome of the trial, his or her ability to observe facts correctly and to remember and relate them tru[thfully] and accurately. You should test the evidence he or she gives you by your knowledge of human nature and the motives which influence and control human action. If any facts are admitted or otherwise proved to you, you may bring them into relation with his or her testimony and see if they fit together with it. In short, you are to bring to bear upon it the same considerations and use the same sound judgment you apply to questions of truth and veracity which are daily presenting themselves for your decision in the ordinary affairs of life. Any conduct or statement of a witness which you find inconsistent.with any other conduct or statement of that witness you may consider in weighing the credibility of that witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Regarding identification evidence, the court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIdentification is a question of fact for you to decide taking into consideration all of the evidence that you have seen and heard in the course of the trial. The state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the perpetrator of the crimes charged. The identification of a defendant by a single witness as the one who committed the crime is in and of itself sufficient to justify a conviction of such a person provided, of course, that you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the identity of the defendant as the one who committed the crime. In arriving at a determination as to the matter of identification, you should consider all of the facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the observation of the perpetrator by the witness. In this regard, the credibility and the reliability of the witness is of paramount importance since identification testimony is an expression of belief or impression by the witness. Its value depends upon the opportunity and ability of the witness to observe the offender at the time of the event and to make an accurate identification later. It is for you to decide how much weight to place upon such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u201cIn appraising the testimony given by a witness identifying a defendant as a perpetrator of the crimes charged, you should take into account whether the witness had adequate opportunity and ability to observe the perpetrator on the date in question. This may be affected by such circumstances as the length of time available to make the observation, the distance between the witness and the perpetrator, the lighting conditions at the time of the events, whether the witness had known or seen the person in the past and whether anything distracted the attention of the witness during the incident. You should also consider the witness\u2019 physical and emotional condition at the time of the incident and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>witness\u2019 powers of observation in general. In short, you must consider the totality of the circumstances affecting the identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">With regard to Townsend\u2019s testimony, the court instructed the jury: \u201cIn weighing the credibility of [Leroy] Townsend, you may consider the fact that he was convicted of one felony in 1986 and two felonies in 1994, and give such weight to those facts which you decide is fair and reasonable in weighing the credibility of his testimony in court and the statement he gave to the police which is taped and marked as exhibit 50A. Also, in weighing the credibility of [Leroy] Townsend, you may consider the testimony of . . . Sherry Hey-ward concerning her opinion that . . . Townsend is a pathological liar and give such weight to that opinion which you decide is fair and reasonable in weighing his credibility.\u201d Nevertheless, earlier in its charge to the jury, the court stated: \u201c[Y]ou have heard testimony that [Leroy] Townsend smoked marijuana the night of the shooting. There is no evidence as to what effect it had on him. Because there is no such evidence, you must not speculate that he was or was not affected by it or how he was affected by it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">At the close of the court\u2019s instruction to the jury, the defendant objected to the court\u2019s statement regarding how the jury must consider the evidence of Townsend\u2019s marijuana usage. The court declined to reinstruct the jury. We review this claim because the defendant properly preserved it.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u201cOur standard of review on this [nonconstitutional] claim is whether it is reasonably probable that the jury was misled. . . . The test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>of law. . . . Therefore, jury instructions need not be exhaustive, perfect, or technically accurate. Nonetheless, the trial court must correctly adapt the law to the case in question and must provide the jury with sufficient guidance in reaching a correct verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Taft, </em>57 Conn. App. 19, 29, 746 A.2d 813, cert, granted on other grounds, 253 Conn. 909, 753 A.2d 942 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The defendant argues that the court\u2019s instruction that the jury must not speculate as to how Townsend\u2019s marijuana usage affected him violated the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. As a threshold matter, we note that although the defendant has framed this claim in terms of a denial of his right to confrontation and his due process right to a fair trial, the claim does not present constitutional issues. Instead, the claim presents evidentiary issues related to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. \u201cClearly, the defendant has put a constitutional tag on . . . nonconstitutional evidentiary ruling [s]. <em>State </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>203 Conn. 445,455, 525 A.2d 101 (1987) .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>[207 Conn. 35, 46, 540 A.2d 42 (1988)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 403, 497 A.2d 956 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 18, 438 A.2d 867 (1982). <em>Stale </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>215 Conn. 1, 5, 574 A.2d 188 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>215 Conn. 653, 659, 577 A.2d 1036 (1990), cert, denied, 498 U.S. 1048, 111 S. Ct. 756, 112 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1991). \u201cJust as every claim of evidentiary error by the trial court is not truly constitutional in nature; see, e.g., <em>[Stale </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 241, 567 A.2d 823 (1989)]; every claim of instructional error is not truly constitutional in nature. We have recognized, for example, that claimed instructional errors regarding the elements of an offense; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535,543,613 A.2d 770 (1992); and claimed instructional errors regarding the burden of proof or the presumption of innocence; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Conn. 270, 289, 623 A.2d 42 (1993); are constitutional in nature .... We have also recognized, however, that claimed instructional errors regarding general principles of credibility of witnesses are not constitutional in nature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 738, 595 A.2d 322 (1991). Indeed, it would trivialize the constitution to transmute a nonconstitutional claim into a constitutional claim simply because of the label placed on it by a party because of a strained connection between it and a fundamental constitutional right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>242 Conn. 143, 151-52, 698 A.2d 297 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u201c \u2018The right to confrontation is fundamental to a fair trial under both the federal and state constitutions. <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.

The primary interest secured by the right of confrontation is the right to cross-examine witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>43 Conn. App. 667, 675, 685 A.2d 677 (1996), cert, denied, 240 Conn. 923, 692 A.2d 819 (1997). The defendant does have a right under the confrontation clause to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, [can] appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the [state\u2019s] witness. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 318; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 101, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983). The confrontation clause requires that [if] the testimony of such a witness is to remain in the case as a basis for conviction, the defendant must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to discover any infirmities that may cast serious doubt upon its truthfulness. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>242 Conn. 666, 682, 701 A.2d 1 (1997). The right of cross-examination is not, however, absolute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 284, 497 A.2d 35 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>42 Conn.

App. 80, 86, 485 A.2d 1321 (1984), in which this court stated: \u201cThe jury may, without the aid of expert testimony, use the consumption of alcohol as a basis on which to infer impairment of ability to observe and recall accurately.\u201d Nevertheless, the situation in <em>Heinz </em>is distinguishable from the present case, not because of the particular drug used by the witness, in that case alcohol and here marijuana, but rather because of the restrictions that the trial court in <em>Heinz </em>placed on the defendant\u2019s ability to cross-examine the witness in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">In <em>Heinz, </em>the trial court allowed the defendant to cross-examine two witnesses regarding the fact that they had consumed several beers on the night that they had made their observations. The trial court, however, precluded the defendant from cross-examining the witnesses regarding \u201cthe effect of this consumption of alcohol on their abilities to recall what they observed that night.\u201d Id., 84-85. In that case, we stated that \u201c[t]he confrontation clause does not require that the defendant be permitted also to elicit from the officers the opinion that consumption of alcohol during and after observing something can affect one\u2019s ability accurately to observe and later recall what one observed.\u201d Id., 86. Nevertheless, we held that the trial court in <em>Heinz </em>abused its discretion by setting a limit on the defendant\u2019s ability to cross-examine the witnesses on the issue of credibility as it related to their ability to observe and recall accurately the details of their observations. Id., 87-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The situation in <em>Heinz </em>is therefore inapposite to the situation in the present case because here the record does not reflect, nor does the defendant claim, that the couit placed any restrictions on his ability to cross-examine Townsend on the issue of his marijuana usage or its effect on him. Rather, the defendant argues that the court\u2019s instruction to the jury not to speculate as to the effect of Townsend\u2019s marijuana usage improperly impaired the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation by precluding the jury from considering a matter that was brought before it by the mere fact that the record contained evidence that Townsend used marijuana prior to making his observations. Although the defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine Townsend on the issue of whether the marijuana affected his ability to observe the events on the night of the shooting, the defendant failed to make full use of that opportunity. Accordingly, the court\u2019s instruction not to speculate as to the effect of marijuana usage on Townsend did not deprive the defendant of his constitutional right to confrontation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The defendant in the present case made a tactical decision not to ask the witness what effect the marij\u00faana had on him. The court did not improperly instruct the jury that it could not speculate as to the effect of the marijuana on Townsend because no party introduced evidence as to what effect, if any, the marijuana had on the witness. Indeed, it is well established that \u201c[e]vidence of a witness\u2019 mental condition may be admitted if the defendant establishes that a relationship exists between the condition and the [witness\u2019] capacity to observe, remember and narrate the relevant facts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cardinal, </em>194 Conn. 114,118-19,478 A.2d610 (1996). Absent such a showing, evidence of the condition . . . may be excluded as irrelevant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>42 Conn. App. 41, 58, 680 A.2d 1340 (1996). \u201cThe capacity of a witness to observe, recollect and narrate an occurrence is a proper subject of inquiry on cross-examination. If <em>as a result of a mental condition </em>such capacity has been substantially diminished, evidence of that condition before, at and after the occurrence and at the time of trial, is ordinarily admissible for use by the trier in passing on the credibility of the witness. . . . Thus, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>order for evidence of a witness\u2019 psychiatric condition to be admissible for impeachment purposes, there must be a showing that the condition substantially affected the witness\u2019 ability to observe, recall or narrate events at issue in the trial.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cardinal, </em>supra, 118-19. Similarly, in the present case, the defendant did not attempt to show that the witness\u2019 condition after smoking marijuana affected the witness\u2019 ability to observe, to recall or to narrate events at issue in the present case. Absent such an attempt or showing, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the court properly instructed the jury that it could not speculate as to the effect that the marijuana had on Townsend, and, therefore, we conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the court\u2019s instruction misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In this opinion LANDAU, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217e (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver when he possesses a pistol or revolver, as defined in section 29-27, and (1) has been convicted of a felony . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-14\"> The jury acquitted the defendant of the charges of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-54a (a) and conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-54a (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\"> The dispute arose from an earlier confrontation at a club in New Haven where one of the members of the defendant\u2019s gang, namely, Charles Green, allegedly shot at some members of the rival gang.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b211-10\"> Townsend\u2019s testimony revealed that he smoked five maryuana cigarettes that evening in a relatively short period of time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b211-12\"> After a joint trial with the defendant, the jury found Green guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, murder as an accessory and criminal possession of a pistol or revolver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\"> The defendant claims that the court\u2019s action violated his rights under the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 19, as amended by article fourth of the amendments, and \u00a7 20, as well as his rights under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\"> The state further argues that the defendant failed to support his claims with independent analysis under the Connecticut constitution.

See, <em>e.gHernandez </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 358-59, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L.

Pursuant to this court\u2019s supervisory authority over the administration of justice, we have eliminated the requirement, contained in the first step of this process, that the party objecting to the exercise of the peremptory challenge establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 646 &amp; n.4, 553 A.2d 166, cert, denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S.

Thus, in this state, after the party contesting the use of the peremptory challenge has raised a <em>Batson </em>claim, the party exercising the challenge must proffer a race neutral explanation for its decision to strike the venireperson from the jury array. Id., 646. In Connecticut, therefore, the party objecting to the exercise of the peremptory challenge satisfies step one of the tripartite process simply by raising the objection.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>249 Conn. 645, 658 n.18, 735 A.2d 267 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\"> The codefendant, Green, also did not inquire into the effect of marijuana on the witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b233-4\"> We respectfully disagree with the dissent that our resolution of this appeal violates <em>Davis </em>v. Alaska, supra, 415 U.S. 308. In Davis, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion in limine preventing the defendant from cross-examining a juvenile witness about his criminal record. The <em>Davis </em>defendant, therefore, was denied his constitutional right to confront the witness by challenging his credibility. Here, the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the witness was not limited, except by the defendant\u2019s own failure to ask the witness about his ability to perceive and to relate events after he had smoked five marijuana cigarettes. Because there was no evidence before the jury concerning the witness\u2019 ability to perceive and to relate, the court simply instructed the jurors that they could not speculate about those issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\"> The dissent opines that the court, denied \u201cthe jury, as the sole trier of fact and credibility, the right to consider facts from which they could draw inferences about the reliability and credibility of the witness.\u201d The court did no such thing. It did not tell the jury to disregard Townsend\u2019s testimony that he had smoked five marijuana cigarettes. The jury, therefore, was free to draw whatever conclusions it wanted with respect to the character of a witness who had ingested an illegal substance. The court merely pointed out that the jury could not speculate about the effect smoking five marijuana cigarettes had on Townsend.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq4\">Although we find that the issue raised by the dissent regarding the effects of marijuana is irrelevant to our resolution of this appeal, we find disturbing the dissent\u2019s position that the effects of using marijuana are common knowledge among jurors. First, we note that consuming alcohol by persons of the age of majority is a legal act; see General Statutes \u00a7 30-89; whereas smoking marijuana, unless otherwise provided for by law, is not a legal act. General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (b). Second, we cannot agree with the dissent\u2019s implication that all jurors are familiar with the effects of marijuana because such an implication ignores the breadth and diversity of our jury pool.</p>\n<p id=\"Arl\">We also take issue with the dissent\u2019s position that <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 653, stands for the proposition that our Supreme Court endorsed the practice of inviting the jury to draw inferences from a witness\u2019 marijuana use. First, the claims in <em>Person </em>concerned prosecutorial misconduct, specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>cally, whether a prosecutor could \u201cattempt to Impeach a witness during cross-examination through use of that witness\u2019 prior invocation of his fifth amendment privilege . . . .\u201d Id., 659-60. Second, the cross-examination of the witness in <em>Person </em>went to the issue of the witness\u2019 ability to perceive and relate after he had used marijuana. Our Supreme Court agreed with the trial court that the witness\u2019 use of marijuana was relevant to the question of his ability to perceive and relate, and, therefore, the question was proper. See id., 661. The critical and distinguishing fact here is that the defendant did not ask any questions about Townsend\u2019s ability to perceive or to relate.</p>\n<p id=\"A7c\">The dissent implies that the court required, as a predicate, that the jury be instructed by an expert witness on the effects of marijuana on the witness\u2019 ability to perceive and recall events. The issue of expert testimony was never before the court. Indeed, the court never mentions it. Therefore, the court properly refused to allow the jury to speculate on something not before it as evidence. The jurors knew that the witness had smoked five marijuana cigarettes and that it was their function to evaluate his credibility, but they could not speculate as to what effect the use of marijuana had on the witness\u2019 ability to observe and to recall events because that was not in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b237-8\">LAVERY, C.

Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974), when the majority upholds the trial court\u2019s charge that the jury could not consider the effect of marijuana use on the state\u2019s key witness, the only witness who identified the defendant as being at the scene with a gun. By so doing, the majority denies the jury, as the sole trier of fact and credibility, the right to consider facts from which it could draw inferences about the reliability and credibility of the witness. Thus, while I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusions as to the other issues raised in this appeal, I respectfully dissent from its conclusion that the trial court\u2019s instruction<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the jury could not consider the effect on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the state\u2019s key witness of the witness\u2019 smoking of five marijuana joints shortly before the shooting constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">As an initial matter, the majority addresses the claim here as a \u201cnonconstitutional evidentiary\u201d claim. I disagree with this characterization of the defendant\u2019s claim since the jury instruction at issue violated his right to confront and to impeach a witness against him, a right guaranteed both by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution and by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority reasons that not all claims of instructional error are constitutional in nature and cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>242 Conn. 143,152, 698 A.2d 297 (1997), for the proposition that \u201cclaimed instructional errors regarding <em>general principles of credibility </em>of witnesses are not constitutional in nature.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">While these two propositions put forth by the majority as its basis for dismissing this claim as nonconstitutional are true, they do not prove the point. First, the error claimed here is not about general principles of credibility of witnesses. The error claimed here concerns <em>one </em>instruction about the credibility of <em>one </em>witness. Second, the fact that not all instructional errors are constitutional in nature does not mean that <em>this </em>claim of instructional error is not constitutional in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">As the United States Supreme Court stated in Davis: \u201c[I]t seems clear . . . that to make any [effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>impeach a witness] effective, defense counsel should [be] permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, <em>as the sole triers of fact and credibility, </em>could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Davis </em>v.

In addition, the Supreme Court noted in <em>Person </em>that \u201c[t]he <em>prosecutor </em>may not express his own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)

We stated: \u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s initial purpose in questioning Mercier regarding his use of marijuana was to impeach his credibility by casting doubt on his ability to perceive and recall the events that were the subject of his testimony. The capacity of a witness to observe, recollect and narrate an occurrence is a proper subject of inquiry on cross-examination. . . . <em>Consumption of alcohol or drugs obviously can impair an individual\u2019s ability to perceive and recall accurately . . . </em>.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 121-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">In no case in which the issue of impeaching a witness\u2019 credibility by his drug or alcohol use has arisen has either this court or our Supreme Court required, as a predicate, that the jury be instructed by an expert witness on the effects of the alcohol or drug use on the witness\u2019 ability to perceive and recall events. This has been true whether the \u201cdrug\u201d in question was alcohol, marijuana or cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">There have been a number of cases in which both this court and our Supreme Court have held that ordinary people, namely, jurors, can judge for themselves whether a witness\u2019 admitted use of drugs would, in their opinion, affect the witness\u2019 credibility. \u201cThe trier of fact <em>need not close its eyes to matters of common knowledge solely because the evidence includes no expert testimony on those matters.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Way </em>v. <em>Parent, </em>179 Conn. 377, 380,426 A.2d 780 (1979). In <em>Way, </em>the plaintiff had consumed ten glasses of beer and, without any expert testimony, the Supreme Court approved of permitting the jury to draw its own infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>enees on the effects of that quantity of alcohol, finding it to be a \u201c[matter] of common knowledge . . . .\u2019\u2019Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">If, in 1979, the effects of ten ten-ounce glasses of beer were common knowledge, then it is fair to say that in 2000, the effects of several marijuana cigarettes are common knowledge. In fact, in 1993, this court approved of a statement by a trial court to a jury that \u201cthe effect of alcohol on a person and also the effect of marijuana on a person . . . [are] probably within your common knowledge, but [defense counsel] has asked me to allow this to be presented as an exhibit so that he could argue from this what he feels the [marijuana] and alcohol, what role they played in this case. So . . . it\u2019s offered solely for the purpose of explaining to you <em>something you already </em>know, <em>the effect of marijuana </em>... on a person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. Charlton, 30 Conn. App. 359, 368-69 n.9, 620 A.2d 1297, cert, denied, 225 Conn. 922, 625 A.2d 824 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">I would therefore conclude that it was improper for the trial court to instruct the jury not to draw any conclusions in the absence of testimony, expert or otherwise, as to the probable effects of the witness\u2019 smoking of five joints of marijuana on the night of the shooting on his ability to perceive and to recall the events accurately. Because the instruction precluded the jury from considering important facts bearing on the credibility of the only witness<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who had placed the defendant at the scene and with a gun, I would find that the instruction was not harmless and reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-9\"> The relevant portion of the court\u2019s instruction is as follows: \u201cAlso, you have heard testimony that [Leroy] Townsend smoked marijuana the night of the shooting. There is no evidence as to what effect it had on him. Because there is no such evidence, you must not speculate that he was or was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>affected by it or how he was affected by it.\u201d It is undisputed that counsel for the defendant timely objected to this portion of the charge, and the court declined to reinstruct the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b238-10\"> The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right ... to be confronted by the witnesses against him . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\"> The witness\u2019 credibility was the key factor in the trial. He was impeached with prior felonies and inconsistent statements. He came forward as a witness three weeks after the incident, when he was incarcerated. Further, the witness\u2019 own cousin testified that he was a pathological liar.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
