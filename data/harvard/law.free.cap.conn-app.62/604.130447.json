We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The following facts are relevant to our disposition of this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At approximately 9:07 p.m. on July 24, 1998, Officer Peter A. Bosco of the Naugatuck police department observed a Ford automobile traveling northbound on Route 8 in the vicinity of exit 29. The vehicle was weaving back and forth between the slow and fast lanes, almost striking another vehicle that was attempting to pass it. The car then made a hard right turn to take exit 29 and struck a partial median on the left side of the ramp. It continued on the ramp approaching Old Waterbury Turnpike with the left front and rear tires traveling over the partial median. Bosco <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>activated his lights and siren, and the Ford drove off the road with the rear of the car jutting out into the roadway. As Bosco approached the vehicle, the driver, who proved to be the plaintiff, yelled, \u201cWhat the hell did I do wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Bosco observed that the plaintiffs eyes were extremely glossy and bloodshot, and that he had a strong odor of alcohol on his breath. When Bosco explained why he had stopped him, the plaintiff replied, \u201cWell, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a stupid place to put a median?\u201d His words were heavily slurred, and he admitted to having consumed \u201ca few beers.\u201d Bosco inquired whether he had any illnesses, medical problems or handicaps that would prevent him from performing field sobriety tests. The plaintiff replied, \u201cNo, I should be all set,\u201d and then proceeded to fail the field sobriety tests. Bosco placed him under arrest, charged him with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and transported him to the Naugatuck police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">At the station, the plaintiff waived his Miranda<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rights in writing and stated that he had begun drinking at approximately 3 p.m. and had consumed his last beer at 8 p.m. When asked what type of alcoholic beverages he had been drinking, he replied, \u201cWhatever they put in front of me.\u201d He advised the police that he was neither injured nor ill, and that he was not taking medication and needed no medication at that time. He also declined to contact an attorney and in response to the police reading the implied consent advisory to him, he stated, \u201cYou know I\u2019m going to refuse whatever test you ask. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>I beat it last time by refusing, I\u2019ll beat it again.\u201d He added, \u201cIf you [the police] could write a good report the first time, you wouldn\u2019t have had to worry about me driving on the streets.\u201d When asked to provide a breath sample, he replied, \u201cI am not going to blow; you\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The police reported to the commissioner the plaintiffs refusal to take the chemical alcohol test, and the commissioner initiated a license suspension action. The plaintiff thereafter requested an administrative hearing after which the commissioner, acting through his hearing officer, suspended the plaintiffs driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, which dismissed the appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The plaintiffs claim at the hearing, as well as on appeal, is that he was exempt from submitting to a Breathalyzer test pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b Q), which provides that \u201c [t]he provisions of [\u00a7 14-227b] shall not apply to any person whose physical condition is such that, according to competent medical advice, such test would be inadvisable.\u201d In support of his contention that he qualified for an exemption under \u00a7 14-227b (j), he submitted to the hearing officer a letter from James E. O\u2019Brien, a physician, to the plaintiffs counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The commissioner does not contend that O\u2019Brien\u2019s letter does not constitute competent medical advice. O\u2019Brien\u2019s letter unequivocally states that it would have been medically inadvisable for the plaintiff to attempt to perform a Breathalyzer test and sets forth the facts on which his opinion is based together with a thorough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>medical analysis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The dispositive issue is whether the hearing officer should have found that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>physical condition was such that, according to competent medical advice, taking a Breathalyzer test was inadvisable pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The hearing officer in this case faced the dilemma of two diverse factual predicates. The first was the police officer\u2019s scenario, which describes an operator whom he observed driving on Route 8, whom he pulled over by use of his siren and red lights, and who expressly denied having any illnesses, medical problems or handicaps. O\u2019Brien\u2019s letter recites the second factual predicate, which describes a plaintiff who pulled over to the side of the road because he was suffering an asthmatic attack resulting in part from the inhalation of fine dirt particles shortly before the stop. According to O\u2019Brien\u2019s letter, the plaintiff was already stopped on the side of the road when the police officer approached. The letter was based on facts and assumptions that were contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Should the hearing officer have accepted the police officer\u2019s version of having pulled an operator over to the side of the road, or should he have accepted the scenario in O\u2019Brien\u2019s letter describing an operator parked on the side of the road having an asthmatic attack? It is the function of the hearing officer to resolve conflicts in the evidence. <em>Schallenkamp </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>229 Conn. 31, 41, 639 A.2d 1018 (1994). The hearing officer was free to believe the police version of the facts and to disbelieve totally the plaintiffs version.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">\u201cFactual determinations of the commissioner must be upheld if there is substantial evidence in the record to support such a finding. ... An administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence if the record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . Such a standard of review allows less room for judicial scrutiny than does the weight of the evidence rule or the clearly erroneous rule. ... In determining whether an admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>istrative finding is supported by substantial evidence, a court must defer to the agency\u2019s right to believe or disbelieve the evidence presented by any witness, even an expert, in whole or in part.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lomen </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>61 Conn. App. 213, 218, 763 A.2d 676 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The plaintiff argues that \u00a7 14-227b (j) requires the hearing officer to consider only O\u2019Brien\u2019s medical report and bars consideration of the police report. That contention is contrary to firmly established precedent. \u201cBasically, an agency is not required to use in any particular fashion any of the materials presented to it so long as the conduct of the hearing is fundamentally fair.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>48 Conn. App. 391, 400, 700 A. 2d 807, cert, denied, 245 Conn. 917, 717 A. 2d 234 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The hearing officer was not bound to consider only the competent medical advice required under \u00a7 14-227b (j). Rather, the hearing officer may consider evidence presented by any witness and make his decision in view of all of the evidence. Id., 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">\u201cPursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner and must affirm the commissioner\u2019s decision unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record .... General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j). In the present case, the court properly concluded that substantial evidence existed to support the commissioner\u2019s findings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>60 Conn. App. 830, 834, 761 A.2d 786 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-12\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 14-227b (b) provides: \u201cIf any such person, having been placed under arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both or while his ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor, and thereafter, after being apprised of his constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>rights, having been requested to submit to a blood, breath or urine test at the <em>option of the </em>police officer, having been afforded a reasonable opportunity to telephone an attorney prior to the performance of such test and having been informed that his license or nonresident operating privilege may be suspended in accordance with the provisions of this section if he refuses to submit to such test or if he submits to such test and the results of such test indicate that the ratio of alcohol in his blood was ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight, and that evidence of any such refusal shall be admissible in accordance with subsection (f) of section 14-227a and may be used against him in any criminal prosecution, refuses to submit to the designated test, the test shall not be given; provided, if the person refuses or is unable to submit to a blood test, the police officer shall designate the breath or urine test as the test to be taken. The police officer shall make a notation upon the records of the police department that he informed the person that his license or nonresident operating privilege may be suspended if he refused to submit to such test or if he submitted to such test and the results of such test indicated that the ratio of alcohol in his blood was ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> In 1998, the legislature amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 14-227b and redesignated subsection (j) as subsection (1) effective January 1, 1999.

In addition, I have also reviewed Mr. Dore\u2019s medical records consisting of the office records of Dr. George Rubin and Cortland Brown, III, M.D., the Gaylord Hospital Pulmonary Clinic reports and the medical records of St. Vincent Medical Center in Bridgeport regarding his hospital admission dated July 3, 1993 to August 8, 1993. I have also considered the circumstances and activities of Mr. Dore surrounding his arrest on July 24, 1998 for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"Avo\">\u201cIt is my understanding that on July 24th Mr. Dore was suffering an asthmatic attack and because of shortness of breath and wheezing he pulled to the side of the road. Subsequently he was approached by a police officer who, believing Dr. [sic] Dore might be intoxicated, requested that he perform the standard field sobriety tests. Mr. Dore explained that because of his medical problems he could not perform the tests. He was then arrested and taken to the police station and requested to submit to the Intoxilyzer 5000 test. Mr. Dore, who was experiencing severe shortness of breath in part due to transporting dirt prior to the stop, refused to take the breathalyzer test. Mr. Dore, who weighed 200 pounds at the time, had been drinking beer earlier in the day and states he had three 12 ounce beers, one at 1200 hours, one at 1500 hours and the last at 1800 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"A8P\">\u201cIn regards to your inquiry as to what effect, if any, Mr. Dore\u2019s pulmonary disease would have on his ability to perform the Intoxilyzer test, Mr. Dore\u2019s pulmonary disease would make performance of such tests most difficult and medically inadvisable. This is based on his severe pulmonary disease which is further complicated by paralysis of his diaphragm and restrictive airway disease and inhalation of fine dirt particles shortly before the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"Aia\">\u201cMr. Dore\u2019s severe pulmonary disease as documented in the above records are the consequence of a gunshot wound to the chest which resulted in severe restrictions of his vital capacity and an expiration flow rate of merely 120 liters per minute. This is due to both obstructive airway disease and diaphragmatic weakness and partial paralysis. The presence of his symptomatic dyspenia at the time surrounding the incident is attested to by review of pharmacy records showing his use of a Serevent Inhaler, Albuterol Inhaler and a Vaneeril Inhaler in the period surrounding the incident. Review of the records also show a FEV, of only 47% of the expected value and forced vital capacity of 74% of normal with a FEV, FVO of 53% normal. These values together with the other clinical data and physical exam, attest to the fact that Mr. Dore does indeed have severe lung disease and particularly when wheezing should not attempt to perform the tests.</p>\n<p id=\"Anm\">\u201cIn summary, because of severe pulmonary disease as documented in the records and the findings noted above it would be medically inadvisable for Mr. Dore to attempt to perform a breathalyzer test.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
