The plaintiff<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in this civil action seeks to enforce the provisions of a separation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>agreement that the court had incorporated by reference into the judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The trial court found the following facts. The plaintiff and the defendant were married on November 3, 1957. A dissolution proceeding was commenced in 1991, and on November 7, 1994, the parties signed a separation agreement,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which the court accepted and incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>by reference into the judgment dissolving the marriage. On March 5,1995, the court, by agreement of the parties, extended the time for payment under paragraph 5.1 (a), from March 7, 1995, to March 31, 1995. The parties agreed to a further extension on March 13, 1995. The defendant again appeared before the court and asked for a further extension, which the court refused. The court cited as its reason that it could not open a judgment beyond the four month time limitation since it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The court then signed an order transferring the certain stock to the defendant in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5.1 (e) of the separation agreement. An appeal to the Appellate Court followed. We affirmed the judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">This civil action followed on February 19, 1998, in which the plaintiff is claiming an interest in a portion of the assets that the trial court transferred to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the defendant was to receive a specific sum of lump sum alimony, that is, $575,000, and that the defendant has been unjustly enriched because she has received substantially more than that amount by virtue of the transfer due to an increase in the value of the stocks that were transferred. The present civil action seeks to enjoin the defendant from liquidating those assets she received pursuant to the separation agreement as well as an order requiring the defendant to transfer back to the plaintiff any assets or cash that would be in excess of the $575,000 contrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>tual settlement. On March 16, 1998, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss on August 18, 1998, finding that the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In this action, the plaintiff first claims that the court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, which motion claimed that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. We agree. We conclude, however, that the defendant is entitled to summary judgment based on res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>247 Conn. 724, 727-28, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999), our Supreme Court, in distinguishing the issue of subject matter jurisdiction and a court\u2019s authority to act, stated that \u201c[sjubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the motion before it. . . . A court does not truly lack subject matter jurisdiction if it has competence to entertain the action before it. . . . Once it is determined that a tribunal has authority or competence to decide the class of cases to which the action belongs, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is resolved in favor of entertaining the action. . . . It is well established that, in determining whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction, every presumption favoring jurisdiction should be indulged.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In this case, the cause of action is based on the agreement of the parties which, although it was incorporated into the judgment, provides the basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction. See <em>Duse </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>9 Conn. App. 218, 220, 518 A.2d 74 (1986). The trial court noted, however, that this corut affirmed the dissolution court\u2019s decision to permit the transfer of the assets to the defendant. The trial court further concluded that the plaintiffs attempt to come through the back door, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>he is unable to come through the front door, cannot be sustained. The basis for the trial court\u2019s decision \u2014 that the transfer order had been affirmed on a prior appeal\u2014 bars the plaintiffs claims under the principle of res judicata but does not bar the action on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u201cUnless a litigant can show an absence of subject matter jurisdiction that makes the prior judgment of a tribunal entirely invalid, he or she [is limited to] resort[ing] to direct proceedings [i.e., an appeal] to correct perceived wrongs in the tribunal\u2019s conclusive decision. ... A collateral attack on a judgment is . . . procedurally impermissible . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Joe\u2019s Pizza, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>236 Conn. 863, 876, 675 A.2d 441 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In <em>Joe\u2019s Pizza, Inc., </em>the court, in an earlier action, had rendered a judgment declaring that the defendant did not have to provide insurance coverage for the plaintiff restaurant. The plaintiff then brought a contract action against the defendant seeking payment on a fire insurance policy. Id., 866-67. Our Supreme Court barred such a collateral attack and affirmed the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment on the basis of res judicata. Id., 876-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">As a matter of law, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>205 Conn. 201, 208 n.3, 530 A.2d 603 (1987). Since we conclude that the dissolution judgment and the order transferring assets cannot be collaterally attacked, we reverse the judgment of dismissal and remand the case to the trial court with direction to render summary judgment in favor of the defendant. See <em>State Library </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>240 Conn. 824, 833, 694 A.2d 1235 (1997); <em>Almeida </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins.
