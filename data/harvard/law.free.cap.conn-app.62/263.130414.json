At issue is the board\u2019s decision to grant the defendant Christy\u2019s Market, Inc. (Christy\u2019s), a certificate of approval for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>location of a gasoline station. On appeal, the plaintiff raises the following two part claim: (1) the court improperly concluded that the plaintiff failed to prove aggrievement; and (2) an examination of the record discloses that the board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. In response, the defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> argue, inter alia, that the plaintiff failed to plead aggrievement properly and that the court, consequently, did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the administrative appeal. We affirm the judgment of the trial court on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The record discloses the following facts and procedural history. On April 30, 1997, Christy\u2019s, seeking to construct a gasoline station in Montville, filed an application with the board for a certificate of location approval, as required under General Statutes \u00a7 14-321.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The proposed location, 2191 and 2205 Norwich-New London Turnpike, was diagonally across the street from the plaintiffs property on which there is an operating gasoline station.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">On July 9, 1997, the board conducted a hearing on Christy\u2019s application. Scott F. Hesketh of F. A. Hesketh <em>&amp; </em>Associates, Inc., a civil and traffic engineering firm, testified on behalf of Christy\u2019s and presented a study he had conducted concerning traffic patterns near the proposed site. The study concluded that \u201cthere [were] no serious traffic concerns which must be addressed or which require mitigation in planning for the introduction of the . . . Texaco-Christy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Market at [the proposed] location.\u201d The attorney for Christy\u2019s also testified in support of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The plaintiff, through its attorney, cross-examined Hesketh regarding department of transportation data indicating that there had been nineteen traffic accidents during the past three years in the vicinity of the proposed site. Hesketh testified that the accidents were not indicative of a problem, given the low volume of traffic, and that he had not included the data in his study because the department of transportation had not identified the area as being a \u201cproblem area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The plaintiffs attorney also submitted an assessor\u2019s map (map 103) delineating a \u201cjog\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the Norwich-New London Turnpike near the proposed site. The plaintiff did not provide any other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Thomas Sanders, Montville\u2019s zoning enforcement officer, recommended that the board approve the application. Sanders\u2019 report indicated that the department of transportation had reviewed the proposal, the plans and the traffic study, and had not expressed any specific concerns regarding the location. His report also indicated that, at one time, there had been three gasoline stations in the area and that two of them had since been converted to auto repair facilities. Sanders\u2019 report also stated: \u201cIt appears that since the opening of Mohegan Sun Resorts, the need for gasoline stations has increased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Approximately one month after the board\u2019s hearing, on August 6,1997, the board, finding that the proposed location was appropriate for the sale of gasoline, approved Christy\u2019s application. The board expressly discounted the plaintiffs concerns regarding the jog <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>depicted on map 103. In so doing, the board relied on the map\u2019s notation, \u201cNot to be used for conveyances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On August 25,1997, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the board\u2019s decision, as permitted under General Statutes \u00a7 14-324.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On September 24, 1998, the court conducted a hearing to determine whether the plaintiff was aggrieved, and on March 24, 1999, the court, finding that the plaintiff had failed to meet its burden of proving aggrievement, dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">On April 7, 1999, the plaintiff filed an appeal in this court, along with a petition for certification to appeal, which was granted on May 19,1999. Thereafter, on June 3, 1999, the plaintiff filed a second appeal, which was identical to its first appeal. On July 16,1999, we consolidated the appeals, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-7 (b) (3),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and ordered the parties to brief the issue of whether the plaintiff was required to petition this court for certification to appeal pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 8-8 (o), now (n). Additional facts and procedural histoiy will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The parties complied with our July 16, 1999 order and maintain that the granting by this court of certification to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (o), now (n), was not required. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The plaintiff is challenging an action taken by a zoning board of appeals pursuant to \u00a7 14-321.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 14-324, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>which references \u00a7 14-321, provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person aggrieved by the performance of any act provided for in sections 14-319 to 14-322, inclusive, by the local authority may take an appeal therefrom to the superior court for the judicial district within which such town or city is situated, <em>or in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183 . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 is contained in chapter 54 of the General Statutes, the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA). Section 4-183 creates a right to appeal from a decision of an administrative agency to the Superior Court. The next section of the UAPA, General Statutes \u00a7 4-184, provides: \u201cAn aggrieved party may obtain a review of any final judgment of the Superior Court <em>under this chapter. </em>The appeal shall be taken in accordance with <em>section 51-197b.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 51-197b (d) provides: \u201cExcept as provided in sections 8-8, 8-9 and 22a-43, there shall be a <em>right to further review </em>to the Appellate Court under such rules as the judges of the Appellate Court shall adopt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Regarding administrative appeals, \u00a7 51-197b establishes a right of direct appeal to the Appellate Court from a judgment of the Superior Court. <em>Ensign-Bickford Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>245 Conn. 257, 263, 715 A.2d 701 (1998). That right is qualified, however, by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-8, 8-9 and 22a-43. Our analysis reveals that those three statutes do not apply to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Sections 8-8 and 8-9 are contained in chapter 124 of the General Statutes. Section 8-9 provides: \u201cAppeals from zoning commissions and planning and zoning commissions may be taken to the Superior Court and, <em>upon certification for review, </em>to the Appellate Court in the manner provided in section 8-8.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 8-9 merely establishes a conditional right of appeal to this court from the Superior Court; however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>it applies only when an action taken by a zoning board pursuant to chapter 124 ultimately is challenged. See <em>Berigow </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>116 Conn. 553, 556,165 A. 790 (1933). In the present case, the board acted pursuant to \u00a7 14-321, which is contained in chapter 250, not chapter 124. Consequently, \u00a7 8-8 and \u00a7 8-9 do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Section 22a-43<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is contained in chapter 440 of the General Statutes, the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act, and applies only when a \u201cregulation, order, decision or action made pursuant to sections 22a-36 to 22a-45\u201d is challenged. In the present case, only an action taken pursuant to \u00a7 14-321 is challenged. Therefore, \u00a7 22a-43 does not apply to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Thus, for the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the legislature created a right of direct appeal to this court from the Superior Court when an action taken by a zoning board pursuant to \u00a7 14-321 ultimately is challenged. Accordingly, the plaintiff was not required to obtain from this court certification to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (o), now (n).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Notwithstanding the plaintiffs invitation to consider its two part claim, we turn to the defendants\u2019 argument that the plaintiff failed to plead aggrievement properly. That issue is dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The defendants claim that the facts alleged in the plaintiffs complaint, even if proven, do not constitute aggrievement as a matter of law. Therefore, the defendants assert, the plaintiffs administrative appeal properly was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. That claim, which was raised in the trial court by the defendants and denied by that court, presents a question of law. Consequently, our review is plenary. See <em>Connecticut Associated Builders &amp; Contractors </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>251 Conn. 169, 177, 740 A.2d 813 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Prior to examining the defendants\u2019 claim, it is necessary to set forth the relevant legal principles that govern our analysis. \u201cIn determining the suitability of a proposed location for a gasoline station and [consequently] whether [to] issue a certificate of approval, the zoning board of appeals [acts] as a special statutory agent of the state under \u00a7\u00a7 14-321 and 14-322 of the General Statutes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Haven College, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 540, 542, 227 A.2d 427 (1967). Appeals to the courts from determinations rendered by entities acting as agents of the state exist only under statutory authority. <em>Office of Consumer Counsel </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>234 Conn. 624, 640, 662 A.2d 1251 (1995). There is a statutory right to appeal from determinations by zoning boards concerning certificates of approval for locations of gasoline stations. That right is set forth in \u00a7 14-324.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That section is restrictive, however, in that it allows appeals to be taken only by \u201caggrieved\u201d persons. General Statutes \u00a7 14-324.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that the question of aggrievement is a jurisdictional one . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 65, 475 A.2d 283 (1984). The question of aggrievement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>also \u201ca practical and functional one designed to assure that only those with a genuine and legitimate interest can appeal . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beckish </em>v. <em>Manafort, </em>175 Conn. 415, 419, 399 A.2d 1274 (1978). \u201cPleading and proof of facts that constitute aggrievement are essential prerequisites to the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over an administrative appeal.\u201d <em>New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>226 Conn. 105, 120, 627 A.2d 1257 (1993). \u201cThe trial court must be satisfied, first, that the plaintiff alleges facts which, if proven, would constitute aggrievement as a matter of law . . . .\u201d <em>Beckish </em>v. <em>Manafort, </em>supra, 419; accord <em>New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 122. If the plaintiff fails to allege such facts, the appeal must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u201c[T]he fundamental test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Med-Trans of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health &amp; Addiction Services, </em>242 Conn. 152, 158-59, 699 A.2d 142 (1997). \u201cThe second prong of the aggrievement test requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that its asserted interest has been specially and <em>injuriously </em>affected in a way that is cognizable by law.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 159. In considering whether a plaintiffs interest has been injuriously affected by an administrative decision, our Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Court considers \u201cwhether the injury [the plaintiff] complains of . . . falls within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for [its] complaint.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. A plaintiff claiming aggrievement is required to allege facts that, if proven, would satisfy both prongs of this fundamental test. See <em>New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 120-22; <em>Beckish </em>v. <em>Manafort, </em>supra, 175 Conn. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In the present case, paragraph six of the plaintiffs complaint, which contains its attempt to allege aggrievement, states: \u201c6. Plaintiff is aggrieved by the decision of the Defendant ZBA in one or more of the following respects:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u201ca. The Plaintiff is the owner of land which is within a radius of 100 feet of the land for which the Certificate of Approval was granted by the Defendant ZBA upon the Application of the Defendant Christy\u2019s.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\u201cb. The Plaintiff has a specific personal and legal property interest which was specifically and injuriously affected by the action of the Defendant ZBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\u201cc. The Plaintiffs property has been adversely effected [sic] and has been depreciated in value by virtue of the action of the Defendant ZBA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Our examination of paragraph six of the plaintiffs complaint discloses that the plaintiff failed to allege facts that, if proven, would satisfy the second prong of the aggrievement test. Specifically, the plaintiff failed to allege an injury that falls within the zone of interests protected by the statutory provisions that comprise the legal basis for the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>When the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the board\u2019s decision granting Christy\u2019s a certificate of approval, it was challenging an action taken by the board pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-321<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 14-322. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The sole function of a zoning board of appeals in passing on such applications is to determine whether the site in question is suitable according to specific statutory criteria contained in \u00a7\u00a7 14-321 and 14-322, which are designed to promote and protect public safety. <em>Helfant </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>153 Conn. 93, 95,214 A.2d 371 (1965). \u201cThe determinative question [is] whether the location [is] suitable, \u2018due consideration being given to the proximity of schools, churches, theatres or playhouses or other places of public gatherings, intersecting streets, traffic conditions, width of highway and effect of public travel,\u2019 and whether the proposed use would imperil the safety of the public.\u201d <em>Esso Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>148 Conn. 507, 508, 172 A.2d 607 (1961), quoting General Statutes (Rev. to 1958) \u00a7 14-322. Accordingly, a plaintiff claiming aggrievement by an action taken pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 14-321 and 14-322 must allege an injury that falls within the zone of interests of those statutes. Specifically, the plaintiff must allege that the action was undertaken absent, or in contravention of, a proper determination as to whether a gasoline station on the proposed site would unduly imperil the safety of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Our examination of the factual allegations contained in paragraph six of the plaintiffs complaint discloses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>that the claim of injury does not fall within the zone of interests of \u00a7\u00a7 14-321 and 14-322. Only two facts were alleged by the plaintiff: (1) it owns real estate that is within 100 feet of the site approved for Christy\u2019s gasoline station; and (2) that real estate has been adversely affected and has depreciated in value. The plaintiff does not challenge the board\u2019s determination that the proposed site at 2191 and 2205 Norwich-New London Turnpike was a safe location for Christy\u2019s gasoline station. Instead, the plaintiff merely claims that the site approved for Christy\u2019s gasoline station is close to the plaintiffs property and, consequently, the plaintiff\u2019s property has lost value. Sections 14-321 and 14-322, however, do not require the board to consider the effect a new gasoline station would have on property values, regardless of the proximity of the proposed site to other properties.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, those factual allegations do not give rise to a claim falling within the zone of interests of \u00a7\u00a7 14-321 and 14-322, and, consequently, they do not satisfy the second prong of the aggrievement test.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Finally, the conclusory statements contained in paragraph six of the plaintiffs complaint, i.e., the \u201c[pjlaintiff is aggrieved by the decision of the [defendant,\u201d and \u201c[t]he [p]laintiff has a specific personal and legal property interest which was specifically and injuriously affected by the action of the [defendant,\u201d are of little import to our analysis. Those conclusory statements, which purport to allege aggrievement, are insufficient because adequate factual allegations do not accompany them. See <em>Beckish </em>v. <em>Manafort, </em>supra, 175 Conn. 419. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiff failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>allege facts that, if proven, would constitute aggrievement as a matter of law. The court properly dismissed the plaintiffs appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and there is no need to consider the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\"> The board adopted the brief filed by Christy\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-321 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who desires to obtain a license for the sale of gasoline or any other product, under the provisions of section 14-319, shall first obtain and present to the commissioner a certificate of approval of the location for which such license is desired.
