At the time of the defendant\u2019s criminal misconduct, he had been released on a written promise to appear pending his sentencing on an unrelated criminal conviction. The defendant failed, at trial, to raise any of the issues that he now pursues on appeal. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In the first part of the information, the state charged the defendant, Joseph J. Sanko, Jr., with the commission of two counts of manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56b,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one count of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor or drugs in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 14-227a (a) (l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> one count of evasion of responsibility in the operation of a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-224 (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and one count of interfering with an officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The factual predicate for these charges was the state\u2019s allegation that the defendant, while intoxicated, had driven his motor vehicle so as to cause the death of two young women walking beside a public highway and had then run from the scene of the accident. Except for the count of interfering with an officer, a jury found the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>guilty as charged under the first part of the state\u2019s information.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In the second part of its information, the state alleged that, if the defendant was convicted of the charges alleged in the first part of the information, he should be sentenced in accordance with the enhanced penalty provisions of \u00a7 53a-40b. The second part of the information was based on the state\u2019s representation that the alleged criminal acts had occurred while the defendant was free on a written promise to appear following his conviction of another crime. Agreeing with the state, the court concluded that the defendant was subject to an enhanced penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Applying \u00a7 53a-40b, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of imprisonment for thirty-five and one-half years, suspended after twenty-six and one-half years, with probation of five years. The defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">In this court, the defendant challenges both the validity of his manslaughter conviction and the propriety of the enhanced sentence ordered by the court. We are not persuaded of the merits of any of his unpreserved claims of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">INSTRUCTIONS ON MANSLAUGHTER</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">The defendant challenges the validity of his manslaughter conviction only with respect to three alleged misstatements in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. Because the defendant failed to raise any of these issues at trial, he is entitled to a review of their merits only if he properly can invoke the special rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239-40. \u201cThe first two <em>Golding </em>requirements involve whether the claim is reviewable, and the second two involve whether there was constitutional error requiring a new trial. . . . This court may dispose of the claim on any one of the conditions that the defendant does not meet.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Heredia, </em>253 Conn. 543, 559-60, 754 A.2d 114 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial with respect to his manslaughter conviction because the court improperly instructed the jury on (1) the elements of the crime of manslaughter concerning the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of \u201cintoxicating liquor and drugs and both,\u201d (2) proximate cause and (3) the significance of the defendant\u2019s mental, physical or nervous processes. Because none of these alleged defects in the court\u2019s instructions warrants <em>Golding </em>review, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The defendant claims that the court improperly advised the jury that it could find him guilty of violating \u00a7 53a-56b if it found that he had been operating his motor vehicle while under the influence of either liquor or drugs, contrary to the information, which alleged that he had operated \u201ca motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor <em>and </em>drugs.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In its instruction to the jury on the manslaughter charges, the court advised the jury to disregard the conjunctive language of the state\u2019s information and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>convict if it found that the defendant had been driving \u201cunder the influence of <em>either drugs or </em>alcohol.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant concedes that there was an abundance of evidence proving that he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, but claims that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he was under the influence of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">This claim of instructional impropriety is not a claim of constitutional magnitude and therefore does not permit <em>Golding </em>review. \u201c[A] factual insufficiency regarding one statutory basis, which is accompanied by a general verdict of guilty that also covers another, factually supported basis, is not a federal due process violation.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>229 Conn. 529, 539, 643 A.2d 1213 (1994); see <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>502 U.S. 46, 112 S. Ct. 466, 116 L. Ed. 2d 371 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on proximate cause. He maintains that the instructions were so misleading that they violated his due process rights. We find no <em>Golding </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The defendant argues that \u00a7 53a-56b does not require any instruction on proximate cause. This court has ruled to the contrary in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kwaak, </em>21 Conn. App. 138, 144, 572 A.2d 1015, cert, denied, 215 Conn. 811, 576 A.2d 540 (1990). Under <em>Kwaak, </em>the court must inform the jury that the state has the burden of proving that the defendant\u2019s unlawful conduct was a proximate cause of the death of the victim. Id., 144-46.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An accu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>rate jury instruction cannot be the basis for a showing that the defendant was \u201cclearly deprived ... of a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly defined the phrase \u201cunder the influence\u201d in \u00a7 53a-56b and that the jury was likely to have been misled by the court\u2019s improper instructions. According to the defendant, because the statute does not state that mental state is an element of the crime, the court improperly instructed the jury to consider his mental state at the time of the offense. Furthermore, he argues that the court misled the jury by giving it disparate instructions about the meaning of \u201coperating under the influence\u201d under the manslaughter statute and under the statute penalizing driving while intoxicated. Again, we are persuaded that the defendant has not raised a claim that is reviewable under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The court instructed the jury that, to convict the defendant under the manslaughter statute, it had to find that the defendant, \u201cas a result of drinking such [intoxicating] beverage or introducing such drug or both into his system, his mental, physical or nervous processes have become so affected that he lacks to an appreciable degree the ability to function properly in relation to the operation of his motor vehicle.\u201d This instruction was substantially similar to instructions that were approved in <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>108 Conn. 209, 216, 142 A. 840 (1928), and its progeny. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>11 Conn. App. 122, 129, 525 A.2d 1374, cert, denied, 205 Conn. 806, 531 A.2d 939 (1987). When the court repeated this basic instruction with respect to the count of operating under the influence, it used the same language except for a minor addition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>the objections belatedly raised to the court\u2019s instructions fail to demonstrate any impropriety whatsoever, we repeat our earlier observation that an accurate jury instruction cannot be the basis for a showing that a challenged court ruling \u201cclearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">ENHANCED PENALTY</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that, even if his manslaughter conviction is affirmed, his sentencing violated his constitutional rights to due process. He maintains that it was unconstitutional for the court to determine, without a jury hearing, that the defendant was subject to an enhanced penalty pursuant to \u00a7 53a-40b. See footnote 1. Although this claim also was unpreserved at trial, it warrants further inquiry because it poses a constitutional question that the courts of this state have not previously decided. We conclude that the court acted properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The defendant argues that a jury hearing was constitutionally required (1) to enable him to obtain an evidentiary finding about his legal status when he committed the manslaughters and (2) to determine the applicability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>of the enhanced penalty statute under the factual circumstances found by the jury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The defendant cannot prevail on the first claim because of admissions that he made at trial. At the sentencing hearing held by the court, the defendant\u2019s counsel conceded that the manslaughters had occurred while the defendant was released on a written promise to appear following a conviction of an unrelated crime. The defendant has proffered no reason why an evidentiary hearing is required in the absence of a factual dispute. He cites no authority for that proposition, and we know of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The defendant likewise cannot prevail on the second claim in light of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>v. <em>United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S. Ct. 1219, 140 L. Ed. 2d 350 (1998), and <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Those cases hold that a jury hearing is not required for an enhanced sentence based on a prior conviction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">We recognize that the text of \u00a7 53a-40b, reprinted in footnote 1, does not refer expressly to a prior conviction as a predicate act that triggers an enhanced penalty. It focuses, instead, on the status of the defendant at the time when the defendant committed a second crime. In this case, the status of the defendant at that time was that, after conviction of the first crime, he had been released on a written promise to appear. This set of facts surely demonstrates the applicability of \u00a7 53a-40b. We need not decide today what the reach of the statute may be under other circumstances. In most cases, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>not in all, a defendant\u2019s status under the statute arises out of some antecedent encounter with the criminal justice system. The record of that antecedent encounter is a judicial record of which a court may take judicial notice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>228 Conn. 487, 497, 636 A.2d 840 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, therefore, decisions of the United States Supreme Court provide guidance on the due process rights that must be safeguarded in enhanced penalty proceedings following prior convictions. We find persuasive the recent discussion of this issue in the two recent cases cited previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to having been found in the United States after he had been deported as the result of his commission of three aggravated felonies. Although the maximum sentence for his present crime was two years in prison, under the federal enhanced penalty statute, his prior convictions exposed him to a sentence of up to twenty years. <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 523 U.S. 227-29. The Supreme Court upheld the District Court\u2019s decision to subject the defendant to an enhanced penalty without giving him the benefit of a jury hearing. Id., 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">More recently, in <em>Apprendi, </em>the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed its ruling in <em>AlmendarezTorres. </em>It concluded that, under the United States constitution, <em>\u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">In language particularly germane to this case, the Supreme Court observed the following: \u201cBoth the certainty that procedural safeguards attached to any \u2018fact\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>of prior conviction, and the reality that [the defendant] did not challenge the accuracy of that \u2018fact\u2019 in his case, <em>mitigated the due process and Sixth Amendment concerns otherwise implicated in allowing a judge to determine a \u2018fact\u2019 increasing punishment beyond the maximum of the statutory range.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 488. On this record as well, the defendant has conceded the fact of his prior conviction and, as far as we can tell, has failed to pursue appellate review of that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the court had constitutional authority to decide, without empaneling a jury, that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction triggered an enhanced penalty under \u00a7 53a-40b. In the absence of any constitutional impropriety, there is no basis for <em>Golding </em>review of the defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-40b provides: \u201cA person convicted of an offense committed while released pursuant to sections 54-63a to 54-63g, inclusive, or sections 54-64a to 54-64c, inclusive, may be sentenced, in addition to the sentence prescribed for the offense to (1) a term of imprisonment of not more than ten years if the offense is a felony, or (2) a term of imprisonment of not more than one year if the offense is a misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56b provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle when, while operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both, he causes the death of another person as a consequence of the effect of such liquor or drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u201c(b) Manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle is a class C felony and the court shall suspend the motor vehicle operator\u2019s license or nonresident operating privilege of any person found guilty under this section for one year.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b59-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both.

We decline to review this state constitutional claim because it is inadequately briefed.
