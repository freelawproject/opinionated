We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">\u201cIn a habeas appeal, although this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous, our review of whether the facts as found by the habeas court constituted a violation of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel is plenary.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>58 Conn. App. 169, 170, 752 A.2d 1159 (2000), citing <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>36 Conn. App. 695, 700, 652 A.2d 1050, cert, denied, 233 Conn. 912, 659 A.2d 183 (1995). \u201cFaced with a habeas court\u2019s denial of a petition for certification to appeal, a petitioner can obtain appellate review of the dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus only by satisfying the two-pronged test enunciated by our Supreme Court in <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden; </em>229 Conn. 178, 640 A.2d 601 (1994), and adopted in <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608,612,646 A.2d 126 (1994). First, he must demonstrate that the denial of his petition for certification constituted an abuse of discretion. . . . Second, if the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>tioner can show an abuse of discretion, he must then prove that the decision of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Petaway </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>49 Conn. App. 75, 77, 712 A.2d 992 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\u201cTo prove an abuse of discretion, the petitioner must demonstrate that the [resolution of the underlying claim involves issues that] are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reddick </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>51 Conn. App. 474, 477, 722 A.2d 286 (1999). \u201cFor the petitioner to prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must establish both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel\u2019s mistakes, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 58 Conn. App. 170, citing <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984); <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 444, 445, 610 A.2d 598 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In the present case, the habeas court based its dismissal of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus on a review of the petitioner\u2019s claims and the evidence presented. The petitioner\u2019s trial counsel testified that it was his standard practice to inform a defendant that he must serve 85 percent of his sentence before he would be eligible for parole, if in fact that were the case. The petitioner testified that his counsel mistakenly had informed him that he would be eligible for parole after serving only 50 percent of his sentence. In its memorandum of decision, the habeas court credited counsel\u2019s testimony and rejected the petitioner\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, the habeas court concluded that the petitioner failed to carry the burden of proof required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>establish that his counsel had provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">\u201cThis court does not retry the case or evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Rather, we must defer to the [trier of fact\u2019s] assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude. ... In a case that is tried to the court . . . the judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses, and the weight to be given to their specific testimony.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wieler </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>47 Conn. App. 59, 61, 702 A.2d 1195, cert, denied, 243 Conn. 957, 704 A.2d 806 (1997). Thus, the petitioner cannot successfully challenge the habeas court\u2019s decision to credit counsel\u2019s testimony and to reject his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Having reviewed the record and the briefs, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to make a substantial showing that he was denied a state or federal constitutional right. Furthermore, the petitioner has failed to sustain his burden of establishing that the denial of certification to appeal was a clear abuse of discretion or that an injustice has been done. See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 612; <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 189. Therefore, we conclude that the habeas court had before it sufficient evidence to find as it did and that it did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-13\"> On April 23, 1998, the trial court accepted the petitioner\u2019s plea of guilty to the following four charges: (1) assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60; (2) risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21; (3) assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61; and (4) failure to appear in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-172. On May 28, 1998, the court imposed a total effective sentence of twenty-seven months of incarceration. The petitioner did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-5\"> General Statutes (Kev. to 1997) \u00a7 54-125a (b) provides in relevant part: \u201c(1) No person convicted of any of the following offenses, which was committed on or after July 1, 1981, shall be eligible for parole under subsection (a) of this section: Capital felony, as defined in section 53a-54b, felony murder, as defined in section 53a-54c, arson murder, as defined in section 53a-54d, murder, as defined in section 53a-54a, or any offense committed with a firearm, as defined in <em>section </em>53a-3, in or on, or within one thousand five hundred feet of, the real property comprising a public or private elementary or secondary school.
