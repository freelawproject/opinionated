We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>The facts necessary for a disposition of this appeal, taken from the parties\u2019 oral stipulation, are as follows. The defendant\u2019s motor vehicle operator\u2019s license was suspended by the commissioner of motor vehicles (commissioner) from February 21, 1998, through August 21,1998. The commissioner sent notice of such suspension by bulk certified mail to the defendant and his attorney on February 19, 1998. During the period of suspension, the defendant was stopped by Groton police while operating a motor vehicle on a public highway in that town and charged with operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The defendant argues that, although notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision could be sent by bulk certified mail, such a mailing would not constitute statutory notice to the operator that his license had been suspended and, therefore, he could not be convicted of violating \u00a7 14-215 (c). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">This appeal requires an understanding of the terms \u201cbulk certified mail\u201d and \u201ccertified mail.\u201d When \u201ca letter is sent by certified mail, a record exists of both the mailing of the letter by the sender and its receipt by the recipient, who must sign for the letter. ... If a letter is sent by bulk mail certified a record exists of only the fact that it was mailed by the sender and not of its receipt by the recipient, since the recipient\u2019s signature is not required.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Yanni </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>31 Conn. App. 350, 356, 624 A.2d 1175 (1993) <em>(Lavery, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Prior to its amendment by the legislature in 1993, General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (g) required that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>missioner send notice of his decision by certified mail. The 1993 amendment inserted the word \u201cbulk\u201d before the expression \u201ccertified mail\u201d where it first appears in \u00a7 14-227b (g).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The notice requirement now appeal\u2019s in subsection (h) of \u00a7 14-227b, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he commissioner shall render a decision at the conclusion of such hearing or send a notice of the decision by bulk certified mail to such person .... The notice of such decision sent by certified mail . . . shall be sufficient notice to such person that such person\u2019s operator\u2019s license . . . is . . . suspended . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">A plain reading of the statute shows that the notice of \u201csuch decision\u201d refers back to the notice that the prior sentence mandated be sent by bulk certified mail. If the notice is not sufficient to inform the operator that his license has been suspended, then Public Acts 1993, No. 93-371, \u00a7 1, which inserted the word \u201cbulk\u201d before the expression \u201ccertified mail,\u201d was auseless act, and the inserted word is meaningless. That construction would violate the principle that \u201c[statutes should not be construed so that words, phrases or clauses are rendered meaningless.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. Warden, 34 Conn. App. 503, 509, 642 A.2d 724, cert, denied, 230 Conn. 908, 644 A.2d 922 (1994). Moreover, it would produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>a bizarre result if we interpreted the statute to require the commissioner to send notice of his decision by bulk mail, but then to say that if the commissioner wants his decision to have any effect on the operator that he must also send a second notice by individual certified mail. \u201c[T]here is a presumption that the legislature intends to accomplish a reasonable and rational result rather than a difficult and possibly bizarre one.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 27, 670 A.2d 851 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">This is not the first time that the Connecticut courts have considered this question. In <em>Yanni </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 350, we held that the operator therein could not prevail on his claim that the commissioner\u2019s mailing of the suspension notice by bulk certified mail rather than by certified mail invalidated the operator\u2019s suspension. The plaintiff in this case argues that <em>Yanni </em>is not dispositive because it was an appeal from an administrative decision rather than a criminal prosecution, as is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>245 Conn. 442, 718 A.2d 1 (1998), destroyed any validity that the defendant\u2019s argument might have had. <em>Swain </em>was a criminal prosecution involving a charge of operation of a motor vehicle while the operator\u2019s license was under suspension in violation of \u00a7 14-215. In <em>Swain, </em>our Supreme Court rejected a claim that imposition of criminal sanctions mandated notice by certified mail so as to assure that the operator had actual knowledge of the suspension. Id., 462-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">The defendant\u2019s argument also ignores <em>State </em>v. <em>Torma, </em>21 Conn. App. 496, 501, 574 A.2d 828 (1990), in which this court held that notice by bulk certified mail was sufficient. <em>Torma </em>was based on General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>\u00a7 14-111 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which establishes the powers of the commissioner. That statute expressly provides that notice of the commissioner\u2019s decisions by bulk certified mail is sufficient. Section 14-111 (a) is also applicable to this case. The 1993 amendment of \u00a7 14-227b (g) brought that statute into line with \u00a7 14-111 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The court\u2019s oral decision recites that if the case went to the jury, it would instruct the jury to the effect that the state must show a mailing by certified mail. Such an instruction would be contrary to existing case law and the plain language of the statute. We conclude that the court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (c) provides: \u201cAny person who operates any motor vehicle during the period his operator\u2019s license or right to operate a motor vehicle in this state is under suspension or revocation on account of a violation of subsection (a) of section 14-227a or section 53a-56b or 53a-60d or pursuant to section 14-227b, shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars and imprisoned not more than one year, and, in the absence of any mitigating circumstances as determined by the court, thirty consecutive days of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced in any manner.
