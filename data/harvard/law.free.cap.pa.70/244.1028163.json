Hutchinson and George II. Cutler. By the will of John Scott, dated February 26th 1861, he revolted all wills, \u201cand particularly a certain will and testament (in form as a deed), &amp;c., witnessed by Miron Hutchinson and George H. Cutler. And I hereby give and assign as the reason of revoking and making void said will, that my son, John W. Scott, and his wife have failed to treat me with filial affection, and to comply with the conditions upon which I made said will. I give and bequeath, &amp;c. * * * Subject to the above, I give and bequeath all my personal property and real estate of whatever name and nature and wheresoever situated to my daughters Nancy Holliday, Anna Sanford and Parney P.

Subsequently to November 22d 1849, John Scott made a deed of the premises to Abner Scott in trust for himself and the daughters of John Scott.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-8\">The plaintiff went into possession with the grantor under the instrument of November 22d 1849. Upon the allegation that the plaintiff had not complied with his agreement to work the farm, &amp;c., the grantor left the premises, brought an action of ejectment and under it recovered the possession, and whilst in possession made his will as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-9\">' After his death the devisees in the will went into possession under it; the plaintiff brought an ejectment against them and recovered the possession (Perry <em>v. </em>Scott, 1 P. F. Smith 119). The devisees afterwards brought an ejectment against the plaintiff in which they recovered a judgment on the ground that the instrument of November 22d 1849, was a testamentary writing and revocable, and had been revoked by John Scott\u2019s will (Turner <em>v. </em>Scott, 1 P. F. Smith 126). On this judgment an habere facias was issued and the devisees put into possession. This action was then brought on the covenant of warranty in the instrument of Novem-\u2018 her 22d 1849.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-10\">The defendant\u2019s 4th point was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-11\">The will of John Scott being the mere expression of the desire of the testator, and of a later date than the instrument under which plaintiff claimed, cannot constitute such paramount title as to be the foundation of an action of covenant for breach of the warranty, and the quit-claim deed of a later date offered in evidence would not constitute such breach.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-12\">The court answered: \u2014 \u201c In answer to the defendant\u2019s 4th point we say, the will and deed made subsequently to the 22d day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>of November 1849, are a breach of the covenant contained in the instrument dated November 22d 1849.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\">The defendant\u2019s 10th point, which was negatived, was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-7\">\u201c The covenant of warranty only warranted the possession after the death of John Scott; there could be no breach of the covenant during his life.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-8\">There was much evidence in the case and several questions of law raised; \u2014 what is above given will sufficiently illustrate the decision of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-9\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $6146.50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-10\">The defendant took a writ of error and assigned for error (amongst others), the answers to his 4th and 10th points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-11\"><em>S.

Scott against the executor of John Scott, upon the covenant of John Scott, made the 22d day of November 1849, which was broken by John Scott in his lifetime, and fully performed and kept by John W. Scott on his part ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">The covenant referred to, that upon which this action is based, is contained in an instrument of writing, which, though in form a deed, was held by this court, in Turner <em>v. </em>Scott, 1 P. F. Smith 126, to be a last will and testament, and, therefore, ambulatory until the death of the testator, and revocable and actually revoked by his subsequent will, dated February 2d 1861.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">How can an action be sustained on a revocable and revoked instrument ?</p>\n<p id=\"b247-17\">It is settled, indeed, by the best authority in the law, that an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>press warranty cannot be created without a deed, and a will in writing is no deed, and, therefore, an express warranty cannot be created by will: Coke\u2019s Litt., 386 <em>a. </em>If a warranty cannot be so created, it follows that a covenant of warranty cannot; for the one necessarily follows the nature of the other. But even admitting that there was a subsisting covenant, there was no breach of it by John Scott, which would subject him to an action upon it, in his lifetime, or his executors after his death. By the very terms of the instrument he had the right of possession during his life, \u201cit was in no way to take effect until after the death of the said John Scott.\u201d To sustain an action upon a covenant of warranty, there must be either an actual or constructive eviction by title paramount. The learned judge below, in his answer to the defendant\u2019s fourth point, instructed the jury that the will and deed of John Scott, made subsequently to the 22d November 1849, was a breach of the covenant contained in the instrument dated November 22d 1849. No authority has been or can be cited to support the position that a deed or will subsequently made by a grantor is itself a breach of the covenant of warranty contained in his conveyance, more especially when such deed or will is a lawful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">All the authorities are the other way: Clark <em>v. </em>McAnulty, 3 S. &amp; R. 364; Paul <em>v. </em>Witman, 3 W. &amp; S. 407; Rawle on Covenants of Title 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b248-8\">Agnew, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
