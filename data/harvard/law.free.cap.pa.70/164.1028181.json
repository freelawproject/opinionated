The William Kineer tract was sold for the taxes by the sheriff of Huntingdon county, to John Blair, on the 10th of January 1806, and the James Kineer tract sold by the treasurer of Huntingdon county for the taxes on the 13th of April 1817, to Nicholas Lefevre.

J.) charged: * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-15\">[\u201c It was objected, when the evidence of the plaintiffs was offered of the tax-sale of the Kineer tracts, that made prior to the Act of 1815, it was necessary to the validity of the tax-title for the party asserting or setting it up, to show a strict compliance with all the requirements or directory provisions of the Act of Assembly under which the assessment and sale were made. This is true when the tax-title is set up against the title of the warrants ; but the rule, it is equally well settled and understood, is only applicable in that case, and is not available when set up by an intruder, that is, by one claiming by improvement or the Statute of Limitations. And such is the attitude of defendants here. Their defence, so far as it asserts title in them, rests it upon their entry and possession, if we except the claim resting on the paper purporting to evidence a sale to Charles Johnston by Wm. W. Jackson, of about 40 acres, on the 17th August 1854, in relation to which it is sufficient, as it respects this question, to say that the setting of it up here is an acknowledgment of the prior title of Jackson; and it is distinctly proven that Johnston never claimed any land embraced in this paper before its date.] So that we repeat the plaintiffs have exhibited evidence of title which entitles them to your verdict, unless some sufficient defence has been shown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-16\">\u201c The defence is threefold: first, that as it respects the two Kineer tracts, the tax-sale was void, for the reason, as alleged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>that these tracts were not, when assessed and sold, in'Hunting-don. county. * * * Third, that they are entitled to hold the 40 acres, or thereabouts, alleged to have been purchased by Charles Johnston from William W. Jackson the 17th of August 1854.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-6\">\u201c Have the defendants established in point of fact the first proposition relied upon in defence \u2014 that the Kineer tracts, at the time of the assessment and sale of them for taxes, were in Somerset, and not in Huntingdon county ? If so, the assessment and sale were unauthorized and void, and vested no title in the purchaser. It has been urged that it is only an irregularity in the sale of which no one but the warrantee could avail himself; but we are constrained to think it more than a mere irregularity. Still the action of the officers of Huntingdon county in this respect is to be regarded as correct until the contrary be shown. * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-7\">\u201c If, on the other hand, the defendants have satisfied you that the Kineer tracts were not in Huntingdon county when assessed and sold, then the plaintiffs cannot, for that reason, recover that portion of the land unless it appears that Johnston entered under Jackson, in which case it would be entirely immaterial whether the Kineer tracts, from 1802 to 1805, or 1806, even lay in Huntingdon or Somerset county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-8\">\u201c It is alleged by the plaintiffs that Johnston did so enter and hold under Jackson, and as there is here this dependence and connection between those two questions we have introduced, and considered the evidence as to the manner in which Johnston entered and held, * * * have the defendants made out a defence by contract of August 17th 1854, under Charles Johnston?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-9\">\u201c This paper is no evidence to establish a contract. It amounts to nothing unless it was satisfied, or money paid and accepted by Thomas Jackson. Whether this was so or not, depends upon the testimony of W. W. Jackson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-10\">[\u201c If Jackson is believed, the defendants are entitled to hold the land described in the contract contained in the paper according to the terms of it, that is, which the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover; the verdict as to this part would be conditional\u2014 in other words, with respect to this part of the land (if other defences fail), a verdict for the plaintiffs to be released as to this part, on the payment of the balance of the purchase-money, in such time as the jury may fix. If the jury do not believe W. W. Jackson (if the defence on the other points fail), your verdict will be a-general verdict for the plaintiff. Whether you believe W. W. Jackson or not, your verdict as to this question will be for the plaintiffs, in one ease \u2014 that is, if you believe him, a conditional verdict; \u2014 in the other; if you do not believe him, a verdict without any condition, or a general verdict.\u201d] * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-11\">The verdict was \u201c for the plaintiffs for the land described in the writ. That portion of it embodied and described as in the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ment of W. W. Jackson, agent of Thomas Jackson, dated August 17th 1854, to be released on payment of $230 in one year with interest from this date.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-6\">The defendants took a writ of error, and assigned for error the portions of the charge in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-7\"><em>S.

This was overruled in Waln <em>v. </em>Shearman, 8 S. &amp; R. 357, on account of the supposed hardship of requiring the former owner to bring his action of ejectment against a vacant possession, and it was therein held that the limitation ran only from the time actual possession had been taken by the purchaser at the tax-sale. But the Act of 29th March 1824 removed this difficulty, and it is now the settled law that the limitation of five years begins to run from- the time of the delivery of the deed to the purchaser under the tax-sale. After that moment the former owner can bring his action under the provisions of the Act of 1824, whether the possession be vacant or not: Robb <em>v. </em>Bowen, 9 Barr 71; Sheik <em>v. </em>McElroy, 8 Harris 25; Burd\u2019s Ex\u2019rs. <em>v. </em>Patterson, 10 Id. 219; Iddings <em>v. </em>Cairns, 2 Grant 88. This, therefore, is a full answer to the errors assigned to the charge of the court on the subject of the tax-titles. The first sale took place in 1806, and the second in 1817, while John Johnston, the father of the defendants, did not enter into the possession until the year 1837, and then he entered as an intruder, without color of title. Thus entering, after the five years were fully ended, and without color of title, the case does not fall within that class of cases which rule that the purchaser- at the tax-sale under the Act of 1804 must prove all the prerequisites to make the sale good under that act. The learned judge below was therefore right in saying that the plaintiffs had shown a good title under the tax-sales against the defendants, and could recover \u00fanless prevented by the other defences set up. He was right also in his instructions upon the alleged contract for the sale of the 40 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">Finding no error in the record,</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
