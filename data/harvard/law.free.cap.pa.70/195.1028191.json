That the testimony of Alexander Mestrezatt, which is the only evidence in the case on the subject of other matters embraced in the submission than those mentioned in the written submission, is too vague, uncertain and indefinite to enlarge the submission so as to embrace matters and things not mentioned in the written submission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-12\">2. That the written submission being only for the settlement of the accounts between William South and Ruhama South, an award under such submission, which includes two notes of hand, and declares that the defendant shall deliver to Ruhama South and Ann South 18 head of cattle, which cattle have since been taken from the defendant in pursuance of said award, is not warranted by the submission, is an excess of authority by the referees, and is illegal and void, and no action can be sustained thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-13\">8. That this suit being on a submission and award alleged to be in writing, it is incompetent for the plaintiff to prove that though the cattle were not included in the submission, it was afterwards submitted by parol, .and that the jury should disregard the evidence on the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-14\">The court answered:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-15\">\u201c1. We answer that if the evidence of Mestrezatt is believed and is sufficiently explicit to satisfy and inform you that it was agreed that the notes should be passed upon by the referees, then the adjudication of the referees is conclusive as to the amount found to plaintiff\u2019s intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-16\">\u201c 2. The award will be good under the submission, for the notes and the amount found by the referees, if the evidence be believed as to the enlargement of the submission. But we hold that in order to include the delivery of the cattle, you must be satisfied that the parties agreed that the referees should adjudicate upon the matter. But be that as it may, it will not affect the finding for the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>in the award. It will only affect the ownership to the cattle, and whether the defendant can bring in the value of the cattle as payment of the award.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-6\">\u201c 8. We say that it was competent to submit the decision of the cattle to the referees, but whether it was done or not, would not affect the money finding but only have a bearing upon the case as payment of the award.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-7\">The court further charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-8\">\u201cWe have answered to points submitted to us that the terms of the submission itself were sufficient to allow the referees to adjudicate upon the note, which plaintiff\u2019s intestate held against the defendant. This we wish you to understand, and that [it was not necessary to enlarge the terms of the submission by parol to include the settlement of these notes between the parties.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-9\">\u201c As to the cattle it seems to have been altogether another matter, a new item is introduced and was passed upon by the referees, and as it appears, if the evidence is believed, belonged to the defendant. His agent, Squire Maple, argued as he says, the ownership of the cattle, hut made no objection to the jurisdiction of the referees. This is as we gather the substance of his evidence, but this is for you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-10\">\u201c [But suppose the referees went beyond their power in passing upon the ownership and division of the cattle. We can\u2019t see what bearing it should have upon the award under the submission. It might have been that it was the partition of the cattle, as counsel argue, which in some measure regulated the award. We have no evidence of this and mere supposition will not answer.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-11\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $832.50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-12\">The defendant took out a writ of error and assigned for error the admission of the plaintiff\u2019s offers of evidence that were objected to; the answers to the points, and the parts of the charge in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A2c\">R. <em>Downey &amp; Son, </em>for plaintiff in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqx\">The submission and award do not agree as they should, with the allegations in the declaration: Clark <em>v. </em>Partridge, 2 Barr 13; Irwin <em>v. </em>Shoemaker, 8 W. &amp; S. 76; Bank <em>v. </em>Fordyce, 1 Barr 456.

The submission is to be construed so as to effectuate the intention of the parties; Worrall\u2019s Accounts, 5 W. &amp; S. 111.

G. Yanvoorhis and Aaron Shelby, to be examined and tried by them after hearing the evidence, and give their award, we the undersigned, do agree and bind ourselves to abide by their decision as final.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The award signed by the three arbitrators is dated the 11th April 1860, and appears to have been annexed to the submission, and is in these words: \u201c We the within-named arbitrators, chosen by the within-named parties to amicably settle the running accounts of Ruhama South and William South, after examining the same, we do find William South indebted to Ruhama South five hundred dollars, including two notes of hand; note 1 dated January 7th 1856, note 2 dated April 10th 1859, to Job South, and by him transferred to Ruhama South, and the said William South to deliver up to Ruhama and Ann South, the eighteen head of cattle that divided and fell to their share, and that each of the parties jay their own costs.\u201d By the terms of the submission, the referees met at the house of the mother, Ruhama, on Monday the 9th April 1860.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">After the death of Mrs. South her administrators, Charles A. Mestrezatt and Dissiway South, brought this suit upon the award, a.nd the <em>narr. </em>stated it to be an award for five hundred dollars, and on the 17th May 1871, a verdict was rendered for the plaintiffs for $832.50, being the amount of the award, with upwards of eleven years\u2019 interest, strictly calculated, upon which judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">\u201c A submission by specialty,\u201d says Chief Justice Gibson, \u201c may be altered by parol; and whether altered or not it is to be construed largely.\u201d The portion of the award sued upon is clearly within the terms of the submission, and the remaining portion not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>covered by it is simply void, and as an award may be good in part and bad in part, it is void only <em>pro tanto. </em>The award, therefore, is good so far as sued upon, and the verdict and judgment were right.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">This view disposes of the whole question.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
