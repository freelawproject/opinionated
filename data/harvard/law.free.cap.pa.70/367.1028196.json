The natural watercourse for some distance below the dam also passes through the plaintiffs\u2019 land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-14\">The dam and race so divided the part of the land which was not granted with the mill and which was now the plantation of the plaintiff, as to cut off one part of it .from access to the other, and deprive that part entirely from the use of water; the dam and race being between the part thus cut off from water and the part, of the stream which passed through his land below the stream.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-15\">The borough of West Chester constructed works at about the upper part of the dam for the purpose of diverting the water for use of the town ; they then purchased \u201c the fulling-mill\u201d tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-16\">The rights of the respective parties were as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u201c The plaintiff\u2019s farm was part of a tract containing 353J acres, patented October 13th 1735, to David Davis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-6\">\u201cBy deed of the 14th June 1742, recited in the subsequent deeds, David Davis and wife, in consideration of natural love and affection to their son, Ellis Davis, &amp;c., conveyed to him 106 acres of the same tract lying on its easternmost side and extending the whole breadth of the tract from north to south, with a fulling-mill thereon, and the race or watercourse thereunto belonging, and the bank to contain one perch in breadth. This deed does not refer to a dam.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-7\">\u201c David Davis afterwards died intestate, seised of the remainder of tract, leaving eight children, Ellis Davis above named being one; in 1755, these children conveyed their undivided interests in this remainder to Ellis, who thus became the owner of the whole of the original tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-8\">\u201c He died intestate, seised of the original tract, leaving nine children, viz.: Ellis Davis (the second), who was the eldest, George Davis and seven others. On the 15th of the Fifth month 1787, Ellis Davis (who under the intestate laws then existing, was entitled to two shares), with his wife conveyed to his brother, George Davis, another of the heirs, his share in the fulling-mill tract as containing 100 acres, \u2018 together also with their two full equal undivided tenth parts of the mill-dam and race on the several courses as they now run, and have heretofore been in use for the mills through the upper plantation, late of Ellis Davis, deceased (of which said upper plantation with the appurtenances, the aforesaid Ellis Davis and Jane his wife, party to these presents, being seised in fee, to and in two full equal undivided tenth parts thereof), and all the land now drowned and occupied by said dam and race, or that has been drowned by the same, with the full and uninterrupted right and use of all the water falling into the said dam and race, to be conveyed along the same, a,nd privilege to dig on the banks to repair small breaches, to pass and repass with workmen, teams, carts or other carriages to haul stone, &amp;c., to and from the said described tract, &amp;c., to repair and cleanse the said dam and race, or either of them as occasion may require; likewise each and every of their several equal undivided one-tenth part of a certain water and watercourse running through the upper plantation used on the north side of the meadow, two days in every week for the use of the. said George Davis on the meadow of the hereby granted premises, the said George Davis, his heirs and assigns, being at a proportionable part of the expense of procuring and bringing the water through the plantation late of Ellis Haines, now John Wagner, as heretofore has been in use. Also, the full right of the said Ellis Davis, and Jane his wife, of and in a small spring of water and dam, heretofore in use on the south side of the meadow, issuing on and out of the said upper planta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>tion, to be solely used by the said George Davis, for the benefit of the hereby granted premises, with the privilege to cleanse and repair said dam and watercourse as occasion may require. To have and to hold the said full, equal and undivided tenth part of and in the said described messuage, &amp;c., and all other the hereditaments and premises hereby granted, or mentioned to be granted with the appurtenances, unto the said George Davis and his heirs, to the use of him, the said George Davis, his heirs and assigns for ever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-6\">\u201c On the 13th day of the Sixth month 1789, George Dunn and wife, &amp;c., the other heirs of Ellis Davis (second), conveyed- their interest in the mill tract to George Davis, with the same clauses as to the dam, race, &amp;c., as those above stated, except that as to the small spring and dam.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-7\">\u201c On the 23d of May 1791, the heirs of Ellis Davis (first) conveyed 68 acres on the south side to Isaac Haines; and on the same day, the same heirs, including George Davis, who was then owner of the fulling-mill tract, conveyed the remainder (that now owned by Hannum, the plaintiff) to Ezra Hoopes, with the following exception: \u2018 Except a privilege conveyed to the said George Davis, by the grantors to these presents, in their indenture to him, bearing date the 12th day of Sixth month, a. d. 1789, viz.: their rights to the mill-dam and race or watercourse, as they now run, and have heretofore been in use for the mill, and all the land now drowned and occupied by said dam and race, or that has usually been drowned by the same, with full and uninterrupted right and use of all the water falling into the said dam and race, to be conveyed along the same, -and privilege to dig on the banks to repair small breaches, to pass and repass with workmen, teams, carts and other carriages, to haul stone, &amp;c., to and from the plantation of the said George Davis, to repair and cleanse said dam and race, or either of them as occasion may require, with the least damage possible, &amp;c.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-8\">\u201cEzra Hoopes, by his will proved in 1811, devised this plantation to his sons Curtis Hoopes and Moses Hoopes; and in 1812 Moses Hoopes conveyed his interest to Curtis Hoopes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-9\">\u201c On the 13th of April 1853, Curtis Hoopes conveyed the tract to Samuel Hannum, the plaintiff in error, \u2018 subject to the privilege granted by George Dunn and wife, and others, by their indenture, bearing date the 13th day of the Sixth month, A. d. 1789, of the right to the mill-dam and race, or watercourse as they now-run, and have heretofore been'in use for the mills, and all the land drowned or occupied by said dam and race, or that has usually been drowned by the same, with full and uninterrupted right,\u2019 &amp;e., as in the foregoing deeds.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s 4th and 5th points with their answers are as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>4. The plaintiff, as owner of the adjacent land, being in the use and enjoyment of the water as it flowed through the race, and the bed of the stream, at the time of the diversion by the defendants and since, they are liable to him for damages of such diversion, without regard to the right to the water of the mill-owner below him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-6\">Answer : <em>\u201c </em>Such, we conceive, would be the law if the plaintiff owned the land over which the water flowed; as he neither owns the land, nor has any claim to the water, except on sufferance of the landowners, he is not entitled to recover damages as a tenant in fee of the premises. For our opinion on this point, see the general charge, as an answer in the negative to this point.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-7\">5. The use of the water by the plaintiff is evidence of license to him by the lower mill-owner, as against any at least but the lower owner, thus to use the water, and if the jury believe that the defendants have interrupted that right, they are liable to him in damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-8\">Answer: \u201c The conveyances under which the plaintiff claims, show that he had no right to use the water in the mill-race and dam. There is no pretence that he owned the soil under either, but used the water on sufferance of the mill-owner, in whom the right to both was vested, and who could at any time exclude the plaintiff therefrom, at his pleasure. He is not such an owner of the premises as is contemplated by the statutes giving damages, but could be prevented at any time by the owners of the premises, from running his cattle into the race or dam. He has not gained any right by usage or prescription as his title, which fully admits that of the lower owner, commenced in 1853, and the defendant took possession of the premises in 1857, and has held the same ever since, until lately. There is not such a length of time since the acknowledgment of the adverse title, as will raise a presumption, or from which we can presume a grant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-9\">The defendant\u2019s 1st point and answer were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-10\">1. Samuel Hannum, the plaintiff, under the deeds in evidence, has no right to the use of the water of Chester creek running or falling into the dam or race on his property, and therefore can maintain no action for its diversion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-11\">Answer: \u201c This point is true as to the dam and race. Mr. Hannum has no right to the soil under either, or the water flowing over the same. He has a right to the water in Chester creek <em>below </em>the mill-dam.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-12\">After referring to the several deeds, the court charged: * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWlW\">\u201c What is the effect of these several conveyances ? As we understand them, Hannum has no interest in, or right to the water in the dam or race, or the land under either. It is precisely the same as if the heirs of Davis had sold the strip of land out of their larger tract, and measured the same off by courses and distances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>and conveyed it with the mill; it is equally certain and binding; the land is conveyed according to the location of the race to the dam, and the water-right also. The land under the dam is conveyed according to the spread thereof, to the utmost margin as it then stood. There is no right to raise the dam an inch higher, or spread the race an inch wider, and it is not pretended that there has ever been any change in either since they were first built and dug, though each has perhaps been repaired from time to time to prevent leakage. It is entirely unlike the sale of a mere water-right, where the vendor would have an undoubted right as owner of the underlying soil, to use any portion of the water not required by the vendee, and consequently would be injured by its abstraction for the use of the borough. In this case the owner of the mill, race and dam, would have an unrestricted right to place a fence along each side of his race, and around his whole dam or pool, and keep Hannum and his stock out from the water entirely, as much as he could the cattle of any stranger. If Hannum used either the dam or the race as a watering-place, it was not by <em>right </em>but by <em>sufferance </em>only. * * * We are therefore of the opinion that Mr. Hannum is not the owner of either the land or water within the intention of the statute under which this proceeding commenced, so far as regards either the race or dam, and it is to that the attention of the witnesses has been mainly directed.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $572.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">The plaintiff took a writ of error, and assigned amongst other errors the construction given by the court to the several deeds under which the plaintiff claimed his right.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-8\"><em>J.

Neither is too much regard to the natural and proper signification of words and sentences, to permit the simple intention of the parties from taking effect; words may be transposed contrary to their order to bring them to the intent of the parties: Shoenberger <em>v. </em>Lyon, 7 W. &amp; S. 184, 192; 1 Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone, 86, 87; 4 Cruise\u2019s Digest, page 242, title <em>Deed </em>ch. 50, pl. 2, <em>et in nota; </em>1 Burton on Real Prop. 164; Parkhurst <em>v. </em>Smith, Willes Rep. 327, especially at 332.

It matters not that the exception was of land in contemplation of law, if it was not of land in contemplation of the parties. There is no better way of construing an ancient deed, than by usage, for however general the words may be, it is to be construed by the manner in which the thing granted has always been used: Broom\u2019s Maxims 300.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-7\"><em>W.

That question is, what is the proper construction of the deed of Ellis Davis to George Davis dated May 15th 1787 ? All the subsequent deeds down to that to the plaintiff of April 13th 1853, are substantially the same. The deed in question grants <em>to </em>George Davis \u201c the mill-dam and race on the several courses as they now run * * * and all the land now drowned and occupied by said dam and race, or that has been drowned by the same with t\u00a3e full and uninterrupted right and use of all the water falling into the said dam and race.\u201d The subsequent deed from Ellis Davis to Ezra Hoopes conveyed his tract, excepting that thus previously granted to George. It is true that it is called a privilege, but with a reference in terms to the former deed, and a statement under a <em>videlioet, </em>of what is thus excepted in the same words as before stated. The plaintiff in error maintains that the grant was only of the right to use the mill-dam and race for the purpose of the mill of the grantee; that that was all he needed, and that to put any other construction upon the grant would be unreasonable, for it would be to cut the farm of the grantors into two parts without any access from the one part to the other. But the established canon of construction is <em>Quoties in verbis nulla est ambiguitas, ibinulla expositio contra verba fienda est. </em>It has accordingly been well observed that although a somewhat strained interpretation of an instrument maybe admissible where an absurdity would otherwise ensue, yet if the intention of the parties is not clear and plain, but <em>in equilibrio </em>the words shall receive their more natural and proper construction: Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims 553. Both the arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>based upon the word \u201c privilege,\u201d and the fact that the description is under an \u201c <em>una </em>cum,\u201d \u201c together with,\u201d are met and answered by Caldwell <em>v. </em>Fulton, 7 Casey 475, where both these peculiarities existed. Nor is it clear that there is any such unreasonableness in the grant as contended for, for if there was no other way of getting from one part of the farm to the other or to a public road or outlet, but by crossing the race, a way of necessity would result, and as the grantee stipulated that he should have \u201c the full and uninterrupted right and use of all the water falling into the said dam and race, to be conveyed along the same,\u201d how could he be perfectly secure in this right and use without interruption unless he was the owner of the land drowned or covered by the water ? We think, therefore, that the conclusion of the learned judge below upon the construction of these deeds was correct. . There is no other point which needs examination, and which is not fully met and answered in the charge and answers to the points. Whether the instructions on the subject of the damages were in the abstract right or wrong, is immaterial as apart from the use of the dam and race to which as we have seen the plaintiff had no right; there was no evidence of any past injury for which damages could have been claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
