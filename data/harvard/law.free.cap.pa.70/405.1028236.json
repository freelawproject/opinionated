He gave the residue of his estate, real and personal, to this daughter and two others.

Because the devise to Mrs. Ann C. Rodrigue of the one-half part of the rents, issues and profits of the farm, &amp;c., on Penn\u2019s Creek, Union county, did not fail nor was it defeated in the sense of the will, and on the sale of said farm for the payment of debts, (be., she did hot become entitled to semi-annual payments of $100 each, but to the value of the one-half part of the said rents, issues and profits at the time of the said sale, to be paid semi-\u00e1nnually each year until she should receive from the proceeds of sale of the William Green tract an equivalent therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-6\">2. Because the leasing of the William Green tract reserving a specified sum of money for each ton of coal mined and taken therefrom by the lessees, was in reality a sal\u00e9 of the coal in the ground at that price, and in fact a sale of part of the soil and freehold of the William Green tract, and therefore, no matter whether the devise to Mrs. Rodrigue of one-half of the rents, issues and profits of the Union county farm had failed or been defeated, in the sense of the will, before the 30th of April 1869 or not, the payment then made to her trustee, as also that made on the 30th of September 1869, should have been diminished by the amount of the interest on the excess of the proceeds from the William Green tract over and above $700 (the amount of the semi-annual payments previously paid to her trustee without objection), from the times the respective parts thereof were received, to the date of each of said payments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\">3. Because, if the leasing of the William Green tract, as above mentioned, was not a sale of part of the soil and freehold, and if the payments stipulated in the lease to be paid by the lessees were rents, then such rents having accrued after the death of the testator, were no part of the residue of his estate devised to his daughters, or of his estate at all, and the said devise or legacy to Mrs. Rodrigue was not payable out of them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-8\"><em>J.

Indeed he has left construction no room to work, and for that reason it has not been found easy to frame any contention upon the subject. It is very plain that he meant to leave to his daughter, Mrs. Rodrigue, at all events, an annual sum toward her maintenance beyond any contingency. He had, no doubt, very good reasons for so distinguishing her from his other two daughters. For this purpose, besides other bequests to her and her children, he makes the provision out of which the controversy in this case has arisen. He thereby bequeathed to her one-half of the rent of a farm and sawmill in Union county, to be paid to her half-yearly until she receives her share of the proceeds of sale of his tract of coal-land at Shamokin, standing in the name of William Green, adding, \u201c but if this gift of the half of said proceeds should fail or he defeated, my executors shall pay to the said Ann C. Rodrigue semiannually, in lieu thereof, the sum of one hundred dollars until she shall receive her share of the proceeds of sale of said William Green tract and no longer; but when she receives any part of her share from said William Green tract, her share of the rents, issues and profits or said semi-annual payments shall be reduced by an amount equal to the interest at six per cent, per annum of the part she shall have received of said proceeds of sale of the William Green tract.\u201d The property in Union county was sold for the payment of debts, and it was clearly for this very contingency that Mr. Bellas meant to provide. It is evident that in the words of the will, the gift of the half of the proceeds of that property failed or was defeated. The will then provides that an annuity of two hundred dollars shall be substituted \u201c in lieu thereof.\u201d This annuity was to be paid until Mrs. Rodrigue should receive her share of the proceeds of sale of the coal-tract, and upon her receipt of any part, it was to abate proportionally, that is, \u201c by an amount equal to the interest of six per cent, per annum of the part she shall have received of said proceeds of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The coal-tract having been leased at a certain rent, and Mrs. Rodrigue being in the receipt of her share of the rent, it is now contended that her annuity should be proportionably reduced; for the reason that the rent being a compensation for the coal mined, which is a part of the land itself, and that which constitutes its chief value, the rent so received ought to be construed as forming a part of the proceeds of sale of the tract. The testator had empowered his executors \u201c to lease and to sell\u201d it, but with this restriction, that it should not be sold within two years unless for the price of at least $100 per acre. He evidently contemplated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the probability of a lease, and if he had intended that the annuity of Mrs. Rodrigue should be reduced as soon as she received her share of the rents, he would naturally have said, \u201cproceeds of sale or lease.\u201d He uses the words \u201cproceeds of sale\u201d three times in this clause, and in immediate connection with the words \u201c rents, issues and profits\u201d of the farm and saw-mill in Union county ; for if that gift had not been defeated, the payment of one-half of the rents to Mrs. Rodrigue would have been subject in like manner as the annuity to be reduced in the method indicated. Technical words are always to be construed according to their technical meaning, unless there be some expression which clearly indicates a contrary intention; and surely this is a rule which ought to be applied to the will of a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The William Green tract being a part of the residuary estate of the testator, under a clause blending both his real and personal estate together, the annuity in question was by implication a charge upon it, and was therefore properly paid out of the rents of that property. It is enough on this point to refer to Jane Gallagher\u2019s Appeal, 12 Wright 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
