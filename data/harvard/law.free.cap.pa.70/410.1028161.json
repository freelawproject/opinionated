Fry, trading together as J. R. &amp; H. B. Fry, brokers.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-8\">On the 28th of May Townsend Whelen filed an answer containing, amongst other things, as follows: * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-9\">\u201c That J. Willis Nevins, one of the executors, and a brother of petitioner, acted with the respondent in settling the estate up to the time of his death, in August 1866; and both he and the respondent frequently conferred with the petitioner in reference to the estate, and gave her full information as to her position in regard to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-10\">\u201cThat on or about the 31st of March 1866 the respondent furnished the petitioner with a detailed account and statement of the amount proposed to be charged to her share of her father\u2019s estate in the distribution in accordance with his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-11\">. \u201c The petitioner frequently called on respondent and conversed with him on the subject of these .charges, which consisted chiefly of advances made by the testator in his lifetime to Mr. Joseph R. Fry, the husband of petitioner. She also sent her counsel (Daniel Dougherty, Esq.) to see him on the subject, and they were both fully informed as to the nature and character of the charges stated in the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-12\">\u201c On the 10th May 1865 a judgment was entered in the District Court of Philadelphia in favor of James Nevins against Joseph R. and Horace B. Fry, for $23,566.38. This being one of the assets of the estate, the respondent used his best efforts to collect the amount due on it, being $14,168.83, but without success. Mr. Horace B. Fry was without means, and alleged that he had never received any part of the money advanced, but that a great part of it had been used by J. R. Fry in erecting a dwelling-house on Walnut street, the title to which property was held in trust for his wife, the present petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-13\">\u201c Previous to the testator\u2019s death the respondent had been for many years very familiar with all his accounts and business transactions ; and with this knowledge of the matter and of the advances made by the testator, the respondent prepared a full statement or schedule, showing the proportionate share due to each of the heirs after deducting the advances which the testator directed by his will to be charged to them. This was done for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>making a partial distribution, so that the heirs might be enabled to receive the bulk of the estate without waiting until the executors\u2019 account should be filed and audited. That schedule was submitted to all the parties interested, and approved of by them, as will appear by their written endorsement thereon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-6\">The petition set out the paper of May 18th 1868, and the receipt of June 5th 1868, heretofore stated, and proceeds: * \u2021 *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Akc\"><em>\u201c </em>He did file an account within seven months after the death of the testator. But this was done with the consent and approbation of all the heirs, including the petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-7\">\u201c There were no debts due by the decedent, and the estate being a large one, there was no reason to delay the distribution of it among his children, to whom it was devised. * * * Neither the petitioner or her counsel, or any of the heirs attended before the auditor, and it was never supposed that they intended to do so, or to interpose any objection to the account or the distribution, after they had signed the agreement and receipts already referred to. The greater part of the estate had already been divided between the heirs, and the auditor was only required to confirm the distribution which they had assented to, and to make a further distribution of the balance in the hands of the executors. * * * There was no haste in closing the audit. The auditor was appointed on the 18th December 1866, and his report was not filed until the 5th of April 1867. During all this interval the respondent was repeatedly applied to by the petitioner to know when the balance of the estate would be distributed, and he invariably informed her that the accounts were in the hands of Mr. Hopper, the auditor, and that no distribution of the balance could be made until his report was filed and confirmed. The respondent denies that he ever told the petitioner, as she alleges, that there would be no auditor appointed, or that he ever contemplated allowing his accounts to be settled without reference to an auditor.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7a\">He inserted Mrs. Fry\u2019s receipt of April 20th 1867, above stated, as proof of her knowledge of the audit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-8\">\u201c Under the rule of court the auditor is only required to give such notice to the parties who have attended his meetings, and as the petitioner never appeared before him, she was not entitled to such notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-9\"><em>\u201c </em>The respondent believed that he had exercised due care and prudence in the management and settlement of the estate, and that he was fully protected by the written agreements and receipts signed by all the parties interested. He therefore proceeded, immediately after the auditor\u2019s report was confirmed, to make a final distribution of the balance in his hands, amounting to $15,985.89, and after paying the petitioner her share of the estate, and taking her full receipt and discharge for it, he also transferred and delivered over to her all the securities and collaterals which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>her late husband had deposited with the testator for his indebtedness, in order that she might have the benefit of whatever could be realized from them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">\u201c The respondent is well satisfied, from his frequent interviews and-conversations with the petitioner, that she knew perfectly well at the time that the executors had filed their account, and that it was pending before the auditor for several months before he made his report. She was also fully informed with regard to the charges against her share of the estate, by reason of advances made by the testator in his lifetime, the greater part of which enured to her own benefit, in the erection of a dwelling-house at No. 2008 Walnut street, which was held in trust for her, and has since been disposed of, and the proceeds thereof, amounting to about $23,000, invested by her trustee for her use, and from which she is still deriving the income.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-7\">\u201c When the agreement for distribution was entered into and signed by all the heirs, the petitioner fully understood the character of it, and assented to its correctness in every respect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-8\">\u201c It was considered to be a family matter between a brother and his sisters, and they were all competent to act and judge for themselves in this division of their father\u2019s estate.

The Allegheny Yalley Bailroad stock, which was sold to the said firm by the said testator, and their note taken for $11,000 in payment thereof, was kept by the testator, until the time of his death, as collateral security for payment of said note, and upon his death was appraised by the respondent at $10,000, and placed among the assets of the estate.

It has been shown that she was very angry at one time, and used extreme language; but this would seem to have been more in reference to the course taken by her father in disposing of his estate; and the auditor has sought in vain for anything in the evidence to show or to sustain an inference that any information or explanation necessary to' an adequate understanding of the paper, and its effect when signed, was not given to her. If she did not apprehend the nature and character of the transaction to which she committed herself, it must have been because she did not give her mind to the subject, and certainly not because of any fault or omission of Mr. Whelen, the executor.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\">The auditor then gives the schedule of partial distribution, and the approval of the legatees of May 18th 1866, the former proceedings before him; and Mrs. Fry\u2019s receipt of April 26th 1867 (as before stated), and proceeds :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-9\">\u201c And thus the matter rested until May 16th 1868, when Mrs. Fry filed her petition for review.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-10\">\u201c Upon the matter, as it now stands before us, two questions are presented:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-11\">\u201c1. Were the deductions properly made? 1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-12\">\u201c 2. Were the commissions properly charged ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-13\"><em>\u201c </em>1. I find, as matter of fact, none of the material allegations in the petition proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-14\">\u201c Mrs. Fry had legal notice of the audit. It is proved that she was told, pending the audit, that it was being held. She certainly knew that an audit had been held when she signed the receipt for the balance awarded to her by the auditor. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-15\">\u201c If, as matter of law, which will presently be noticed, there was an error in the construction of the will of Mr. Nevins, or a misapplication of its provisions, there was no fact not known and made abundantly clear to Mrs. Fry when she united in the authority to the executors, and they acted upon it. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\u201c The question then comes, what is the meaning of the will ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">\u201c It is alleged that the testator intends <em>advancements only </em>to be deducted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-7\">\u201c If this is so, strictly speaking, there was none to be deducted except the individual indebtedness, and the recital in the will, unless as to that, would be without meaning or application ; but while a husband, as our law stands, cannot take his wife\u2019s property or claim it, it would be inconsistent to hold that money paid to him is a payment on account of that property in anticipation or advance of the vesting of the legal title thereto, which is the legal meaning of <em>advancement. </em>It would seem, however, that the testator, Mr. Nevins, certainly contemplated and referred to such advances of money as did and would, agreeably to common acceptation, constitute a <em>debt. </em>His language is, <em>\u201c such amounts as they may be so indebted to me. </em>* * * I hold that Mr. Nevins meant <em>debts </em>\u2014 that is, advances, which were, in fact and in law, loans and constituted <em>debts. </em>The counsel for the petitioner urged that some of these debts were barred by the statute, and that the amount, $1250, was not borrowed from the testator, Mr. Nevins. I must look at the meaning of the will as the law of the case, and I find that meaning to be, what is charged as a debt, if not repaid, to be deducted. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">\u201c The remaining question is that of commissions; these were 5 per cent. It is now contended that they were excessive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-9\">\u201c Had this point been raised at the audit, it would have received careful consideration, and possibly I should have been inclined to reduce it \u2014 yet it was not overlooked. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-10\"><em>\u201c </em>In this particular case, however, there are answers to the point, one of which seems to me conclusive:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-11\">\u201c 1. It is too late, at such a distance of time, to have a review on such ground, on such a point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-12\">\u201c 2. If, however, this were otherwise, circumstances exist which would render a change in this case exceedingly oppressive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-13\">\u201c The present accountant is one of three executors who divided these commissions among themselves in equal proportions. One died, leaving no estate but this share of commissions, which has been paid to his legal representative. Another, to whom the share has been paid, has been long absent in Europe, without property here, and with no estate of his own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-14\">\u201c Now, even though I might possibly have awarded a less sum for commissions, I deem it a very plain case for a refusal to change the decree now, on the ground, that by the delay, a state of things has arisen which renders it inexpedient and unjust to interfere with the amount as it now stands, and which was acted on by the executor, who is called upon to suffer by the proposed change. Of this the petitioner should not complain, as the delay was her own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u201c It has been shown to the auditor that before the executors filed this account, Mrs. Fry consulted counsel with reference to the deductions made from her share in the settlement of the estate, and that he told her what he thought she ought to do in the premises.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">Mrs. Fry filed with the auditor a number of exceptions to his report. He finally reported that he saw \u201c no reason for changing his report as originally made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">All else necessary to an understanding of the case is to be found in the opinion of the court below, approved by the Supreme Court and delivered July 28d 1870, after argument of the exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report, by</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-8\">Allison, P. J. \u2014 \u201c The account of the executors of James Nevins was referred to an auditor, whose report was confirmed without exception. Upon a petition for review, presented by Mrs. Cornelia N. Fry, one of the children of the decedent, and a legatee under her father\u2019s will, who is entitled to one-fourth part of his estate, less such deductions as her share was subject to, it was ordered, after argument, that the account be referred back to the auditor, with instructions to report upon all questions which arise upon the whole record as it was then before us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-9\"><em>\u201c </em>On the 18th day of May 1866, two months and seven days after the death of Mr. Nevins, the four children of the testator executed a paper, by which they agreed to a distribution according to a statement therein contained of the greater portion of the estate. This paper showed that $21,445.02 were deducted from the share of Mrs. Fry, which is made up of charges in the account-book of the deceased, against Joseph R. Fry, the husband of the exceptant; against the firm of J. R. <em>&amp; </em>H. B. Fry, and against Mrs. Fry individually. These entries are in part in the handwriting of Mr. Nevins, and in part in the handwriting of Townsend Whelen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-10\">\u201c On the 29th of April 1867, Mrs. Fry receipted to the executors of the estate of James Nevins for $3657.28, the balance awarded to her by the auditor\u2019s report and the executors\u2019 account, filed October 2d 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-11\">\u201c In her petition for review the petitioner swore that, notwithstanding the acknowledgment contained in this receipt, she did not know of the account having been referred to an auditor, and that she had been put off her guard by Townsend Whelen, the acting executor, who stated to her that to save expense the account would not be audited. In her testimony, taken before the auditor upon the reference back, this statement is repeated in the most positive manner, to which she adds, that the receipt was signed without a knowledge of its contents; that it was not read by her before she appended her signature to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-12\">\u201c This statement is contradicted by the Messrs. Whelen, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>under examination before the auditor. It is not, however, asserted by any one that Mrs. Fry was at any time present at the audit; nor is it in proof that she had personal notice of the appointment of the auditor, or that she was informed of the time or place of meeting, or that any direct or special notice, relating to the reference of the account to Mr. Hopper, was given to her. The auditor finds that she had legal notice; that due publication was made, and holds that she is concluded upon the question of notice by such publication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-6\">\u201c The first questions to be considered are the avoidance of the effect of the signature of Mrs. Fry to the agreement of distribution, and the power and the duty of the court to open the decree of confirmation. If this cannot be done, the report, as it now stands, must be confirmed, and an examination into the merits, legal as well as equitable, of the deductions from Mrs. Fry\u2019s share of her father\u2019s estate, and the alleged overcharge of commissions, must be refused. The auditor decides against this application, not only on the fact of notice, but on the merits, and also on the well-settled principle that, for a mistake of law, relief will not be given against the unwise or improvident execution of a deed or agreement. But this doctrine, though founded on principle, and supported by authority, will not be allowed to bar the way to relief, where the party seeking to avoid the consequences of his own deed, shows that he has acted upon a w.ant of proper knowledge which he was not able to obtain, though vigilant and diligent in his search for it, or where information to which he was entitled, and which was necessary to the formation of a correct judgment as to the performance of a proposed act by which his rights are to be effected, has been withheld from or refused to him. Nor is the principle which the auditor invokes in support of his conclusions applicable to a case in which unconscionable advantage is taken of circumstances in which a suitor is placed, whereby his will is coerced, and he has by undue pressure been induced to do that which he would not otherwise have done. Much more clear is the ease where there is actual or legal fraud ; where t;here is a moral or legal wrong on the part of one who seeks to obtain by these means the execution of an agreement from which a benefit is to flow to himself, or to another for whom he acts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-7\">\u201c It is' clearly settled that where, with a mistake in law there is found mixed up other ingredients, showing misrepresentations, stating that which is not true, or concealing that which ought to have been made known ; where imposition, undue influence, mental incapacity or surprise are established, relief will be afforded to one who has thus been imposed upon and induced to do that which it is contrary to equity to maintain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-8\">\u201cJudge Story, in the first volume of his Equity Jurisprudence, under the head of \u2018Mistakes,\u2019 states the doctrine at length, with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>qualifications, and refers to some of the cases in which the general principle, relied on by the auditor, has been held not to apply. As in the case of Pusey <em>v. </em>Desbouvrie, 3 P. Wins. 315, where a daughter held a legacy of 10,000Z., upon condition that she would release her orphanage share, which amounted to 40,000Z., accepted the legacy and executed the release. On the ground that she did not fully understand her right to have an account first taken, although informed that such was her right, the release was set aside, and her orphanage share was given to her. In Evans <em>v. </em>Lewellyn, 1 Cox R. 333, a conveyance was set aside for the reason that it had been improvidently executed. Lord Kenyon remarks :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">\u2018 The party was taken by surprise; he had not sufficient time to act with caution, he was not competent to protect himself, and therefore we are bound to afford him such protection.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">\u201c These cases are not without their importance in the consideration of this application. The first is ruled on the fact that full information and explanation were not given; and the second on the ground of surprise, and an improvident execution. We have both these elements standing out in the undisputed facts of this case. The testimony shows that Mr. Townsend Whelen, upon application made to him, on behalf of Mrs. Fry, by a member of the bar of the highest respectability, who was well known to Mr. Whelen, refused permission to him to examine the books of the testator, in which the charges were made which Mr. Whelen claimed to deduct from Mrs. Fry\u2019s portion. This is confessed by Mr. Whelen, accompanied by an explanation which, however satisfactory to himself, allows the fact to remain that light was refused which was every way proper should have been given, and at a time when it was of the utmost importance that it should not have been withheld. Mr. Whelen testified that he named another person to Mrs. Fry, who should advise with her in regard to the settlement of her father\u2019s estate, but after the refusal mentioned she was not bound to accept a suggestion of this kind emanating from him; such a suggestion was in itself a sufficient reason for its rejection; and upon every principle of right and of fair dealings, she ought to have been allowed the freest access to herL father\u2019s books, either by herself or by her chosen agent or attorney. This conduct on the part of Mr. Whelen makes a stronger case for Mrs. Fry than the facts as they are stated in Pusey <em>v. </em>Desbouvrie, made for the complainant in that case. Evans <em>v. </em>Lewellyn supports this application to open the decree on the ground of haste in the execution of the agreement of distribution. The short time that had passed after the death of Mr. Nevins, a little more than two months, makes the transaction a very uncommon one, showing unusual expedition in securing, by consent of the parties, a division of the principal portion of the assets of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u201cIt was not accomplished without controversy, without strenuous resistance on the part of Mrs. Fry, and that it was pressed upon her by Townsend Whelen and Edward S. Whelen, is, we think, abundantly clear from the whole testimony. Townsend Whelen testifies that he told Mrs. Fry that the estate could only be settled by her allowing the deductions from her share which he claimed, and that he had been so advised by counsel. If to this is added the facts testified to by Mrs. Fry, which are uncon-\u00a3 tradicted, that she was suffering at that time great sorrow because of the comparatively recent death of her husband and father; that she was distressed and annoyed by the want of money to meet debts then due, and to supply the wants of her household, and that her children urged her to sign the agreement to avoid family alienations, we have a case of surprise, of undue pressure, and a condition of circumstances which we think show, as in the latter case cited, that she was not able to protect herself, and that she is therefore entitled to claim the protection she has invoked. This is all outside of the portion of the testimony of the Messrs. Whelen and Mrs. Fry, which is highly contradictory, the latter swearing that she was repeatedly threatened by Townsend and Edward S. Whelen with the loss of other property, which was held in trust for her, if she refused to allow the deductions, and that they possessed the knowledge that would enable them to accomplish this result.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">\u201c All of these statements are denied in the most positive manner by T. and E. S. Whelen. But putting out of the ease these controverted matters, we think it is made clear by the testimony on both sides that there were excited and angry disputes on the subject of these allowances, and the question of Mrs. Fry\u2019s signature to the agreement of distribution, and that enough has been presented to require us to open the decree of confirmation and examine this application upon its merits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-7\">\u201c There is another well-settled principle which favors this application, which is, that when a party has acted under a misconception or ignorance of his title, and has executed an agreement or conveyance to his prejudice, he will be relieved in equity. In this case the title of Mrs. Fry to the one-fourth part of her father\u2019s estate rested on his will, and in the charges which he had made in his books against the share which would come to her. There was ignorance of title here which was not the result of negligence on the part of Mrs. Fry, but an ignorance forced upon her by the refusal of the executors to furnish the evidence for which she called. This is not, therefore, a case which stands upon the ground of a compromise, based on a doubtful construction of a will, from which equity will not relieve, hut is mixed up with other considerations of law and fact, which takes it from under the operation of the rule upon which the auditor, in a measure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>seems to have rested his refusal to go behind the agreement of the 18th of May 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\">\u201cWe are not forgetful of the fact that this is not a proceeding in equity for relief, but that it is a petition for review in the Orphans\u2019 Court, which, though not in strictness a court of equity, is greatly controlled by the principles recognised as equitable, and by which a chancellor would be guided upon an application by bill in equity. A bill of review is therefore never allowed to stand on strict law and against equity: Stevenson\u2019s Appeal, 8 Casey 324. By the Act of October 13th 1840, a petition of review may be entertained within five years after final decree, alleging errors, which shall be specifically set forth, and the courtmre directed to give such relief as equity and justice may require; provided, that the act shall not apply to any case in which a balance found due shall have been actually paid and discharged. This provision can have no [application to a case in which distribution or payment was voluntary on the part of an executor or administrator, and where it was made before account filed, for in such oase there is no balance which has been <em>\u2018 </em>found due.\u2019 And such was the fact when distribution and payment was made, from which the deductions were claimed that are now alleged to exhibit error in law, apparent on the face of the record, which, if well founded, give to the Orphans\u2019 Court undoubted statutory authority and jurisdiction to entertain the application for review of the account. Nor does a confirmation of an account of an executor or administrator prevent its re-examination, unless the particular item impeached has been expressly litigated and adjudicated: Clark <em>v, </em>Callaghan, 2 Watts 259. It will not protect an accountant from answering for a <em>devastavit </em>where there has been a misapplication, though credit be regularly claimed and allowed: Pry\u2019s Appeal, 8 Watts 264. Nor will it preclude a creditor from controverting an assertion of payment, nor a legatee or distributee from questioning alleged payment to them; nor will it bar a widow\u2019s claim because of a deduction allowed in payment of her husband\u2019s debt: Foulk <em>v. </em>Brown, 2 Watts 214; McLanachan <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Rawle 359; Rittenhouse <em>v. </em>Levering, 6 W. &amp; S. 201; Hovy <em>v. </em>Becker, 2 Barr 470; Keech <em>v. </em>Rinehart, 10 Id. 240. In this case there is no pretence by any one that the disputed items were litigated before the auditor, or brought to the knowledge of the court, nor that anything more was done by the auditor than to take the agreement of distribution, signed by the parties in interest, as it was furnished to him by the executor, and upon this alone found his report covering the matters contained in said agreement. The items, which are disputed and questioned in the petition for review, are interest upon $4259.53, which sum is charged in the books of Mr. Nevins against Joseph R. Fry, the husband of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>petitioner; the sum of $14,168.83, made up of principal and interest upon an account of the testator against the firm of J. R. &amp; H. B. Fry, and $918.46 charged to Mrs.. Fry individually. Exception is also taken to the charge of five per cent, commissions, which were retained by the executors on the aggregate sum of $163,977.82.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-6\">\u201c The determination of the most important questions which are raised by the exceptions to the report involves the proper construction of the following clause of the will:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-7\">\u201c \u2018 And whereas, during my lifetime, I have made, or may hereafter make, <em>advances </em>in money, stocks or otherwise to my said son, or to the husband of either of my daughters, and it is my express intention that the shares of all of my said children shall be equalized, I hereby direct that such <em>advances </em>respectively shall be deducted from the share to be paid to the trustees of my said son, or to either of my said daughters whose husbands may be indebted to me.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-8\">\u201c The auditor finds that the testator did not intend that the <em>advances </em>in \u2018 money, stocks or otherwise,\u2019 to his son, or to the husband of either of his daughters should be regarded as, and should in fact constitute <em>advancements, </em>but that they should be regarded as debts, and under this view he sustains the deductions claimed by the executors. Is this the true interpretation of the will ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-9\"><em>\u201c </em>The intention of the testator, if it can be gathered from the will, must answer this question, and this, we think, he has not left in doubt or uncertainty. His purpose is clearly expressed in the phrase \u2018 it is my express intention that the shares of all of my said children shall be equalized.\u2019 To accomplish this the advances are to be deducted from the share of this son, or from those of his daughters <em>\u2018 </em>whose husbands may be indebted to me.\u2019 The auditor is influenced in arriving at this conclusion by the term indebted, and from this argues that he \u2018 referred to such advances of money as did and would, agreeably to common acceptation, constitute a debt.\u2019 But these advances made and to be made by the testator, were not limited to money; <em>stocks or otherwise, </em>is the phrase used, which last word would cover anything of value, of which he would make advances; it might be real estate, evidences of debts or money due to him, or any other kind of personal property. To advance or make advances of such kind of property, if voluntary on his part, and without solicitation of the s\u00f3ns-in-law (and there is here no evidence of such solicitation), would not of itself convert that which was thus advanced into debts (4 Wharton 141); such advances would rather stand as gifts, to be accounted for or not, as the donor should direct, and in such manner as should be specified by him. Where there is no promise to pay, express or implied, how could the relation of debtor and creditor be estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>listed in the sense in which the auditor holds that it existed between Mr. Nevins and Joseph R. Fry ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The testator does not say that these advances shall be treated as debts, so as to carry with them the ordinary incidents of a debt, but says, \u2018 the husbands who shall be <em>so </em>indebted.\u2019 How indebted ? Evidently as he had provided for and designated in his will; who should have received from him such advances in money or property on account of the shares of his daughters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-7\">\u201c And these advances were not intended to be collected as debts from his sons-in-law, but were to stand as advances until the death of Mr. Nevins, when they were to be cancelled by deducting them from the shares of the estate to which the daughters would be entitled whose husbands should be so, or in this way, indebted to the testator. He evidently treated these moneys or properties given to the husbands of his daughters as advancements made to the daughters themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-8\">\u201c The end to be attained is the equal division of the estate among the four children, in such a way that no injustice would be done to either of them, and this is to be reached, by first taking from each share the advances made to his son, or to his sons-in-law. We, therefore, regard this as a direction to treat the advances as advancements made to the son or to the daughters through their husbands. Thompson\u2019s Estate, 6 Wright 345, is a much stronger case against the view taken by the auditor than the one before us. The sum claimed to be a debt was charged to the son of the testator as debtor, and is twice stated in the account kept by the father as money, <em>and as money loaned. </em>This was held by the Supreme Court, upon the fact of intention, to be an advancement, and not a debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-9\">\u201c If we are right in our interpretation of the disputed clause of the will, two results follow: First, the sums of money charged to Joseph R. Fry, are to be treated as advancements made to Mrs. Fry, and because the testator so directed they are to be taken from her portion of the estate, but without interest; and second, a sale of stocks to the firm of which Joseph R. Fry was a member, which stand charged against the firm, and which is nowhere carried by Mr. Nevins to the individual account of J. R. Fry, is a mere debt of the firm, and cannot now be converted by the executors into a gift or loan, or advance; because a sale is not an advance, the testator not having directed it to be so treated, it remains a debt. And if a debt which grew out of a business transaction with the testator, which remained on that footing until his death, it does not belong to the designated advances which he directed should be deducted; for it is only the advances which he had or might make to his sons-in-law, and not their debts, which were to be taken from the share of his daughters. That a debt due by a husband cannot be deducted from the portion of a daughter is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>clearly settled. Yundt\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris, is an authority in point. So also is Seagrist\u2019s Appeal, 10 Harris 424. In this case the term <em>advanced </em>is held to be equivalent to advancement; the language of the will is, \u2018 What I have given and advanced in my lifetime, to any of my children, shall be deducted from their respective sharesLevering <em>v. </em>Rittenhouse, 4 Wharton 141, supports the doctrine, that to convert an advance or gift to a child into a debt, such an intention must be made to appear. That if a father, without solicitation, gives to his son a sum of money, or pays a debt for him, it will be considered a gift or an advancement to the son. This was the case in Thompson\u2019s Estate. The father had paid debts due by the son and charged them as money loaned. Looking therefore to the intention of the testator, as we understand it to be expressed in his will, we think it is clear that his purpose was to do no more than to secure the deduction from each share of whatever sums in money or property he may have made advances in his lifetime to his son or to his sons-in-law. In this sense the son or the sons-in-law are to be considered as indebted to him, and not in the sense in which the auditor interprets it. If the testator had no other purpose than this one in his mind when he gave the direction in his will which has given rise to this controversy, and we think none other can be gathered from it, with what justice can it <em>be </em>claimed that the indebtedness of the firm of J. R. &amp; H. B. Fry, growing out of transactions of purchase and sale of stock, upon part of which the testator made a profit of several thousand dollars, is to be regarded as an advance of stock to Joseph R. Fry, and as such to be deducted from Mrs. Fry\u2019s share of her father\u2019s estate ? We regard this as a debt due by Joseph R. Fry to the testator, and not as an advance made to him, and therefore not a proper or legal deduction from the sum due to Mrs. Fry. Bird\u2019s Estate, 2 Parsons 168, is cited against this view, but there the father took the note of the son, which, though outlawed, the auditor held was, under a direction contained in the will, to be deducted from the son\u2019s share for money advanced. It does not appear whether interest was charged or not. Berry <em>v. </em>Morse, 1 House of Lords Cases 70, seems to have been decided upon general principles, and not on a question of intention of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The charge of five per cent, commission is objected to as excessive. The entire estate passed into the hands of the executors in the shape of interest-paying investments in stocks, &amp;c. There was no change or conversion of assets; nothing required to be collected by suit. The actual duty performed was simply to pay to the legatees their respective portions of the securities (amounting in all to $163,000) after having held them for only a little over two months. This was all of it. Stevenson\u2019s Estate, 4 Wharton 104; Pusey <em>v. </em>Clemson, 9 S. &amp; R. 204; Walker\u2019s Estate, 9 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>&amp; R. 223, settle the amount to be allowed in a case of this kind at three per cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">\u201c The deduction of $900, with interest, as a debt due by Mrs. Fry, was properly allowed. It was charged against her in the books of the testator, and by his express direction. This is in accordance with the declared purpose of Mr. Nevins to equalize the shares of his children. The intention is shown by the clause of the will above quoted, and regarded in this light we think he intended to charge it against her as a debt. The auditor regards it as contrary to equity to hold the executors responsible to Mrs. Fry, after distribution of the estate among the legatees, and the commissions between the executors. The answer to this is, that the distribution was their own act, to which they required Mrs. Fry to assent in writing, before they would make a division of the estate, and this before account filed or an opportunity afforded to any one to raise a question before the Orphans\u2019 Court, as to the legality or propriety of the course adopted by them. Having insisted upon pursuing this course, and chosen to walk in it with their eyes open, to the manifest injury of the petitioner, they have no right to complain if they are held to the consequences of their acts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-7\">\u201c These views require us to sustain the exceptions to the report of the auditor, upon the material questions covered by them, except so far as they relate to the charge of $918.46 against Mrs. Fry, as stated in the account-hooks of her father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-8\">\u201c Let a decree be prepared accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-9\">The decree was as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-10\">\u201cAnd now, July 23d 1870, the exceptions to the report of the auditor having been argued, and it appearing to the court, for the reasons stated in the opinion, that on the 18th of May, A. d. 1866, certain sums of money were improperly deducted from the share of Mrs. Cornelia N.
