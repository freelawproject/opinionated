The justice rendered judgment against the defendant for $66.75:' he appealed to the Court of Common Pleas, where the case was tried May 16th 1871, before Gilmore, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-22\">The circumstances as they appeared at the trial were these:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-23\">At the triennial assessment in 1865, the defendant's property was adjusted at $2510. of which defendant had notice; he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>notice of the day and place of appeal for Dunkard township; he did not attend nor did he appeal; at their meeting to hear appeals, the commissioners raised the valuation to $8875. The plaintiff as supervisor made out the duplicate for road tax, adopting $8875 as the correct assessment of the defendant\u2019s property, and the rate was fixed at one per cent., making the amount of defendant\u2019s road tax $88.75. He was notified to work out his tax on the roads he; did so work to the amount of $22, and declined to work any more. On the 13th of July 1866, a warrant was put into the plaintiff\u2019s hands for the collection of road tax, including the balance assessed on the defendant. The collector suffered the warrant to expire in his hands, and the township auditors charged him with the unpaid tax of defendant. The defendant refused to pay, principally on the ground that the raising of the valuation of his property from $2510 to $8875, was unauthorized by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">The Act of May 15th 1841, section 4, Pamph. L. 394, 2 Br.

If Maple had not a hearing before the commissioners on or before the regular day appointed for holding the appeals, he might afterwards appeal to them in session at any time before his taxes were paid. If he did so appeal and was unsuccessful he is concluded ; and if he was informed of the raising of his valuation and did not appeal, he is equally concluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-10\">\u2022 4. After the assessment of the tax in question against Maple, he had the right to apply by petition to the next Court of Quarter Sessions of the county, or to a judge in vacation, for relief, and having failed to do so, he is concluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-11\">The court further charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-12\">\u201c The assessment or increased valuation made on the day of appeal and after the valuation had already been adjusted, was illegal and irregular but not void, and the supervisors had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>right to demand and receive from the defendant one per cent, on $2510 and no more. * * * We say further that it is competent for defendant to make this defence here. Whatever is found in any of the points contrary to this may he considered refused.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $4.18. He took a writ of error, and assigned for error the refusal of his points, and the portion of the charge given above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-7\"><em>Black </em>and <em>Phelan, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arx\">referred to Acts of 1834 and 1841, <em>supra. </em>The Aet of 1841 being merely directory, time is not material: Gearhart <em>v. </em>Dixon, 1 Barr 224; Ins.

F. Smith 315; Forward Sch. Dist.

Until altered, or changed by the commissioners, the increased valuation was properly taken as the basis for the assessment of township-rates and levies for road and other purposes. If the defendant was aggrieved by the assessment, his remedy was by petition to the next Court of Quarter Sessions, as provided by the act. Having neglected to avail himself of the remedy furnished by the law for his redress, he cannot set up the illegality of the tax as a defence to this action. The objection comes too late. As was said in Clinton School District\u2019s Appeal, 6 P. F. Smith 315, the remedy for illegal taxation, when the general power to assess exists, is by appeal to those to whom the appeal is required to be taken; and if none be given, neither the Common Pleas nor this court can revise the judgment of the tax-officers. The court below should, therefore, have affirmed the plaintiff\u2019s third and fourth points, and for the refusal to instruct the jury as therein requested the judgm\u00e9nt must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
