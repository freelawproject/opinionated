LANIER ANDERSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b443-24\">On May 30,1978, the appellant Termplan, Inc., Bolton (lender) and the appellees-cross appellants, Elijah and Shirley Whitfield (borrowers) entered into a consumer credit transaction. On September 30, 1978, the borrowers filed this action alleging that the loan contract violated various provisions of the Truth-In-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1601 <em>et seq. </em>and Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.1 <em>et seq. </em>The lender answered, denied liability and counterclaimed for the balance due on the loan contract. The borrowers replied that the contract violated the Georgia Industrial Loan Act. Ga.Code Ann. Chap. 25-3, and was therefore void and unenforceable. The district court held that the inclusion of a provision for post-maturity interest was a default or delinquency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>charge which was required to be disclosed under the Truth-In-Lending Act and had not been disclosed. The court also held that the contract violated the Georgia Industrial Loan Act and dismissed the lender\u2019s counterclaim. The lender filed a notice of appeal. The borrowers, dissatisfied with their award of attorney\u2019s fees, filed a cross-appeal. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">I. MUST THE POST-MATURITY INTEREST CLAUSE BE DISCLOSED UNDER REGULATION Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(b)(4)?</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(b)(4) requires the disclosure of \u201c[t]he amount, or method of computing the amount, of any default, delinquency, or similar charges payable in the event of late payments.\u201d The contract involved in this case contained the following provision under the heading, \u201cState disclosures that are inconsistent with the federal Truth-In-Lending Act:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">For value received ... The undersigned agrees to pay interest after the scheduled or accelerated maturity hereof at the rate of 8 percent per annum....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The district court held that this provision constituted a charge similar to a default or a delinquency charge, and that it must be disclosed in the federal or Truth-In-Lending disclosures. The court based its conclusion on the fact that, had the contract been silent as to post-maturity interest, the lender would have been entitled to collect only seven percent under Georgia law. <em>See </em>Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 57-101 (Supp.1981). The court reasoned that the contract effectively reserved to the lender an additional one percent of post-maturity interest, and that the one percent constituted the delinquency \u201ccharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">We note, however, that the eight percent post-maturity interest rate was the same as the stated periodic rate under the contract itself, which the lender would have been lawfully entitled to collect in the absence of a default. This court has never faced the question of whether a post-maturity interest charge equal in amount to the interest rate of the loan constitutes a \u201cdefault, delinquency, or similar charg[e].\u201d Recently, the Supreme Court has defined the term \u201cdelinquency charge\u201d as used in the Truth-In-Lending Act \u201cas specific penalty sums,\u201d and as \u201cthe compensation a creditor receives .. . for the debtor\u2019s delay in making timely installment payments.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 561, 100 S.Ct. 790, 795, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980). We do not believe that a post-maturity interest rate on the outstanding balance constitutes a penalty or compensation for delay when that rate is the same as the interest rate of the loan itself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Our conclusion finds support in a Federal Reserve Board Official Staff Interpretation of Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(b)(4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"API\">You also ask whether a creditor must disclose that, after the maturity date of a simple interest loan contract, interest may or will accrue on any principal balance that remains unpaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-12\">It is the staff\u2019s opinion that as to simple interest loans, <em>such continued accrual of interest need not be disclosed if the periodic rate applicable after maturity is the same as the stated periodic rate under the loan contract, </em>or if the rate permitted by statute after the loan maturity rate is lower than the stated rate. Where the interest on the unpaid balance accrues at a higher rate after the maturity date, however, staff believes disclosure is required by \u00a7 226.8(b)(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">FRB Official Staff Interpretation No. FC-0083 (June 20, 1977), reprinted in CCH, Consumer Credit Guide, Transfer Binder H 31,611 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">Our conclusion also finds support by analogy from <em>McDaniel v. Fulton National Bank of Atlanta, </em>571 F.2d 948 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>1978) <em>clarified, </em>576 F.2d 1156 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc) and <em>Ford Motor Credit Corp. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 100 S.Ct. 790, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980), both dealing with the issue of whether a creditor\u2019s practice concerning rebate of unearned interest in the event of acceleration pursuant to default constitutes a delinquency charge. In <em>McDaniel, </em>this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">Nor need an additional disclosure of rebate provisions of unearned interest in the event of default be made if these are the same as disclosed rebate provisions in the event of voluntary prepayment. But if the creditor possesses under his contract the right to retain <em>more </em>unearned interest in the event of accelerated payment pursuant to default than in that of voluntary prepayment .. . then the existence of that right in him must be disclosed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">576 F.2d at 1157 (emphasis added). In <em>Mil-hollin, </em>the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">But so long as the creditor\u2019s rebate practice under acceleration is identical to its policy with respect to voluntary prepayments, <em>separate </em>disclosure of the acceleration policy does not seem obligatory under a literal reading of the regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvN\">444 U.S. at 562, 100 S.Ct. at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">As the Supreme Court declared, \u201c[u]nless demonstrably irrational, Federal Reserve Board staff opinions construing the Act or Regulation should be dispositive.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. at 565, 100 S.Ct. at 797. We believe that the staff\u2019s approach to this issue is eminently rational. Indeed, we believe it would be unreasonable to penalize the lender for failing to disclose the fact that he would charge the same interest rate for the use of his money after maturity as he did during the life of the loan. We hold that a lender is not required to disclose the fact that post-maturity interest will be charged where the rate is the same as the stated contract rate of interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">II. WAS THE LOAN CONTRACT VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE UNDER THE GEORGIA INDUSTRIAL LOAN ACT?</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">By counterclaim, the lender sought to recover the outstanding balance due on the note. The borrowers filed a defense to the counterclaim alleging that the contract refinanced a prior contract which was void under Georgia\u2019s Industrial Loan Act (\u201cILA\u201d), Ga.Code Ann. Chap. 25-3 (1981), and therefore was itself void. The contract at issue here was executed on May 30,1978, but it included a refinancing of the balance of a prior loan transaction dated October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>26, 1977. On appeal, the parties agree that the first loan contract was illegal, and thus void, as tested by the interpretation of the ILA in <em>Consolidated Credit Corp. of Athens </em>v. <em>Peppers, </em>144 Ga.App. 401, 240 S.E.2d 922 (1977).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties also agreed that the second contract did not violate the ILA on its face. The borrowers argue, however, that the second loan which refinanced a prior tainted loan was itself void because of illegal consideration. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The Georgia Court of Appeals decision in <em>Peppers </em>was rendered on December 5,1977, more than one month after the first loan contract was executed. During the pendency of this appeal, the Georgia Court of Appeals decided to give its <em>Peppers </em>decision prospective application only. <em>FinanceAmerica Corp. v. Drake, </em>154 Ga.App. 811, 270 S.E.2d 449 (1980). Therefore, the 1977 loan was not void and when that loan was renewed there was no taint.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Our conclusion finds further support in the 1978 amendment to the ILA. In 1978, the Georgia General Assembly amended Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 25-9903 to include the following proviso:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">If a contract is made in good faith in conformity with an interpretation of Chap. 25-3 by the appellate courts of this State or in a rule or regulation officially promulgated by the commissioner after public hearings, no provision in this section imposing any penalty shall apply, notwithstanding that after such contract is made, such rule or regulation is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 25-9903 (1981). The amendment was apparently a response to the court of appeals decision in <em>Peppers. </em>During the pendency of this appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court decided to give the amendment retroactive application. <em>Southern Discount Company of Georgia v. Ector, </em>246 Ga. 30, 268 S.E.2d 621 (1980). The retroactive application of the 1978 amendment has the same effect in this instance as giving the <em>Peppers </em>case prospective application only. The affidavit of A1 Field, the lender\u2019s branch manager, states that the lender relied upon the <em>pre-Peppers </em>decisions in calculating the loan fee. There is no evidence which would demonstrate a lack of good faith. Therefore, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment which dismissed the lender\u2019s counterclaim for the balance due; we remand to the district court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\">. <em>Compare Franklin v. Community Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., </em>629 F.2d 514 (8th Cir. 1980), where the court held that an <em>increase </em>in the interest rate during a period of delinquency constituted a \u201cdefault, delinquency or similar charg[e].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b445-9\">. The borrowers rely upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith v. Chapman, </em>614 F.2d 968 (5th Cir. 1980), for the proposition that the post-maturity interest rate must be disclosed as a delinquency or default charge. We do not believe that <em>Smith v. Chapman </em>addressed this issue. In <em>Smith </em>the post-maturity interest was specifically treated on the creditor\u2019s documents as a delinquency charge. The contract provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8A\">The Seller, at its option, shall collect a delinquency charge on each installment in default ... in an amount not to exceed 5% of each installment or $5 whichever is less, or, in lieu thereof, interest after maturity on each installment, not to exceed the highest lawful contract rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">There is no indication that the <em>Smith </em>lender argued, either in the district court or in this court, that its post-maturity interest was not a delinquency charge; and the lender\u2019s own treatment of it may have precluded such an argument. Furthermore, this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Smith </em>held only that the disclosure there was not sufficiently clear and definite. The lender had disclosed on the front page only that the post-maturity interest would not exceed the \u201chighest lawful contract rate,\u201d and only by reading the other portions of the contract could one ascertain that the highest lawful contract rate was ten percent. There is some language in the district court\u2019s opinion in <em>Smith v. Chapman, </em>436 F.Supp. 58, 63 (W.D.Tex.1977), which lends support to the borrowers\u2019 position in this case; however, this court did not adopt the district court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b445-15\">. One alleged Truth-In-Lending violation remains to be considered by the district court, <em>i. </em>e., whether the disclosure statement failed to disclose the limitation on security interests in accessions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\">. <em>Peppers </em>held that a loan contract was void and unenforceable where the interest charge was included in the computational base used to calculate the loan fee. <em>Peppers </em>represented a departure from prior cases which had implicitly or explicitly approved this practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\">. In response to the counterclaim, the borrowers also argued that the lender was estopped from recovering the balance due on the loan contract because it had issued a termination statement indicating that it no longer claimed a security interest in the property. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 109A-9-404. The magistrate stated that while there may be merit to the argument, he based his decision upon a finding that the loan contract violated the ILA. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report. In view of our holding that the contract did not violate the ILA, we remand to the district court for a determination on the question of estoppel and other defenses, if any, to the counterclaim which the borrower has properly preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">Since we have reversed the district court\u2019s finding of a Truth-In-Lending violation, we do not address the borrowers\u2019 allegations that the award of attorney\u2019s fees was insufficient or the lender\u2019s claim that each borrower should not recover separate damages under the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
