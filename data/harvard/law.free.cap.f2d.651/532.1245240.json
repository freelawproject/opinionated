Jamieson, Sr., and James C. Jamieson, Jr., individuals, and Jamieson-McKames Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pharma-care Generic Drugs, Inc., Pharmacare, Inc., and Payless Pharmacy, Inc., corporations, appeal a judgment finding them guilty of criminal violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq. They also appeal a civil order of condemnation and forfeiture of certain drug manufacturing equipment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 334(b). The criminal case, which resulted in convictions on one count of conspiracy to violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and ten substantive counts of counterfeiting, misbranding, and adulterating of drugs, and the civil case were consolidated for trial before the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by consent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-19\">The trial, which consumed more than twenty days, ended on January 17, 1978. The district court on March 29, 1979, filed its findings of fact in the criminal case. On July 23, 1979, an order, memorandum, and findings<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were filed in the civil case. Each of the individual defendants was sentenced to imprisonment for terms of eight years and a fine of $5,000.00 on each of ten of the counts. The court suspended imposition of sentence as to count IV and placed the individuals on probation for a period of five years following the completion of the sentence of imprisonment under the other counts. Each of the four corporate defendants was fined the sum of $2,000.00 on each of the eleven counts, or $22,000.00 apiece, for a total of $88,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-20\">Asserted grounds for error are (1) that the searches and seizures conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agents were in violation of the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Amendment to the Constitution, (2) that certain statements made by the defendants to FDA agents were inadmissible because of violations of the Fifth Amendment, and (3) that the evidence was insufficient as to all criminal counts and the civil order of forfeiture and condemnation. In the main, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">I. The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Jamieson-McKames Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Jamieson-McKames) is a Missouri corporation with its principal place of business in St. Louis, Missouri. The company manufactured, purchased, packaged, labeled, distributed, and sold drugs from before June 1972 until November 1975. Jamieson-McKames sold drugs directly to doctors, clinics, and pharmacies through defendants Pharma-care, Inc., and Payless Pharmacy, Inc. Ja-mieson-McKames\u2019s activities were carried out by defendant James C. Jamieson, Sr.; defendant James C. Jamieson, Jr.; James C. Jamieson, III, a part-time employee; and approximately five other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Jamieson, Sr., was the president and treasurer of Jamieson-McKames and a member of its board of directors. He was also a member of the board of directors and vice-president and secretary of Pharmacare Generic Drugs and during 1975 a member of the board of directors of Pharmacare.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Jamieson, Jr., a board member, vice-president, and secretary of Jamieson-McKames, was also a member of the board of directors, president, and treasurer of each of the other corporate defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Defendants Pharmacare, Inc. (Pharma-care), Payless Pharmacy, Inc. (Payless) and Pharmacare Generic Drugs, Inc. (Pharma-care Generic) were also Missouri corporations engaged in the business of manufacturing, purchasing, packaging, labeling, distributing, and selling drugs. In addition, Pharmacare and Payless operated five and two retail pharmacies respectively. The operations of Pharmacare, Pharmacare Generic, and Payless were closely interrelated with each other and with those of Jamie-son-McKames. For example, the two Phar-macare pharmacies doing business in doctors\u2019 offices were opened only after an agreement was reached between Jamieson-McKames and the doctors in whose offices the pharmacies operated. Jamieson-McKames stocked the pharmacies, hired their employees, paid their bills, and shared the profits with the doctors. Drugs were frequently labeled with Pharmacare Payless Pharmacy labels whether the drug was for a Payless or a Pharmacare pharmacy, or for a pharmacy unconnected with any of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Bills owed by the pharmacies operated by Payless and Pharmacare were forwarded to their common principal place of business, which was at the same location as Jamie-son-McKames\u2019s principal place of business at 3227-29 Morganford Road in St. Louis. All of Pharmacare Generic\u2019s activities were carried out by Jamieson-McKames employees. Pharmacare Generic had no employees of its own, other than corporate officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">On October 29, 30, and 31, and November 3, 1975, federal and state agents entered and searched the premises of Jamieson-McKames Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Phar-macare, Inc., at 3227 Morganford Road, St. Louis, Missouri. Samples of drugs were taken, documents were taken, quantities of drugs were embargoed, the premises and contents photographed, and machinery seized. On October 29 and 30,1975, defendant\u2019s premises at 714 West Pierce Road, Wentzville, Missouri, were also searched, and similar items were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">A civil complaint for forfeiture of certain items of equipment in the defendant\u2019s possession was filed by the government in the district court on December 19, 1975, alleging that the equipment was used or designed for use in making counterfeit drugs. Jamieson-McKames Pharmaceuticals, Inc., denied the allegations in its answer filed February 19, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">Thereafter, on May 12, 1977, defendants were charged in an 11-count indictment with counterfeiting, adulterating, and mis-branding drugs and conspiracy to counterfeit, adulterate, and misbrand drugs. The indictment also charged that the defendants committed all of these acts with the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>to defraud and mislead, rendering such felonies punishable under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">II. The Fourth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The appellants contend that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the failure of the court to suppress evidence seized by government agents from the defendants\u2019 business premises at Wentzville, Missouri, and at the Morganford Road site in St. Louis, and from a building in St. Louis operated by the Chambers Medical Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">\n<em>The Wentzville Search</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The seizures at the Wentzville pharmacy were conducted on the authority of a notice to inspect authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 374(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The employee in charge was given a copy of the notice to inspect, but no warrant to inspect was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The Supreme Court has held that war-rantless searches are generally unreasonable, and that commercial premises as well as homes are within the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection. <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 312, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 1820, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978). An exception from the search-warrant requirement has, however, been delineated for industries \u201clong subject to close supervision and inspection,\u201d <em>Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 72, 77, 90 S.Ct. 774, 777, 25 L.Ed.2d 60 (1970), and \u201cpervasively regulated business[es],\u201d <em>United States v. Biswell, </em>406 U.S. 311, 316, 92 S.Ct. 1593, 1596, 32 L.Ed.2d 87 (1972). <em>Colonnade </em>involved the liquor industry, and <em>Biswell </em>the interstate sale of firearms. The threshold question therefore is whether the drug-manufacturing industry should be included within this class of closely regulated businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">The appellants argue that the drug-manufacturing industry is no more closely regulated than any number of industries involved in interstate commerce, and that therefore the rule of <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., supra, </em>requiring a warrant in the absence of consent before an administrative search can take place, should apply. In <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>the Supreme Court held that war-rantless searches authorized by \u00a7 8(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(a), violated the Fourth Amendment. There, however, the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>sought to inspect work areas not open to the public on the premises of an electrical and plumbing contractor. In <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>the argument that all businesses involved in interstate commerce had \u201clong been subject to close supervision\u201d of working conditions was urged by the Secretary of Labor but explicitly rejected by the Court. In rejecting this argument and others the Court specifically preserved the <em>Colonnade-Bis-well </em>exception to the warrant requirement. The Court indicated that there were other industries, covered by regulatory schemes applicable only to them, where regulation might be so pervasive that a <em>Colonnade-Bis-well </em>exception to the warrant requirement could apply. 436 U.S. at 313, 321, 98 S.Ct. at 1820, 1824.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Such warrantless searches are upheld because \u201cwhen an entrepreneur embarks on such a business, he has chosen to subject himself to a full arsenal of governmental regulation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 313, 98 S.Ct. at 1820 and \u201c \u2018in effect consents to the restrictions placed on him\u2019.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>citing <em>Almeida-San-chez v. United States, </em>413 U.S. 266, 271, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 2538, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973). Further, in the face of a long history of government scrutiny, such a proprietor has no \u201creasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We think the drug-manufacturing industry is properly within the <em>ColonnadeBiswell </em>exception to the warrant requirement. The drug-manufacturing industry has a long history of supervision and inspection. The present Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act has its origins in the Food and Drug Act of 1906, 34 Stat. 768. That Act was an attempt by Congress \u201cto exclude from interstate commerce impure and adulterated food and drugs ...\u201d and to prevent the transport of such articles \u201cfrom their place of manufacture.\u201d <em>McDermott v. Wisconsin, </em>228 U.S. 115, 128, 33 S.Ct. 431, 433, 57 L.Ed. 754 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The <em>Biswell </em>Court acknowledged that the history of regulation of interstate firearms traffic was \u201cnot as deeply rooted\u201d as the history of liquor regulation, but included firearms within the warrant exception because their regulation was of \u201ccentral importance to federal efforts to prevent violent crime and to assist the states in regulating the firearms traffic within their borders.\u201d <em>United States v. Biswell, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 315, 92 S.Ct. at 1596. This passage teaches that the nature of the federal or public interest sought to be furthered by the regulatory scheme is important to our analysis. See <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., supra, </em>436 U.S. at 337, 98 S.Ct. at 1833 (Stevens, J., dissenting). It is difficult to overstate the urgent nature of the public-health interests served by effective regulation of our nation\u2019s drug-manufacturing industry. Furthermore, virtually every phase of the drug industry is heavily regulated, from packaging, labeling, and certification of expiration dates,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to prior FDA approval before new drugs can be marketed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The regulatory burdens on the drug-manufacturing industry are weighty, and that weight indicates that the drug manufacturer accepts the burdens as well as the benefits of the business and \u201cconsents to the regulations placed on him.\u201d <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., supra, </em>436 U.S. at 313, 98 S.Ct. at 1820.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The final lesson of <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>is that the reasonableness of warrantless searches is dependent on the \u201cspecific enforcement needs and privacy guarantees of each statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 98 S.Ct. at 1824. In <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>the Court was unconvinced that requiring OSHA officials to obtain administrative warrants when consent to inspect was withheld would cripple the effective<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>ness of the enforcement scheme. The Court reasoned that most businessmen were likely to consent to inspections, and the Secretary\u2019s argument that a warrant requirement would impede enforcement was inconsistent with the fact that OSHA regulations promulgated by the Secretary themselves provided for obtaining warrants, even though the statute did not require it. <em>Id. </em>at 316-20, 98 S.Ct. at 1822-24. This Court is aware of no similar FDA regulation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Regulation of the drug industry differs from the OSHA situation in another significant way. The class sought to be protected by OSHA regulation of safety of work areas is made up of employees, who are in the work place itself and free to report violations at any time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The protected class in the area of drug manufacturing is the consuming public, which has no way of learning of violations short of illness resulting from the consumption of defective drug products. In this sense the enforcement needs of drug-industry regulation are considerably more critical than those before the Court in <em>Barlow\u2019s.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">As for privacy guarantees, the Supreme Court points out that a warrant provides assurances that the proposed \u201cinspection is reasonable under the Constitution, is authorized by statute, and is pursuant to an administrative plan containing specific neutral criteria.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323, 98 S.Ct. at 1825 (footnote omitted). The notice of inspection used in this case satisfies at least some of these criteria. It informs the \u201cowner or agent in charge\u201d (\u00a7 374(a)) of the \u201cscope and objects of the search.\u201d <em>Barlow\u2019s, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 323, 98 S.Ct. at 1825. Although the notice of inspection makes no express reference to reasonableness under the Constitution, it clearly states that notice is given pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 374, which is enacted by the Congress. The name of the firm and address is also prominently listed. Further, the notice of inspection reproduces large portions of \u00a7 374(a), stating the areas and objects to be searched; that the inspection is to take place at reasonable times; that certain records are to be made available to the inspector; that each inspection must be made with reasonable promptness; that each inspection must be accompanied by a separate notice; and that the purpose of any inspection of a prescription-drug operation is discovery of information \u201cbearing on whether prescription drugs [are being] adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of\u201d the Act or on other violations of the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 374(a). Equally important, the Notice of Inspection informs the owner of what cannot be examined by the inspector. Inspections relating to prescription drugs do not extend to financial data, pricing data, and certain data regarding sales, personnel, and research.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">In sum, the authorizing statute now before the Court was not painted with so broad a brush as the one rejected in <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>the enforcement needs are more critical in the drug-manufacturing field, and the interests of the general public are more urgent. We hold that inspections authorized by \u00a7 374 are \u201creasonable\u201d and therefore not inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment. Thus, this case falls within the \u201ccarefully defined classes of cases\u201d which are an exception to the search-warrant requirement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 528, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1730, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967). We share, to a degree, the fears expressed by appellants that many businesses are thoroughly regulated by the United States, and that an undue extension of our rationale might obliterate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>much of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection. On balance, however, we are persuaded that the capacity for good or ill of the manufacture of drugs for human consumption is so great that Congress had power to enact \u00a7 374(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Having concluded that drug manufacturing is a \u201cpervasively regulated\u201d industry does not end our inquiry,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but establishes only that Congress has broad authority to place restrictions on that industry that might otherwise violate the Fourth Amendment. A question remains as to whether the conduct of the government in this case conforms with the statutory scheme provided by the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The Court in <em>Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, supra, </em>confronted a very similar issue. There Internal Revenue Service agents, suspecting a violation of the federal excise tax law, sought to inspect an establishment where liquor was being served.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The owner refused to open a locked storeroom and asked if the agents had a search warrant. The agents answered that they didn\u2019t need a warrant, broke the lock, entered, and found evidence of regulatory violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">After emphasizing the long history of regulation of the sale of liquor, the Court acknowledged the broad authority of Congress to provide for inspections under the liquor laws. <em>Colonnade, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 75-76, 90 S.Ct. at 776-777. Under the existing statutory scheme, however, the Court concluded that Congress had not provided for \u201cforcible entries without a warrant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 77, 90 S.Ct. at 777. This conclusion was based on Congress\u2019s provision of a separate penalty for a dealer\u2019s refusal to permit an inspection.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Compare <em>Biswell, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 314, 92 S.Ct. at 1595. Consent being absent, the search was held invalid, and the evidence suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act contains provisions, similar to those addressed in <em>Colonnade, </em>which punish refusals to permit inspections by imprisonment up to one year, or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(f) and 333(a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It follows, therefore, as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>Colonnade, </em>that an inspection pursuant to a \u00a7 374 notice to inspect is authorized only when there is a valid consent. If consent is withheld, a separate violation of the Act occurs, and the FDA inspectors are required to obtain a warrant before the inspection can proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">This brings us to the problem presented by the search at the Wentzville site. Here, as in <em>Colonnade, </em>the critical issue is whether there was consent to the inspection.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Unfortunately this issue was not expressly resolved in the court below. The magistrate approved the Wentzville inspection but made no findings on the consent issue.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although there is evidence in the record from which consent could have been found, the trier of fact was not required to believe it, and we are not at liberty to make our own findings. Therefore, as to Counts VII and VIII, the counts as to which evidence was taken from the Wentzville site, the judgments of conviction will be vacated, and the cause remanded for the making of further findings on the issue of consent. The district court may hold a further hearing on this issue if it wishes, but the existing record may be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We add a word of clarification as to the meaning of the term \u201cconsent\u201d as we intend it in this context. We do not mean, by imposing a requirement of \u201cconsent,\u201d to require a factual determination as to whether appellants, with respect to the Wentzville site, knowingly and understandingly relinquished a known right. The question is whether appellants refused to permit entry or inspection, thereby violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(f). If they did so refuse, then FDA was obliged to obtain an administrative warrant in order to effect the inspection, and could also seek a separate criminal prosecution for the refusal itself. If appellants did not refuse to permit entry or inspection, then they \u201cconsented\u201d to the search and seizure, as we use that term here. This formulation, while it may not answer every question that may arise with respect to searches and seizures pursuant to \u00a7 374 notices of inspection, seems to us to be the most logical way to harmonize <em>Biswell </em>and <em>Colonnade. </em>As the court said in <em>United States v. Litvin, supra, </em>353 F.Supp. at 1338:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">Therefore, as in <em>Colonnade, </em>if defendant refused entry to the Food and Drug Administration inspectors he was in violation of \u00a7 331(f) and subject to one-year imprisonment and/or $1000 fine. But if defendant refused entry, the inspectors had no right to enter the storeroom, and following <em>Colonnade, </em>any evidence seized as a result of the search must be suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">\n<em>The Morganford Road Inspection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">The inspection and seizures conducted at the Morganford Road site were supported not only by a statutory notice, but also by a Warrant for Inspection issued by a United States Magistrate on October 23, 1975, and a Warrant for Arrest of Property issued by the clerk of the district court on October 29, 1975.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Appellants now argue that the inspection and seizures were illegal because the application for the warrant for inspection did not comply with traditional probable-cause standards. <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., supra, </em>however, teaches that \u201c[pjrobable cause in the criminal law sense is not required ...\u201d to secure a warrant for an administrative search. 436 U.S. at 320, 98 S.Ct. at 1824. Probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>cause for administrative-search purposes may be based on \u201cspecific evidence of an existing violation,\u201d <em>ibid, </em>(footnote omitted), or a \u201cshowing that \u2018reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an ... inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular [establishment].\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>citing <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 538, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1735, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967). Those standards are met here, where the application for the inspection warrant contained evidence of numerous violations of the FDCA, sworn to by an FDA investigator.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Appellants next argue that the inspections were part of an ongoing criminal investigation, and that therefore a warrant issued on less than criminal probable cause was not sufficient to authorize a search.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It is our view that a warrant based on an administrative showing of probable cause is valid in this pervasively regulated industry. To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with our conclusion, already expressed, that warrantless entry under a notice of inspection does not violate the Fourth Amendment in the drug-manufacturing field. Probable-cause standards are relaxed because the business person engaged in this industry has a lesser expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The appellants cite <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>436 U.S. 499, 512, 98 S.Ct. 1942, 1951, 56 L.Ed.2d 486 (1978), for the proposition that where the government has probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed, access to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution requires a warrant issued upon a traditional showing of probable cause. <em>Tyler </em>involved a series of searches by a fire marshal at the scene of a fire. During the initial inspection two containers of flammable liquid were found. Suspecting arson, the fire chief summoned police and turned over the containers. Later that day the marshal, continuing his initial investigation, discovered suspicious burn marks on some carpet and other evidence of arson. Some weeks later fire officials returned to the premises on several occasions to gather evidence. The Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ata\">an entry to fight a fire requires no warrant, and that once in the building, officials may remain there for a reasonable time to investigate the cause of the blaze. Thereafter, additional entries to investigate the cause of the fire must be made pursuant to the warrant procedures governing administrative searches. Evidence of arson discovered in the course of such investigations is admissible at trial, but if the investigating officials find probable cause to believe that arson has occurred and require further access to gather evidence for possible prosecution, they may obtain a warrant only upon a traditional showing of probable cause applicable to searches for evidence of a-crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 511-12, 98 S.Ct. at 1950-51 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The answer is that <em>Tyler </em>did not involve pervasively regulated industries, which the Supreme Court has referred to as \u201cexceptions\u201d that are \u201cresponses to relatively unique circumstances.\u201d <em>Barlow's, </em>436 U.S. at 313, 98 S.Ct. at 1820. The rule in <em>Tyler </em>rests on a different foundation from the rule applicable to pervasively regulated industries. In <em>Tyler </em>the Court said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>there is no diminution in a person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy nor in the protection of the Fourth Amendment simply because the official conducting the search wears the uniform of a firefighter rather than a policeman, ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">436 U.S. at 506, 98 S.Ct. at 1948. In the case of the inspection to discover the cause of a fire, the reasonable expectation of privacy remains, but the basis for the pervasively-regulated-industry exception to the warrant requirement is that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. See <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>436 U.S. at 313, 98 S.Ct. at 1820. Therefore, <em>Tyler </em>is not determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">For these reasons we hold that in the case of a pervasively regulated industry warrants based on an administrative showing of probable cause are valid so long as the extent of the intrusion is limited to the purposes specified in the statute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>the Supreme Court indicated that specific evidence of an existing violation (and the FDA had such evidence here) could justify a search based upon an administrative warrant, even though OSHA contains criminal as well as civil penalties. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666. Thus the evidence from the Morganford Road site was not seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment and was properly admissible at trial.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The question of consent, discussed above with respect to the Wentzville site, does not arise here, because the agents did obtain a warrant based on a valid administrative showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\n<em>The Chambers Medical Group Search</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">During the course of the trial an issue arose concerning several searches of a dispensary in the ground-floor area of the Chambers Medical Group building in St. Louis, owned by a Dr. Salit. Appellants question the legality of these searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">A Dr. Eckert testified that he and Dr. Salit were \u201cpartners\u201d in a \u201ccorporation\u201d engaged in the practice of medicine in the building. The doctors made arrangements with Jamieson, Jr., to open a dispensary on the lower floor of \u201ctheir\u201d building. Jamie-son, Jr., was to pay rent, hire employees, pay for the utilities, stock the dispensary, and pay all other ancillary expenses, and at the end of each month the profits were to be divided between the doctors\u2019 corporation and Jamieson, Jr. There was further testimony that the dispensary ceased doing business on October 29, 1975, after there were reports in the press of the searches at Mor-ganford Road. During and after the period when the dispensary was operating (roughly April 1975 to October 29, 1975), both doctors and their employees had unlimited access to the dispensary and had their own keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">The agent who conducted the searches testified that he visited the store on November 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, and 24, 1975. He also testified that after he presented his credentials Dr. Eckert let him in and gave permission to collect samples. The district court ruled that Dr. Eckert had capacity to consent to the search and that he did give his consent to the FDA inspector. The lower court\u2019s ruling was based on <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974), in which the Supreme Court said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">proof of voluntary consent [to a warrant-less search], ... is not limited to proof that consent was given by the defendant, but may show that permission to search was obtained from a third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 171, 94 S.Ct. at 993 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">We agree with the district court. The agent obtained entry to the dispensary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>area after Dr. Eckert \u201coffered him a key,\u201d and there were no threats or overbearing assertions of authority. The doctors and Jamieson, Jr., were in effect in business together, and Dr. Eckert\u2019s authority to consent to the searches cannot be seriously questioned. Therefore the searches at the Chambers Medical Group building were not in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">III. <em>Miranda </em>Warnings</p>\n<p id=\"AXy\">Appellants next argue that certain statements made by the defendants to FDA agents during the searches were inadmissible at trial because <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not given. See <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The district court held that <em>Miranda </em>was not applicable because \u201cthe evidence failed to establish that defendants ... were in a custodial situation, subject to arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Evidence presented at trial showed that FDA agents are without authority to make arrests, that the defendants\u2019 movements were not restricted during the time of the search, and that there were no threats or coercion. Evidence also indicated that appellants\u2019 employees were free to go about their business, and that consultation with attorneys was not limited. There is ample evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding, and the statements were therefore properly admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">IV. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Appellants next argue that there was insufficient evidence to support conviction of any of the 11 counts charged. The substantive counts II through XI will be discussed first, with the conspiracy charge, count I, discussed last.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Count II of the indictment alleged, and the district court found, that the defendants sold counterfeit Motrin tablets to a Dr. Zack Bames of Kansas City, Missouri, with the intent to defraud and mislead. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321(g)(2), 331(i)(3), and 333(b). A \u201ccounterfeit drug\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av7\">a drug which, or the container or labeling of which, without authorization, bears the trademark, trade name, or other identifying mark, imprint, or device, or any likeness thereof, of a drug manufacturer . . . other than the person or persons who in fact manufactured, processed, packed, or distributed such drug and which thereby falsely purports or is represented to be the product of ... such other drug manufacturer ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(g)(2). \u201cMotrin\u201d is the trademark of the Upjohn Company used for the drug ibuprofen since 1970. UpjShn has never authorized any of the defendants to manufacture ibuprofen or to use the trademark Motrin. Since October 1974, Upjohn has manufactured and distributed Motrin tablets, which are coated, round, orange tablets with the logo \u201cUpjohn 750\u201d on one side. When Motrin was first marketed, demand exceeded supply, resulting in a nation-wide shortage from late 1974 until late 1975. During the Motrin shortage in June of 1975, Jamieson, Jr., ordered and received 200,000 magnesium salicylate tablets from C.M. Bundy Company of Cincinnati, Ohio. At Jamieson, Jr.\u2019s, request C.M. Bundy manufactured the tablets to resemble a Motrin tablet. Sometime after this, in response to an order by Dr. Zack Barnes, Jamieson-McKames sent Dr. Barnes a bottle with \u201cMotrin\u201d printed on a Pharmacare Payless label, thereby falsely representing the contents as Motrin.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction on count II. Where a trial, like this one, is to the court rather than a jury, the standard of review is \u201cwhether there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the government, to support the fact determination by the trial court.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>United States v. Cady, 567 </em>F.2d 771, 774 (8th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 944, 98 S.Ct. 1526, 55 L.Ed.2d 541 (1978); <em>United States v. Marley, </em>549 F.2d 561, 563 (8th Cir. 1977). This standard is more than adequately met for count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">\n<em>Count III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Count III charged, and the district court found, that the defendants caused the mis-branding of magnesium salicylate tablets as \u201cMotrin formula\u201d while they were held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(k) and 333(b). A drug is \u201cmisbranded\u201d \u201c[i]f its labeling is false or misleading.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Magnesium salicylate tablets were shippedj. in bulk in interstate commerce by C.M. Bundy of Cincinnati, Ohio, to the appellants, who then packed the tablets in bottles labeled \u201cMotrin formula.\u201d There was testimony that the \u201cMotrin formula\u201d label represented the tablets to be products of the Upjohn Company and to contain ibuprofen, both of which representations proved to be false. There was further testimony of FDA investigators who presented prescriptions for Motrin at various pharmacies operated by appellants that they were sold magnesium salicylate tablets instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">It is noteworthy that the above listed incidents were not isolated ones, according to evidence presented at trial. There was testimony that the appellants made similar shipments to a Pharmacare pharmacy in St. Clair, Missouri, and to the Chambers Group dispensary, where the tablets were routinely dispensed as Motrin. This pattern is important, because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333(b) provides for more severe penalties for violations of the Act accompanied by the intent to defraud or mislead. The trial court\u2019s finding on this element of the crime is more than amply supported by the record. The judgment of conviction on count III is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">\n<em>Count IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Count IV of the indictment alleged that the appellants held for sale counterfeit \u201cValium\u201d with the intent to defraud and mislead in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(i)(3) and 333(b). The district court found that the appellants sold and held for sale bottles of diazepam tablets which bore the trademark \u201cValium,\u201d a trademark held by Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc., which never authorized its use by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">It was stipulated at trial that appellants were not authorized to use the trademark or to manufacture diazepam. The government also introduced at trial a bottle labeled \u201cValium\u201d that was seized in the retail section of the pharmacy on Morganford Road. The tablets were virtually the same size, shape, and color as the Hoffman-La-Roche product. Jamieson-McKames obtained bulk diazepam from Gyma Laboratories, and the tablets were then manufactured at Morganford Road and labeled as valium. Jamieson, Sr., was said to have made \u201cValium\u201d two to four times a month during the period between 1972 and the time of the inspection in October of 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">There is ample evidence to sustain the convictions on count IV, especially considering the frequency and duration of the violations. The appellants\u2019 use of diazepam contrary to the patent seemed to be a calculated effort to substitute their product for the brand-name drug. The district court\u2019s judgment of conviction on count IV is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">\n<em>Count V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">Count V of the indictment charged the appellants with causing the adulteration of a drug held for sale with the intent to defraud and mislead in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 881(k) and 333(b). A drug is \u201cadulterated\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-15\">if it is a drug and the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to or are not operated or administered in conformity with current good manufacturing practice to assure that such drug meets the requirements of this chapter as to safety and has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics, which it purports or is represented to possess</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B). If the drug is not recognized in an official compendium, it is also adulterated if its \u201cstrength differs from, or its purity or quality falls below, that which it purports or is represented to possess.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(c).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Evidence presented at trial tended to show the following: In January 1975, pursuant to an order from Pharmacare Generics, a shipment of potassium phenoxymethyl penicillin (pen V) with an expiration date of August 1975, was sent from Zenith Laboratories in New Jersey to appellants\u2019 place of business in St. Louis, Missouri. During the ensuing months up to the time of the inspections at Morganford Road, bottles of pen Y were relabeled. The replacement labels bore the name Pharmacare Generic, Inc., rather than Zenith Laboratories, Inc., and read in part, \u201cCherri-Penn\u201d ..., \u201cFlavored Potassium Penicillin G\u201d ..., \u201cExp. Date: 7/77.\u201d No records were kept of this relabeling procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">During the FDA inspections at the Mor-ganford site the pen V bottles were found in the wholesale section of the pharmacy. One of the boxes with a Zenith pen V label on the outside contained 18 bottles with Pharmacare Generic labels. The Pharma-care Generic labels represented that the bottles contained potassium penicillin G (pen G).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Our examination of the record reveals evidence of the appellants\u2019 failure to keep records of the receipt, repacking, and labeling of the pen V. This evidence supports a conviction under \u00a7 351(aX2XB) because of a lack of conformity \u201cwith current good manufacturing practice.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Evidence presented also supports conviction under \u00a7 351(c), because the bottles in question contained pen V rather than pen G, thus rendering the strength and purity of the substance different from what the labels represented. We therefore affirm the judgment of conviction on Count V.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">\n<em>Count VI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Count VI also involves the appellants\u2019 relabeling of the bottles of pen V. According to the indictment the drugs labeled, in part, \u201cFlavored Potassium Penicillin G Powder\u201d ..., \u201cExp. Date 7/77,\u201d were in violation of \u00a7 352(a), which deems a drug misbranded if its label is false or misleading. The drug was also said to be mis-branded under \u00a7 352(1), in that it was represented to be composed of penicillin, at least in part, and there was no certificate in effect as to the drug.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Evidence presented at trial indicated that in January 1975 the appellants purchased bottles of pen V powder which was certified until August 1975. There was testimony that such a product could be obtained at a reduced price because the expiration date was so near. Jamieson, Jr., was said to have directed Jamieson-McKames employees to replace the pen V labels with pen G labels and to extend the expiration date to July 1977. The expiration date on the label of the \u201cFlavored Potassium Penicillin G Powder\u201d was not approved by the FDA and was not based on stability testing, as required by 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 432.5(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">This evidence supports a conviction of misbranding under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(1), in that the drug contained penicillin and was not properly certified. Although, as originally labeled, the drug was certified by the FDA, the certification ceased to be effective when the labeling was altered. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.11(a)(2). The drugs were also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>misbranded within the meaning of \u00a7 352(a) because their labels were \u201cfalse or misleading.\u201d The evidence established that the expiration date was false, and that the bottles did not contain pen G as represented on the label. The evidence is sufficient under either of the above provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Appellants argue that there was insufficient evidence to show that the bottles of pen G were \u201cheld for sale\u201d as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(k). The argument is based on considerable testimony at trial indicating that the section of the pharmacy jn which the pen G bottles were stored was a designated quarantine area reserved for products that were not for sale. This testimony was not uncontradicted, however. One former employee testified that she never heard that section of the pharmacy referred to as a quarantine area. An FDA inspector also testified that one of the pharmacists, Mr. Abelson, told him during the inspection that all drugs in the section were to be sold. The inspector testified further that there were no signs designating a quarantine area. The record is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the drugs were being held for sale. The statute does not require that sales actually take place. The trial court found that appellants purchased bottles of a soon-to-expire drug, removed the labels, and replaced them with labels bearing false information. Inferring from these facts an intent to market the drugs is only common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Appellants next argue that counts V and VI involve identical proof, and that therefore the district court erred in permitting prosecution of both counts based on the same conduct. They point out that both counts are laid under the same statutes, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(k) and 333(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">This argument is contrary to <em>United States v. Wiesenfeld Warehouse Co., </em>376 U.S. 86, 84 S.Ct. 559, 11 L.Ed.2d 536 (1964),. which specifically dealt with the scope of \u00a7 331(k). There the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">The language of \u00a7 [331(k)] unambiguously defines two distinct offenses with respect to food held for sale after interstate shipment. As originally enacted in 1938, the subsection prohibited \u201c[t]he alteration, mutilation, destruction, obliteration, or removal\u201d of the label, or \u201cthe doing of any other act\u201d with respect to the product which \u201cresults in such article being misbranded.\u201d The section was amended in 1948 to prohibit additionally \u201cthe doing of any other act\u201d with respect to the product which \u201cresults in such article being adulterated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 89, 84 S.Ct. at 562 (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, it is clear that separate prosecutions for misbranding drugs and adulterating drugs are consistent with the intent of Congress and are within the language of the statute. Nor do counts V and VI conflict with the rule of <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">The applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"anf-dedup-0\">The proof required by count V involved, among other things, lack of conformity with good manufacturing practices by failure to keep adequate records of the relabeling process. This conduct comes within \u201cthe doing of any other act\u201d which \u201cresults in such article being adulterated.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(k). The misbranding charged in count VI was proved by evidence of \u201calteration of the labeling\u201d that rendered the label false or misleading. These crimes are distinct, and different facts were proved to support conviction. For example, had the appellants removed the Zenith Laboratories labels and replaced them with Pharmacare labels which were accurate in every way, the failure to keep records of the relabeling process would still support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>charge of adulteration. The government need not prove that the labels were false or misleading as required for a misbranding charge, but only that current good manufacturing practice was not followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">There is ample evidence in the record to support the judgment of conviction on count VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\n<em>Counts VII and VIII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AeEB\">Count VII of the indictment alleged and the district court found that the appellants held for sale counterfeit Cleocin tablets. \u201cCleocin\u201d is the trademark of the Upjohn Company for the drug clindamycin hydrochloride. Upjohn also holds the patent for clindamycin. Count VII is based on a bottle with a Pharmacare Payless label, labeled \u201c300 Cleocin 150 mg.,\u201d which was held for sale at the Wentzville pharmacy. The bottle was said to be a \u201ccounterfeit drug\u201d because its label bore the trademark \u201cCleo-cin\u201d without the authorization of the Upjohn Company. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(g)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Evidence introduced at trial indicated that Jamieson-McKames received shipments of encapsulated tetracycline at the Morgan-ford Road premises. These capsules were then emptied by Jamieson-McKames employees and later used to fill capsules which were bottled and labeled as \u201cCleocin.\u201d Further testimony showed that the \u201cCleocin\u201d made from tetracycline was manufactured on a regular basis during 1974 and 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Count VIII is based on the same bottle labeled \u201cCleocin\u201d from the Wentzville pharmacy. Count VIII alleged the appellants caused the misbranding of the Cleocin under three separate sections of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. First, the drug was said to be misbranded within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(a) because the statement \u201c300 Cleocin 150 mg.\u201d appearing on the label represented the drug to contain clindamycin hydrochloride when it contained tetracycline. Misbranding under \u00a7 352(a) requires only that the label be false or misleading. Second, the Cleocin was alleged to be misbranded under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(j), which deems a drug misbranded \u201cif it is dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof.\u201d Third, the \u201cCleocin\u201d was said to be misbranded under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(7), because it purported to be the antibiotic drug clindamycin hydrochloride, but it was from a batch for which no certificate had been issued pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The record reveals the following evidence relative to count VIII. The bottle labeled Cleocin contained capsules very similar in size, shape, and color to Upjohn\u2019s Cleocin 150 mg. FDA analysis showed the capsules contained tetracycline, a yellow powder, and no clindamycin. The reencapsulating process was accomplished by Jamieson, Sr., Jamieson, Jr., and several employees under Jamieson, Sr.\u2019s supervision. These capsules were then bottled and labeled with a Phar-macare Payless Pharmacy label and held for sale at the Wentzville pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">In addition the government presented expert testimony indicating that the substitution of tetracycline for clindamycin hydrochloride would create significant health risks, including the risk of death, to patients for whom clindamycin is prescribed.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">Lastly, clindamycin was shown to be an antibiotic which must be certified by the FDA prior to marketing. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 357(a); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 430.4(a)(34). It was also shown that the drug in question was not certified, and that appellants did not request certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">The evidence in the record outlined above is sufficient to sustain convictions on counts VII and VIII. The bottle of capsules that is the basis of these counts, however, was obtained through the inspection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Wentzville site. As was discussed earlier, the issue of the legality of the Wentzville search is unresolved pending remand to the district court on the issue of consent. Thus the judgments of conviction on counts VII and VIII must be vacated, subject to reinstatement or dismissal depending on the resolution of the consent-to-inspect issue. If the government wishes to pursue these counts, and the district court finds that there was a valid consent to the inspection under \u00a7 374(a), the convictions can be reinstated, subject of course to appeal. If consent is found lacking, counts VII and VIII should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">\n<em>Count IX</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Count IX of the indictment charged, and the district court found, that the appellants caused the adulteration of a drug sold as \u201cAmpicillin\u201d in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(k) and \u00a7 333(b). According to the indictment the drug was adulterated in two ways: (1) within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B), because of failure to follow current good manufacturing practice, and (2) under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(b), because the strength of the drug differed from the standards set forth in an official compendium.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Evidence relevant to count IX showed the following: Pursuant to an order by Jamie-son, Jr., Pharmacare received a shipment of potassium penicillin G (pen G) pills from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works in Raleigh, North Carolina. Because Mallinckrodt was discontinuing sales of antibiotics, drugs like pen G were available at reduced prices. The tablets were then ground up in a coffee grinder and packed into capsules which were then placed in bottles of 1000 each and labeled \u201cAmpicillin.\u201d These bottles were placed in the wholesale section of the pharmacy<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and were used to fill orders for ampicillin.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">The evidence supports a finding of adulteration of drugs for failure to follow current good manufacturing practices during the processing and packing of the drug. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B). FDA regulations interpreting \u201ccurrent good manufacturing practice\u201d require production and control procedures to include \u201call reasonable precautions\u201d to assure the safety, strength, quality, and purity of the drugs produced. The evidence indicates the appellants did not meet these standards. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 211.-40. Nor did appellants keep adequate records of the significant steps in the production process, as required by 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 211.40(a). FDA investigators specifically asked for, but were not shown, manufacturing records for ampicillin.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">The evidence also supports a charge of adulteration as defined by \u00a7 351(b), because the drug\u2019s strength, quality or purity differed from the standards set forth in a recognized compendium. Both pen G and ampicillin are drugs recognized by the United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.), but they are different from each other and have different pharmacological effects. A product containing pen G cannot meet the standard for ampicillin; thus, the strength of the drug differed from the standard set out in the U.S.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">The evidence on count IX is far from insufficient. Accordingly the judgments of conviction on count IX are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">\n<em>Count X</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">Count X charges that the \u201campicillin\u201d that was the basis of count IX was also misbranded within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(a), (j), and (7), thus violating \u00a7\u00a7 331(k) and 333(b). Misbranding under \u00a7 352(a) occurs whenever a drug\u2019s label is false or misleading. Section 352(j) deems a drug misbranded when it is dangerous to health when used in the manner or dosage prescribed. Finally, a drug is within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>proscription of \u00a7 352(7) when it is composed, at least in part, of an antibiotic, and the certification or release requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 357 have not been met. Section 357 requires that antibiotics be certified prior to their sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Evidence presented at trial showed bottles of drugs were labeled \u201c1000 AMPICIL-LIN 250,\u201d a label representing them to contain ampicillin, when they actually contained pen G. Thus the drugs\u2019 labels were false and misleading under \u00a7 352(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Testimony of an expert witness called by the government indicated that the substitution of pen G for ampicillin was dangerous to health, because the drugs have different uses and properties. Pen G and ampicillin are effective against different types of infections. Pen G can be used for Gram-positive infections but not Gram-negative ones. Ampicillin, although effective against both types, was developed specifically to treat Gram-negative infections. The substitution of pen G for ampicillin would result in ineffective treatment of Gram-negative infections. In addition, the absorption rates of the two drugs are very different, so different doses of each are required. Thus even in those instances when both drugs are generally effective, replacement of ampicil-lin with pen G could result in ineffective treatment. The drug was therefore dangerous to health when used in the manner and dosage prescribed. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Lastly, the evidence proved that pen G and ampicillin are antibiotic drugs that must be certified by the FDA prior to marketing. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 357; 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 430.-4(a)(1). Once an antibiotic is certified by the FDA, an expiration date is specified. The bottles of \u201cAmpicillin\u201d found at Mor-ganford Road were not certified, nor had certification been requested. This lack of certification amounted to misbranding under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The record supports the trial court\u2019s findings under all of the above statutory provisions. The judgments of conviction on count X are affirmed.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">count <em>XI</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">Count XI charges, and the district court found, that the defendants caused the mis-branding of Neomycin-Polymyxin eardrops under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 352(a) and 352(7). The statement \u201cExpiration date 8/76\u201d appearing on the label was said to be false and misleading and thus within \u00a7 352(a). The eardrops were also alleged to contain derivatives of the antibiotics neomycin and poly-myxin, which are subject to certification and release requirements. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 357(a); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.4(a)(16), 430.-4(a)(23). The failure to meet these requirements was said to render the drugs mis-branded under \u00a7 352(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">The record showed the following: Neo-mycin-Polymyxin eardrops with hydrocorti-sone and disperodon are drugs. Bottles of the eardrops were shipped to Jamieson-McKames from Atlanta, Georgia, pursuant to an order of Jamieson, Jr., in September of 1974. The eardrops bore an expiration date of July 1975. During the summer of 1975 Jamieson, Jr., directed Jamieson-McKames employees to remove the labels on the eardrops and replace them with labels with an expiration date of 8/76. This operation was carried out on several occasions. The eardrops were then distributed by Pharmacare Generic and Pharmacare according to the statement on the label. A number of the bottles were shipped from Morganford Road to the Payless Pharmacy in Salem, Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">The appellants, moreover, never filed a request with the FDA for certification of the eardrops with the extended expiration date. Any such change would have had to be based on stability tests, and none was conducted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">The above evidence amply supports the trial court\u2019s findings of misbranding under \u00a7\u00a7 352(a) and (7) and the ultimate violations of \u00a7\u00a7 331(k) and 333(b). The judgments of conviction on count XI are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Count I of the indictment alleged, and the district court found, that the appellants engaged in a conspiracy from January 1, 1974, to November 5, 1975, to violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321-392. The indictment charges that the appellants, with the intent to defraud and mislead, sold and dispensed counterfeit drugs in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(iX3) and 333(b), and manufactured, processed, packed, and labeled drugs in such a way that they were adulterated and mis-branded in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(k) and 333(b). In furtherance of the conspiracy, at least one of the appellants was alleged to have committed at least one of eight overt acts listed in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Appellants now challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the conspiracy charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">There is ample evidence in the record that the appellants collaborated in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and labeling of drugs in violation of various provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A review of the evidence presented in our discussion of counts II through XI demonstrates continuous, widespread violations of the Act, the involvement of each of the individual defendants, and the participation of the interconnecting corporate entities. For example, Morgan-ford Road was the site of various operations of each of the four corporate defendants. Bills owed by the several retail pharmacies were forwarded to the Morganford Road address. Jamieson, Jr., was a corporate board member of all four corporations, and Jamieson, Sr., was a board member of three of the four. The district court found, and the evidence supports the finding, that Ja-mieson, Sr., and Jr. had complete control of the various corporate defendants and used them to suit their own purposes. Nor does the evidence paint a picture of compartmentalized corporate functions, with information available to one corporation but not available to another. The unity of action was nearly complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The law has long recognized that the existence of a conspiracy need not be shown by direct proof, but that the common purpose or plan can be inferred from circumstantial evidence. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Here, the evidence is not reflective of isolated or inadvertent instances of adulteration, misbranding, and counterfeiting, but of a continuous pattern of illegal conduct. The district court\u2019s finding of an agreement to violate the Act is fully supported. Our discussion of counts II-VI and IX-XI demonstrates the existence of adequate proof of several of the overt acts charged in the indictment.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> What emerges is an overall plan to substitute less expensive drugs for more expensive, disregarding the safety of the public and the provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">\n<em>Civil Action for Condemnation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">The civil action was brought pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 334(a)(2)(C), which authorizes condemnation of \u201c[a]ny punch, die, plate, stone, labeling, container, or other thing used or designed for use in making a counterfeit drug or drugs.\u201d The various articles of equipment involved here were seized on December 19,1975, at the Morganford Road premises and consist of the following:<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">1) .

Four Dies corresponding to the four sets of Punches.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Appellant<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> now appeals the condemnation and forfeiture of the above items of equipment. We have carefully examined the evidence of record as to each item condemned, and the judgment in the civil case is affirmed. The district court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous (indeed, they are clearly correct), and no error of law appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">The judgments of conviction on Counts I-VI and IX-XI are affirmed. The judgment of condemnation in the civil action is affirmed. The judgments of conviction on Counts VII and VIII are vacated, and the cause remanded for further proceedings (if desired by the United States) as to those counts, in accordance with Part II of this opinion. As a result, the total time of imprisonment is reduced from eight years to seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-14\">. The Hon. John F.

While it is true that the Morganford Road inspection, to be discussed below, was conducted pursuant to an administrative warrant obtained six days prior to the actual search, this fact does not necessarily weaken the FDA\u2019s argument that warrants as a matter of policy should not be required. The fact that a warrant was obtained on one occasion does not mean that it is practicable to do so in every instance. More important for our analysis, and seemingly also for the Court in <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>is the existence <em>vel non </em>of formal regulations that are inconsistent with the stated needs of enforcement. We find none here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\">. \u201c29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(f)(1) provides that employees or their representatives may give written notice to the Secretary of what they believe to be violations of safety or health standards and may request an inspection.\u201d <em>Barlow\u2019s, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 320 n.16, 98 S.Ct. at 1824 n.16.

The Court in <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>noted that \u201c[d]elineat-ing the scope of a search with some care is particularly important where documents are involved.\u201d <em>Barlow\u2019s, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 324 n.22, 98 S.Ct. at 1826 n.22. We are persuaded that \u00a7 374(a) shows some sensitivity to this concern.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\">. Several courts have addressed this or similar issues. In accord with our conclusion is <em>United States </em>v. <em>New England Grocers Supply Co., </em>488 F.Supp. 230 (D.Mass.1980). This case involved evidence seized during inspection of a food-supply warehouse pursuant to \u00a7 374. <em>United States v. Acri Wholesale Grocery Co., </em>409 F.Supp. 529 (S.D. Iowa 1976), decided prior to <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>found warrantless searches authorized by \u00a7 374 to be consistent with those allowed in <em>Biswell. United States v. Business Builders, Inc., </em>354 F.Supp. 141 (N.D.Okla.1973), was another <em>pre-Barlow\u2019s </em>case involving food. Relying on <em>Biswell, </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">It would be an affront to common sense to say that the public interest is not as deeply involved in the regulation of the food industry as it is in the liquor and firearms industries. (Footnote omitted). One need only call to mind recent cases of deaths occurring from botulism. Modem commerce has devised such an efficient and rapid means of distribution of food products to the consumer that a batch of contaminated food may cause widespread illness and death before the public can be warned and the contaminated products removed from the market.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">354 F.Supp. at 143. In <em>United States v. Del Campo Baking Mfg. Co., </em>345 F.Supp. 1371 (D.Del.1972), still another food case, the court considered the regulatory scheme under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to be as pervasive as the licensing scheme in <em>Biswell. Post-Biswell </em>cases holding a search warrant required in the absence of consent include <em>United States v. Roux Laboratories, </em>456 F.Supp. 973 (M.D.Fla.1978) (where consent refused, a warrant is necessary). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Litvin, </em>353 F.Supp. 1333 (D.D.C.1973), considering a motion to suppress evidence seized during a routine inspection of a food warehouse. The court treats the food industry as a closely regulated one but requires a warrant when consent to inspect is withheld. Compare the discussion of <em>Colonnade </em>in text <em>infra. Cf. Donovan v.

See <em>United States v. Litvin, </em>353 F.Supp. 1333 (D.D.C.1973), where the court distinguished <em>Bisweii </em>on this basis. See also <em>United States v. Kramer Grocery Co., </em>418 F.2d 987 (8th Cir. 1969). This case affirmed a ruling that valid consent was necessary before FDA had authority to conduct a warrantless inspection under \u00a7 374. Although the rationale of <em>Kramer </em>is inconsistent with our reading of the later-decided cases of <em>Colonnade </em>and <em>Biswell, </em>the holding of <em>Kramer </em>is still valid in the food and drug areas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\">. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation. It relied on <em>Biswell, </em>but that case is not dispositive as to the Wentzville site, because under the <em>Colonnade </em>analysis described above, if consent is refused after a notice of inspection is served, the refusal of consent may be separately prosecuted, but entry cannot be forced without a warrant. This result follows not because Congress <em>could not </em>authorize entry under a notice of inspection over objection, but because, in the food-and-drug area, just as in the liquor area, it <em>has not </em>done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b600-15\">. Although 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 374 authorizes FDA agents to take samples of drugs during an inspection, an in rem action is required if large quantities of drugs or equipment are to be seized. For this reason the FDA obtained the Warrant for Arrest of Property pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 334(a)(1), which provides procedures closely conforming to those in admiralty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b601-6\">. The application stated that the FDA had information that Jamieson-McKames had received magnesium salicylate tablets from outside the State of Missouri which were made to look like Motrin, a drug manufactured by the Upjohn Company; that the drugs were repacked into bottles labeled with the Motrin brand name; that the FDA had other information indicating Jamieson-McKames packaged or manufactured other drugs which resembled brand-name drugs in shape and appearance; and that Jamieson-McKames was marketing drugs that required prior administrative approval when no applications for approval were on file with the FDA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b601-11\">. There was evidence that the FDA investigators were accompanied by law-enforcement officers from the State of Missouri. Also, on several occasions prior to the Morganford Road inspection FDA agents made undercover buys of defective drugs at various pharmacies owned by the appellants. The appellants argue that there can be little doubt that the government contemplated bringing criminal charges. The evidence supports this view.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\">. A different issue would be presented where inspectors used their regulatory authority to gather evidence of a crime or violation outside the scope of the authorizing statute. That case is not presented here, where only violations of the FDCA were prosecuted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b602-14\">. We have considered and hold to be without merit appellants\u2019 statutory argument that searches of pharmacies here were invalid under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 374(a)(1). Appellants\u2019 pharmacies were closely related to their manufacturing activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b603-11\">. The FDA analysis established that the drug contained no ibuprofen. The fact that the tablets did not contain Motrin\u2019s active ingredient, ibuprofen, is not relevant to the charge of counterfeiting. The essence of counterfeiting is the unauthorized use of the trademark, trade name, or other identifying mark. Thus, even if the tablets were chemically indistinguishable from Motrin, counterfeiting could still be found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\">. Appellants were charged in Count V under \u00a7 351(c) as well as under \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B), because Cherri-Penn flavored Potassium Penicillin powder, the drug involved, is not recognized in an official compendium, the United States Pharmacopeia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\">. Appellants\u2019 argument that \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B) is unconstitutionally vague is without merit. The constitutionality of the statute was upheld against a vagueness charge in <em>United States v. Article of Drug, </em>484 F.2d 748 (7th Cir. 1973). In addition, interpretive regulations have been promulgated by the Secretary. Specifically, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 211.80 describes proper record-keeping procedures for packaging and labeling operations. These standards are clear and have not been met by the appellants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b605-15\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 357 requires that all drugs containing penicillin be certified as to strength, quality, and the like, and be assigned an expiration date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">.

Dr. Joseph Marr, the government\u2019s expert, testified that tetracycline and clindamycin are used to treat different types of infections. Thus, a substitution could result in ineffective therapy. Furthermore, tetracycline only arrests the growth of micro-organisms rather than killing them. Tetracycline can also cause liver degeneration in pregnant women and impair bone development in the fetus. Clindamy-cin, on the other hand, does not pose such dangers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">. The \u201campicillin\u201d that is the basis of counts IX and X was seized at the Morganford Road premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\">.

Mallinckrodt sold the 250 mg. pen G tablets to Jamieson, Jr., for $9.00 per thousand. Ampicillin was also available, but at a price of $60-70 per thousand. Mallinckrodt sold no ampicillin to the appellants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">. Appellants argue that Counts IX and X improperly charge two crimes based on the same conduct. For reasons similar to those discussed above with respect to Counts V and VI, we reject this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\">.
