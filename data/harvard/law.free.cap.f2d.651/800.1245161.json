(Main) is an engineering firm incorporated in Massachusetts and having its principal place of business in Boston. On November 20,1979, Main brought suit in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the government of Iran and various Iranian governmental entities to obtain payment for services it had rendered in Boston and Iran in connection with certain Iranian electrification projects. <em>Chas. T. Main International, Inc. v. Khuzestan Water &amp; Power Authority, </em>No. 79-2304C <em>(Main v. KWPA). </em>Main\u2019s claims in that case are for services alleged to have been performed under two contracts: one contract called for engineer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ing and consulting services to develop a hydroelectric power plant on Iran\u2019s Karun River; this was with Mahab Consulting Engineers (though performed for the benefit of the Khuzestan Water &amp; Power Authority and Iran\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources). The other contract involved miscellaneous services under a \u201cGeneral Services Agreement\u201d between Mahab and \u201cParsmain,\u201d an \u201cIranian\u201d corporation partially owned by Main. Main\u2019s complaint contains a further allegation that the Central Bank of Iran, now Bank Markazi Iran, wrongfully failed to transmit a payment order of $378,000 authorized by Mahab. Damages totalling $3,256,787.26 are claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The above suit was preceded by dramatic events. On November 4, 1979, American hostages were seized at the United States Embassy in Teheran. That hostile and unprecedented act precipitated a crisis in relations between Iran and the United States. On November 14, 1979, in response to the taking of hostages, President Carter declared a national emergency<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ordered blocked \u201call property and interests in property of the Government of Iran, its instru-mentalities and controlled entities and the Central Bank of Iran which are or become subject to the jurisdiction of the United States ... . \u201d Exec. .Order No. 12170, 44 Fed.Reg. 65729. The President further authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to employ all powers granted to the President under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1701 <em>et seq., </em>to carry out the blocking order. Pursuant to this authorization, the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) promulgated regulations, effective November 14, 1979, prohibiting, absent a license or authorization, injunctions, attachments, judgments, or other relief, against property in which Iran or its entities had an interest. 31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 535.201, 535.203(e), 44 Fed.Reg. 65956.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Main moved to sue the Iranian defendants a few days after the President and OF AC had acted. On November 19,1979, it sought authority from OF AC to institute suit against the Iranian defendants, and, in conjunction therewith, to obtain injunctive relief and attachments against Iranian assets.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On November 20, 1979, an OF AC official informed Main\u2019s representatives over the telephone, and on November 21, 1979 Main received written confirmation, that it would be given a \u201cspecial license\u201d to \u201cinitiate and prosecute judicial proceedings\u201d and to obtain preliminary relief against Iranian property; the license specifically provided that Main was not authorized to proceed to judgment on its claims or to receive any payment from the blocked assets. (On November 23, 1979, regulations were promulgated authorizing suits against Iran and its governmental entities on terms similar to those specified in Main\u2019s license. 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 535.504, 44 Fed.Reg. 67617.) Effective November 19, 1979, all OFAC \u201crulings, licenses .. . [and] authorizations\u201d pertaining to Iranian assets were explicitly made revocable \u201cat any time.\u201d 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 535.805, 44 Fed.Reg. 66834.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">On November 20, 1979 \u2014 the day Main commenced its action \u2014 the district court ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>proved <em>ex parte </em>attachments on trastee process and issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the Iranian defendants from disposing of any of their assets located in the United States. On December 12, 1979, following a hearing, the district court entered a preliminary injunction to the same effect as its earlier TRO.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants appealed the order granting the preliminary injunction, and this court heard oral argument on October 8,.1980. Further proceedings on the appeal were stayed, however, pending the outcome of ongoing negotiations for the release of the Ameri-can hostages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">On January 19, 1981, Iran released the hostages pursuant to an agreement with the United States, embodied in two Declarations of the Government of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The agreement states that it is \u201cthe purpose of both parties ... to terminate all litigation as between the Government of each party and the nationals of the other, and to bring about the settlement and termination of all such claims through binding arbitration.\u201d In furtherance of this goal, the agreement calls for the establishment of an Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (Tribunal), which will, with certain exceptions, arbitrate any such claims not settled within six months of the date of agreement; awards of the Tribunal will be \u201cfinal and binding\u201d and \u201cenforceable ... in the courts of any nation in accordance with its laws.\u201d The United States is obligated \u201cto terminate all legal proceedings in United States courts involving claims of United States persons and institutions against Iran and its state enterprises, to nullify all attachments and judgments obtained therein, to prohibit all further litigation based on such claims, and to bring about the termination of such claims through binding arbitration.\u201d The United States must also \u201cact to bring about the transfer\u201d by July 19, 1981 of all Iranian assets held in \u201cU. S. banking institutions in the United States.\u201d One billion dollars of these assets will go directly to a security account which will be used to fund awards of the Tribunal; Iran has agreed to maintain a minimum balance of $500 million in this account until all such awards are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">On January 19, 1981, President Carter issued a series of executive orders implementing the terms of the agreement with Iran. Exec.Order Nos. 12276-12285, 46 Fed.Reg. 7913-7932. In pertinent part, these orders revoked all licenses permitting persons to exercise \u201cany right, power or privilege\u201d with regard to Iranian funds, securities or deposits, \u201cnullified\u201d all non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Iranian interests in such assets acquired subsequent to the November 14,1979 blocking order, and required those holding blocked Iranian assets to transfer them to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, \u201cto be held or transferred as directed by the Secretary of the Treasury.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See esp. </em>Exec.Order No. 12279, 46 Fed.Reg. 7919. On February 24, 1981, President Reagan \u201cratified\u201d the January 19 orders; he also ordered \u201csuspended\u201d all \u201cclaims which may be presented to the [Tribunal]\u201d and provided that they \u201cshall have no legal effect in any action now pending in any court of the United States.\u201d Exec.Order No. 12294, 46 Fed.Reg. 14111.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">On February 4,1981, Main commenced an action in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the United States, seeking a declaration that the executive agreement with Iran, and the implementing executive orders and Treasury Department regulations, were in excess of the President\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority; in the alternative, Main sought a declaration that the agreement effected a \u201ctaking\u201d of Main\u2019s \u201cproperty\u201d for a public use without just compensation, in violation of the fifth amendment. <em>Chas. T. Main International, Inc. v. United States (Main v. United States), </em>509 F.Supp. 1162. On March 17, 1981, following a hearing, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint in that case, holding that \u201cthe actions of Presidents Carter and Reagan have a legal basis in the provisions of Article II of the Constitution ... as well as in the powers granted to them by the provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">On February 23, 1981, we remanded to the district court the appeal in <em>Main v. KWPA, </em>for reconsideration of the grant of preliminary relief in light of the executive agreement and orders. On April 7, 1981, relying on its decision in <em>Main v. United States, </em>the district court dissolved the preliminary injunction and vacated the <em>ex parte </em>attachments. The appeals from the orders in <em>Main v. KWPA, </em>and from the dismissal of the complaint in <em>Main v. United States, </em>are consolidated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">The primary issue before us is one of presidential authority. As this nation\u2019s leader and as the head of one of the three coordinate branches of the federal government, the President holds substantial powers, both express and implied, under the Constitution. These powers may be supplemented, in certain areas, by delegations of authority from Congress. Justice Jackson described the reach of presidential power, and its interaction with that of the legislative branch, in his concurring opinion in <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, </em>343 U.S. 579, 635-38, 72 S.Ct. 863, 870-71, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-12\">1. When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right, plus all that Congress can delegate. In these circumstances, and in these only, may he be said (for what it may be worth) to personify the federal sovereignty. If his act is held unconstitutional under these circumstances, it usually means that the Federal Government as an undivided whole lacks power ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-13\">2. When the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely, upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not invite, measures on independent presidential responsibility. In this area, any actual test of power is likely to depend on the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables rather than on abstract theories of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-4\">3. When the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive presidential control in such a case only by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject. Presidential claim to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A70\">Footnotes omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Through the executive agreement with Iran, and through the implementing executive orders, the President has taken certain actions affecting Main\u2019s claims against Iran and its instrumentalities. First, he has purported to \u201cnullify\u201d Main\u2019s attachments and preliminary injunction against Iranian assets, and has prohibited Main from acquiring any further \u201crjght, power, or privilege\u201d with regard to these assets. Second, he has ordered the transfer of Iranian assets to the Federal Reserve Bank, in preparation for their eventual transfer out of the United States. Finally, he has purported to \u201csuspend\u201d Main\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d against Iran and its governmental entities, at least pending a determination of the Tribunal\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the claim; if the Tribunal asserts jurisdiction, the suspension will, by virtue of the agreement, become a \u201ctermination\u201d of the claim upon a decision by the Tribunal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">While each of these presidential actions is an integral part of a single agreement between the United States and Iran, there are salient differences between the first two and the third as regards the President\u2019s authority to undertake them. We thus analyze separately, first, the nullification of attachments and transfer of Iranian assets out of the United States and, second, the suspension of litigation currently pending before the courts of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">A. <em>Nullification of Attachments and Transfer of Assets</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) enables the President, in times of declared national emergency, to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-11\">(A) investigate, regulate, or prohibit\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-12\">(i) any transactions in foreign exchange,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-13\">(ii) transfers of credit or payments between, by, through, or to any banking institution, to the extent that such transfers or payments involve any interest of any foreign country or a national thereof,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-14\">(iii) the importing or exporting of currency or securities; and</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">(B) investigate, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest;</p>\n<p id=\"b866-16\">by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-17\">50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702(a)(1). The President relied on his IEEPA powers in November 1979, when he \u201cblocked\u201d all Iranian assets in this country, and again in January 1981, when he \u201cnullified\u201d interests acquired in blocked property, and ordered that property\u2019s transfer. The President\u2019s actions, in this regard, are in keeping with the language of IEE-PA: initially he \u201cpreventfed] and prqhib-it[ed]\u201d \u201ctransfers\u201d of Iranian assets; later he \u201cdirectfed] and compel[led]\u201d the \u201ctransfer\u201d and \u201cwithdrawal\u201d of the assets, \u201cnullify[ing]\u201d certain \u201crights\u201d and \u201cprivileges\u201d acquired in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Main argues that IEEPA does not supply the President with power to override judicial remedies, such as attachments and injunctions, or to extinguish \u201cinterests\u201d in foreign assets held by United States citizens. But we can find no such limitation in lEEPA\u2019s terms. The language of IEEPA is sweeping and unqualified. It provides broadly that the President may void or nullify the \u201cexercising [by <em>any </em>person of] <em>any </em>right, power or privilege with respect to ... any property in which any foreign country has any interest .... \u201d 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702(aXl)(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">To be sure, it could be argued, by implication, that in enacting IEEPA Congress did not intend to authorize the President to wipe out liens on Iranian assets predating the President\u2019s invocation of his IEEPA powers. The language of section 1702(a)(1) is drawn directly from section 5(b) of the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), which elsewhere provided U.S. citizens with mechanisms for recapturing the value of their interests in enemy property subject to presidential control, <em>see, e. g., </em>TWEA \u00a7\u00a7 7(a) &amp; 9(a). Here, however, there is no issue of presidential power to nullify judicially created interests in the property <em>retroactively. </em>By the time Main acted, the assets were within the President\u2019s control, under the umbrella of his IEEPA powers. Once the blocking order was in place, we do not believe that Main could obtain such an interest in the blocked assets as would later hamper the President in disposing of them. Main, in fact, proceeded against the \u201cblocked\u201d Iranian assets only under the provisional Treasury Department license which it had obtained.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By the terms of the license and by regulation, Main was prohibited from obtaining a final judgment against the assets or in any other manner levying on the assets to satisfy its claim. In the circumstances, we think Main could acquire no greater \u201cproperty interest\u201d in the blocked funds \u2014 through \u201cjudicial remedies\u201d or otherwise \u2014 than its conditional license and the regulations allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">A presidential blocking order virtually identical to this was held impervious to judicial attachment in <em>Orvis v. Brownell, </em>345 U.S. 183, 73 S.Ct. 596, 97 L.Ed. 938 (1953). In <em>Orvis, </em>United States litigants had obtained an attachment against property belonging to Japanese nationals, which was subject to a presidential blocking order entered pursuant to section 5(b) of the TWEA. The Alien Property Custodian (under the President\u2019s direction) had subsequently \u201cvested\u201d the property against which the attachment was entered, and had refused the litigants a license to use vested funds in satisfaction of their judgment against the Japanese nationals. The Supreme Court had already held, in <em>Zittman v. McGrath, </em>341 U.S. 446, 71 S.Ct. 832, 95 L.Ed. 1096 (1951), that even with the blocking order in effect, litigants were entitled to obtain prejudgment attachments against \u201cenemy\u201d property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in <em>Orvis </em>the Court held such attachments ineffectual as against the Custodian\u2019s (and, by clear implication, the President\u2019s) power to transfer, vest, and dispose of the assets in the manner he saw fit. Although section 9(a) of the TWEA expressly provided \u201cnon-enemies\u201d with a claim against the Custodian to recover any \u201cinterest, right, or title\u201d in enemy property, the Court held that an attachment entered after a blocking order created no such \u201cright\u201d or \u201cinterest\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>[T]he general assent by the Government to state attachment procedures which we recited in the <em>Zittman </em>opinion did not extend so far as to recognize them as effecting a transfer. To so interpret it would ignore the express conditions on which the consent was extended. Realistically, these reservations deprive the assent of much substance; but that should have been apparent on its face to those who chose to litigate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-4\"><em>Id., </em>at 187, 73 S.Ct. at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The clear import of <em>Orvis </em>is that Main\u2019s injunction and attachments, obtained pursuant to a conditional Treasury Department license subsequent to the President\u2019s \u201cfreeze\u201d of Iranian assets by blocking order, do not constrain the President in exercising his express powers under IEEPA to nullify non-Iranian interests in the assets and transfer them out of the country. Similar to <em>Orvis, </em>\u201cthe question is not whether a lien, concededly valid because obtained pri- or to the freezing order, may be \u2018annulled\u2019 by the [President], but rather whether the freezing order prevented the subsequent acquisition, by attachment, of such a property interest as the [President] would have to recognize .... \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 188, 73 S.Ct. at 598. As in <em>Orvis, </em>the answer is in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">We see no distinction between <em>Orvis </em>and the present case in the fact that IEEPA was enacted (in 1977) to, in certain respects, limit the President\u2019s former peace-time powers under the TWEA. While some such limitations were effected by IEEPA\u2019s enactment,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702(a)(1), on which the President relies, is virtually identical to section 5(b)(1) of the TWEA, with the exception that the President may no longer direct the \u201cvesting\u201d of foreign property. The President, however, has not purported to cause Iranian assets to \u201cvest,\u201d but has simply ordered their \u201ctransfer\u201d without effecting any change in title or ownership. Nor has the President \u201cseized\u201d the assets, as he would have been authorized to do under section 7(c) of the TWEA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Since Congress has authorized the President to block Iranian assets, nullify attachments of such assets obtained after the blocking order took effect, and transfer the assets out of the United States, the President lacked authority for these actions only if \u201cthe Federal Government as an undivided whole lacks [such] power ... . \u201d <em>Youngstown, supra, </em>343 U.S. at 636-37, 72 S.Ct. at 870-71. Quite plainly, the federal government\u2019s powers do encompass control over foreign assets used in international commerce. <em>See, e. g., Orvis v. Brownell, supra, </em>345 U.S. at 188, 73 S.Ct. at 598; <em>Propper v. Clark, </em>337 U.S. 472, 482-86, 69 S.Ct. 1333, 1339-41, 93 L.Ed. 1480 (1949); <em>see also </em>Part III, <em>infra </em>(President may settle claims). Equally plainly, the compensation clause of the fifth amendment of the Constitution does not constrain the President in nullifying Main\u2019s attachments. Main\u2019s argument based on the compensation clause is undercut by the fact that its \u201cinterest\u201d in Iranian assets was <em>ab initio </em>subordinate to the President\u2019s IEEPA powers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See supra. </em>Since Main\u2019s \u201cproperty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>interest\u201d in the Iranian assets was defined and delimited by IEEPA\u2019s terms, it could not have been \u201ctaken\u201d by presidential action effected pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AXo\">We therefore hold that the President had authority to order the transfer of blocked Iranian assets without regard to attachments or other judicial orders against the assets obtained subsequent to the November 14, 1979 blocking order.</p>\n<p id=\"A4y\">B. <em>Suspension of Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZFl\">The President&gt;s order suspending claimg gtandg on a different footing. while it is not impossibie to read IEEPA itself as providing authority for the President to suspend or terminate claims against a for-eign sovereign, the statutory meaning in this regard is scarcely clear, and there is no precedent for such a reading.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Though we read IEEPA as giving some support to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>President\u2019s order, <em>see </em>note 13, <em>supra, </em>we cannot say that it provides sufficient authority. We therefore approach the President\u2019s order in terms of whether he had inherent power under the Constitution to take such action. We hold that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">We are met at the outset with differing characterizations by the parties of what the President is attempting to do. Main contends that the President is attempting to regulate federal court \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d If so, the validity of his actions would be in great doubt, since the power to define the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts is committed to Congress. U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 9; Art. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 1 &amp; 2, cl. 2. Moreover, in 1976 Congress enacted the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), providing that \u201cthe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any non-jury civil action against a foreign state . . . as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either under [28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1605-07] or under any applicable international agreement.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The United States, on the other hand, maintains that the President has not attempted to divest the federal courts of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over claims against Iran, but has simply exercised his constitutionally based power to \u201csettle\u201d the claims of U.S. nationals against a foreign state in the course of negotiating an end to an international crisis. The mandated settlement, in this instance, requires U.S. claimants to divert their claims to an international arbitration tribunal, with provision for a $1 billion fund from which to pay the Tribunal\u2019s awards, and for enforcement of awards in any country in accordance with its laws. Since the claims are thus \u201csettled,\u201d they can no longer have any \u201clegal effect\u201d in the United States courts. <em>Cf. </em>Exec.Order No. 12294, 46 Fed.Reg. 14111.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">The terms of the agreement with Iran, and of the executive orders themselves, may to some extent belie the United States\u2019 characterization of the President\u2019s actions as reflecting only a settlement of claims. The Declarations obligate the United States \u201cto terminate all legal proceedings in United States courts\u201d based on claims against Iran, and \u201cto prohibit all further litigation based on such claims.\u201d Moreover, Exec.Order No. 12294, 46 Fed.Reg. 14111, purports, <em>of its own force, </em>to \u201csuspend\u201d \u201call claims for equitable or other judicial relief ... in any action now pending in any court of the United States,\u201d insofar as such claims may be presented to the Tribunal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nevertheless, if the President is in fact empowered to effect a binding settlement of the claims of United States nationals against Iran, it matters little, in practical terms, whether he has improperly attempted to go further. A binding settlement would compel dismissal of Main\u2019s action, not for lack of \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d but for \u201cfailure to state a claim.\u201d Thus, rather than undertake a discussion of the President\u2019s ability, in general, to enter orders that might have an impact on the scope or exercise of federal court jurisdiction, we think it more appropriate to begin with an inquiry into the President\u2019s asserted international claims settlement power.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">International agreements settling claims by nationals of one state against the government of another \u201care established international practice reflecting traditional international theory.\u201d L. Henkin, <em>Foreign Affairs and the Constitution </em>262 (1972). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>numerous instances, dating back to the earliest days of this country\u2019s history,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the President, often acting without the advice or consent of the Senate, has agreed to extinguish claims of United States nationals against foreign governments, in return for lump sum payments or the establishment of arbitration procedures. For recent examples see Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China Concerning the Settlement of Claims, - U.S.T. -, T.I.A.S. 9306 (May 11, 1979); Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt Concerning Claims of Nationals of the United States, 27 U.S.T. 4214, T.I.A.S. 8446 (May 1, 1976); Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Hungarian People\u2019s Republic Regarding the Settlement of Claims, 24 U.S.T. 522, T.I.A.S. 7569 (March 3, 1973). <em>See also </em>J. B. Moore, <em>Treaties and Executive Agreements, </em>Sept. 1905 Political Science Quarterly 385, <em>reprinted at </em>62 Cong. Rec. 13063-68, esp. 13066 (Sept. 21, 1922) (\u201cIt would be a work of supererogation to attempt to cite all the cases in which the Executive of the United States has settled individual claims against foreign governments without reference to the Senate\u201d; \u201c[n]ot only is the power of the President to settle the claims of citizens of the United States against foreign governments firmly established but he has repeatedly employed arbitration for the purpose.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">To be sure, such settlements were often encouraged by the U.S. claimants themselves; a claimant\u2019s only hope of obtaining any payment at all might lie in having his government negotiate a diplomatic settlement with the foreign power. However, the President has \u201csometimes disposed of the claims of [U.S.] citizens without their consent, or even without consultation with them, usually without exclusive regard for their interests, as distinguished from those of the nation as a whole.\u201d L. Henkin, <em>supra, </em>at 263. <em>See, e. g., Meade v. United States, </em>76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 691, 19 L.Ed. 687 (1869); <em>Comegys v. Vasse, </em>26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 193, 7 L.Ed. 108 (1803); <em>cf. United States v. Schooner Peggy, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 103, 2 L.Ed. 49 (1801). <em>See also Gray v. United States, </em>21 Ct.Cl. 340 (1886) (detailing history of the \u201cFrench Spoliation Claims\u201d). Indeed, the current Restatement (Second) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 213 (1965) lists as black letter law the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-9\">The President may waive or settle a claim against a foreign state based on the responsibility of the foreign state for an injury to a United States national, without the consent of such national.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">The Supreme Court has recognized this presidential settlement power as being incidental to the President\u2019s position as the nation\u2019s representative in the arena of international affairs, and in particular, as a power necessary to facilitate the resolution of crises in foreign relations. In <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number><em>States v. Pink, </em>315 U.S. 203, 62 S.Ct. 552, 86 L.Ed. 796 (1942), the Court upheld the President\u2019s authority to undertake the so-called Litvinov Assignment, which, as part of the normalization of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, settled claims of U.S. nationals arising from Russia\u2019s expropriations of property.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Court had already held, in <em>United States v. Belmont, </em>301 U.S. 324, 57 S.Ct. 758, 81 L.Ed. 1134 (1937), that it was within the President\u2019s exclusive competence to undertake negotiations leading to the normalization of relations between the two governments, and to officially recognize the Soviet government. <em>Id., </em>at 330-31, 57 S.Ct. 760-61. In <em>Pink, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-4\">The purpose of the discussions leading to the policy of recognition was to resolve \u201call questions outstanding\u201d between the two nations.... Settlement of all American claims against Russia was one method of removing some of the prior objections to recognition based on the Soviet policy of nationalization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-5\"><em>Id., </em>at 227, 62 S.Ct., at 564. It continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfM\">Power to remove such obstacles to full recognition as settlement of claims of our nationals . . . certainly is a modest implied power of the President who is the \u201csole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.\u201d <em>United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., supra, </em>[299 U.S.] page 320, [57 S.Ct. page 221, 81 L.Ed. 225]. Effectiveness in handling the delicate problems of foreign relations requires no less. Unless such a power exists, the power of recognition might be thwarted or seriously diluted. No such obstacle can be placed in the way' of rehabilitation of relations between this country and another nation, unless the historic conception of the powers and responsibilities of the President in the conduct of foreign affairs (see Moore, Treaties and Executive Agreements, 20 Pol. Sc.Q. 385, 403 \u2014 117) is to be drastically revised. It was the judgment of the political department that full recognition of the Soviet Government required the settlement of all outstanding problems including the claims of our nationals. Recognition and the Litvinov Assignment were interdependent. We would usurp the executive function if we held that that decision was not final and conclusive in the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-8\"><em>Id., </em>at 229-30, 62 S.Ct., at 565-66.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">It is not difficult to understand why it has become generally accepted that the President possesses power, at least in times of crisis in our international relations, to settle the claims of United States nationals against a foreign government. The matter becomes particularly clear if, as Justice Jackson maintained in his <em>Youngstown </em>concurrence, \u201cany actual test\u201d of the President\u2019s constitutional powers, especially in the foreign relations field, \u201cis likely to depend on the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables rather than on abstract theories of law.\u201d 343 U.S. at 637, 72 S.Ct. at 871. This case well illustrates the imperative need to preserve a presidential flexibility sufficient to diffuse an international crisis, in order to prevent the crisis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>from escalating or even leading to war. As the Supreme Court has consistently recognized, it is the President who is charged with responsibility as the United States\u2019 representative and negotiator in the international arena. <em>See, </em>e. <em>g., United States v. Belmont, supra, </em>301 U.S. 330-31, 57 S.Ct. 760-61, 81 L.Ed. 1134; <em>United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., </em>299 U.S. 304, 319-22, 57 S.Ct. 220-21, 81 L.Ed. 225 (1936). The authority to remove impediments to the peaceful resolution of international disputes is an authority necessary to meet the responsibilities of presidential office, and, in the words of the Supreme Court, a \u201cmodest implied\u201d attribute of presidential power. <em>See United States v. Pink, supra, </em>315 U.S. at 229, 62 S.Ct. at 565.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">We cannot agree with Main that the FSIA was meant to eradicate \u201cexecutive branch flexibility in an international crisis.\u201d No such intention is to be gleaned from the language of the statute, or to be found in its legislative history. FSIA was directed toward a single topic\u2014 sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In principal part, FSIA simply codifies contemporary concepts concerning the scope of sovereign immunity, and entrusts to the courts the determination of immunity in individual cases. To be sure, one objective of FSIA \u2014 an objective heartily endorsed by representatives of the executive branch<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u2014 was to end the practice whereby the State Department was expected to file, on a case-by-case basis, \u201csuggestions of immunity,\u201d to which the courts would normally defer. However, the fact that the State Department may no longer, in the normal course of events, dispose of commercial litigation against a foreign state by asserting that state\u2019s immunity from suit does not reflect adversely on the President\u2019s long-accepted power, in times of international emergency, to settle or provide substitute means for the resolution of the underlying claims. As the district court stated, in providing a workable federal forum for the adjudication of commercial litigation involving foreign entities, \u201cCongress never intended to cripple the negotiating power of American Presidents.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>We recognize that there are few precedents which deal precisely with claims of U.S. citizens against foreign government corporations. But merely because the FSIA has eased the way to suing such entities, it does not follow that the President\u2019s settlement power in the interest of conducting the nation\u2019s foreign affairs has been declared off limits in such suits. We observe that many foreign states, both developed and less developed, conduct vast and critically important economic programs and projects through the device of government corporations. Suits against such entities in many instances have the same impact as suits against the states themselves; by the same token amicable settlement has the same beneficent impact on our nation\u2019s foreign affairs. We thus consider such suits to be closely akin to suits against foreign governments themselves, and view neither our holding nor our analysis as having any necessary implications for the broad class of suits against foreign individuals and private commercial entities discussed by the concurring opinion. In this case, both because of the nature of the foreign entities involved and the unique surrounding circumstances, the President\u2019s action stands poles apart from executive settlement of a claim against a purely commercial foreign entity affecting only the parties to the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">We need not and do not hold that the executive possesses plenary power to settle claims, even as against foreign governmental entities. It may be that much of this area is within that \u201czone of twilight in which [the President] and Congress may have concurrent authority.\u201d <em>Youngstown, supra, </em>343 U.S. at 637, 72 S.Ct. at 871. The sheer magnitude of such a power, considered against the background of the diversity and complexity of modern international trade, cautions against any broader construction of authority than is necessary. Here, however, the President has acted to resolve what was indisputably a major crisis in the foreign relations of this country. His settlement of the claims of Main and others was not an isolated event but a necessary incident to the resolution of a dispute between our nation and another. Whatever may be the reach of the executive power under circumstances that implicate less squarely the conduct of foreign relations, the executive power extends so far as to permit the accord reached here.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">We hold, therefore, that the President had authority to settle Main\u2019s claims against the Iranian defendants, by providing for their submission to binding arbitration. This being the case, we need not decide whether the President went too far in purporting to \u201corder\u201d the \u201csuspension\u201d of litigation relating to the claims. The claims having been settled, they are no longer cognizable in the courts, except insofar as permitted by the settlement\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">Main argues that it is at least entitled to compensation from the United States as a result of the President\u2019s actions in settling the claims.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We think, however, this issue is neither properly presented nor ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">There may well be situations when the President\u2019s extinction or \u201csettlement\u201d of a claim against a foreign government, without the consent of the claimant, would constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d of private property for a public \u201cuse.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.Const., Amend. V. Here, of course, the President has not simply \u201cextinguished\u201d Main\u2019s claim, but has provided alternative means for its resolution and satisfaction. Thus, his actions could at very most constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d of property only if the alternative method of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>satisfying the claim <em>(i. e., </em>submission to the Tribunal) is demonstrably and measurably inferior to the rights otherwise available to Main (i. e., the right to attempt to obtain an unsecured judgment in the federal court). Yet, at present, it would be impossible to say with assurance whether the President has substituted a \u201clesser\u201d remedy for a \u201cgreater,\u201d or vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">To be sure, arbitration before the Tribunal poses, from Main\u2019s perspective, certain obvious disadvantages. Main might fear that a panel composed partly of Iranians will approach Main\u2019s claims with less sympathy than might a United States district court. The Tribunal could become stalled in procedural wrangles. On the other hand, there may, in fact, be some advantages to the arbitration process. Iran will be unable to present sovereign immunity or act of state defenses, and thus, at the least, potentially troublesome pre-trial skirmishes will be avoided.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Main will also derive some protection from a $1 billion security account, although it maintains this security represents only a fraction of all claims and thus may be inadequate. The Declarations also provide that Tribunal awards will be enforceable in any country in accordance with its laws. Thus, even should the security account prove insufficient, the Tribunal award may nevertheless be more valuable, in terms of enforcement abroad, than an equivalent unsecured United States court judgment. And, of course, the amount the Tribunal will award Main on its claim is at present uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Not only is Main\u2019s claim for compensation, at this point, wholly speculative, it is (unless \u201cnot exceeding $10,000 in amount\u201d) made before the wrong tribunal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 1491 &amp; 2201. If and when Main can establish a \u201ctaking\u201d for which compensation is due, its remedy will lie in the Court of Claims. <em>See Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>419 U.S. 102, 125-36, 95 S.Ct. 335, 349-54, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974); <em>Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States, </em>534 F.2d 889, 902-06 (Ct.Cl.1976) (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1502 bars only claims involving \u201crights given or protected by a treaty,\u201d which derive their \u201clife and existence\u201d from a treaty stipulation); <em>see also United States v. Weld, </em>127 U.S. 51, 56-57, 8 S.Ct. 1000, 1002-1003, 32 L.Ed. 62 (1888).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the dismissal of the complaint in <em>Main v. United States. </em>We also affirm the orders of the district court in <em>Main v. KWPA </em>dissolving the preliminary injunction and vacating the <em>ex parte </em>attachments. In those orders, the district court stated that it \u201cno longer [had] jurisdiction over the controversy.\u201d We think the court was technically incorrect in so stating: while the claims have been \u201csettled\u201d leaving the district court without any matters to adjudicate, litigation might be recommenced in the future in narrow circumstances contemplated in the February 24, 1981 Executive Order. Moreover, the district court certainly has jurisdiction to remove any remaining vestiges of the attachments and preliminary injunction, and there may be other relief, ancillary to the settlement and consistent with this opinion, which it may grant. (For example, to the extent the district court has not, as the United States asserts, vacated all attachments entered in <em>Main v. KWPA, </em>it may and should do so upon a proper motion.) This constitutes the full extent of the matters before us on appeal. We note the request of the United States that we \u201cdirect a stay of litigation of Main\u2019s claims against Iran which may be presented to the Tribunal.\u201d No such matter is encompassed within the pending appeals. If appropriate, such a request should be directed to the district court, which, we are certain, will act upon it in a manner not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-7\">. The President\u2019s declaration of national emergency was accompanied by a finding, as required by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701, that the situation in Iran constituted \u201can unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States.\u201d See note 10, <em>infra. </em>There is no question that the events in question constituted such an emergency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\">.

In the application for a license, Main represented that it sought to recover a total amount of $2,878,787.20 (with interest and costs); the discrepancy between this figure and the $3,256,787.26 claimed in the <em>Main v. KWPA </em>complaint brought in the District of Massachusetts is presumably due to the fact that the $378,000 alleged owing from Bank Markazi would be offset against the amount alleged due from Mahab and the other Iranian defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b864-5\">.

Still, in assessing what the President took away in exercising his powers under IEEPA, it is relevant to bear in mind that a right to attachment has been considered the exception, rather than the norm, in suits by United States nationals against a foreign government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">.

One might also argue that other combinations of IEEPA\u2019s shopping list of words cover this case, e. <em>g., </em>that the lawsuit is a step leading toward \u201cacquisition ... of ... property [of Iran],\u201d or that it is a \u201ctransaction involving ... property.\u201d The very breadth of the powers given the President under IEEPA, and the desirability of relying on statutory rather than constitutional authority, might tempt one to find an implied congressional grant of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">Nevertheless we feel uneasy in resting on such a construction. To say that an unliquidat-ed claim in personam for money damages is a \u201cright\u201d with respect to \u201cproperty,\u201d or that it is \u201cacquisition\u201d of \u201cproperty,\u201d or that it is a \u201ctransaction involving ... property\u201d simply because it may someday be reduced to judgment and capable of execution is to render a technical word rich in ancient teaching amorphous and all inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">Further militating against such a reading is the fact that the \u201cchief objects\u201d of the TWEA, IEEPA\u2019s predecessor, were 1) the prevention of trade with the enemy in time of war, and 2) the \u201cconservation] and utilization] upon a basis of practical justice [of] enemy property found within the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.85, 65th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1917). The Act sought to further the goal of conserving enemy property by bringing it \u201cunder the control of the Government, to be impounded or used, and to await such disposition at the close of the war as Congress may determine.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 3. One contemplated \u201cuse\u201d of such property was the satisfaction of claims of U.S. citizens. <em>Id., </em>at 4. Given such purposes, it would seem questionable that Congress intended claims by U.S. citizens <em>against </em>the enemy to be among the sorts of \u201cenemy property\u201d to be \u201cimpounded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">While we therefore conclude that we cannot rest on any express or implied grant of power from Congress in IEEPA, we find no hint of congressional <em>disapproval </em>of the power to settle claims in these circumstances. Even if IEE-PA does not confer such a power, it shows Congress\u2019 willingness to give the President wide discretion in dealing with issues affecting foreign assets during periods of international crisis. In addition, we are told that the President notified Congress of the agreement with Iran, as required by IEEPA, and that Congress has not registered opposition to any provision, including that purporting to suspend judicial claims and substitute arbitration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b870-6\">.

I find troubling, however, the court\u2019s opinion on a subsidiary point \u2014 that the President has inherent Article II power to settle Main\u2019s claim against the Khuzestan Water &amp; Power Authority over Main\u2019s objection. The \u201cinherent power\u201d question is more difficult than the court suggests and at the same time it is not necessary to the court\u2019s decision. Given the need for a speedy decision and the possibility of further review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I shall state my reasons briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">It is unnecessary to reach the question of whether the President, on his own under Article II, could suspend and settle Main\u2019s suit because IEEPA gives him adequate Congressional authority to take this action. IEEPA specifically gives the President the power to \u201cregulate, ... nullify, void, prevent or prohibit ... [the] exercising [of] any right, power, or privilege with respect to . . . any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest; by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702(a)(1)(B). A civil lawsuit is surely the \u201cexercising\u201d of a \u201cright\u201d with respect to \u201cproperty\u201d. The Khuzestan Water &amp; Power Authority is a \u201cforeign . . . national\u201d which has an interest in property that will be affected by the lawsuit. Even if the Authority\u2019s property is not now in the United States, the suit is brought \u201cby\u201d a \u201cperson ... subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d Thus, whether or not one considers Main\u2019s claim itself \u201cproperty\u201d subject to IEEPA, the President has authority under IEEPA\u2019s language to \u201cvoid\u201d or to \u201cprohibit\u201d the exercise of his right to sue. And, the history of IEEPA, enacted in the context of a lengthy list of instances in which the President has settled suits against foreign nations, supports the notion that Congress gave the President its specific assent to suspend, to prohibit, or to void such suits against foreign nations or nationals, during an emergency, where he finds that such action is required. H.R.Rep.No.459, 95th Cong. 1st Sess. 11, 15 (1977). <em>See also United States v. Yoshida International, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 560, 579 (C.C.P.A.1975). Thus, we are here dealing with an instance of the President\u2019s acting with the specific assent of Congress\u2014 the first, not the second, category mentioned in <em>Youngstown. Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, </em>343 U.S. 579, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952). As the court points out, the Executive\u2019s authority in such a case has its greatest Constitutional breadth and is more than adequate to take the actions at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">I am reluctant to go further and attempt to determine the scope of the President\u2019s <em>inherent </em>Article II power to settle suits against foreign nationals over the plaintiffs\u2019 objections because that question is less clear than the court suggests. The court lists numerous instances of claim settlements, but these almost exclusively involved claims by Americans against foreign <em>governments. </em>It is hardly surprising that the President could settle such a claim, for under traditional principles of international law an individual had no claim against a foreign country; only a nation could assert a right against another nation. <em>Ex Parte Peru, </em>318 U.S. 578, 63 S.Ct. 793, 87 L.Ed. 1014 (1943). And, our courts recognized this principle of international law by allowing foreign countries to assert a defense of sovereign immunity when sued by an Amer-ican in a domestic court. <em>Id. </em>During this century, however, international law has changed, and governments acting in a commercial capacity now tend to be treated like private citizens before the courts. The United States first recognized this change in the Tate Letter. 26 Dept. State Bull. 984 (1952). Congress then specifically codified the change in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) which instructed the courts not to accept a defense of sovereign immunity when the foreign entity sued is commercial in nature thereby treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>them, for this purpose, like private citizens. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330,1602 <em>et seq. </em>Thus, there is some reason to believe that an action such as this one \u2014 a suit against the Khuzes-tan Water &amp; Power Authority based upon a contract for engineering services \u2014 is to be treated by the courts like other suits by Americans against foreign individuals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Once one sees the potential implications of the court\u2019s opinion upon claims against foreign individuals,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> one becomes uncertain about the validity of its broad assertion of inherent Presidential power. As the court points out, the foreign affairs power implicit in Articles I and II of the Constitution gives broad authority to the <em>government </em>to settle such claims where necessary \u2014 particularly if the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of taking private property for public use without \u201cjust compensation\u201d is honored through the allowance of a later suit. <em>See Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>419 U.S. 102, 124-5, 95 S.Ct. 335, 349, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Yet, the FSIA, by removing sovereign immunity as to such claims, suggests that the <em>government </em>is not the President alone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The President does not on his own, without Congressional approval, have the power to seize a domestic steel mill at a time of grave domestic crisis. <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, supra. </em>Does he nonetheless have the power to seize an American\u2019s claim against, say, a foreign steel mill, even in the face of Congressional silence or opposition? The answer to this question is not given in the precedents the court cites for they are cases decided prior to evolution of the restrictive view or involve claims against a foreign government rather than a private citizen\u2014 or both. One suspects the answer to this question depends upon the nature of the emergency facing the President, whether Congress is actively opposed and whether compensation is granted. But there is no need now to say that the President has broad <em>inherent </em>authority to settle all such claims in peace or war. To do so, given the commercial interdependence of the modern world and the scope of America\u2019s commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>cial involvement in foreign commerce, is to find enormous inherent power in the President to regulate international commercial dealings. And, it is a power that may, as a practical matter, be exercised, not by the President himself, but by lesser officials in the Departments of State or Commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Since this is not a case which requires a decision of such magnitude, I would not make it. Rather, it is a case in which the President and Congress are in agreement, in which the Congress has delegated to the President adequate legislative authority to take the steps he proposes. And, that delegation, together with the President\u2019s actions, is sufficient to justify the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-5\">. This case was argued on May 8. The parties have indicated an intention to seek Supreme Court review prior to the July 19, 1981 deadline for transfer of all Iranian assets held in the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-6\">. In addition, the Treaty of Amity between the United States and Iran provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-7\">No enterprise of either High Contracting Party, including corporations, associations, and government agencies and instrumentalities, which is publicly owned or controlled shall, if it engages in commercial, industrial, shipping or other business activities within the territories of the other High Contracting Party, claim or enjoy, either for itself or for its property, immunity therein from taxation, suit, execution of judgment or other liability to which privately owned and controlled enterprises are subject therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and Consular Rights between the United States and Iran, Art. XI, 114, 8 U.S.T. 899, 909, (entered into force June 16, 1957). While it is disputed whether Khuzestan Water &amp; Power Authority is engaged in a commercial enterprise within the United States, within the meaning of the Treaty, the court does not suggest that it would reach a different result were it dealing with a claim against an Iranian entity that is more obviously engaged in a commercial enterprise within the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b877-9\">. One might argue that a commercial branch of a foreign government should be treated like a private individual for purposes of amenability to suit, but like a foreign government for purposes of an \u201cinherent\u201d Presidential claims\u2019 settlement power. Yet, the FSIA suggests Congressional hostility to this additional legal corn-plexity. The practicalities of foreign affairs have not been shown to require any such distinction, particularly since Congress, in IEEPA, has specifically authorized the President to take the action at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b877-12\">. The \u201cright to compensation\u201d here would, in my view, arise out of the President\u2019s assertion of an IEEPA power, not the treaty or executive agreement with Iran or Algeria. Thus, jurisdiction is likely to lie in the Court of Claims. <em>See Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States, </em>534 F.2d 889, 902-06 (Ct.Cl.1976). Of course, for reasons that the court points out, the value of what was taken may be very small.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b877-13\">. The FSIA was designed in part to take from the Executive Branch the power to determine in each individual case, on the basis of foreign policy considerations, whether the courts should dismiss a claim on grounds of sovereign immunity. H.R.Rep.No. 1487, 94th Cong., 2nd Sess. 6-7, 12 (1976). And, once sovereign immunity disappears in a particular case at least one part of the rationale underlying the President\u2019s historical authority to settle the case over objection also disappears. Whether the <em>other </em>part of that rationale \u2014 practical consideration of foreign policy \u2014 is sufficient to support an <em>inherent </em>Presidential power is the difficult question that here need not be decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
