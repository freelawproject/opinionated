(CCM), the successful defendant in a maritime tort action, appeals from the district court\u2019s af-firmance of the District Court Clerk\u2019s disal-lowance of two items of costs. On August 4, 1977, following his fall from a gangway leading to appellant\u2019s vessel, Captain Shelby C. Roberts (Roberts), a Delaware River pilot, initiated an unseaworthiness action against CCM. On February 14, 1978, the district court on Roberts\u2019 motion ordered CCM to produce the Master of the vessel for deposition in Wilmington, Delaware. CCM flew Captain Petros Nikiforos from his home in Pireaus, Greece, to Roberts\u2019 counsel\u2019s office in Wilmington. The deposition was videotaped and was introduced at the subsequent trial. At trial, CCM also produced an expert witness, Paul J. Keeler, to testify concerning gangway safety standards. On July 13, 1979, the district court rendered a judgment in favor of CCM. This court affirmed by judgment order on March 21, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">CCM then filed a bill of costs in the district court. On September 22, 1980, the Clerk of that court ordered taxation of various costs against Roberts, but denied the bulk of Captain Nikiforos\u2019 travel expenses to and from the United States, and denied Mr. Keeler\u2019s expert witness fee. The Clerk disallowed the travel expenses on the ground that \u201cmileage in excess of the \u2018100 mile rule\u2019 is at the discretion of the trial judge not the Clerk.\u201d Appendix 155 n.2. Concerning the expert\u2019s fee, the Clerk stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-13\">Pursuant to Local rule 6.1(B)(4), fees of expert witnesses are not ordinarily taxable in an amount greater than that statutorily allowable for ordinary witnesses; however, the Court may allow, in its discretion, a reasonable amount as an additional award for expert witnesses, provided the Court finds that the expert\u2019s testimony was not only helpful but also played a crucial role in the resolution of the issues presented. Therefore the request for expert fees for Mr. Keeler will be disallowed by the Clerk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">Appendix 154 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">On September 26,1980, CCM filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) motion for review of costs, contesting the denial of these two items. On November 10, the district judge entered an order summarily affirming most of the Clerk\u2019s assessment, but awarding an additional sum to cover the costs of transcripts and copies of exhibits. We reverse the denial of Captain Niki-foros\u2019 travel expenses. We also reverse the district court\u2019s denial of the expert witness\u2019 fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">\n<em>Travel Expenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Farmer v. Arabian American Oil Co., </em>379 U.S. 227, 85 S.Ct. 411, 13 L.Ed.2d 248 (1964), award of witness\u2019 travel expenses beyond 100 miles has been within the discretion of the district court. Before <em>Farmer, </em>many federal courts had assumed that the taxable mileage allowance for witnesses under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 corresponded to the 100 mile reach of the court\u2019s subpoena power. <em>See, e. g., Spiritwood Grain Co. v. Northern Pac. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>Ry. Co., </em>179 F.2d 338 (8th Cir. 1950); <em>Lee v. Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>93 F.Supp. 309 (E.D. Pa.1950). In <em>Farmer, </em>the Court, while declining to invalidate the \u201c100 mile rule\u201d in all cases, remitted the issue to the discretion of district courts. Accordingly, most courts now recognize that restrictions on their subpoena power are no barrier to taxing as costs the travel expenses of a prevailing party\u2019s witness who appears from beyond the court\u2019s reach. <em>See generally </em>10 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 2678 at 231-34 &amp; cases cited n.42 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The \u201c100 mile rule\u201d may be of particularly dubious application when the witness travels from abroad. The version of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 in force at the time of this action stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">Provided that, in lieu of the mileage provided for herein, witnesses who are required to travel between the territories and possessions or to and from the continental United States, shall be entitled to the actual expenses of travel at the lowest first class rate available at the time of reservation for passage, by means of transportation employed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 (1964). The language of the statute would seem to supercede the mileage restrictions pertinent to intra-United States travel. If so, the prevailing party whose witness travels from abroad would clearly be entitled to recover the cost of passage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">While there is little doubt that a witness\u2019 expenses incurred in traveling to and from the United States may be recovered, some courts have held award of these costs a matter of discretion, see, e. <em>g., Scientific Holding Co. Ltd. v. Plessey Inc., </em>510 F.2d 15 (2d Cir. 1974) (by implication); <em>Kaiser Indus. Corp. v. McLouth Steel Corp., </em>50 F.R.D. 5 (E.D.Mich.1970); <em>Rosenthal v. Brangier, </em>37 F.R.D. 248 (D.Haw.1965), while others have held \u00a7 1821 mandated their award, <em>see, e. g., Oscar Gruss &amp; Son v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>46 F.R.D. 635 (S.D.N.Y. 1969); <em>Dunn v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc., </em>279 F.Supp. 937 (S.D.N.Y. 1968).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">We need not here decide whether 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 requires taxation of a witness\u2019 expenses incurred in traveling to and from the United States. In this case, the district court ordered CCM to produce Captain Nikiforos from overseas. Award of travel costs generally resides within the district court\u2019s discretion. Where, as here, however, the witness appears .pursuant to a court order made on the losing party\u2019s motion, we believe it an abuse of discretion not to award costs that would not have been incurred but for that court\u2019s order, unless the losing party demonstrates circumstances warranting an exercise of discretion in his favor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Captain Roberts has made no such showing. Accordingly, we reverse the denial of the bulk of CCM\u2019s travel costs and remand to the district court with a direction to award appellant the full $1717 it expended in bringing Captain Nikiforos to Wilmington.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">\n<em>Expert Witness\u2019 Fee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">CCM also maintains the district court abused its discretion in failing to award expert witness fees. Roberts, however, asserts that expert witnesses are entitled to no more than the regular statutory witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>fees allowed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821. He points out that the Clerk awarded the statutory fee, and argues that the district court had no discretion to increase that award. Roberts cites considerable caselaw and treatise authority for this proposition. Most notably, he stresses <em>Henkel v. Chicago, St. P., M., &amp; O. R. Co., </em>284 U.S. 444, 52 S.Ct. 223, 76 L.Ed. 386 (1932). The Supreme Court there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">Under [the predecessor statute to \u00a7 1821] additional amounts paid as compensation, or fees, to expert witnesses cannot be allowed or taxed as costs in cases in the federal courts. The Congress has dealt with the subject comprehensively and has made no exception of the fees of expert witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">284 U.S. at 446, 52 S.Ct. at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Roberts\u2019 contention implicitly calls into question the validity both of our recent decision in <em>Walker v. Robbins Hose Co. No. 1, </em>622 F.2d 692 (3d Cir. 1980), and of District of Delaware Local Rule 6.1B(4). In <em>Walker, </em>we declined to decide \u201cwhether expert fees are allowable as costs in this circuit. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that such fees are allowable,\u201d we held \u201cit would be within the district court\u2019s discretion to award the fees in any particular case.\u201d 622 F.2d at 694. The District of Delaware rule, enacted two and a half months following our decision in <em>Walker, </em>places that discretion in the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">Fees of expert witnesses are not ordinarily taxable in an amount greater than that statutorily allowable for ordinary witnesses; however, the Court may allow, in its discretion, a reasonable amount as an additional award for expert witnesses, provided the Court finds that the expert\u2019s testimony was not only helpful to the Court but also played a crucial role in the resolution of the issues presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">If Roberts is correct as a matter of law that expert fees may never be taxed above the amount \u00a7 1821 provides for ordinary witnesses, we must declare the District of Delaware Local Rule inconsistent with statute and judicial precedent. We turn, therefore, to appellee\u2019s legal contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">While this Circuit has never explicitly ruled on the issue, a long line of decisions, including some from district courts within this Circuit, have upheld the general rule that federal courts have no authority to tax as costs the compensation of expert witnesses in excess of the statutory attendance per day, mileage, and subsistence allowances provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821. <em>See, e. g., Henkel, supra; Harrisburg Coalition Against Ruining The Environment </em>v. <em>Volpe, </em>65 F.R.D. 608 (M.D.Pa.1974); <em>Quetel v. Querrard, </em>278 F.Supp. 341 (D.V.I.1968); <em>see generally </em>cases cited 10 Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra </em>at 236-37 n.62. Even a general rule, however, admits exceptions. In <em>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. O\u2019Neill, </em>431 F.Supp. 700 (E.D.Pa.1977) (Fullam, J.), <em>aff\u2019d. mem., </em>573 F.2d 1301 (3d Cir. 1978), we affirmed without opinion the district court\u2019s award of expert witness fees. In that case, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">The defendants correctly argue that generally fees for expert witnesses cannot be recovered as costs. Recently, however, many courts have awarded expert\u2019s fees as costs where the expert\u2019s testimony was helpful to the court and played an important role in the resolution of the issues. I am in agreement with these insofar as they award expert fees as costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">431 F.Supp. at 713 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">Examination of the decisions cited in <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>as well as several other decisions, bears out Judge Fullam\u2019s characterization. <em>See, e. g., Cagle v. Cox, </em>87 F.R.D. 467 (E.D.Va.1980); <em>Welsch v. Likins, </em>68 F.R.D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>589 (D.Minn.), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>525 F.2d 987 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>Wallace v. House, </em>377 F.Supp. 1192 (W.D.La.1974), <em>m\u2019dfd, </em>515 F.2d 619 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Sims v. Amos, </em>340 F.Supp. 691 (M.D.Ala.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>409 U.S. 942, 93 S.Ct. 290, 34 L.Ed.2d 215 (1972); <em>La Raza Unida v. Volpe, </em>57 F.R.D. 94 (N.D.Cal. 1972), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>488 F.2d 559 (9th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 968, 94 S.Ct. 3171, 41 L.Ed.2d 1138 (1974). All these decisions, including <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>however, <em>are </em>perhaps distinguishable. All involve civil rights actions, and many awarded expert witness fees in part on the ground that the award helped effectuate Congress\u2019 intent to encourage initiation of civil rights actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Civil rights actions, however, do not exhaust the realm of the exception. In <em>Henkel, </em>for example, the Supreme Court held a court may exercise its equitable discretion to award as costs the fees of a court-appointed expert even if they exceed the \u00a7 1821 allowance. 284 U.S. at 447, 52 S.Ct. at 225. Similarly, expert fees may be awarded if the losing party has conducted the case in a vexatious or oppressive manner. <em>Kinnear-Weed Corp. v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., </em>441 F.2d 631, 637 (5th Cir. 1971). As a general proposition, one treatise <em>has suggested:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">There is some intimation that the court in the exercise of its general equitable power may permit an additional allowance to be taxed as costs, provided the court is satisfied that the situation is exceptional and the court makes an order to that effect prior to the expert being called.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"abs-dedup-0\">6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 1154.77[5.-3] at 1735 (2d Ed. 1976), <em>relying on Department of Highways v. McWilliams Dredging Co., </em>10 F.R.D. 107 (W.D.La.1950), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>187 F.2d 61 (5th Cir. 1951). Several courts have suggested or held that expert fees may be allowed when the expert\u2019s testimony is crucial to the case\u2019s resolution, and when the party has made a prior application to the court. <em>See, e. g., Cagle v. Cox, supra; Quetel v. Querrand, supra </em>(dictum) (prior application); <em>Pizarro-de Ramirez v. Grecomar Shipping Agency, </em>82 F.R.D. 327 (D.P.R. 1976) (dictum) (prior application).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Not all courts awarding expert fees as costs have required prior application. <em>See, e. g., Worley </em>v. <em>Massey-Ferguson, Inc., </em>79 F.R.D. 534 (N.D.Miss.1978); <em>Welsch v. Likins, </em>68 F.R.D. 589 (D.Minn.), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>525 F.2d 987 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>Brooks v. Town of Sunflower, </em>Civil Action No. GC 71-57-K (N.D.Miss. March 27, 1974). The central concern of all courts that have awarded expert fees as costs under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) has focussed <em>on </em>the necessity of the expert\u2019s testimony. In <em>Brooks, </em>for example, the court overruled defendant\u2019s objection to inclusion of an expert witness fee in plaintiffs\u2019 bill of costs, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">The services of a consultant engineer was an absolute necessity for the proper development of plaintiffs\u2019 case, since the subject matter was of a technical nature, clearly beyond the knowledge of any lay citizen.... While the allowance of a fee for an expert employed by adversary litigants is to be viewed with caution, it is our view that the presentation of plaintiffs\u2019 claims required employment of a consulting engineer to review, analyze, and criticize the plans and technical data prepared by the professional engineers especially employed by the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_H\"><em>quoted in Worley v. Massey-Ferguson Inc., </em>79 F.R.D. at 541. Similarly, in rejecting a claim for expert fees in <em>Wade v. Mississippi Cooperative Services Inc., </em>64 F.R.D. 102 (N.D.Miss.1964), the court held the <em>Wade </em>expert to be insufficiently essential to the case\u2019s disposition. In contrast, it observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxB\">In <em>Brooks, </em>plaintiffs were wholly dependent upon technical engineering study to contest successfully the sufficiency of the Town's plans for installing a new municipal sanitary sewer system, extending water lines and furnishing other municipal services. Obviously, lay testimony in such a case was inappropriate and it was indispensible for the plaintiffs to obtain technical advice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">64 F.R.D. at 105. And in <em>Welsch v. Likins, supra, </em>the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">The court finds that these expert witnesses were an indispensable part of this trial. Their expertise in governmentally operat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ed programs for the retarded was clearly reflected in their testimony and added greatly to the court\u2019s knowledge. This experience, coupled with their observations of the conditions at Cambridge [mental institution], enabled the court to fashion not only necessary but practical requirements to relieve the conditions that exist there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">68 F.R.D. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The court in <em>Welsch </em>also suggested that award of expert fees when expert testimony is indispensable to resolution of the decision does not in fact conflict with prior Supreme Court precedent. As a general matter, the <em>Welsch </em>Court observed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abi\">Although . .. expert witness fees are not taxed as a matter of course, 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice Para. 54.77[5.-3] at 1734 ... the Court has considerable discretion to award these fees when it feels they were particularly necessary under the circumstances of the individual case. See <em>Farmer v. Arabian American Oil Co.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">68 F.R.D. at 596. The <em>Welsch </em>Court was aware of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Henkel </em>decision (it is prominently cited in the excerpt from Moore\u2019s). Nonetheless, the district court seemed to suggest that <em>Farmer </em>had qualified <em>Henkel. </em>This suggestion warrants examination. In <em>Farmer, </em>the Supreme Court upheld the district court\u2019s denial of travel expenses and stenographer\u2019s fees. The district judge had suggested that the prevailing party had deliberately run up a \u201chuge bill of costs.\u201d 379 U.S. at 235, 85 S.Ct. at 416. The Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ac-dedup-0\">We think that under the circumstances [the district judge] could not be charged with any improper exercise of the discretion vested in him by Rule 54(d). We do not regard that Rule as giving district judges unrestrained discretion to tax costs to reimburse a winning litigant for every expense he has seen fit to incur in the conduct of his case. Items proposed by winning parties as costs should always be given careful scrutiny.... Therefore the discretion given district judges to tax costs should be sparingly exercised with reference to expenses not specifically allowed by statute. Such a restrained administration of the Rule is in harmony with our national policy of reducing insofar as possible the burdensome cost of litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\"><em>Farmer </em>appears to hold that Rule 54(d) authorizes district judges to exercise discretion \u2014 albeit \u201csparing\u201d \u2014 to award costs not specifically enumerated in \u00a7 1821. The Court seemed concerned to avoid taxation of unnecessary and possibly vexatious costs accumulated by a prevailing party. Hence the reference to a national policy in favor of restrained award of costs. It is important to note that the Court based its interpretation of Rule 54(d) not on a <em>Henkel-like </em>theory of statutory preclusion of costs not listed in \u00a7 1821, but on policy considerations militating against award of unenumerated costs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A district court should therefore carefully scrutinize the prevailing party\u2019s bill of costs in order to assure that any award will compensate only those expenditures necessary to the litigation. While <em>Farmer </em>commands perhaps a tight-fisted exercise of discretion in order to insure moderation in the cost of litigation, it does not mandate parsimony to the extent of precluding recovery of legitimate and indispensable litigation expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">We therefore agree with the District of Minnesota and the Eighth Circuit that <em>Farmer </em>affords a district court equitable discretion to award expert fees when the expert\u2019s testimony is indispensable to determination of the case. The principles emerging from <em>Farmer </em>and from the decisions awarding expert fees prove congruent to the District of Delaware rule: when the expert\u2019s testimony \u201cplayed a crucial role in the resolution of the issues presented,\u201d a district court, in its discretion, may award expert fees. We therefore hold District of Delaware Local Rule 6.1B(4) consistent with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">Turning to the facts of this case, Captain Roberts alleged an unsafe gangway occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>sioned his fall. It would seem, therefore, that expert testimony concerning gangway safety standards was crucial to resolving CCM\u2019s liability. The district court summarily upheld the Clerk\u2019s assessment denying expert fees. The Clerk, however, merely quoted the local rule, and stated that \u201ctherefore\u201d no fee would be awarded. On this record, we simply cannot tell whether or not the court found Mr. Keeler\u2019s testimony crucial to the case. The court in its discretion may decline to award the expert\u2019s fee, but in our view, the court exercised no discretion one way or the other. An \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review may be generous and forgiving, but it does require the district court to afford some indication that it considered the necessity of Mr. Keel-er\u2019s testimony. On this record, we discern no such indication. Accordingly, we will reverse the denial of expert fees, and will remand to the district court to exercise and to articulate its discretion under District of Delaware Local Rule 6.1B(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The order denying travel expenses of Captain Nikiforos will be reversed with a direction that those expenses be awarded. The order denying award of an expert witness fee for Paul J. Keeler will be reversed with a direction that the ruling be reconsidered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\">. <em>But see Farmer, supra, </em>379 U.S. at 234, 85 S.Ct. at 416, in which the Supreme Court did not distinguish foreign from domestic travel expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-10\">.

I also agree that where a court enters an order directing a \u25a0witness to appear, it does not abuse its discretion in denying travel costs if the losing party demonstrates special, extreme or extraordinary circumstances warranting an exercise of discretion in his favor. I write separately only to emphasize that rather than <em>directing </em>the district court to enter an order granting these expenses, I would simply remand and permit the district court to exercise its discretion with regard to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">As the majority states, the award of travel costs rests in the sound discretion of the district court judge. There is no question that the present record does not disclose any special, extreme, or extraordinary circumstances which could support the denial of Captain Nikiforos\u2019 travel costs. Nevertheless, contrary to the majority\u2019s holding that these costs <em>must be awarded </em>to the Captain, I believe that it is for the district court to explain in the first instance the manner in which it has exercised its discretion in denying such costs and its reasons for so doing. <em>See ADM Corp. v. Speedmas-ter Packaging Corp., </em>525 F.2d 662 (3d Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Accordingly, rather than direct the district court to award the Captain\u2019s travel costs, I would reverse and remand to the district court so that it may reconsider its denial of these travel costs in light of the foregoing standard.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
