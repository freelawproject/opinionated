Rohm &amp; Haas sought an injunction against the issuance to Mobil of an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) for experimental use of Mobil\u2019s product Tackle as a pesticide for soybeans. Rohm &amp; Haas contends, and the defendants do not dispute, that the Environmental Protection Agency, in approving experimental use of Tackle, relied on information in the agency\u2019s file with respect to Rohm &amp; Haas\u2019s product Blazer, which like Tackle contains the active ingredient aci-fluorfen. Such reliance, Rohm &amp; Haas contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-20\">(1) violates Section 5 of the Federal Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136c in that EUP\u2019s may not be issued in reliance on data submitted by anyone but the applicant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-21\">(2) violates restrictions on the use of submitted data in Section 3(c)(1)(D) of the Federal Fungicide and Rodenti-cide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(l)(D).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-22\">Rohm &amp; Haas also contends that the agency should have permitted additional time for public comments in response to its May 5, 1981 Federal Register Notice of Mobil\u2019s application for the EUP.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Upon filing its notice of appeal Rohm <em>&amp; </em>Haas moved for an injunction pending appeal, and alternatively for accelerated disposition of the appeal after oral argument, on the briefs filed with the trial court. All parties agreed to a disposition of the appeal on the submissions to date. We heard oral argument on the merits of the appeal on May 22, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We affirm the judgment appealed from, essentially for the reasons set forth in the comprehensive opinion of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
