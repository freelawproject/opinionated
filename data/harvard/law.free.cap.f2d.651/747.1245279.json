United States, </em>84 Cust.Ct. 200, C.D. 4859, 496 F.Supp. 273 (1980), sustaining appellee\u2019s complaint and holding that hot rolled stainless steel angles, which were annealed and pickled during the manufacturing process, are properly classified under Item 609.82 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), as modified by T.D. 68-9, as hot rolled alloy steel angles, not drilled, not punched, and not otherwise advanced. The government had classified the imported angles under Item 609.86, TSUS, as modified by T.D. 68-9, contending that although the angles were not drilled or punched, they were \u201cotherwise advanced\u201d because they were annealed and pickled in the course of their production. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The imported goods are stainless steel angles. They are formed by \u201chot rolling\u201d a steel billet, cooling it, annealing it (reheat to 1000\u00b0C and cool by quenching in water), straightening (to remove waves created by the rolling process), and \u201cpickling\u201d (dipping the angles into acid solution). The purpose of annealing is to create a uniform and predictable range of physical characteristics in the metal, including corrosion resistance, by uniformly redistributing its chromium content (which had previously been localized after hot rolling in the form of chromium carbide). The pickling step removes the crust or scale which is formed in annealing, insuring that the chromium now located over the entire surface of the metal can combine with oxygen, giving the metal a uniform layer of chromium oxide, which in turn makes it corrosion resistant.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The angles were assessed a duty at 8.5% ad valorem pursuant to classification under 609.86, TSUS, plus additional duties on their chromium and molybdenum content under Items 607.01 and 607.02, respectively, pursuant to Schedule 6, Part 2, Subpart B, headnote 4. Appellee claimed the proper duty to be 0.1 cent/lb. plus 2% ad valorem under 609.82, TSUS. The additional duties on the chromium and molybdenum content were not contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">\n<em>Statutory Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\"><em>Tariff Schedules of the United States </em>SCHEDULE 6. \u2014 METALS AND</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">METAL PRODUCTS ******</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">PART 2. \u2014 METALS, THEIR ALLOYS, AND THEIR BASIC SHAPES AND FORMS</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">\n<em>Part 2 headnotes:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">1.

Baron Tube Co. et al., </em>47 CCPA 69, 71, C.A.D. 730 (1960); <em>Commercial Shearing &amp; Stamping Company v. United States, (Guadalupe Industrial Supply Company, Inc., Party-in-Interest), </em>65 Cust.Ct. 91, 105, C.D. 4060, 317 F.Supp. 750 (1970), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>59 CCPA 203, C.A.D. 1067, 464 F.2d 1048 (1972). Moreover, \u201cmanipulations after rolling, incident to making the rolled shape merchantable and fit for shipment, do not constitute \u2018advance\u2019 within the congressional intent\u201d. <em>American Mannex Corp. v. United States, </em>56 Cust.Ct. 31, 36, C.D. 2608 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-20\">Since the angles were intended to be corrosion resistant, and <em>commercially acceptable </em>angles could not be produced without annealing and pickling, the court agreed with appellee that the imported angles were not \u201cotherwise advanced\u201d within the meaning of the heading superior to Item 609.86. It further noted that the government\u2019s own witness indicated that \u201che had never encountered a single order for nonannealed and nonpickled stainless steel angles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-22\">The court also applied the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>\u201cwhere particular words of description are followed by general terms, the latter refer only to things of a like class with those particularly described,\u201d to reach the same result. \u201cOtherwise advanced\u201d in the statute is preceded by the words \u201cdrilled\u201d and \u201cpunched.\u201d Stating that annealing and pickling are not <em>ejusdem generis </em>with drilling and punching, the court held that the presumption of correctness of classification had been overcome and that the proper classification was under Item 609.82 as alleged by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-23\">\n<em>Arguments On Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b809-24\">The government argues that Items 609.86 and 609.82 provide for angles of alloy iron or steel. They do not require the angles to be stainless steel, the interpretation it alleges was given by the court below. In support of this argument, the government notes that other headnotes demonstrate that \u201cstainless steel\u201d is only one of many grades of steel that fall under the broader <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>term, \u201calloy iron or steel.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Thus, even if all stainless steels required annealing or pickling or both to be commercially acceptable, that would have no bearing on whether those processes are necessary for these imports to be \u201cangles * * * of alloy iron or steel\u201d under either Item 609.86 or 609.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">The government further argues that, in any event, several witnesses have testified that many angles of \u201calloy iron or steel\u201d are sold hot rolled as rolled without either annealing or pickling. Thus, it is stated, it is clear that annealing or pickling or both are not necessary to produce or sell angles of alloy iron or steel, and that \u201cadvanced\u201d must be construed in terms of further processing beyond the minimum required to create the article, i. e., hot rolling, and not in terms of whether the process renders the article commercially acceptable. Appellant states that the court itself noted that annealing and pickling are \u201cnot incidental to the rolling\u201d operation and that, despite this, it erroneously referred to non-annealed and non-pickled angles as \u201csemi-finished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Finally, the government argues that application of the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>is unwarranted, its use being reserved for those cases where the legislative intent is in doubt or ambiguous. In proposing that the meaning of the language in the heading superior to 609.86 is clear, the government repeats much of its earlier argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Appellee agrees with the reasoning of the lower court. Among other things, it states that the government\u2019s argument that the angles should be considered \u201cotherwise advanced\u201d since annealing and pickling are unnecessary to produce certain types of steel angles ignores the fact that the specific types of alloy steel of which the angles were composed, stainless steel types 304 and 316, require annealing and pickling to create a commercially acceptable product. The processes in issue, it is argued, cannot be both steps in creation and advancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The lower court stated, as previously noted, that no step in the creation of ah <em>article </em>can at the same time be an advancement of that <em>article. </em>The question to be resolved, therefore, is whether that \u201carticle\u201d is an [angle] * * * of alloy iron or steel hot rolled as rolled, as the government argues, or a stainless steel angle which conforms to the pickling and annealing requirements of stainless steel types 304 and 316, as appellee asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">Other than for the proposition of law for which it was cited by the lower court, the case of <em>United States v. Baron Tube Co., </em>supra, is not particularly instructive. Baron Tube had imported steel tubes manufactured by (1) hot rolling steel strips to cylindrical shapes with their longitudinal edges abutting in an open seam, (2) closing that open seam with a weld, and (3) removing the rib resulting from the weld. The imports were classified under a section which laid a duty upon \u201clap-welded, butt-welded, seamed, or jointed iron or steel tubes, pipes, flues, and stays * * *.\u201d Baron Tube claimed, and the Customs Court agreed, that the proper duty was found in a section relating to certain structural shapes (not specifically referencing tubes) and \u201call other structural shapes of iron or steel\u201d which are not advanced beyond \u201chammering, rolling, or casting.\u201d In reversing the decision of the Customs Court, this court stated that \u201cthe tubes here are not structural shapes until processing beyond \u2018rolling, hammering, or casting\u2019 has been completed.\u201d Thus, although the court noted that \u201cNo step required for the creation of a structural shape * * * can, at the same time, be an advancement of a structural shape,\u201d it held that the tubes when rolled did not possess the physical properties required to qualify them as structural shapes. This, however, does not help us determine what comprises an angle of \u201calloy iron or steel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">The lower court also stated, regarding \u201ccommercial acceptability,\u201d that, \u201c \u2018manipulations after rolling, incident to making the rolled shape merchantable and fit for shipment, do not constitute \u201cadvance\u201d within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the congressional intent\u2019,\u201d citing <em>American Mannex Corp. v. United States, </em>supra, and <em>E. Dillingham, Inc. v. United States, </em>61 Cust.Ct. 33, C.D. 3522 (1968). Those cases dealt with the removal of useless or dangerous excrescences from rolled steel oil well casings, <em>American Mannex, </em>and from axe head forgings, <em>E. Dillingham. </em>The reasoning behind those decisions was that the cutting or grinding of the excrescences were steps required in the creation of the articles involved \u2014 to make them merchantable and fit for shipment \u2014 and were thus a part of the rolling and forging process. <em>Commercial Shearing &amp; Stamping Co. v. United States, </em>supra at 105, 317 F.Supp. at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The next question we must address in deciding what \u201carticle\u201d we are dealing with, therefore, is whether the steps of annealing and pickling are required to make the imported \u201cangles * * * of alloy iron or steel\u201d merchantable, it being clear that the steps are not required to make the angles \u201cfit for shipment.\u201d This case, however, does not present the type of situation found in <em>American Mannex </em>and <em>E. Dilling-ham, </em>\u2014 whether the excision of useless or dangerous excrescences constitutes \u201cadvancement\u201d \u2014 for the headnote discussion of \u201cbasic shapes and forms\u201d of metals and their alloys is neither incomplete nor ambiguous with regard to annealing and pickling, and, therefore, needs no modification through discussion of what is a \u201ccommercially acceptable\u201d angle. Accordingly, we agree with the government that an angle of \u201calloy iron or steel\u201d should be interpreted to mean just that, an angle of <em>any </em>alloy iron or steel, since headnote 1, supra, refers to alloy iron or steel products \u201cwhether <em>or not </em>\u201d they have been otherwise improved by annealing, pickling and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">We do, however, on the basis of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>conclude that it would be stretching the matter to hold that even though headnote 1 expressly allows annealing and pickling, \u201cDrilled, punched, or otherwise advanced\u201d in the heading superior to Item 609.86 modifies that allowance pursuant to the phrase in headnote 1, \u201cUnless the context requires otherwise.\u201d Drilling and punching are not <em>ejusdem generis </em>with annealing and pickling, and we therefore hold that the context of the heading superior to Item 609.86 is not one which \u201crequires otherwise.\u201d The decision of the lower court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b810-9\"> Schedule 6, Part 2, Subpart B, headnotes 2(h)(ii) and 2(h)(iv).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
