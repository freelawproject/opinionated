Eudy, for his invention of an electrically powered anchor winch. On February 18, 1976 Eudy filed suit in the district court charging Appellee (1) infringed his patent by manufacturing a winch which copied his, (2) and was guilty of obtaining and utilizing trade secrets in producing its winch. Appellant sought damages under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 as well as for unfair competition. Appellee denied the charges and filed four counterclaims charging Eudy with (a) fraud on the Patent Office, (b) unfair trade practice in dealing with Appellee and (c) unfair competition. The fourth counterclaim sought a declaratory judgment as to the invalidity of the Eudy patent. Appellant denied the counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">The district court dismissed the Appellant\u2019s unfair competition count based on affidavits on June 28,1977. On November 2, 1978 the district court issued an order which declared Eudy\u2019s patent void and invalid and dismissed the claim for infringement. The court further ordered that the letters patent were not infringed and that Eudy was guilty of fraud on the patent office. The district court subsequently adopted these orders as its final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">On October 5,1979,604 F.2d 17, this court ruled that the then present posture prohibited the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. The case was remanded to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">On May 22, 1980 the district court held a hearing on Eudy\u2019s motion to reconsider and reopen. Eudy requested permission to demonstrate the differences between his electric winch and the prior art handeranked winch. The district court stated that Eudy had in effect just attached a motor to a hand-cranked winch and reiterated its final judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">This appeal can best be decided from the exact language used by the district judge in the orders above described. The order of June 28, 1977 (entered on June 30, 1977) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">Defendant having pursuant to Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure moved the entry of summary judgment dismissing COUNT II of the Complaint, and, It appearing that Defendant received no confidential disclosure of any information, data or trade secret from Plaintiff, and there is no genuine issue as to any material fact as all material facts are established by the sworn deposition testimony of Plaintiff, Charles N.

Eudy, was not the first inventor of the invention which is the subject matter of U.S. Letters Patent 3,876,184 as that invention was embodied in AnchorMate winches both known to and used by Eudy and others in this country during the period of at least ten (10) years next preceding Eudy\u2019s alleged making of said invention in 1972, and, it also appearing that the invention was made in this country by another, the inventor of the An-chorMate winch, before Eudy\u2019s purported invention thereof, which AnchorMate winch was in public use and on sale in this country more than one year prior to October 2,1972, the date of Eudy\u2019s application, and it further appearing that the invention which is the subject matter of said patent would have been obvious from the prior art to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains at the time Eudy purportedly made said invention, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact as to all material facts are established <em>by </em>the sworn testimony of plaintiff, Charles N. Eudy, and related exhibits, and It Further appearing that the Defendant, Arnold Industries, Inc., is entitled as a matter of law to the judgment sought, said motion is sustained and it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">(1) That United States Letters Patent 3,876,184 are invalid, void and could not heretofore and cannot now or hereafter be infringed;</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">(2) That Count I of the complaint is without merit and hereby dismissed forthwith;</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">(3) That defendant\u2019s First Counterclaim is meritorious and hereby sustained forthwith, and</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">(4) That defendant shall recover its costs to be taxed according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">The order of final judgment entered May 27, 1980 (dated May 22, 1980) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">On Motion of defendant and on the prior Orders of this Court dated June 28, 1977., entered June 30,1977, and dated November 2, 1978, entered November 3, 1978, it appearing to the Court that there is no just reason for delay in entering final judgment on plaintiff\u2019s complaint, defendant\u2019s first counterclaim and certain of the plaintiff\u2019s prayers for relief, it is pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">ORDERED that FINAL JUDGMENT be entered herein,</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">(1) That United States Letters Patent 3.876.184 are invalid, void and could not heretofore and cannot now or hereafter be infringed;</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">(2) That Count I of the Complaint is without merit and hereby dismissed forthwith;</p>\n<p id=\"b361-18\">(3) That defendant\u2019s First Counterclaim is meritorious and hereby sustained forthwith;</p>\n<p id=\"b361-19\">(4) That COUNT II of the Complaint is without merit and hereby dismissed forthwith;</p>\n<p id=\"b361-20\">(5) That United States Letters Patent 3.876.184 were procured by practice of fraud on the Patent Office, wherefore this is an \u201cexceptional case\u201d within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 and defendant shall recover reasonable attorneys fees to be fixed by this Court at a reasonable date after expiration of time for appeal from this judgment has expired without appeal being taken or after all appellate action has terminated and mandate of affirmance has been filed in this Court; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b361-22\">(6) That defendant shall recover its costs to be taxed according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-23\">The legal principles that must guide us in a determination of the validity of this patent were well and fully stated by this court in <em>Cathodic Protection Service v. A. M. Smelting, </em>594 F.2d 499 (5th Cir. 1979), at pages 505-513, and need not be restated here. For an additional and recent statement of relevant authority, see <em>I. U. Technology Corporation v. Research-Cottrell, Inc., </em>641 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>An invention to be patentable must meet the standards expressed in the Constitution and the conditions set forth in Section 101,102 and 103 of the Patent Act. It is a fundamental rule that the patentee must be the first inventor. See <em>Alexander Milburn Co. v. Davis-Bournonville Co., </em>270 U.S. 390 at page 402, 46 S.Ct. 324, at page 325, 70 L.Ed. 651 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">During the course of the prosecution of the application for the Eudy 184 patent it was specifically set forth in the applicant\u2019s application to the Patent Office on June 24, 1974 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">Prior to considering the rejections of the claims and the prior art on which they are based, it is considered appropriate to set forth applicant\u2019s invention to place the issues of the rejection in their proper perspective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">Applicant\u2019s invention provides a powered anchor winch with a simple, compact helical spring cluth release devise which holds the anchor line in a desired position, preventing the weight of the anchor from unreeling the line from the drum unless the release device is activated. The release device further provides for a varied rate of unreeling of the anchor line. The helical clutch spring is always fixed to the drive shaft collar 4 by the keyed connection between the spring end 5a and the collar slot 4a, and by frictional engagement of the upper coils of the spring clutch 5 to the driving collar 4. Only the drum hub is releasable for reverse rotation of the drum relative to the drive shaft and driving collar. The drum is not releaseable while it is being driven. Accordingly, these features and limitations, as set out in the claims, provide the workable structure required for applicant\u2019s invention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">Eudy testified to his intimate knowledge of the AnchorMate handcranked winch structure and to the fact that he knew the AnchorMate structure for upwards of ten years prior to 1972 when he claims to have made the invention which is the subject matter of the 184 patent. A comparison of the patent claims and the Eudy testimony in regard to the same is helpful and enlightening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">Alleged Eudy _Invention_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">Applicant's invention provides a powered anchor winch</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">with a simple, compact helical spring clutch release device which holds the anchor line in a desired position,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-13\">Eudy\u2019s Testimony as to His Invention_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-15\">Q Were you aware of any winches existent before you developed your winch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-17\">Q Could you identify any of those particular items that you are acquainted with in the past?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-18\">A I\u2019m acquainted with the Anchormate hand - cranked winch.

Eudy\u2019s own testimony established the invention was known by others, those who made, those who distributed, those who sold, and those who, like Eudy bought and used AnchorMate winches in this country for at least ten years before Eudy in early 1972 purportedly made that same \u201cinvention\u201d, the subject matter of the 184 patent. The district court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe invention ... of ... Patent 3,876,184... was embodied in AnchorMate winches ... known to ... Eudy and others in this country during the period of at least ten years next preceding Eudy\u2019s alleged making of said invention in 1972, ...\u201d is supported by undisputed evidence of record. Affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment that the 184 patent is invalid, is therefore additionally in order as a matter of law pursuant to Title 35, U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The condition that the invention was not used by others in this country before the invention thereof by Eudy [35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)] was not and could not be met by Eudy\u2019s \u201cinvention\u201d in early 1972 as Eudy has testified herein that the AnchorMate winch embodies the invention which is the subject matter of the 184 patent. He testified in response to question by the district court that AnchorMate winch, \u201c... has been on the market for many many years. And they are very useful and widely used.\u201d [R. IV 11]. His earlier deposition testimony was he knew they were marketed since at least as early as 1960-1961. The district court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe invention ... of ... Patent 3,876,184 ... was embodied in AnchorMate winches ... used by Eudy and others in this country during the period of at least ten years next preceding Eudy\u2019s alleged making of said invention in 1972, ...\u201d is supported by undisputed evidence of record. It is clear under such facts that AnchorMate winches embodying the invention of the 184 patent were used by Eudy and others in this country before Eudy\u2019s \u201cinvention\u201d in early 1972. Eudy\u2019s \u201cinvention\u201d was not patentable upon his application as said condition for patentability specified in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a) constituted a bar, and affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment is in order as a matter of law on such additional ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The condition that the invention was not in public use in this country more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States ([35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b)] was not and could not be met by Eudy\u2019s \u201cinvention\u201d, as marketing of the AnchorMate beginning in 1960-1961 necessarily involved public use of \u201cthe invention\u201d more than one year prior to Eudy\u2019s application filing date of October 2, 1971 as evidenced by his answer [R. IV 11] under oath to question by the district court mentioned in the next preceding paragraph hereof. Eudy\u2019s testimony of record is undisputed evidence supporting the district court\u2019s finding that \u201c... the invention of the An-chorMate winch, before Eudy\u2019s purported invention thereof, ... was in public use ... in this country more than one year prior to October 2, 1972, the date of Eudy\u2019s application...\u201d wherefore affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment is in order as a matter of law on such additional ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The condition that the invention was not on sale in this country more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States [35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b)] was not and could not be met by Eudy\u2019s \u201cinvention\u201d in early 1972 for the AnchorMate\u2019s inventor made the \u201cinvention\u201d before that winch was made in this country by another, the inventor of the AnchorMate winch, before Eudy\u2019s purported invention thereof, ...\u201d [R. 463] is well supported by undisputed evidence of record, and affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment is in order as a matter of law on such additional ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The district court found that the subject matter of the patent would have been obvious from the prior art to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the subject matter pertains under Section 103 of the Patent Act. An invention is not patentable under the obviousness/non-obviousness tests of Section 103 \u201cif the differences between the subject matter sought to \u25a0be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the subject matter pertains\u201d. <em>Graham v. John Deere, </em>383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 693, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1976). As the AnchorMate winch by Eudy\u2019s own testimony embodies the invention which is the subject matter of the 184 patent that invention was obvious from the prior art AnchorMate winch. The district court\u2019s finding is clearly supported by the evidence of the record as is the conclusion drawn therefrom that the 184 patent is invalid and void as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The legal principles that must guide us in regard to misrepresentations to the Patent Office were stated by this court in <em>Parker v. Motorola, </em>524 F.2d 518 (5th Cir. 1975), at pages 534-535:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">Our start is with the rubric that because the grant of a patent affected with a public interest, an applicant owes \u201can uncompromising duty to report to [Patent Office] all facts concerning possible fraud or inequitableness underlying the applications in issue.\u201d <em>Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Mach. Co., </em>1945, 324 U.S. 806, 818, 65 S.Ct. 993, 999, 89 L.Ed. 1381, 1388; <em>Kingsland </em>v. <em>Dorsey, </em>1949, 338 U.S. 318, 319, 70 S.Ct. 123, 124, 94 L.Ed. 123, 126. The concept that a patent is invalid because of misconduct by the patentee in proceedings before the Patent Office goes beyond the classical definition of fraud, and encompasses a wide variety of inequitable conduct. <em>Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. David-Edwards Pharmacal Corp., </em>2 Cir. 1971, 443 F.2d 867, 881; <em>Norton v. Curtiss, </em>1960, 433 F.2d 779, 793, 57 C.C.P.A. 1384. Although the type of misconduct before the Patent Office which results in the invalidity of a patent admits to no fixed parameters, it is necessary that there be some element of wrongfulness, willfulness, or bad faith. See <em>Monsanto Co. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co., </em>3 Cir. 1972, 456 F.2d 592, 597, cert. denied, 407 U.S. 934, 92 S.Ct. 2463, 32 L.Ed.2d 817; <em>A. H. Emery Co. v. Marcan Products Corp., </em>2 Cir. 1968, 389 F.2d 11, cert. denied 393 U.S. 835, 89 S.Ct. 109, 21 L.Ed.2d 106; <em>Xerox Corp. v. Dennison Mfg. Co., </em>D.C.N.Y.1971, 322 F.Supp. 963, 969. Hence, mere negligent omissions or misstatements to the Patent Office do not provide sufficient basis for a finding of fraud or misrepresentation by an applicant for a patent. <em>Xerox Corp., supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">In <em>Beckman Instruments, Inc. v. Chemtronics, Inc., </em>5 Cir. 1970, 439 F.2d 1369, cert. denied 400 U.S. 956, 91 S.Ct. 353, 27 L.Ed.2d 264, this Court held the patent in suit invalid (i) as anticipated by the prior art, and (ii) because of intentional nondisclosure to the Patent Office by the patentee in securing the patent. <em>Id. </em>at 1374-80. We found in <em>Beckman, </em>that the patentee deliberately withheld from the Patent Office knowledge of prior art, which would, if known by the Examiner, have resulted in the denial of the patent, and, therefore, the patent was invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 1374, 1378, 1379. Similarly, in both <em>Armour &amp; Co. v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>7 Cir. 1972, 466 F.2d 767, and in <em>Monsanto Co. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co., supra, </em>relied on by Motorola, there was evidence that the respective patentees made knowingly false statements and concealed material facts which would have resulted in the denial of the patent by the Patent Office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alx\">The district court determined under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 that this is an exceptional case and that the appellee as the prevailing party was entitled to recover attorney fees and costs. The record here does not support the findings as to exceptional case. This circuit in <em>Parker, </em>requires \u201csome element of wrongfulness, wilfulness, or bad faith\u201d as a prerequisite to finding fraud on the Patent Office. Other circuits may impose a slightly heavier standard referring to \u201cstrict proof\u201d or \u201cclear and definite proof\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>of wrongful conduct. See <em>Carpet Seaming Tape Licensing </em>v. <em>Best Seam, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 1133, 1138-39 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Super Products Corp. v. D. P. Way Corp., </em>546 F.2d 748, 758 (7th Cir. 1976); and <em>Pfizer, Inc. v. International Rectifier Corp., </em>538 F.2d 180, 186-187 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The findings entered by the district court are insufficient to show that Eudy acted in bad faith or wilfully. The only explicit finding is that \u201cthis is an exceptional case\u201d. There is nothing in the findings or record to demonstrate that Eudy acted with intent to deceive the Patent Office. At worst, the record shows that Eudy\u2019s <em>pro se </em>actions before the Patent Office were incompetent.
