The two indictments were joined for trial. The only grounds of appeal that will merit discussion deal with the admission by the trial court of two statements testified to by other witnesses as having been made by the defendant Ad-cock. In order to test the admissibility of these two statements under some exception to the hearsay rule, it is necessary to outline proof in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), <em>reh. denied </em>315 U.S. 827, 62 S.Ct. 629, 86 L.Ed. 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">A jury could have believed the following facts as testified to by Government witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">(A) Adcock, defendant-appellant, is charged in the first indictment, with one count (Count I) for possession of 18 counterfeit federal reserve notes and one count (Count II) for delivery of those notes to Gary Stillings.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">On December 22,1979, Gary Stillings and Robert Adcock met at a motel in Winter Park, Florida, according to an agreement they had reached earlier in the day whereby Adcock had agreed to pay Stillings $380.00 for a pound of marijuana. Adcock was in the motel room when Stillings arrived, and the two smoked some of Stillings\u2019 marijuana. Adcock then produced a bank bag full of money which Stillings thought was counterfeit. Stillings testified that he told Ad-cock that he did not want to be paid with counterfeit money. The two continued discussions over a few drinks, some more marijuana and some cocaine and Adcock told Stillings he could pass the counterfeit bills at volume business retail establishments and age the counterfeit bills by rubbing them between newspaper. Stillings left with $380 in counterfeit bills (nineteen $20 bills).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">When Stillings was unsuccessful in his attempt to pass one of the bills, he hid the money. Then he made a phone call anonymously to the Secret Service to find out whether a citizen could get real money for turning in bogus money. Agent Don Steb-bins told Stillings that he could not get real money and asked Stillings to identify himself. Stillings refused to do so. Several days later, Stillings called Stebbins and agreed to turn over the counterfeit money to him. When they met, Stillings turned in the counterfeit money except for one $20 federal reserve counterfeit note which he kept and subsequently lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">(B) Count III of the first indictment charged Adcock with the delivery of one counterfeit $20 federal reserve note to Robbie Campbell at the ABC Lounge in Cassel-berry, Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">On New Year\u2019s Eve, Campbell ran into Adcock and another individual at the ABC Lounge. The barmaid was unable to change Campbell\u2019s $50 bill when he tried to pay her for drinks so Adcock gave Campbell two $20\u2019s and one $10 for the $50. Later that evening, after Campbell had unsuccessfully attempted to use the remaining $20 to pay for drinks, a Casselberry police officer determined that it was a counterfeit bill. A few days later, Adcock approached Campbell at the ABC Lounge and asked him to give someone $1,000 in $20 bills. Campbell took the money. Later he noticed the bills were counterfeit so he gave Adcock back the $1,000, telling Adcock he did not want to take counterfeit money. Adcock denied that it was counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">(C) Appellant was charged in Count I of the second indictment with obstructing an official investigation by threatening Gary Stillings.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">During January, Adcock and a six-foot-five, 250 pound companion, Larson, went to the home of Stillings\u2019 brother, David, where Gary lived. Failing to find Gary Stillings there, they told David that Gary was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u201cdead man\u201d if he testified for the Secret Service. Stillings was frightened by the incident, called the Secret Service, and asked a friend, Marty Cohen, to move in with him for protection. Later Adcock and Larson approached Gary Stillings at the ABC Lounge where he was dancing with a lady. They grabbed him, escorted him outside and told him that they were going to fix him so he could never speak to the Secret Service again. They forced him inside a van where Larson placed a gun in his lap and told him that he hoped he realized they meant business.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Marty Cohen worked out an agreement with Adcock and Larson whereby the latter two agreed to leave David alone and David\u2019s friends would not avenge any action taken by Adcock on Gary Stillings. After Adcock had told Cohen that breaking Gary\u2019s leg would not be sufficient to prevent him from testifying he implied that it would be necessary for his mother to find him dead alongside of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">(D) Appellant was charged in Count II of the second indictment with obstructing an official investigation by threatening Robert Campbell if he testified against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">On January 23, 1980, Robert Campbell was at the Sheraton Inn when Adcock approached him and requested to have a discussion with him in a room on the backside of the motel. Once within the room, Ad-cock told Campbell that there were some people who were very upset with Campbell and wanted to hurt him for having spoken to the Secret Service. The conversation ended when Adcock received a phone call, but not before Campbell felt intimidated and threatened by Adcock\u2019s actions. Ad-cock called Campbell later on two occasions and once explicitly told him that \u201che would have someone brought in to take care of everybody that testified against him, including Gary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">THE OBJECTIONS TO EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">(A) Adcock took the stand and denied that he had known that the federal reserve notes were counterfeit and he undertook to explain away the telephone conversations and other damaging statements relative to threats. Under cross-examination, in response to the question by the prosecuting attorney, \u201cwhen is the last time you talked to Mr. Campbell?\u201d he answered, \u201cyesterday\u201d and in response to the question, \u201cand what was the conversation you had with him?\u201d he answered, \u201cHi, Robbie, how are you doing?\u201d In point of fact, Adcock had accosted Campbell in the men\u2019s restroom the previous day during the trial and had said to him that his testimony \u201cwas hurting him, killing him, that my [Campbell\u2019s] testimony was hurting him.\u201d This testimony, given by Campbell after the Government had recalled Adcock to the witness stand to attempt to get him to confirm it, is the basis of the first of the two objections to the admission of evidence with which we deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">(B) During the cross-examination of the defendant, the Government questioned him about conversations he had had with Agent Robert Connelly of the Secret Service. The following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">Q: Okay. Did you \u2014 do you ever recall telling him, there\u2019s going to be a lot of people get hurt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-12\">A: That\u2019s quite possible that I said that. A lot of people were being hurt; my business associates, my family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-13\">Q: Okay. Let me ask you this, do you recall Mr. Connelly advising you in response to that that the Secret Service would take whatever measures were necessary to ensure the safety of any witnesses in their investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-14\">A: Sir, their safety was never a concern. There were no physical threats made or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-15\">THE COURT: Now just a minute. That isn\u2019t the question that was asked. Read the question. State your question again, and you answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-16\">BY MR. URBANIAK:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-17\">Q: Do you recall Mr. Connelly advising you that the United States Secret Service would take whatever measures were necessary to ensure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>safety of any witnesses in their investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">A: I don\u2019t recall that being said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">A: It\u2019s possible that it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">Q: Do you recall you answering' to Mr. Connelly, \u201cYou all can\u2019t help everyone\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">A: Since they were obviously hurting me and members of family as well, and friends, that\u2019s quite possible that I said that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">The Government then called Agent Con-nelly in rebuttal. Agent Connelly testified that on February 14,1980, he was called on the telephone by the defendant. His testimony, objected to by the defendant, follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">A: Mr. Adcock said, \u201cWhat are you trying to do to me?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">MR. STEVENS: Your Honor, again this is not impeachment material. I would object and move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-14\">THE WITNESS: \u201cI thought this thing was over with\u201d he said, \u201cAre you going to get me indicted by the Grand Jury?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHj\">I advised Mr. Adcock that we had nothing personal against him. We were conducting an ongoing investigation, and that I was not at liberty to discuss with him our investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-15\">Q: Did he say anything after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-16\">A: Yes, sir, he did. He said there were going to be a lot of people get hurt. I told Mr. Adcock that was a foolish statement to say, and that the Secret Service would take whatever measures were necessary to protect any of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-17\">Q: Excuse me, I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-18\">A: Mr. Adcock then said, \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014 you can\u2019t protect them all.\u201d And at that point I terminated the conversation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-19\">When Connelly was cross-examined he conceded that he had said in his concluding statement \u201cyou all can\u2019t \u2018help\u2019 everyone.\u201d The admission of this testimony is the basis of the second ground of appeal with which we deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-21\">THE CAMPBELL TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"ATzy\">The appellant contends that the admission of Campbell\u2019s restroom testimony was improper, because it was useful only for the purpose of bolstering the testimony of the Government witness, Stebbins, and that its admission would violate the provisions of Rule 403, F.R.Evid. because even if relevant, its probative value would be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-22\">While appellant frankly concedes that he is unable to find any case in this or any other Circuit which deals with the precise point in question, <em>i. </em>e., whether the defendant\u2019s opinion of the weight of the testimony can be properly presented to the jury solely to comment on the weight of the evidence, he cites us to <em>U. S. v. Garza, </em>608 F.2d 659 (5th Cir. 1979). In the <em>Garza </em>case, the court criticized a prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks which the court found to have been for the purpose of giving added credibility to the prosecutor\u2019s witnesses. In that case, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-23\">A criminal trial provides a neutral arena for the presentation of evidence upon which alone the jury must base its determination of a Defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt. Attorneys for both sides, following rules of evidence and procedures designed to protect the neutrality and fairness of the trial, must stage their versions of the truth within that arena.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-24\">608 F.2d at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-25\">The Government responds by taking the broad position that <em>any </em>statement by the accused in a criminal case which is not explicitly barred \u201cby the doctrine of confessions or by the privilege against self-incrimination, is usable against him as an admission,\u201d citing <em>United States v. Rouse, </em>5 Cir., 452 F.2d 311 (1971). The language of the <em>Rouse </em>case supporting the Government\u2019s contention is \u201cas stated by Wigmore, \u2018any and every statement of an accused person, so far as not excluded by the doctrine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>confessions ... or by the privilege against self-incrimination ... is usable against him as an <em>admission </em>\u2019 ....\u201d 6 Wigmore Evid. \u00a7 1732, p. 99 (3d ed. 1940). It is doubtful that the statement was intended by this Court or by Wigmore as broadly as the Government here contends. That is to say, we assume that in the <em>Rouse </em>case we meant to say that if, in fact, from the statement a jury could reasonably infer that the accused was <em>admitting </em>some element of the offense, then the statement was admissible against him as an admission. We do not construe the language of the opinion in <em>Rouse </em>as saying that any statement made by an accused, even though it could not possibly be construed as admitting any element of the offense charged, could nevertheless be received against him as an admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Here, the statement made by Ad-cock that Campbell\u2019s testimony was \u201ckilling\u201d Adcock could not be construed by a jury as an admission by Adcock of any of the elements of the offense. It could, of course, be construed as an admission by Adcock that what Campbell was testifying to was really very harmful to him. At the commencement of the trial, the trial court had invoked \u201cthe rule,\u201d that is, he had instructed all witnesses in the case to refrain from discussing the case with anyone else and from letting anyone discuss the case with them. When the defendant accosted the witness Campbell in the restroom and told him his testimony was \u201ckilling\u201d Adcock, the latter knew he was causing Campbell to violate the court\u2019s specific instructions. Such a comment may have been intended by Adcock to be a continuation of the threat he had made to Campbell earlier \u2014\u201cI told you we would have someone brought in to take care of everybody who testifies\u201d against me, and, now Adcock approaches Campbell and tells him not only that he has testified against Adcock, but that his testimony is \u201ckilling\u201d Adcock. If it was such a continuation of the threat, it would be admissible even though it occurred months after the original threat. In any event, it hardly seems open to Adcock to object to introduction into evidence of a conversation he started in violation of the court\u2019s order, especially one apparently designed to have such a chilling effect on the witness. We conclude that it was not error for the court to admit the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">THE CONNELLY TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">It is difficult to understand the basis for appellant\u2019s challenge to the admissibility of Connelly\u2019s testimony relative to the telephone call made to him on February 14 by Adcock. The court already having received substantial evidence of threats by Adcock against both Stillings and Campbell as potential witnesses, it would seem quite relevant for the court to admit evidence of Adcock\u2019s own repetition of the threat to the Secret Service agent to prove the element of intent necessary for a conviction under the obstruction statute. Here is a man who, according to other testimony, had told Campbell that \u201cthere were going to be a lot of people hurt\u201d and \u201che would have someone brought in to take care of everybody that testified against him, including Gary\u201d who now calls the Secret Service agent himself and repeats the statement \u201cthere were going to be a lot of people get hurt.\u201d Then, in response to Agent Connelly\u2019s statement \u201cthat was a foolish statement to say, and that the Secret Service would take whatever measures were necessary to protect any of the witnesses,\u201d Adcock replied \u201cyou all can\u2019t help everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The statement made by Mr. Connelly that the Secret Service would take whatever measures were necessary to protect all the witnesses could not be converted by Adcock into something different merely because he responded by saying: \u201cYou all can\u2019t help everyone.\u201d The defendant\u2019s original statement that \u201cthere were going to be a lot of people get hurt\u201d was construed by Connelly as being a threat to the safety of the witnesses. His answer makes this plain. He said \u201cthe Secret Service would take whatever measures were necessary to protect any witnesses.\u201d We conclude that the jury could properly make the same inferences from the language as did the person to whom the call was made. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>permitted the introduction of this evidence as proof of the intent back of the original threat. We think it did not err in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">OTHER OBJECTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Appellant does not complain of the lack of sufficient evidence to convict with respect to either of the indictments. He bases his complaint upon the trial court\u2019s errors in the admission of the two statements already referred to and to the court\u2019s admission of evidence as to Adcock\u2019s negotiating a purchase of marijuana from one of the witnesses. The trial court gave proper cautionary instructions with respect to such evidence, and we agree that since the counterfeit bills were transferred in payment of the marijuana purchase, no error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Appellant\u2019s general contention that these several bits of evidence which were admitted should have been excluded under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is not well taken. Necessarily, the rule that even though relevant, evidence may be excluded \u201cif its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\u201d must contemplate a careful weighing by the trial judge of the threatened danger of unfair prejudice. As we have stated in <em>United States v. Frick, </em>588 F.2d 531 (5th Cir. 1979), \u201ca trial judge\u2019s ruling under Rule 403 may be reversed only if there was a clear abuse of discretion. <em>U. S. v. McDaniel, </em>574 F.2d 1224, 1227 (C.A.5 1978); <em>U. S. v. Grimm, </em>568 F.2d 1136, 1138 (C.A.5 1978); <em>U. S. v. Brown, </em>547 F.2d 1264, 1266 (C.A.5 1977).\u201d Here, we find no such abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
