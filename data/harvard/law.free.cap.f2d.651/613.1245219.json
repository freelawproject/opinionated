WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">A 1975 Oregon statute restricts attempts by employers to negotiate settlements with employees injured in work-related accidents. ORS 17.075, 17.085, 17.990.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Several railroads sued the Oregon attorney general to enjoin enforcement of the Act, contending that it is preempted by federal law, unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce, and violates First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The acting attorney general has been substituted as appellee on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">The district court, 458 F.Supp. 593, determined that the railroads would be injured if the penalty provision were enforced, but concluded that a threat of enforcement was not established. The attorney general stipulated that he would advise Oregon district attorneys to presume the act constitutional and that they would enforce it unless restrained, but the court declined to infer that the district attorneys, who were not parties, actually would do so. Because the attorney general lacked authority to prosecute, and because no other injury was shown,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court dismissed for lack of a justiciable controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">Oregon law provides that the attorney general \u201cshall consult with, advise and direct the district attorneys in all criminal causes and matters relating to state affairs in their respective counties.\u201d ORS 180.-060(4). State court decisions on his role are few and do not establish that he could prosecute a violation of the challenged act or compel the district attorneys to prosecute or refrain from doing so. <em>Compare Thornton v. Johnson, </em>253 Or. 342, 453 P.2d 178, 186 (1969) (per curiam) (Oregon law \u201cappear[s] to provide some control over district attorneys by the Attorney General\u201d) <em>with State ex rel. Thornton v. Williams, </em>215 Or. 639, 336 P.2d 68, 74-75 (1959) (attorney general cannot initiate criminal investigation or prosecution unless directed by governor).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-16\">The railroads contend that the attorney general\u2019s stated intention to advise and direct the district attorneys to prosecute gives rise to a justiciable controversy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We believe, however, that the attorney general\u2019s connection with enforcement is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Article III requires a concrete dispute between the parties. \u201c[A] federal court [can] act only to redress injury that fairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant, and not injury that results from the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u201d <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org, </em>426 U.S. 26, 41-42, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1925, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Further, when a state officer is sued to enjoin enforcement of state law, he must have \u201csome connection\u201d with enforcement or suit against him would be equivalent to suit against the state and would violate the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 157, 28 S.Ct. 441, 452, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908); <em>Mendez v. Heller, </em>530 F.2d 457, 460 (2d Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In <em>Boating Industry Associations v. Marshall, </em>601 F.2d 1376 (9th Cir. 1979), we held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge a Labor Department interpretive notice because the notice merely reflected the opinion of the defendants about the meaning of a statute and was not binding on the courts or the Benefits Review Board. <em>Id. </em>at 1382. \u201cA contrary interpretation would not have insulated recreational boat manufacturers from later prosecution were the interpretation rejected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1383 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The attorney general\u2019s advice that the statute was unconstitutional would not insulate the plaintiffs from prosecution if this advice were rejected by the district attorneys. His power to direct them suggests that his opinion might be persuasive, but the Oregon courts have not held that it would be binding and Oregon law guarantees district attorneys autonomy. <em>See </em>ORS 180.070(4) (powers conferred on attorney general do \u201cnot deprive the district attorneys of any of their authority, or relieve them from any of their duties to prosecute criminal violations of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The attorney general\u2019s power to direct and advise does not make the alleged injury fairly traceable to his action, nor does it establish sufficient connection with enforcement to satisfy <em>Ex parte Young. </em>The suit presents no justiciable controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-12\">. The plaintiffs, in addition to challenging the penalty provision, alleged that nonpenalty provisions would injure them in proceedings involving employee claims for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">The district court found that no injury had resulted. Even if a plaintiff had been injured by nonpenalty provisions, the injury could not have been traced to the action of the attorney general, against whom relief is sought. See <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U.S. 26, 41, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1925, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976) (\u201ca federal court [can] act only to redress injury that fairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-18\">. The railroads\u2019 contention that the attorney general could or would bring a civil suit to enjoin violations is wholly speculative. <em>Cf. State ex rel. Johnson v. Bauman, </em>7 Or.App. 489, 492 P.2d 284, 285 (1971) (attorney general has common law power to sue for injunction to abate public nuisance, but power may be transferred by statute to other agencies).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-19\">Although it is conceivable that the Oregon courts might allow the attorney general to seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>an injunction, they have not done so and there is no indication that the attorney general will ask them to do so. <em>See Shell Oil Co. v. Noel, </em>608 F.2d 208, 212 (1st Cir. 1979) (\u201cnot fanciful to suppose\u201d state courts would permit attorney general to sue for injunction, but they had not yet done so and there was no justiciable controversy).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
