Sellers alleges that certain evidence (police offense reports) favorable to him was withheld by the prosecution during his state court trial for murder which could have had an effect on his conviction and/or sentence. We agree with the petitioner Sellers that if he did not have the opportunity to review the allegedly withheld (but favorable) police offense reports, it constituted a violation of his due process rights. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). However, because it is ambiguous from the state court records whether or not these reports were furnished to the petitioner for use at his murder trial, we must remand to the district court below for an evidentiary hearing on this issue. If the district court concludes at that hearing that the petitioner did not receive them, then Sellers\u2019s conviction is to be vacated and the writ of habeas corpus shall issue unless the petitioner is retried within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">The petitioner Sellers was arrested in the early morning hours on November 26,1969, at the Hamilton Junior High School in Houston, Texas. Officers Kenneth Wayne Moody and R. R. Dietrich of the Houston Police Department had gone to the school in response to a silent burglar alarm which had been triggered. After arriving at the school, they started to conduct an investigation, shots were fired, and Officer Moody was fatally wounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-7\">Shortly thereafter, other officers arrived and, in their search of the premises, apprehended the petitioner Sellers, who himself had been shot and was apparently hiding in an upstairs classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-10\">Sellers was subsequently indicted by a Texas Grand Jury (Petitioner\u2019s Ex. 17a, p. 2) for the killing of Officer Moody. This was a capital offense. After a jury trial, he was found guilty, and the jury fixed his sentence at life imprisonment (i. e., instead of sentencing him to death, or to imprisonment for a lesser term of years, as was within the discretion of the jury). His conviction was upheld on direct appeal. <em>Sellers v. State, </em>492 S.W.2d 265 (Tex.Cr.App.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-11\">After unsuccessfully seeking state habeas corpus relief (Record p. 205), Sellers filed for habeas relief in federal district court. The basis of Sellers\u2019s application was that certain offense reports prepared by members of the Houston Police Department were withheld from him at the time of his trial for murder, in violation of his due process rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Brady v. Maryland, supra. </em>Specifically, the offense reports allegedly suppressed revealed that: (1) Santos Cant-era \u201corally admitted his part in this offense\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s Ex. 1); (2) Santos Cant-era made his admission of guilt to the police after he was implicated in the murder by three friends \u2014 Alfredo Valenzuela, Albert Santos and Amos Santos (Alfredo and Amos both told police that Cantera had admitted to each of them that he had killed the officer at Hamilton Jr. High School) (Petitioner\u2019s Ex. 1); (3) Santos Cantera had been charged with the burglary of another school on Sept. 9, 1969, less than 3 months before the offense in question (Petitioner\u2019s Ex. 1); and (4) Santos Cantera was charged with aggravated assault on a police officer on August 5, 1969, approximately 4 months before the murder at the junior high (Petitioner\u2019s Ex. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-12\">After an \u201cevidentiary hearing\u201d on Sellers\u2019s petition (at which the state was required to produce its file), the matter was submitted on the basis of the police and state judicial records. In recommending denial of the petitioner\u2019s application, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>Magistrate failed, however, to make a definitive ruling on whether or not the offense reports above cited were actually suppressed at trial. Nevertheless, the Magistrate concluded that, even if the reports were suppressed, Sellers \u201cfailed to carry his burden in this case, that is, to demonstrate facts that establish a constitutional violation.\u201d (Record p. 207).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">In recommending denial of Sellers\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus, the Magistrate found that Cantera\u2019s oral statement was <em>\u201cinculpatory </em>in that it place[d] Petitioner at the scene voluntarily,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Record p. 200); that the allegedly suppressed evidence was not material \u201cin any constitutional sense\u201d (Record p. 200), and that \u201cCantera\u2019s statements would have been inadmissible\u201d under art. 38.22, Tex.Code Cr.P.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Valenzuela\u2019s written statement (implicating Cantera) inadmissible as hearsay. (Record p. 201).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">After a thorough review of the record before us, we find that Sellers demonstrated sufficient facts to establish a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">In <em>Brady v. Maryland, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held \u201cthat the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution, 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196. In establishing a <em>Brady </em>violation, a defendant must prove: \u201c(1) the prosecution\u2019s suppression of evidence, (2) the favorable character of the suppressed evidence for the defense; (3) the materiality of the suppressed evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Sink, </em>586 F.2d 1041, 1051 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. den., 443 U.S. 912, 99 S.Ct. 3102, 61 L.Ed.2d 876 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-15\">We pretermit for the moment discussion of the prosecution\u2019s alleged suppression of the police offense reports. See part II, infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-16\">\n<em>Favorable Character of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-17\">The Magistrate concluded that the offense reports allegedly suppressed were not favorable to Sellers because they were in-culpatory. As the Magistrate correctly noted, the offense reports were inculpatory to the extent that they placed the petitioner Sellers voluntarily at Hamilton Junior High School on the night that Officer Moody was killed. However, these reports were clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number><em>exculpatory </em>in that they indicated that another individual, Santos Cantera, not only was at the school that night, but admitted to others that he was the one who shot Officer Moody. (Petitioner\u2019s Ex. 1). Additionally, Seller\u2019s defense counsel was not afforded the opportunity to further develop the \u201ckidnap theory\u201d presented by the petitioner in light of this newly discovered, and partially exculpatory, evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">We find, then, that the suppressed reports were favorable to the petitioner with respect to the determination of his guilt. A fortiori, this suppressed evidence was even more favorable to the petitioner with regard to his punishment. <em>Brady v. Maryland, supra. </em>The trial court instructed the jurors that \u201cthe punishment for murder with malice aforethought shall be by death or by confinement in the Texas Department of Corrections for life or <em>for </em>a <em>term of years not less than two.\u201d </em>(Petitioner\u2019s Ex. 17a, p. 37) (Emphasis added). It is not inconceivable that, had the jury been made aware of this additional evidence (implicating Cant-era with Officer Moody\u2019s murder), Sellers (even if found guilty of murder as a co-defendant, but not as the actual \u201ctrigger-man\u201d) might have received a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">\n<em>Materiality of Suppressed Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AY6\">The Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), recognized three types of situations in which the <em>Brady </em>doctrine is applicable: (1) Those cases in which the prosecution has knowingly used false or perjured testimony \u2014 reversal required \u201cif there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 103, 96 S.Ct. at 2397; (2) Those cases in which the defense made a specific request for a particular item that was not disclosed \u2014 reversal is required if the suppressed evidence might have affected the outcome of the trial. <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 104, 96 S.Ct. at 2398; and (3) Those cases in which the defense made only a general request or in which the state does not volunteer information in its possession that might be of an exculpatory nature \u2014 reversal is required only if the suppressed evidence \u201ccreates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist.... If there is no reasonable doubt about guilt whether or not the additional evidence is considered, there is no justification for a new trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 112-13, 96 S.Ct. at 2402.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">In the case before us, we find that the defense specifically requested the prosecution to produce \u201cthe offense reports and any other written statements\u201d dealing with this case. (Petitioner\u2019s Ex. 17a, pp. 73-74). The petitioner could not have been more specific absent express knowledge of Cant-era\u2019s, Valenzuela\u2019s and the Santos Brothers\u2019 reports. Accordingly, reversal is required if the suppressed evidence might have affected the outcome of the trial. Having already concluded that this evidence was favorable, we find that the suppressed evidence satisfies this threshold of materiality, both with respect to the petitioner\u2019s guilt and to his punishment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-12\">The final <em>Brady </em>requirement that we must address is the suppression issue \u2014 were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>the police offense reports relating to Cant-era withheld (either intentionally or not) from the petitioner. The conflicting statements made by the Magistrate in his findings and conclusions of law leave us confused as to whether he made a specific finding of fact on this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-4\">The Petitioner was supplied at his State-Court trial only with that portion of the offense report which had been made by officers Smith and Langford. The \u201csupplemental offense report\u201d reflecting the \u201cadmissions\u201d and proceedings involving Santos Cantera was apparently made by Officers Cashmere, McNutt, Brandan, Massey and Bland; <em>it was never produced. </em>(Record p. 198). [Italics supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-5\">From the state appeal record and trial transcript before the Magistrate, it is impossible to determine whether this supplemental report was included in those reports given to defense counsel following testimony by Homicide Officers Smith and Langford. (Record p. 199).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-6\">The Magistrate here will not speculate what statements or lab reports were contained in Officer Smith and Officer Lang-ford\u2019s reports, even though they were the chief homicide investigating officers in that case. The Magistrate further notes that all <em>physical </em>evidence was available for inspection and expert witness testing by defense counsel. (Record p. 208). [Italics supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-7\">After reviewing the entire police records and the state court record, we ourselves are unable to determine positively whether the supplemental offense reports containing information on Cantera, Valenzuela, and the Santos brothers were furnished to the defense for trial preparation. The clear implication that we perceive from the record is that this material was indeed withheld, for there is a conspicuous absence in the state court trial record of any attempt to raise the issue suggested by the (withheld) offense reports or of any mention of the individuals concerned by the defense or the state. Furthermore, the state itself has never asserted that it turned over this requested information to the defense. We must therefore remand this issue to the district court for a specific finding as to that issue, including the taking of additional evidence with regard to it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-10\">In conclusion, we find that if the offense reports requested by the petitioner were withheld from him during his state court trial for murder, this constituted a violation of his due process rights. We remand this proceeding to the district court for a further evidentiary hearing to determine if the requested offense reports were actually withheld. If, after such a hearing, the district court concludes that they were, we further instruct that court to vacate the petitioner\u2019s conviction and to issue the writ of habeas corpus, unless within a reasonable period of time to be fixed by the district court the state shall again try the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1135-8\">. Sellers\u2019s petition was heard before a United States Magistrate, whose findings and conclusions of law were adopted by the United States District Court. (Rec. p. 210)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1135-9\">. At the evidentiary hearing held before the Magistrate, Sellers also asserted that the prosecution withheld other evidence (blood tests, photographs, etc.) in addition to the offense reports implicating another individual in Moody\u2019s murder. On appeal, however, Sellers only challenges the alleged impermissible suppression of offense reports favorable to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">. As part of his defense presented at his trial for murder, Sellers contended that he was kidnapped by 3 masked men on the night the school was broken into and Officer Moody killed. He recognized the voice of one to be that of Leonard Minor, a personal enemy of his. Sellers contends that he was brought to the school by these individuals, knocked unconscious, and consequently framed by them (when he was discovered by the police on the second floor) for the burglary of the school and the murder of Officer Moody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1136-9\">. Article 38.22 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-10\">Sec. 3. (a) An oral statement of an accused made as a result of custodial interrogation is admissible against the accused in a criminal proceeding for the purpose of impeachment only and when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-11\">(1) an electronic recording, which may include motion picture, video tape, or other visual recording, is made of the statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-12\">(2) prior to the statement but during the recording the accused is told that a recording is being made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-13\">(3) prior to the statement but during the recording the accused is given a warning in Subsection (a) of Section 2 above and the accused knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waives any rights set out in the warning;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-19\">(4) the recording device was capable of making an accurate recording, that the operator was competent, and that the recording is accurate and has not been altered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-20\">(5) the statement is witnessed by at least two persons; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-21\">(6) all voices on the recording are identified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-22\">(b) Every electronic recording of any statement made by an accused during custodial interrogation must be preserved until its destruction is permitted by order of a district court of this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-23\">(c) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to any statement which contains assertions of facts or circumstances that are found to be true and which conduce to establish the guilt of the accused, such as the finding of secreted or stolen property or the instrument with which he states the offense was committed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">. A fourth situation was recognized by this court in <em>Garrison v. Maggio, </em>540 F.2d 1271 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. den., 431 U.S. 940, 97 S.Ct. 2655, 53 L.Ed.2d 258 (1977). There, the court held that \u201can even stricter standard of materiality, one requiring petitioner to demonstrate that the new evidence probably would have resulted in an acquittal, is appropriate before a new trial must be granted for the nondisclosure of purely impeaching evidence.\u201d Id. at 1274.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">. In addressing the issue of materiality, the Magistrate found that Cantera\u2019s oral statements and Valenzuela\u2019s written statement would have been inadmissible, hence these reports were immaterial. (Record pp. 200-01). Such a conclusion is unwarranted. First, by enabling the defense to examine these reports, Sellers may have been able to produce witnesses whose testimony or written statements may have been admissible. <em>Martinez v. Wainwright, </em>621 F.2d 184 (5th Cir. 1980). Second, the evidence here suppressed was material to the preparation of petitioner\u2019s defense, regardless of whether it was intended to be admitted into evidence or not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1138-8\">. The Magistrate (and the State on appeal) rely on <em>Landry v. State of Alabama, </em>579 F.2d 353 (5th Cir. 1978). This case, however, is inappo-site to the present issue. <em>Landry </em>did not concern a specific request to produce the allegedly suppressed <em>Brady </em>material; additionally, the claimed <em>Brady </em>information in <em>Landry </em>that the state did not volunteer would have affected neither the determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt nor his punishment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
