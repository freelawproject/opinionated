The Administrative Law Judge credited certain testimony and concluded that the union-employer took action to discourage organization, in violation of \u00a7 8(aXl) of the National Labor Relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Act (NLRA). Evelyn McCann, a 22 year veteran office worker, stepped down as office manager but continued to perform essentially the same duties. Her salary was cut, and after other actions that the Administrative Law Judge concluded were discriminatory, both Evelyn McCann and her daughter, who also worked in the office, were discharged. The Administrative Law Judge rejected the union-employer claims of legitimate discharge, and characterized the union-employer\u2019s defenses as \u201cshifting, unfounded, and frivolous.\u201d The record reveals that there was substantial evidence to support the findings of the National Labor Relations Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the National Labor Relations Board is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
