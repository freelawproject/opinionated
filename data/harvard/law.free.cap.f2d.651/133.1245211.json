Mun-son, Ch. J., granting the motion of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) for judgment on the pleadings in appellant\u2019s action, which challenges the Secretary\u2019s determination that she was not eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI), disability benefits, or widow\u2019s benefits. We affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">Appellant applied for the benefits mentioned above on August 1, 1978. After her application was denied, appellant requested a de novo hearing before an administrative law judge (AU), which was conducted in July 1979. At the hearing, appellant testified that she had worked as a cashier in a supermarket from 1965 until the store closed in 1975, after which time she had not been employed. Appellant also testified that she suffered from extreme dizziness, pain due to arthritis, and fatigue. The medical evidence submitted at the hearing indicated that appellant received treatment for, inter alia, diabetes with autonomic neu-ropathy, hypertension, and hyperlipopro-teinemia. The medical record before the ALJ also contained a statement from appellant\u2019s treating physician that appellant was unable to stand or ambulate for prolonged periods, but could sit and perform fine and gross hand movements without restriction. The treating physician went on to conclude that appellant could \u201cfunction in a sedentary type of job only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">Based on this evidence, the ALJ held that appellant\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity has been reduced only insofar as she has been unable to engage in work involving extensive walking or carrying or strenuous exertion,\u201d and that accordingly she \u201cpossesses the residual functional capacity to return to her former job as a cashier.\u201d The ALJ noted that appellant\u2019s prior position as a supermarket cashier \u201ccould be performed in either the sitting or the standing position,\u201d although he acknowledged that \u201c[t]he typical supermarket cashier performs work in the standing position.\u201d The ALJ then explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-16\">However, there are numerous cashier jobs existing in the national economy as well as in the claimant\u2019s region of residence which can be performed in the sitting position. This type of work is sedentary in nature and involves only minimal lifting in the sense of handling change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Since appellant was capable of sedentary work, the ALJ concluded that he was \u201cconstrained to find that the claimant can return to her former type of job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The AU\u2019s findings were approved by the Social Security Administration\u2019s Appeals Council in December 1979. Appellant then commenced this proceeding in the district court, where the matter was referred to a magistrate. The latter, in a report filed in October 1980, recommended that the Secretary\u2019s determination be affirmed. In January 1981, Chief Judge Munson adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Appellant contends that it was improper for the ALJ to take administrative notice of the existence of \u201csedentary\u201d cashier positions. We disagree. Appellant\u2019s argument appears to rest on an assumption that her initial burden, in making a prima facie case of disability, was merely to show an inability to return to her prior job as a \u201csupermarket cashier.\u201d But this view rests on too narrow a construction of the standard of eligibility for benefits. The relevant provision of the Social Security Act requires that an applicant for disability benefits demonstrate that \u201chis physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is .. . unable to do his previous work.... \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Parker v. Harris, </em>626 F.2d 225, 230-31 (2d Cir. 1980). In this case, appellant\u2019s burden was to show an inability to return to her \u201cprevious work\u201d as a cashier, not simply to her former job as a \u201csupermarket cashier.\u201d As the First Circuit made clear in <em>Pelletier v. Secretary of H.E.W., </em>525 F.2d 158, 160 (1st Cir. 1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaN\">A claimant makes a prima facie showing of disability only by establishing \u201cthat he is unable to return to his former <em>type </em>of work.\u201d <em>Hernandez </em>[v. <em>Weinberger, </em>493 F.2d 1120, 1122 (1st Cir. 1974)]; <em>Torres v. Celebrezze, </em>349 F.2d 342, 345 (1st Cir. 1965) (emphasis supplied). Thus to meet her initial burden it was not enough for Miss Pelletier to show simply that her specific job at Avco entailed exposure to smoke and fumes, she would have to show that such exposure would be a condition of this sort of work generally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">In this context \u2014 while appellant still bore the burden of proving disability \u2014 it was entirely proper for the ALJ to notice that the occupation of \u201ccashier\u201d encompasses sedentary jobs as well as jobs that may require extended periods of standing or occasional supplemental work requiring greater amounts of exertion. The fact that some cashier positions are entirely sedentary is a matter so plainly \u201cwithin the common knowledge and experience of ordinary men,\u201d see <em>McLamore v. Weinberger, </em>538 F.2d 572, 575 (4th Cir. 1976), that we cannot find the ALJ\u2019s reasoning in error. It is clear that he was doing no more than explaining the scope of the occupation of cashier in order to demonstrate why appellant had failed to meet her initial burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">We recognize that in reaching his conclusion, the ALJ used language more appropriate to an inquiry into the availability of alternative employment in the national economy. But this language is harmless surplusage, since in this case the burden had not shifted to the Secretary to establish the availability of such alternative employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">Appellant also contends that the AU inadequately considered both her subjective symptoms and the opinion of her treating physician. From our examination of the record, however, it is clear to us that both of these factors were adequately considered by the ALJ. In fact, in reaching his conclusion that appellant had not sustained her initial burden of proof, the ALJ expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>relied on the opinion of appellant\u2019s treating physician that she could perform \u201csedentary\u201d work. We have examined appellant\u2019s other claims of error and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-9\">. An identical burden is imposed on claimants seeking SSI payments under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(B). See <em>Hankerson v. Harris, </em>636 F.2d 893, 895 n.2 (2d Cir. 1980). Although there is no similar language in the section of the Act that defines eligibility for widow\u2019s benefits, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(B), that provision states that a widow will not be considered disabled unless she is incapable of engaging in \u201cany gainful activity.\u201d Consequently, a claimant who is unable to meet the initial burden of showing inability to perform \u201cprevious work\u201d for the purpose of receiving SSI or disability insurance is a fortiori unable to satisfy the standard of eligibility governing widow\u2019s benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
