PECK, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Pursuant to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s order of April 20, 1981,-U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 1967, 68 L.Ed.2d 290, we now further consider this case in light of <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 764, 101 S.Ct. 764, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981), a decision rendered after our opinion herein of December 1, 1980, 635 F.2d 1189. <em>Sumner </em>requires that a federal court must explain, in a decision rendered in a habeas corpus suit, its reasons for departing from findings of fact made by a state court after a hearing to which the habeas petitioner was a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">The relevant facts are as follows: petitioner Lonberger was convicted in the Lucas County, Ohio, Common Pleas Court of aggravated murder with a \u201cspecification.\u201d The specification was a prior conviction of attempted murder. This prior conviction followed Lonberger\u2019s guilty plea in the Cook County, Illinois, Circuit Court in 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">In both the Ohio trial court and in the Ohio Court of Appeals, Lonberger unsuccessfully challenged the validity of his 1972 guilty plea and conviction. Lonberger contended that he did not knowingly plead guilty to attempted murder, but rather thought he was \u201ccopping out to aggravated battery.\u201d His supposed plea to attempted murder was, according to Lonberger, voluntarily but not intelligently made, and thus was not valid under constitutional standards. <em>See Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">The Ohio trial court upheld the validity of Lonberger\u2019s 1972 plea following a pretrial evidentiary hearing. The only evidence concerning the validity of this plea was the transcript of the entry of the plea and the testimony of Lonberger himself. On this evidence, the Ohio trial court found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-14\">that the defendant is an intelligent individual, well experienced in the criminal processes and well represented at all stages of the proceedings by competent and capable counsel in Illinois. On review of the certified copy of the Illinois proceedings and a transcript of the plea of guilty, the Court finds that every effort was taken to safeguard and to protect the constitutional rights of the defendant. Therefore, the Court finds that the defendant intelligently and voluntarily entered his plea of guilty in the Illinois court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-15\">No explicit findings were made concerning Lonberger\u2019s credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-17\">The Ohio Court of Appeals, following its own review of the record, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-19\">The transcript from the Cook County Circuit Court proceedings at which\u2019appellant changed his plea to guilty indicated that he was represented by competent counsel. When questioned by the court, appellant answered affirmatively that he was pleading guilty to \u201cthe offense of aggravated battery on one Dorothy Maxwell, * * * attempt on Dorothy Maxwell with a knife, * * * [and] the offense of aggravated battery on Wendtian Maxwell * * *.\u201d Appellant further affirmed that he understood that he was waiving his right to trial and to confront witnesses, that he understood the penalties that could be imposed, that he was motivated to plead guilty by an offer of a reduced sentence, and that he had not otherwise been threatened or promised anything. Through his counsel, appellant stipulated that there were sufficient facts to sustain the charges contained in the indictment. We find from the record of this proceeding and from the record of the pre-trial hearing in the instant case, that the trial court did not err in ruling that appellant\u2019s guilty plea was voluntarily and knowingly made and that the evidence of the prior conviction should be submitted to the jury. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is not well taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Lonberger, after exhausting his appellate remedies in the Ohio courts, unsuccessfully petitioned the United States District Court for a writ of habeas corpus. We reversed the judgment of the district court and ordered issuance of the writ should Lonberger not be retried. See <em>Lonberger v. Jago, </em>635 F.2d 1189 (6th Cir. 1980). The basis for our judgment was that Lonberger\u2019s 1972 guilty plea to attempted murder was not demonstrably an intelligent one, and was therefore invalid under federal constitutional standards. This conclusion is directly contrary to the conclusions of both of the Ohio courts that considered the question of the validity of Lonberger\u2019s 1972 plea. We now expressly hold that these factual determinations by the Ohio courts are not fairly supported by the records that were before them. This we are empowered to do by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(8). <em>Sumner v. Mata, supra, </em>requires that federal courts state their rationales for exercise of this power.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The basis for our disagreement with the factual determinations of the state courts can be briefly stated. The question of an effective waiver of a federal constitutional right is governed by federal standards.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Boykin v. Alabama, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 243, 89 S.Ct. at 1712. A guilty plea, which works as a waiver of numerous constitutional rights, cannot be truly voluntary if the defendant \u201chas such an incomplete understanding of the charge that his plea cannot stand as an intelligent admission of guilt.\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 645 n.13, 96 S.Ct. 2253, 2257 n.13, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976). <em>Accord, Smith v. O\u2019Grady, </em>312 U.S. 329, 334, 61 S.Ct. 572, 574, 85 L.Ed. 859 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The transcript of Lonberger\u2019s 1972 plea is inadequate to show that Lonberger was aware that he was pleading guilty to a charge of attempted murder. The inadequacies of that record were specifically noted in our opinion of December 1,1980. <em>See Lonberger v. Jago, supra, </em>635 F.2d at 1193-95. Chief among these inadequacies was the total lack of mention of the charge of \u201cattempted murder.\u201d \u201cAttempt\u201d arose in this context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">The Court: In other words, you are pleading guilty, that you did on August 25, 1968, commit the offense of aggravated battery on one Dorothy Maxwell, and that you did on the same date attempt on Dorothy Maxwell, with a knife, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">\u201cWhat is at stake for an accused facing death or imprisonment demands the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.\u201d Doy<em>kin, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 243-44, 89 S.Ct. at 1712. The transcript of Lonberger\u2019s 1972 plea does not evince such solicitude. The deficiencies in this transcript cause us to differ with the Ohio trial court\u2019s finding that \u201cevery effort was taken to safeguard and protect the constitutional rights of the defendant\u201d when he entered his 1972 plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">In the face of this inadequate transcript, the state had to demonstrate clearly and convincingly the validity of the plea. <em>See Lonberger v. Jago, supra, </em>635 F.2d at 1194, and cases cited there. The state did not meet this burden. At the pretrial hearing, Lonberger testified that he \u201ccopped out to aggravated battery\u201d in 1972, but had no knowledge of other charges. The Ohio prosecutors attempted to discredit this testimony by introducing copies of the 1972 indictment charging Lonberger with \u201cthe offense of attempt.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lonberger denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>that he had ever seen or read this indictment. The prosecutors sought to imply by their questioning of Lonberger that he must have heard of the \u201cattempt\u201d charge either at his arraignment or in conversation with his attorneys. Lonberger testified that he had not, and the state produced no contrary evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even though the state proved to the trial court\u2019s satisfaction that Lonberger was an \u201cintelligent individual, well experienced in the criminal processes and well represented at all stages of the [Illinois] proceedings,\u201d such showings do not clearly and convincingly demonstrate that Lonberger received adequate notice of all the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Lonberger\u2019s aggravated murder conviction was obtained at least in part by admission of evidence of a constitutionally infirm prior conviction. Such evidence is \u201cinherently prejudicial.\u201d <em>See Burgett v. Texas, </em>389 U.S. 109, 115, 88 S.Ct. 258, 262, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1967). The possible effects of that prejudice cannot be expunged by reducing Lonberger\u2019s sentence after a conviction is improperly obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">The state has argued, and may argue again, that Lonberger\u2019s case should be remanded for an evidentiary hearing so that the state might have a second shot at proving the validity of Lonberger\u2019s 1972 plea. We disagree. .</p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">Evidence of the 1972 plea was offered only as proof of a \u201cspecification\u201d to aggravated murder \u2014 not as proof of commission of the murder charged. See Trial Transcript at 914. The Ohio Court of Appeals reversed Lonberger\u2019s aggravated murder conviction and entered a judgment of guilty of murder. The specification is not an element of the crime of murder. See O.R.C. \u00a7 2903.02. It was not suggested at trial that evidence of Lonberger\u2019s prior conviction could be admitted as proof of motive, identity, intent, or under any other exception to the general common-law rules requiring exclusion of such prejudicial evidence. Admission under such theories may be proper on retrial, if the state shows the validity of the plea. The state, however, may not save a tainted conviction by boot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>strapping into evidence an element of a crime of which Lonberger does not stand convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">We recognize that <em>Spencer v. Texas, </em>385 U.S. 554,87 S.Ct. 648,17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967), implied that limiting instructions were enough to dispel prejudice resulting from introduction of prior crimes evidence. The Court has, however, rejected this implication where \u201cspecific federal rights\u201d \u2014 namely those touching the validity of a confession \u2014 were at issue. <em>See Burgett v. Texas, supra, </em>389 U.S. at 115-16, 88 S.Ct. at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The Ohio Court of Appeals itself concluded that \u201cthe defendant was prejudiced and prevented from having a fair trial\u201d on the charge of aggravated murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That prejudice is not erased by simply reducing Lonberger\u2019s offense and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The judgment of the district court is reversed. The case is remanded with directions to issue a writ of habeas corpus unless the State of Ohio grants Lonberger a new trial within a reasonable time as determined by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\">. The district court erroneously used state standards in analyzing the validity of Lonber-ger\u2019s 1972 plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\">. The indictment reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">The Grand Jurors chosen, selected, and sworn, in and for the County of Cook, in the State of Illinois, in the name and by the authority of the People of the State of Illinois, upon their oaths aforesaid present that on August 25th, 1968, at and within said County Robert Lonberger committed the offense of attempt, in that he, with intent to commit the offense of murder, intentionally and knowingly attempted to kill Dorothy Maxwell by cutting Dorothy Maxwell with a knife without lawful justification, in violation of Chapter 38, Section 8-4, of the Illinois Revised Statutes 1967.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The Illinois statute cited in the indictment provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">8-4. \u00a7 8-4. Attempt.) (a) Elements of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">A person commits an attempt when, with intent to commit a specific offense, he does any act which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">(b) Impossibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">It shall not be a defense to a charge of attempt that because of a misapprehension of the circumstances it would have been impossible for the accused to commit the offense attempted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">(c) Penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">A person convicted of an attempt may be fined or imprisoned or both not to exceed the maximum provided for the offense attempted but, except for an attempt to commit the offense defined in Section 33A-2 of this Act,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">(1) the penalty for attempt to commit treason, murder or aggravated kidnapping shall not exceed imprisonment for 20 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-13\">(2) the penalty for attempt to commit any other forcible felony shall not exceed imprisonment for 14 years, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-14\">(3) the penalty for attempt to commit any offense other than those specified in Subsections (1) and (2) hereof shall not exceed imprisonment for 5 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-17\">This statute obviously did not define a single crime of \u201cattempt,\u201d but rather a class of crimes singly denominated \u201cattempt to commit....\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b510-18\">. In <em>Henderson v. Morgan, supra, </em>the Supreme Court stated as dictum that \u201cit may be appropriate to presume that in most cases defense counsel routinely explain the nature of the offense in sufficient detail to give the accused notice of what he is being asked to admit.\u201d 426 U.S. at 647, 96 S.Ct. at 2258.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-19\">Such a presumption is dispelled in this case by: Lonberger\u2019s testimony that his lawyers did not discuss the charge of \u201cattempt\u201d with him; Lonberger\u2019s switching lawyers between his Illinois preliminary hearing and his 1972 plea, raising the possibility that the second lawyer assumed more information had been given to Lonberger than had been in fact; the 1971 indictment\u2019s vague description of the offense of \u201cattempt,\u201d and the Illinois trial court\u2019s own nebulous delineation of the \u201cattempt\u201d count at the time of Lonberger\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-20\">It is also questionable whether such a presumption is proper in a case such as this one in which a prior conviction forms an element of a later crime. Under Ohio law, the \u201cspecification\u201d \u2014 the prior conviction \u2014 had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Gordon, </em>28 Ohio St.2d 45, 276 N.E.2d 243 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b511-17\">. The Ohio appellate court held that there was insufficient evidence of the \u201caggravating\u201d rape to sustain a conviction of aggravated murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
