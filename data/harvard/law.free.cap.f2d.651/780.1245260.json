Now that the radioactive gas from the nuclear plant has been fully vented into the atmosphere, the petitioners seek only declaratory relief from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">This case arises in the aftermath of a widely publicized accident that occurred on March 28, 1979 at \u201cUnit 2\u201d of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. As a result of the accident, dangerous concentrations of radioactive gas collected in the reactor containment building, inhibiting cleanup and maintenance work.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Three months after the accident, the NRC issued an \u201cOrder for Modification of License,\u201d 44 Fed.Reg. 45,271 (1979), suspending Metropolitan Edison\u2019s authority to operate Unit 2 of the Three Mile Island plant (TMI-2), and requiring it to \u201cmaintain the facility in a shutdown condition.\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The NRC order indicated that, in about thirty days, the Commission would issue a \u201cSafety Evaluation\u201d addressing \u201cthe imposition of new and/or revised Technical Specifications setting forth appropriate license conditions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">In fact, the NRC issued no such evaluation. Instead, on November 21, 1979, the NRC issued a \u201cStatement of Policy and Notice of Intent to Prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement,\u201d 44 Fed.Reg. 67,738 (1979), which was to be an \u201coverall study of the decontamination and disposal process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The NRC Statement of Policy directed the agency\u2019s staff</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afh\">to include in the programmatic environmental impact statement on the decontamination and disposal of TMI-2 wastes an overall description of the planned activities and a schedule for their completion along with a discussion of alternatives considered and the rationale for choices made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">On February 11, 1980, the NRC issued another order, 45 Fed.Reg. 11,282 (1980), which stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-14\">the facility\u2019s operating license should be modified so as to: ... (3) Prohibit venting or purging or other treatment of the reactor building atmosphere . . . until each of these activities has been approved by the NRC, consistent with the Commission\u2019s Statement of Policy and Notice of Intent to Prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">\n<em>Id</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>4</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">Six weeks later the NRC published a notice of the \u201cAvailability of Environmental Assessment for Decontamination of the Three Mile Island Unit 2 Reactor Building Atmosphere,\u201d 45 Fed.Reg. 20,265 (1980). The notice stated that the Assessment \u201cconsiders five alternative methods for decontaminating the reactor building atmosphere and recommends that the building atmosphere be decontaminated by purging to the environment through the building\u2019s hydrogen control system.\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The NRC staff</p>\n<p id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>concluded in the Assessment that venting the gas into the atmosphere would \u201cnot constitute a significant environmental impact and, accordingly, the staff does not propose to prepare a separate Environmental Impact Statement on this action.\u201d Id. at 20,265-66. Public comments on the Assessment originally were due by April 11, 1980, but the period was extended to May 16, 1980. 45 Fed.Reg. 30,760 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">In May of 1980, the NRC issued the \u201cFinal Environmental Assessment for Decontamination of the Three Mile Island Unit 2 Reactor Building Atmosphere.\u201d On June 12, 1980, the NRC issued without a hearing two final orders, entitled \u201cOrder for Temporary Modification of License,\u201d 45 Fed. Reg. 41,251 (1980), and \u201cMemorandum and Order,\u201d 2 Nuclear Reg.Rep. (CCH) H 30,498.-01 (1980). The first order modified the operating license <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to permit the licensee to release the radioactive gas from the reactor building at a faster rate than the existing specifications allowed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The first order also expressly stated that, because the NRC had found that the modification of the operating license involved \u201cno significant hazards consideration,\u201d requests for a hearing would not stay the implementation of the order. 45 Fed.Reg. at 41, 252.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The second order authorized release of radioactive gas from the reactor building.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Venting was to begin on June 22.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">On June 16, petitioners wrote a letter to the NRC requesting that it reconsider its finding of \u201cno significant hazards consideration\u201d and its decision to make the June 12 orders effective immediately. The NRC did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">On June 23, petitioners filed a petition in this court for review of the two June 12 orders.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Three days later this court denied the petitioners\u2019 requests for emergency in-junctive and declaratory relief. The next day, one day before the venting began, the petitioners filed a request for a hearing with the NRC on the two June 12 orders. The hearing request was referred to an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. On July 3, one of the petitioners in No. 1691 moved the Board to suspend the venting; however, this request was subsequently withdrawn, on July 8, shortly before the venting was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">Metropolitan Edison began to vent the reactor building on June 28, 1980, at a rate that was within the original license specifications for a normally operating reactor. On July 8, the licensee began to vent the radioactive gas at a faster rate, pursuant to the specifications set in the June 12 license amendment. The venting was completed on July 11. As the NRC had anticipated, the off-site doses from the venting were below the limits set in the June 12 radiation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>license amendment. In its draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, NUREG-0683, issued August 14, 1980, the Commission stated that it did not anticipate a recurrence of the purging of the reactor building atmosphere, but that some minor releases of gas might be necessary for data gathering purposes. <em>See </em>Brief for Respondent Nuclear Regulatory Commission at 6 n.4 &amp; 20 n.ll.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">II. MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Because the licensee has completed the venting of the reactor containment building, and because both of the June 12 orders have expired, the Commission and the licensee claim that petitioners\u2019 claims for injunctive and declaratory relief are moot.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, because we find that these cases are \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review,\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we hold that the petitioners\u2019 claims are justiciable in this court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The mootness doctrine is primarily based on article III of the United States Constitution, which limits federal court jurisdiction to \u201ccases\u201d or \u201ccontroversies.\u201d Courts have interpreted the constitutional provision to limit their jurisdiction to \u201ca present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if we are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.\u201d <em>Hall v. Beals, </em>396 U.S. 45, 48, 90 S.Ct. 200, 201, 24 L.Ed.2d 214 (1969). The case or controversy requirement \u201cpreserves the separation of powers\u201d and \u201c \u2018limit[s] the business of federal courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>606 F.2d 1373, 1379 (D.C.Cir.1979) (quoting <em>Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 95, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1950, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">Cases arising from agency action, no less than cases involving only private parties, are subject to the mootness doctrine. Yet, as this court has recently noted, \u201cthe concept of mootness is placed under some strain in the context of administrative orders whose formal legal effect is typically shortlived.\u201d <em>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>606 F.2d at 1379-80. The strain is relieved somewhat by an exception first articulated in <em>Southern Pac. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>219 U.S. 498, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>310 (1911), where the Supreme Court held that technically moot cases are justiciable if they involve \u201cshort term orders, capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515, 31 S.Ct. at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">A case is considered justiciable if \u201cthe litigant show[s] the existence of an immediate and definite governmental action or policy that has adversely affected and continues to affect a present interest.\u201d <em>Super Tire Engineering Co. v. McCorkle, </em>416 U.S. 115, 125-26, 94 S.Ct. 1694, 1699-1700, 40 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974). As this case demonstrates, administrative orders, like labor disputes, often \u201cdo not last long enough for complete judicial review of the controversies they engender .... The judiciary must not close the door to the resolution of the important questions these concrete disputes present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126-27, 94 S.Ct. at 1700-1701. Yet, in order to invoke the <em>Southern Pacific </em>exception, the petitioner must not only show that \u201cthe challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,\u201d he must also show that \u201cthere was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.\u201d <em>Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149, </em>96 S.Ct. 347, 349, 46 L.Ed.2d 350 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The issue in the present case is not simply whether the NRC will again purge the reactor building atmosphere without first giving notice and holding a hearing. At stake is whether the NRC will continue its policy of making immediately effective license amendments without holding a hearing, even though petitioners request one, whenever the NRC finds that the amendment involves \u201cno significant hazards consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Under this view of the issues in this case, the conditions for avoiding dismissal on grounds of mootness, set forth in <em>Weinstein, </em>are met. The Commission has candidly conceded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-9\">at some point in the TMI-2 cleanup, perhaps on more than one occasion, the Commission will amend the utility\u2019s license in respects so minor that the Commission will think itself justified in making the amendment immediately effective based upon a no significant hazards consideration finding. Certainly, that kind of finding has been utilized in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agel\">Brief for Respondent Nuclear Regulatory Commission at 23.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Commission plainly intends to adhere to its policy of denying a hearing on a license amendment, under certain circumstances, even though interested parties specifically request a hearing. The chances of recurrence are more than speculative; because the NRC policy will be carried out during the TMI-2 cleanup, there is a \u201creasonable expectation that the same complaining partfies]\u201d will be denied their alleged statutory rights to hearing and notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">As the present case demonstrates, challenges to the NRC\u2019s policy of denying a hearing on license amendments may well escape review. The difficulty here is that the orders are often shortlived and the NRC actions, like venting, may be irreversible. The difficulty is compounded when the NRC elects, as in this case, to make its orders effective immediately. These considerations indicate that future challenges to the NRC policy may easily \u201cevade review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>This court has stated that \u201c[t]he situations [involving appellate consideration of recurrent controversies] are necessarily variant, and the variables complex. . . . [T]he court\u2019s decision to maintain the appeal, in the interest of sound judicial administration, is dependent on a prediction of a recurrence or continuation of what is perceived to be essentially the same legal dispute.\u201d <em>Alton &amp; Southern Railway Co. v. International Ass\u2019n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, </em>463 F.2d 872, 879 (D.C.Cir. 1972). \u201cWhile an \u2018effective remedy\u2019 for the immediate dispute is not obligatory, there must be at least a capacity for a declaration of legal right concerning a future projection of the actual dispute that precipitated the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 879-80. In the present case, that capacity exists, and we hold that this case is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">III. THE ORDER FOR TEMPORARY MODIFICATION OF LICENSE</p>\n<p id=\"ajx-dedup-2\">The NRC issued without a hearing the \u201cOrder for Temporary Modification of License\u201d (OTML) of June 12, 1980, which substituted off-site dosage limits for release limits in the TMI-2 operating license. The petitioners contend that the NRC\u2019s failure to provide a hearing violated section 189(a) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The first sentence of that section provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-5\">In any proceeding under this chapter, for the granting, suspending, revoking, or amending of any license or construction permit ... the Commission shall grant a hearing upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected by the proceeding, and shall admit any such person as a party to such proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">The NRC and Metropolitan Edison do not dispute that the OTML constituted a license amendment subject to the terms of section 189(a). They do maintain, however, that under the fourth sentence of the section the Commission could dispense with a hearing. The fourth (and last) sentence of section 189(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-9\">The Commission may dispense with such thirty days\u2019 notice and publication with respect to any application for an amendment to a construction permit or an amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">The NRC and the licensee argue that the NRC properly made a finding of \u201cno significant hazards consideration\u201d with respect to the OTML, and that consequently a hearing was not required. Although the last sentence of section 189(a) only explicitly \u201cdispense^] with . . . thirty days\u2019 notice and publication\u201d upon a determination of \u201cno significant hazards consideration,\u201d the NRC and the licensee contend that such a determination also permits the Commission to dispense with a hearing because notice and a hearing are inextricable.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">We are convinced that such a finding did not permit the NRC to dispense with a hearing that is otherwise required by section 189(a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This is not the first case in this circuit in which it has been argued that a finding of \u201cno significant hazards consideration\u201d permits the NRC to issue a license amendment without a hearing. In <em>Brooks </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number><em>v. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, </em>476 F.2d 924, 926 (D.C.Cir.1973) <em>(per </em>curiam) this court soundly rejected the contention that the fourth sentence in section 189(a) \u201cindicate[d] Congressional intent to dispense with hearings in construction permit amendment proceedings . . . when the Commission determines that the amendment involves \u2018no significant hazards consideration.\u2019 \u201d Instead this court, after an examination of the legislative history of section 189(a), held that the fourth sentence only dispenses with requirements of notice and publication. Because this circuit has previously rejected the very construction of section 189(a) offered by the NRC and the licensee,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>compels us to hold that the NRC improperly failed to provide a hearing in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Moreover, even if this court were not bound by <em>stare decisis, </em>we would still adopt the <em>Brooks </em>interpretation of the last sentence of section 189(a). The plain language of section 189(a) dispels any notion that by a finding of \u201cno significant hazards consideration\u201d the NRC may dispense with the hearing requirement. The fourth sentence makes no mention of the hearing requirement\u2019s being lessened, but makes reference only to the requirements of notice and publication. Despite the plain, unambiguous language contained in the last sentence, the NRC and Metropolitan Edison suggest that the requirements of hearing and notice are so intertwined that the reference to notice in the fourth sentence must also comprehend a hearing. While it is true that requirements of notice and hearing are interrelated, it is clear that Congress was not merging them in section 189(a). That is demonstrated by the third sentence of the section where Congress made explicit reference to the hearing requirement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That sentence plainly demonstrates that Congress did indeed intend to disentangle the two requirements of notice and hearing,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and \u201cto lessen the mandatory hearing requirement only when there was no request for a hearing.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, </em>476 F.2d at 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">A review of the legislative history of the 1962 amendments to section 189(a) \u2014 by which the last two sentences of the section were added \u2014 also firmly persuades us that the <em>Brooks </em>court properly construed the last sentence of section 189(a). That history demonstrates that the 1962 amendments to section 189(a) had their origin in congressional concern over a hearing requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>in <em>uncontested </em>cases \u2014 that is, when a hearing had not been requested.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Representative of that concern was the statement by Raoul Berger, serving as an American Bar Association spokesperson, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-4\">14 out of 15 of [the Atomic Energy Commission\u2019s] cases have been uncontested. And the central problem appears to be whether trial-type proceedings should be employed under sections 7 and 8 of the Administrative Procedures [sic] Act <em>in uncontested cases </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">AEC Regulatory Problems: Hearings on H.R. 12336 and S. 3491 Before the Sub-comm. on Legislation of the Joint Comm, on Atomic Energy, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 64 (1962) (statement of Raoul Berger) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Accord, e. g., id. </em>at 32 (statement of Herzel H. E. Plaine, Chairman, Special Comm, on Atomic Energy Law, ABA). Thus an interpretation of section 189(a) that would permit the NRC to issue a <em>contested </em>license amendment without a hearing would enlarge section 189(a) beyond the scope originally intended.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The 1962 Report of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy also suggests that Congress perceived the changes to section 189(a) as permitting the NRC to dispense only with notice and publication \u2014 not a hearing \u2014 upon a finding of \u201cno significant hazards consideration\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-13\"><em>In the absence of a request for a hearing, </em>issuance of an amendment to a construction permit, or issuance of an operating license, or an amendment to an operating license, would be possible without formal proceedings, but on the public record....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-14\">Finally, it is expected that <em>the authority given AEC to dispense with notice and publication </em>would be exercised with great care and only in those instances where the application presented no significant hazards consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">H.R.Rep.No.1966, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1962), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1962, pp. 2207, 2214, S.Rep.No.1677, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1962), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1962, pp. 2207, 2214 (emphasis added). And in a committee hearing one year prior, the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy had noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-16\">When no substantial safety question is involved in .. . the amendment .. . the public interest would be protected by . . . publication of an apt notice in the Federal Register<footnotemark>[24]</footnotemark> and the giving of <em>an oppor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number><em>tunity to any interested party to intervene. .. .</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Staff of the Joint Comm, on Atomic Energy, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., Improving the Regulatory Process, Vol. II, at 49-50 (Comm. Print 1961) (emphasis added). The language of the reports, consonant with the plain meaning of section 189(a), thus indicates that the section only permits the NRC to issue a license amendment witho\u00fct a hearing when there has been no hearing request.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Statements by Representative Holifield, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, and Senator Pastore, Vice-Chairman, on the floors of their respective houses further reinforce the language in the reports. Both individuals explicitly stated that the \u201camendment [to section 189(a)] in no way limits the right of an interested party to intervene and request a hearing at some later stage, nor does it affect the right of the Commission to hold a hearing on its own motion.\u201d 108 Cong.Rec. 16,548 (1962) (remarks of Rep. Holifield); <em>see id. </em>at 15,-746 (remarks of Sen. Pastore). The interpretation that the NRC and the public utilities press upon us,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> however, would \u201climit[ ] the right of an interested party to intervene and request a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">In sum, we are confident that <em>Brooks </em>was properly decided and that it dictates the construction that must be attached to the last sentence of section 189(a). Because the NRC\u2019s finding of \u201cno significant hazards consideration\u201d did not entitle the Commission to dispense with a requested hearing prior to issuance of the OTML, we hold that its failure to provide a hearing violated section 189(a) of the Atomic Energy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>IV. THE NRC\u2019S MEMORANDUM AND ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">The second order issued by the NRC on June 12, 1980, entitled \u201cMemorandum and Order\u201d (Venting Order), authorized Metropolitan Edison to vent the atmosphere of the reactor containment building. Respondents argue that section 189(a) did not require a hearing with respect to the Venting Order because the order was not a license amendment. We reject respondents\u2019 description of the order and find that section 189(a) was indeed applicable and, as a consequence, that petitioners were entitled to a hearing on the Venting Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Section 189(a), quoted in pertinent part in note 2 <em>supra, </em>requires that a hearing be given upon request \u201c[i]n any proceeding under this chapter, for the granting, suspending, revoking, or amending of any license or construction permit.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a) (1976). Respondents maintain that because the Venting Order merely lifted a prior suspension of the licensee\u2019s authority to vent, and did not authorize release of a greater amount of radioactive gas than was permitted by the original technical specifications of the operating license, it was not a license amendment. However, on the facts here, this characterization of the Venting Order appears to be nothing more than an after-the-fact rationalization, which finds no support in the record of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The NRC\u2019s July 20,1979 \u201cOrder for Modification of License\u201d suspended Metropolitan Edison\u2019s authority to operate TMI-2 and directed the licensee to \u201cmaintain the facility in a shutdown condition in accordance with the approved operating and contingency procedures.\u201d 44 Fed.Reg. 45,271 (1979). In a second order, dated February 11, 1980, the NRC recognized that TMI-2\u2019s operating license did not permit venting as part of a cleanup operation because the license specifications pertained only to normal operation of the facility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">[I]n the present post-accident status of the facility, the license itself does not include explicit provisions or Technical Specifications for assuring the continued maintenance of the plant in a safe, stable condition or for coping with foreseeable off-normal conditions. Moreover, certain portions of the facility\u2019s operating license relate to or govern power operation of the facility, the authority for which was suspended by the Order of July 20, 1979. <em>These provisions are now simply inapplicable to the facility in its present post-accident condition.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">45 Fed.Reg. 11,282 (1980) (emphasis added). The NRC concluded that \u201cthe facility\u2019s operating license, should be <em>modified </em>so as to: . . . [p]rohibit venting or purging . .. until ... approved by the NRC.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">There is no indication that this order was intended or perceived as a mere suspension of the licensee\u2019s existing authority to vent. In February 1980, it appeared that adequate venting of the reactor building might not be possible under the existing license authority. Consequently, the NRC acted to modify \u2014 and thus amend \u2014 the TMI-2 license in order to regulate the plant in an \u201coff-normal\u201d condition and to facilitate whatever venting scheme might be determined to be necessary. By its very terms, the February 11, 1980 order was a license amendment intended to reflect TMI-2\u2019s post-accident condition. Given that the original operating license was inapplicable, the NRC could not simply rely on its terms as authority for the venting. Authority for venting \u2014 in this case the June 12 Venting Order \u2014 therefore had to come in the form of a license amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">The specific language of the June 12 Venting Order further corroborates our interpretation of that order as a license amendment. In the Venting Order, the NRC noted that TMI-2 was being operated according to the provisions of the February 11, 1980 order, <em>see 2 </em>Nuclear Reg.Rep. (CCH) 130,498.01, at 29,456 (1980), and the Venting Order did nothing to change that. TMI-2\u2019s operating license was not simply \u201cunsuspended\u201d by the Venting Order. Instead, in the words of the NRC, \u201c[i]n the present order we give the approval contemplated by [the February 11] restriction insofar as necessary for the licensee to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>a purging of the TMI-2 containment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29,456-57. Nowhere does the Venting Order support respondents\u2019 characterization of it as a reinstatement of some preexisting authority. Rather, the Venting Order appears as an amendment to the February 11 amendment to TMI-2\u2019s operating license., Because the June 12 Venting Order modified the February 11 order, and granted the licensee authority to do something that it otherwise could not have done under the existing license authority, the Venting Order was a license amendment within the scope of section 189(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">Our reading of the Venting Order is also supported by Congress\u2019 intent in enacting section 189(a). By requiring a hearing upon request whenever a license is \u201cgrant[ed], suspended], revok[ed], or amendfed],\u201d Congress apparently contemplated that interested parties would be able to intervene before any significant change in the operation of a nuclear facility. Whatever the Venting Order is called, it certainly was such a change.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">As we held in Section III of this opinion, the NRC is required under section 189(a) to hold a hearing on a license amendment whenever interested parties request one.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Petitioners did so in this case, <em>see </em>note 25 <em>supra, </em>and the NRC therefore acted unlawfully in refusing to hold a hearing on the Venting Order.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">Because the NRC\u2019s actions in this case are \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review,\u201d the issues presented by petitioners are not moot. We hold that under section 189(a) the NRC is required to hold a hearing on license amendments whenever interested parties request one. Finally, we hold that the June 12 Venting Order, which authorized the NRC to release radioactive gas from the disabled nuclear reactor, was a license amendment subject to the hearing requirements of section 189(a). Because the petitioners requested a hearing on the two June 12 license amendments, they were entitled to a hearing under section 189(a). The NRC\u2019s refusal to hold a hearing violated the petitioners\u2019 statutory rights.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-11\">. Metropolitan Edison Co., Pennsylvania Electric Co., and Jersey Central Power and Light Co. jointly hold the operating license to the Three Mile Island nuclear plant.

The petitioners primarily rely on \u00a7 189(a) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a) (1976), as amended in 1957, Pub.L. No.85-256, \u00a7 7, 71 Stat. 579 (1957), and in 1962, Pub.L.No.87-615, \u00a7 2, 76 Stat. 409 (1962). Section 189(a) reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-13\">In any proceeding, under this chapter, for the granting, suspending, revoking, or amending of any license ... the Commission shall grant a hearing upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected by the proceeding, and shall admit any such person as a party to such proceeding.

Much of the factual basis for the NRC\u2019s actions is contained in its report, the \u201cFinal Environmental Assessment for Decontamination of the Three Mile Island Unit 2 Reactor Building Atmosphere\u201d (May 1980), which is reprinted in the Intervenor-Respondents\u2019 Appendix (App.) 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b842-10\">. The February 11, 1980 order specified that any interested person or the licensee could request a hearing before March 21, 1980 on whether the proposed changes in the technical specifications would be sufficient \u201cto protect health and safety or to minimize danger to life and property\u201d or \u201cwhether the provisions of this Order would significantly affect the quality of the human environment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11,283. The order also provided, however, that a request for a hearing on part (3) of the order would not stay the effectiveness of the order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b842-18\">. The NRC desired to remove the radioactive gas from the reactor building so that workers could begin to clean the building, maintain the equipment, and prepare to remove the damaged fuel from the reactor core. Removing the radioactive gas from the reactor containment building was only the first step in an extensive cleanup.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b843-5\">. As part of its argument, the NRC contends that the second order, permitting purging, was not a license amendment. However, the NRC admits that the first order amended the TMI-2 operating license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b843-6\">. Before the accident of March 28, 1979, the TMI-2 operating license authorized periodic release of specified amounts of radioactive gas into the atmosphere as a normal and necessary part of plant operations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\">. Part of the basis for the Commission\u2019s determination of \u201cno significant hazards consideration\u201d was its conclusion that, although existing <em>release </em>rate limits would be exceeded, off-site dose limits would not be breached. Since the NRC\u2019s concern was the effect of the venting on human health, the Commission .felt that the more direct measure \u2014 off-site dose limits\u2014 would provide a satisfactory standard to determine the appropriate limits on the venting of the radioactive gas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b843-14\">. The NRC made no finding that this order involved \u201cno significant hazards consideration.\u201d <em>See </em>Brief for Respondent Nuclear Regulatory Commission at 30, 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b843-15\">. By making the orders effective immediately, the Commission failed to give any notice in the Federal Register of the license amendment. The Commission contends that <em>so long as it </em>makes a finding of \u201cno significant hazards consideration,\u201d the governing statute does not impose such a notice requirement. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra </em>for statutory notice and hearing requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b843-16\">. On July 8, 1980, a petition for review (No. 80-1783) and an accompanying petition for writ of mandamus (No. 80-1784) were filed in the Third Circuit. On the NRC\u2019s motion, those cases were transferred to this court and consolidated for review with No. 80-1691, the case originally filed in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\">. Metropolitan Edison seems to argue that since petitioners\u2019 claims for injunctive relief are moot (i. e., the reactor building atmosphere has been purged), the case should be dismissed. This argument, however, misstates the nature of the relief sought by petitioners. They have sought <em>both </em>injunctive and declaratory relief in this action. Although petitioners cannot now obtain injunctive relief to prevent the purging, they continue to pursue their claim for a declaratory judgment that the NRC must grant them statutorily mandated notice and a hearing whenever it amends a license. <em>See, e. g., Super Tire Engineering Co. v. McCorkle, </em>416 U.S. 115, 94 S.Ct. 1694, 40 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974) (the Court found that even though the strike had been settled, mooting injunctive relief, the petitioner alleged sufficient facts in support of declaratory relief so that the case should not be dismissed as moot).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">. <em>See Southern Pac. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 283, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b844-9\">. We note that the United States has taken the position that the petitioners\u2019 claims are \u201ccapable of repetition\u201d \u2014 since the Commission has stated that it will continue to deny requested hearings when it finds no significant hazards considerations are involved \u2014 but that future claims will not evade review \u2014 since \u201cthere is no reason to believe that [NRC] actions will characteristically be irreversible.\u201d Memorandum of Respondent United States at 4. Consequently, the United States also argues that the petitions should be dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">We reject the Government\u2019s position for two reasons. First, as we explain in the text of the opinion, many NRC license amendments are irreversible. The facts in the present case illustrate how making an amendment effective immediately can preclude complete judicial review. Second, we believe that it is unreasonable for the Government to take the position that, in order to seek judicial review of a license amendment, a petitioner must race to the courthouse before the NRC takes an irreversible action. Even if a petitioner could file the petition before the NRC acted, a court more often than not will decline to grant emergency relief. Indeed, such a request for emergency relief was denied in this case. Consequently, because a petitioner will not receive complete judicial review of his claim, even though it might be meritorious, we find that these claims evade review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b845-6\">. This admission entirely undercuts Metropolitan Edison\u2019s argument that there is no evidence that the actions complained of will be repeated. In each of the cases cited in Metropolitan Edison\u2019s brief, the challenged governmental activity had ceased with no indication that it would be continued at a later time. See, e. <em>g., Murphy v. Benson, </em>270 F.2d 419 (2d Cir. 1959), <em>cert. denied, </em>362 U.S. 929, 80 S.Ct. 750, 4 L.Ed.2d 747 (1960). In the present case, by contrast, the NRC has clearly stated its intention to continue with its allegedly unlawful conduct \u2014 making certain license amendments effective immediately without holding a requested hearing or giving notice. We think it obvious that the NRC will also continue to rely on the second method employed in this case for avoiding the notice and hearing requirements of \u00a7 189(a) \u2014 describing an order as something other than a license amendment. <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra. </em>The Commission\u2019s continued belief in its authority to follow this policy makes petitioners\u2019 challenge to the policy \u201ccapable of repetition.\u201d <em>See Nader v. Volpe, </em>475 F.2d 916 (D.C.Cir.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b846-6\">. The petitioners, challenging the correctness of the \u201cno significant hazards consideration\u201d determination, also contend that the NRC was required under the third sentence of \u00a7 189(a) to provide 30 days\u2019 notice and publication in the Federal Register of the Commission\u2019s intent to issue the license amendment without a hearing. The third sentence provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aar-dedup-0\">the Commission may, <em>in the absence of a request therefor </em>by any person whose interest may be affected, issue an operating license or an amendment to a construction permit or an amendment to an operating license without a hearing, but upon thirty days\u2019 notice and publication once in the Federal Register of its intent to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">(Emphasis added.) Since, however, we hold that the petitioners requested a hearing, <em>see </em>note 25 <em>infra, </em>and that the NRC was required to hold a hearing, we need not reach the question whether the Commission was required to provide 30 days\u2019 notice of its intent to issue the license amendment without a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b846-14\">. It is noteworthy that respondent United States concedes \u2014 indeed \u2022 argues \u2014 that the NRC\u2019s failure to provide a hearing violated \u00a7 189(a) of the Atomic Energy Act. <em>See </em>Memorandum of Respondent United States at 4-21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b847-5\">. It is true, of course, that 15 months after the <em>Brooks </em>decision this court stated in dictum in a footnote that \u201c[a]n amendment can be made without opportunity for a hearing if the AEC determines that it \u2018involves no significant hazards consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Union of Concerned Scientists v. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, </em>499 F.2d 1069, 1084 n.36 (D.C.Cir.1974). The court provided no support for its far-reaching statement, nor did it even make mention of the recently decided <em>Brooks </em>case, which had squarely <em>held </em>to the contrary on the basis of the legislative history of .\u00a7 189(a). We accordingly decline to place any reliance on the dictum in <em>Union of Concerned Scientists.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b847-6\">. For the text of the third sentence, <em>see </em>note 16 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b847-7\">. We are cognizant of the fact that the plain meaning of the third and fourth sentences of \u00a7 189(a), when read together, produces in theory a somewhat paradoxical result. Under the fourth sentence the NRC may issue a license amendment without providing 30 days\u2019 notice and publication in the Federal Register of its intent to do so, while under the third sentence the NRC need not provide a hearing when one has not been requested. As the NRC and the licensee note, it is difficult to imagine how a hearing can be requested when the NRC issues a license amendment without notice. This \u201cparadoxical result\u201d did not occur, however, in the instant case. Although petitioners did not formally request a hearing prior to issuance of the OTML, their prior expressions of interest constituted in effect a request for a hearing. <em>See </em>note 25 <em>infra. </em>It is also unclear whether the \u201cparadoxical result\u201d will ever in fact occur. As the NRC conceded at oral argument, there may be some type of notice requirement \u2014 al- . though 'perhaps not 30 days\u2019 notice and publication in the Federal Register \u2014 implicit in the opportunity to seek judicial review of determinations of \u201cno significant hazards consideration.\u201d Moreover, our decision today does not reach the question whether some notice of the NRC\u2019s intention to amend a license is required under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment or the Administrative Procedure Act notwithstanding a finding of \u201cno significant hazards consideration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">.

The quoted portions of the letter suggest, in ambiguous terms, that the Commissioner was of the view that the AEC should be able to dispense with hearings on license amendments upon a finding that \u201cno substantial new safety questions\u201d are presented. <em>See </em>Reply Brief for Respondent Nuclear Regulatory Commission at 9.

It is not entirely clear what the Committee meant by the phrase \u201cpublication of an apt notice in the Federal Register.\u201d Presumably it only refers to publication of the amendment <em>after the Commission has issued it. </em>This is not inconsistent with the fourth sentence of \u2022\u00a7 189(a), adopted in 1962, which dispenses with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>30 days\u2019 notice and publication in the Federal Register of the Commission\u2019s <em>intent to issue </em>a license amendment without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">This ambiguity in the quoted language is not unique in the context of \u00a7 189(a). The text and legislative history of the section are replete with ambiguities and inconsistencies. <em>Cf. </em>note 20 <em>supra. </em>But there is no ambiguity in the legislative history or the text of \u00a7 189(a) with respect to the question before this court\u2014 whether a finding of \u201cno significant hazards consideration\u201d permits the NRC to dispense with a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b849-10\">. Whether petitioners did in fact request a hearing was not argued by the parties. While respondent United States suggests in a footnote that \u201c[i]t is not wholly clear that petitioners did make such a request,\u201d Memorandum of Respondent United States at 6 n.2, we are convinced that the petitioners requested a hearing. In <em>Brooks v. Atomic Energy Comm'n, </em>476 F.2d 924, 926 (D.C.Cir.1973) (per <em>curiam </em>), this court held that expressions of interest may be sufficient to constitute a request for a hearing. In the instant case petitioners\u2019 continued interest in \u2014 and opposition to \u2014 the actions of the NRC at TMI-2 clearly constituted a request for a hearing. Indeed, the petitioners were among the many that submitted comments in April-May 1980 to the NRC regarding the Commission\u2019s Environmental Assessment for Decontamination of the Three Mile Island Unit 2 Reactor Building Atmosphere. <em>See </em>text at notes 5-6 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b849-11\">. As part of their argument the NRC and the public utilities contend that the NRC, and the Atomic Energy Commission prior to the creation of the NRC, consistently interpreted the section as permitting license amendments to be issued without a hearing upon a finding of \u201cno significant hazards consideration.\u201d <em>See </em>10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.105(a)(3) (1980); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 50.58(b); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 50.59(c) (1963); 45 Fed.Reg. 42,908 (1980); 45 Fed.Reg. 20,491-92 (1980); 43 Fed.Reg. 13,-928 (1978); 41 Fed.Reg. 10,482-83 (1976); 40 Fed.Reg. 18,231 (1975); 39 Fed.Reg. 10,554 (1974); 39 Fed.Reg. 1,875-76 (1974); 27 Fed.

Even if the history of regulations and administrative practice by the AEC and the NRC were unambiguous \u2014 which we do not think it is \u2014 deference to the agencies\u2019 interpretations would be inappropriate in this case. As we have indicated, the statute and legislative history are in our view unambiguous; a finding of \u201cno significant hazards consideration\u201d does not permit the NRC to dispense with a hearing. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201c[A]dministrative practice does not avail to overcome a statute so plain in its commands as to leave nothing for construction.\u201d <em>Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, </em>288 U.S. 294, 315, 53 S.Ct. 350, 358, 77 L.Ed. 796 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">It is also worth noting that because of today\u2019s decision the NRC will not be able to put into effect a regulation proposed earlier this year that would explicitly permit the NRC to dispense with hearings on license amendments upon a finding of \u201cno significant hazards consideration.\u201d <em>See </em>45 Fed.Reg. 20,491-92 (1980). Such a regulation would be clearly inconsistent with the congressional mandate in \u00a7 189(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b851-6\">. We note that the NRC and the public utilities briefly argued that a full adjudicatory hearing was not required here. See Brief for Respondent Nuclear Regulatory Commission at 32-34; Brief for Intervenor-Respondents at 44-45. Because this question was not fully briefed and argued by the parties, we express no opinion on the precise nature of the hearing required by \u00a7 189(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b851-7\">. Respondent United States argued that petitioners requested a hearing, as provided for in the OTML, and then failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by withdrawing their motion. The intended-scope of that hearing and the facts surrounding the withdrawal are somewhat muddled by the record. What is clear, however, is that the offer of a hearing was made only in the OTML and not in the Venting Order. Presumably, then, petitioners would have been able to challenge only the license amendment substituting off-site dosage limits for release limits and not the actual decision to vent. Moreover, any hearing was to revolve around the issues whether the license amendment was in the public interest and whether it should be sustained. See 45 Fed. Reg. 41,251, 41,252 (1980). It appears from this description that petitioners would not have been permitted to raise their arguments regarding the NRC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 189(a), which formed the basis of this suit. Finally, the Commission specifically provided that a request for a hearing would not stay the effectiveness of the order. <em>See id. </em>But \u00a7 189(a) required a hearing upon request on the Venting Order before it went into effect; a hearing after the venting had been completed would not have satisfied the statute\u2019s requirement. For all these reasons, the remedy that petitioners allegedly failed to exhaust was an inadequate one and therefore need not have been pursued. <em>See McNeese v. Board of Educ., </em>373 U.S. 668, 674-76, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 1437-38, 10 L.Ed.2d 622 (1963); <em>Union Pac. R. R. Co. v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>247 U.S. 282, 38 S.Ct. 510, 62 L.Ed. 1110 (1918).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
