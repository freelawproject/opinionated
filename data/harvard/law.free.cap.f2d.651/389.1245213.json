Because we find that the district court abused its discretion in denying Bamm\u2019s motion for leave to amend, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Bamm is a small family corporation engaged in the roofing business in Georgia. On December 13, 1977 Bamm signed a contract with Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation to put a corrugated asbestos roof on Kaiser\u2019s fertilizer warehouse in Bain-bridge, Georgia. Before bidding on the job, Bamm obtained a list of GAF Corporation\u2019s prices for corrugated asbestos. Subsequent to its signing the contract with Kaiser, Bamm ordered corrugated asbestos from GAF\u2019s salesman, Ed Gravenstein. On January 24,1978 GAF sent the initial truckload of materials to Bainbridge, Georgia. Gravenstein personally delivered the invoice to appellant and received full payment for the goods. In March and April of 1978 GAF sent ten shipments of corrugated asbestos to Bamm. Various disputes occurred concerning the quality of the materials received by appellant. GAF was notified that some of the asbestos sheets were unsuitable for roofing purposes. Bamm and GAF unsuccessfully attempted to resolve their dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">On June 19,1979 Bamm filed suit against GAF alleging breach of implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose and breach of implied warranty of merchantability. Subject matter jurisdiction was predicated on diversity. Bamm sought a total of $187,-316.66 in damages, including the purchase price of the roofing plus consequential damages. GAF answered on July 12, 1979 and counterclaimed for $18,494.98 due on account.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">On November 5, 1979 GAF filed a motion for partial summary judgment limiting damages solely to the purchase price of the roofing materials. GAF\u2019s motion was based on disclaimer language in a provision of the GAF invoices.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bamm filed a timely response. On January 4, 1980 both parties filed a joint status report and both appeared at a joint status conference on January 29, 1980. On February 1, the district court granted GAF\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the warranty action limiting recoverable damages to the purchase price of the roofing materials, $34,803.24 less a credit and excluded recovery of consequential damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">In response to the court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment Bamm filed an amendment to the complaint on February 11,1980 alleging negligence, fraud and strict liability. The amendment was allowed subject to objection. GAF answered on February 19 and filed its opposition to the amendment and in the alternative asked for summary judgment. A pretrial conference was held on February 21. At the conference appellant presented an amended version of the previously filed amendment as well as a brief in support of the motion. The district judge did not rule on the amendment at that time. On March 3 GAF submitted a brief opposing the amendment, citing undue prejudice, delay and the futility of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">On July 8, 1980, five months after Bamm initially sought to amend its com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>plaint, the district court entered an order denying Bamm\u2019s motion for leave to amend. The court reasoned that Bamm had \u201cdemonstrated no valid reason for its delay\u201d in seeking to add new theories for the recovery of damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Bamm requested the district court to dismiss the action without prejudice in order to bring suit in state court. The motion was denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsequently, GAF moved the court to enter judgment against it in the amount of the purchase price of the product and waived its right to proceed on the counterclaim. On August 15, 1980, six months after Bamm filed its amendment, the district court entered judgment against GAF for the purchase price of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Our review of a district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend is limited to a determination of whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Zenith Radio Corp. </em>v. <em>Hazeltine Research, </em>401 U.S. 321, 330, 91 S.Ct. 795, 802, 28 L.Ed.2d 77 (1971); <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962); <em>Henderson v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>620 F.2d 530, 534 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1034, 101 S.Ct. 608, 66 L.Ed.2d 495 (1980). In deciding whether to grant leave to amend -the district court must take into account several factors \u201csuch as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of the amendment.\u201d <em>Foman v. Davis. Accord, Pan-Islamic Trade Corp. v. Exxon Corp., </em>632 F.2d 539, 546 (5th Cir. 1980). <em>See generally </em>6 C. Wright and A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1487, 1488 (1971). The district court may also consider whether undue prejudice to the movant will result from denying leave to amend. <em>Henderson v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co.; Lone Star Motor Import, Inc. v. Citroen Cars Corp., </em>288 F.2d 69, 75 (5th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Application of the foregoing principles to the facts of this case leads us to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow Bamm to amend its complaint. The record is devoid of facts that would indicate that counsel for Bamm acted in bad faith with any dilatory motive. There was no undue delay in Bamm\u2019s filing a motion for leave to amend after partial summary judgment had been granted. Bamm\u2019s motion for leave to amend was filed on February 11, 1980 and was considered at the pretrial conference on February 21. <em>See Nevels v. Ford Motor Co., </em>439 F.2d 251, 257 (5th Cir. 1971) (amendments should be tendered before pretrial). The district court relied on <em>Freeman v. Continental Gin Co., </em>381 F.2d 459, 469 (5th Cir. 1967) in which this court found that there was no abuse of discretion in refusing to grant leave to amend after summary judgment had been granted when there was no valid reason for the delay. <em>Freeman </em>is distinguishable from the present appeal, however, because only partial summary judgment was granted to GAF. The case remained on the district court\u2019s docket. The district court retained the motion under advisement for nearly five months before denying the motion. Much of the delay is attributable to the time spent in considering the motion. Bamm had not filed previous amendments. We are unable to perceive undue prejudice to GAF in allowing the addition of fraud and negligence claims to a warranty action involving the same transaction. Discovery had not been completed at the time of the filing of leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>to amend.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although a trial date had been scheduled, it was not adhered to because of the five month consideration of the motion. That period was surely sufficient to preclude any hardship to GAF as a result of. the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">There would be irreparable prejudice to Bamm if leave to amend is not granted because of the court\u2019s order limiting damages to the purchase price. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) emphatically states that \u201cleave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d In the face of such a rule and the lack of prejudice to GAF, the district court should have granted leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-5\">. The eleven invoices for the shipments to Bamm from GAF contained the following language in boldface type:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">8. SELLER WARRANTS THAT THE MERCHANDISE DELIVERED HEREUNDER SHALL BE OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY. SELLER DOES NOT MAKE AND SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE OR FOR ANY OTHER WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCE. BUYER ASSUMES ALL RISK AND LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE USE OF SUCH MERCHANDISE WHETHER USED ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER PRODUCTS. NO CLAIMS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF WARRANTY, THE ALLEGED NEGLIGENCE OF SELLER, OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO MERCHANDISE DELIVERED OR FOR FAILURE TO DELIVER ANY MERCHANDISE SHALL BE GREATER IN AMOUNT THAN THE PURCHASE PRICE HEREUNDER OF THE MERCHANDISE IN RESPECT OF WHICH DAMAGES ARE CLAIMED____</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b450-11\">. The district court concluded that Bamm\u2019s warrant claims were limited by the language in the invoices to the purchase price. The court found that this was authorized by Georgia law. See Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 109A-2-719(l)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">. On appeal Bamm contends that error was committed by the transfer of the consideration of the motion for leave to amend to a different district judge than the one who originally heard the motion and who was later scheduled to be the trial judge. We find no merit in this argument. <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>411 F.2d 597, 599 (5th Cir. 1969) (\u201cDistrict Judges have the inherent power to transfer cases from one to another for the expeditious administration of justice.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\">. Bamm also claims that the district court committed reversible error in failing to grant its motion to voluntarily dismiss under Fed.R. Civ.P. 41(a)(2). Because we reverse on the issue of denial of leave to amend, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b452-15\">. In response to the court\u2019s inquiry at oral argument GAF\u2019s counsel stated that it probably would be necessary to retake plaintiffs deposition. It is clearly within the district court\u2019s discretion to tax all costs of such additional deposition against Bamm.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
