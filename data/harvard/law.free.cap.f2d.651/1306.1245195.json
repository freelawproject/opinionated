In making our determination, we interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>City of Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 624, 93 S.Ct. 1854, 36 L.Ed.2d 547 (1973), and later federal statutes. We affirm the district court which concluded that the state could not impose these curfew regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">The political subdivision which asserts the invalidity of the state\u2019s attempted imposition of a curfew is the San Diego Unified Port District. The Port District owns and operates San Diego International Airport, Lindbergh Field. Lindbergh Field is the principal airport serving San Diego, and is near the downtown area. Five million passengers pass through the airport each year. This volume of traffic requires frequent jet flights, which produce jet noise that has vexed local residents for some years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-16\">The Port District has attempted to accommodate the needs of commerce and the quiet of San Diego residential areas, by, among other things, unilaterally imposing a midnight to 6:00 a. m. curfew on all commercial jet takeoffs. In addition, the curfew allows only jets meeting strict noise standards to land during those hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-17\">In spite of these efforts, the State of California, through its Department of Transportation [CalTrans], has attempted to impose a more restrictive curfew through regulations authorized by state statute. <em>See </em>Cal.Pub.Util.Code \u00a7 21669 (West Supp. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-18\">These would require the measurement of noise at all affected airports and forbid operation of those airports which exceed a preset noise level. <em>See </em>21 Cal.Admin.Code \u00a7 5000-5080.5 (1977).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Airports which routinely exceed this level cannot operate without a variance issued under procedures established by the regulations. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5062.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-19\">Lindbergh Field is in this category, and in January of 1977 the Port District applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>for a variance permit pursuant to CalTrans\u2019 regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A state administrative law judge granted the permit, subject to six conditions. The fourth condition lies at the heart of this lawsuit and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1369-5\">Respondent San Diego Unified Port District is to retain the existing curfew .... Respondent is to extend this existing curfew to the extent that commercial air carriers will not be permitted to take off between the hours of 11:00 p. m. and 7:00 a. m. and commercial air carriers will not be permitted to land between the hours of 11:00 p. m. and 7:00 a. m. unless such aircraft meet FAR Part 36 requirements</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">Not willing to extend its curfew another two hours, the Port District sought to enjoin enforcement of the condition. It has contended that federal control of both airspace management and the sources of aircraft noise preempts CalTrans\u2019 ability to place such a condition on the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-13\">After an initial procedural phase,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> including the intervention of the Air Transportation Association of America,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the district court rendered its decision. 457 F.Supp. 283 (S.D.Cal.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-14\">Relying primarily on <em>City of Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 624, 93 S.Ct. 1854, 36 L.Ed.2d 547 (1973), the court adopted the Port District\u2019s position on preemption and issued a preliminary injunction. CalTrans has appealed. The state and several cities have joined it as amici curiae. In addition, the United States <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and several states have filed briefs amici curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-15\">I. Preemption and the Underlying Federal Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-16\">The Port District\u2019s attack on condition four rests primarily on the ground that federal law preempts state regulation of airspace management and control of the source of aircraft noise.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This preemption, it is claimed, renders CalTrans powerless to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>require the Port District to accept condition four.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">The district court agreed and issued a preliminary injunction in favor of the Port District. On appeal, a preliminary injunction will not be reversed unless the lower court abused its discretion or based its decision on erroneous legal premises. <em>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>National Football League, </em>634 F.2d 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">CalTrans directs its arguments at the latter half of this test, claiming that the district court erred in relying on the <em>City of Burbank </em>case. To assess this claim, we inquire first into the applicable preemption doctrine..</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">The supremacy clause, U.S.Const., Art. VI, Cl. 2, invalidates any exercise of state power that unduly frustrates or obstructs the objectives of legitimate national policy. <em>Chicago &amp; North Western Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick &amp; Tile </em>Co.,-U.S.-, -, 101 S.Ct. 1124, 1130, 67 L.Ed.2d 258 (1981); <em>Malone v. White Motor Corp., </em>435 U.S. 497, 504, 98 S.Ct. 1185, 1189, 55 L.Ed.2d 443 (1978); <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 67-68, 61 S.Ct. 399, 404, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-10\">In assessing any claim brought under this clause, we start from the position \u201cthat the historic police powers of the states [are] not to be superseded ... unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 1152, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947). <em>See also City of Milwaukee v. Illinois, </em>-U.S.-, 101 S.Ct. 1784, 1790, 68 L.Ed.2d 114 (1981); <em>Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 525, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 1309, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-13\">Where, as here, Congress has not enacted an explicit preemption clause,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> state authority may still be displaced if an intent to preempt is \u201cimplicitly contained in [the federal statute\u2019s] structure and purpose.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>430 U.S. at 525, 97 S.Ct. at 1309. <em>See also City of </em>Milwaukee,-U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. at 1790.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-16\">Such an intent has been inferred when the state regulations could not be enforced \u201cwithout impairing the federal superintendence of the field .. . . \u201d <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 1217, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963), or when \u201cthe federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.\u201d <em>Rice, </em>331 U.S. at 230, 67 S.Ct. at 1152. <em>See also Chicago &amp; North Western Transp. Co., </em>- U.S. at -, 101 S.Ct. at 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-19\">Preclusion of state regulation is possible even in cases where the regulated entity can feasibly comply with both state and federal mandates. <em>See Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>435 U.S. 151 at 157-58, 98 S.Ct. 988 at 994, 55 L.Ed.2d 179; <em>DeCanas v. Bica, </em>424 U.S. 351, 356-57 &amp; n.7, 96 S.Ct. 933, 936-37 &amp; n.7, 47 L.Ed.2d 43 (1976); <em>Pennsylvania v. Nelson, </em>350 U.S. 497, 504-05, 76 S.Ct. 477, 481, 100 L.Ed. 640 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-20\">The key to the scope of federal preemption is the intent of Congress in enacting the applicable federal legislation. <em>Malone, </em>435 U.S. at 504, 98 S.Ct. at 1189; <em>Retail </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number><em>Clerks </em>v. <em>Schermerhorn, </em>375 U.S. 96, 103, 84 S.Ct. 219, 222, 11 L.Ed.2d 179 (1963). If this intent does not appear in the statute, the above cases require us to evaluate the effect of the state action on the federal scheme to see if the state action impairs the objectives of national policy. <em>Chicago &amp; North Western Transp. Co., </em>- U.S. at -, 101 S.Ct. at 1130; <em>Ray, </em>435 U.S. at 157-58, 98 S.Ct. at 944; <em>Hines, </em>312 U.S. at 67-68, 61 S.Ct. at 404.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-9\">Congress formulates the policies of the national government in its acts and resolutions. Our task is to interpret applicable congressional acts and to define the national policy to discern whether a given state regulation or, for that matter, any state regulation, could be compatible with the attainment of the national policy\u2019s objectives. <em>Jones, </em>430 U.S. at 525, 97 S.Ct. at 1309; <em>DeCanas, </em>424 U.S. at 358 n.7, 96 S.Ct. at 937; <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc., </em>373 U.S. at 142, 83 S.Ct. at 1217. This case requires us to assess the effect of the state regulation on national aviation and aircraft noise policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-10\">The state regulation in question is easily defined. The state, through its police power, has sought to regulate and restrict aircraft flights directly by requiring the Port District to adopt a more extensive curfew than the Port District itself thought necessary and appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-11\">The interpretation and definition of applicable federal policies is more difficult. National policies with respect to aviation and noise are sufficiently complex that we must consider what is implicit in the federal regulatory scheme, its underlying assumptions, intended purposes, and desired effects. <em>Jones, </em>430 U.S. at 525, 97 S.Ct. at 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-13\">Much of this task has been performed by the Supreme Court. In <em>City of Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 624, 93 S.Ct. 1854, 36 L.Ed.2d 547 (1973), it held that a local non-proprietary airport curfew was preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-14\">At issue was a city\u2019s imposition, under its police power, of an 11:00 p. m. to 7:00 a. m. curfew on the operation of Hollywood-Burbank Airport, owned and operated by Lockheed. Lockheed sought to enjoin the city\u2019s ordinance, asserting that federal regulation and administrative action had preempted such legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-15\">The Supreme Court affirmed this court\u2019s and the district court\u2019s finding of preemption. After extensively surveying the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and the Noise Control Act of 1972, the Court found that Congress unequivocally intended that the federal government have \u201cfull control over aircraft noise, pre-empting state and local control,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 633, 93 S.Ct. at 1859, and that this congressional intent left \u201cno room for local curfews or other local controls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638, 93 S.Ct. at 1862.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, in order to fulfill the objectives of both acts, \u201ca uniform and exclusive system of federal regulation\u201d was \u201crequire[d].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639, 93 S.Ct. at 1862. Finally, the Court accepted the Solicitor General\u2019s statement that the federal government had preempted the field of \u201cairspace management.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627, 639, 93 S.Ct. at 1856, 1862. <em>See also </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348 (1976) (FAA authority over airspace control and facilities). Burbank\u2019s curfew was held to invade these preempted areas by regulating both the time when planes could fly and the source of noise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>emission. <em>City of Burbank, </em>411 U.S. at 638-39, 93 S.Ct. at 1862.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">The district court held correctly that <em>City of Burbank </em>controls here. Here, as in <em>City of Burbank, </em>a governmental entity was attempting to impose a mandatory curfew on an unwilling airport proprietor. Its authority for the curfew derived from the police power, again as in <em>City of Burbank.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Condition four would affect many flights,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> whereas the <em>City of Burbank </em>curfew affected only one flight per week. <em>Id. </em>at 626, 93 S.Ct. at 1856. Stare decisis seems to dictate affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">CalTrans disagrees. It asserts initially that <em>City of Burbank </em>is no longer good law because subsequent congressional and administrative actions evince a retreat from the pervasive federal regulation considered in <em>City of Burbank. </em>Second, it argues that, even if <em>City of Burbank </em>is good law, California fits within an exception desired by Congress and recognized by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">II. Federal Regulation following <em>City of Burbank</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-7\">Justice Douglas concluded <em>City of Burbank </em>by stating that the Court was \u201cnot at liberty to diffuse the powers given by Congress to FAA and EPA by letting the States or municipalities in on the planning. If that change is to be made, Congress alone must do it.\u201d 411 U.S. at 640, 93 S.Ct. at 1863.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-12\">CalTrans asserts that the passage of the Quiet Communities Act of 1978, Pub.L.95-609, 92 Stat. 3079 (1978),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> demonstrates Congress\u2019 intent to reject total federal control of the source of aircraft noise and to involve local governments in the national effort to abate such noise. In essence, this Act provides for a nationwide quiet communities program administered by local government and funded by the federal treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-13\">In particular, CalTrans relies on section two of the Quiet Communities Act, which amends the 1972 Noise Control Act relied upon in <em>City of Burbank. </em>This section gives the Environmental Protection Agency discretion to disburse funds to local governments for the purpose of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-14\">[Developing abatement plans for areas around major transportation facilities (in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>eluding airports, highways, and railyards) and other major stationary sources of noise, <em>and where appropriate, for the facility or source itself; </em>.... (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4913(c)(1)(C) (Supp. III 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">CalTrans cites the italicized portion of the statute and argues that Congress has explicitly authorized local governments to regulate the \u201csource\u201d of aviation noise unless such regulation would be in direct conflict with existing federal regulation. We disagree. '</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">The success of CalTrans\u2019 argument rests on a strained interpretation of the statute. First, it interprets \u201csources\u201d in the last phrase to include transitory sources such as airplanes. This is contrary to the statutory scheme, which distinguishes transportation facilities, such as railyards and airports, from stationary sources, such as factories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-8\">Second, CalTrans construes \u201cabatement plans\u201d to include the control of the sources of aircraft noise. This construction was rejected in <em>City of Burbank </em>and, as we discuss below, is inconsistent with other parts of the same statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-9\">Finally, CalTrans\u2019 argument that \u201cwhere appropriate\u201d means \u201cwhere possible\u201d or \u201cwhere not in direct conflict with a federal regulation\u201d begs the pivotal question of this appeal, namely, what scope of state regul\u00e1tion is left unpreempted by federal law. If Congress desired the result CalTrans advocates, it could have drafted the statute to avoid these strained constructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-12\">Instead, in subsection (c)(1), Congress stated that \u201cno actions, plans or programs hereunder shall be inconsistent with existing Federal authority under [the Noise Control Act of 1972] to regulate sources of noise in interstate commerce.\u201d This prohibition was written against the background of <em>City of </em>Burbank\u2019s holding that federal authority preempted local control of the sources of aviation noise. We hold that Congress intended to continue such preemption.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-13\">CalTrans\u2019 attempt to interpret the Quiet Communities Act as a blank check for local control of aviation noise stems, in part, from interpreting <em>City of Burbank </em>so broadly as to forbid any state control over aviation noise. This reading confuses controlling the source of noise with mitigating its effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-14\">An object causing noise can be controlled directly, either by restricting its use or by prescribing noise emission standards. <em>See, e. g., </em>14 C.F.R., Part 36 (1980). Quite independently of source control the effects of noise may be mitigated. Examples of such steps are compensating those adversely affected,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> using the zoning power to assure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>harmonious development,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> baffling existing noise,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or resettling those affected by the noise.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">As we read <em>City of Burbank, </em>Congress has preempted only local regulation of the source of aircraft noise. Local governments may adopt abatement plans that do not impinge on aircraft operations.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>See Air Transp. Ass\u2019n of America v. Crotti, </em>389 F.Supp. 58, 64-65 (N.D.Cal.1975) (three-judge court) (erection of noise abatement structures and monitoring of aviation noise are permissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\">The <em>City of Burbank </em>Court spoke only of noise \u201ccontrol\u201d preemption, 411 U.S. at 633, 638, 93 S.Ct. at 1859, 1862, not preemption of the entire field of aviation noise abatement. <em>See </em>U. S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Federal Aviation Admin., Aviation Noise Abatement Policy 34 (1976). Section 611(d)(2) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431(d)(2) (1976), relied upon in <em>City of Burbank, </em>authorizes the FAA to \u201cconsult with . .. Federal, State, and interstate agencies\u201d regarding noise control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-12\">This interpretation of <em>City of Burbank </em>is consistent with its underlying rationale. The Court acknowledged that \u201c[cjontrol of noise is of course deep-seated in the police power of the states,\u201d 411 U.S. at 638, but recognized that effective control of aircraft source noise is presumptively a subject for uniform federal regulation. <em>See, e. g., id. </em>at 625, 627-28, 639, 93 S.Ct. at 1855, 1856-57, 1862. <em>See also National Aviation v. City of Hayward, </em>418 F.Supp. 417, 425 n.13 (N.D.Cal.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-13\">As the Court in <em>City of Burbank </em>noted, Congress foresaw that local regulation of airspace use and the sources of aviation noise would \u201cseverely limit the flexibility of FAA in controlling air traffic flow,\u201d 411 U.S. at 639, 93 S.Ct. at 1862, and would \u201cincrease congestion, cause a loss of efficiency, and aggravate the noise problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628, 93 S.Ct. at 1857.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It was but a short step from these findings to the hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>ing that local regulation of the source of aircraft noise was preempted.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">In <em>Air Transp. Ass\u2019n of America v. Crotti, </em>389 F.Supp. 58 (N.D.Cal.1975) (three-judge court), the regulatory scheme at issue here was attacked as facially invalid by virtue of federal preemption. The court invalidated some provisions and let others stand, reserving for a later date their validity as applied.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">Brief discussion of three points in the district court decision illustrates its consistency with the result we reach.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It used the distinction between direct and indirect con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>trol of aircraft noise to invalidate California\u2019s attempt at direct noise regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65. Other regulations permitted proprietors to choose a variety of methods to reduce noise. Although a curfew was one option, it was not specifically mandated as it has been here.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The court stated that efforts to impose curfews via the state\u2019s police power might be suspect but, since the program did not unambiguously require this, it refrained from ruling on the matter. <em>Id. </em>at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">Finally, the court observed in a footnote that the power of states to regulate political subdivisions was well established. <em>Id. </em>at 64 n.2. CalTrans places inordinate interpretive weight on this dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">The observation that a state has a power in no way implies any doubt about equally well-settled limits to that power, such as federal preemption. The <em>Crotti </em>decision nowhere intimidated that the power to regulate subdivisions was unlimited by the Constitution. <em>Cf. National Aviation v. City of Hayward, </em>418 F.Supp. 417, 421 (N.D.Cal. 1976) (\u201cit seems clear that if this [curfew] was passed by a state . .. not the proprietor of the airport, it would run afoul of <em>Burbank </em>....\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">Our analysis of the pertinent state and federal regulations leads us to conclude that the curfew imposed by condition four impinges on airspace management by directing when planes may fly in the San Diego area, <em>City of Burbank, </em>411 U.S. at 627, 639, 93 S.Ct. at 1856, 1862, and on federal control of aircraft noise at its source by restricting the permissible flight times of planes solely on the basis of their noise emissions. <em>Id. </em>at 633, 638, 93 S.Ct. at 1859, 1862. The state has attempted to act in an area preempted by the federal government and its actions are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-10\">It is asserted, however, that even if <em>City of Burbank </em>is still a correct statement of federal policies, CalTrans fits within a recognized exception to its holding. We next consider that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-11\">III. <em>City of Burbank's </em>Proprietor Exemption</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-12\">The <em>City of Burbank </em>Court recognized that Congress singled out airport proprietors and gave them special, although undefined, leeway in controlling the sources of aircraft noise directly. <em>City of Burbank, </em>411 U.S. at 635-36 n.14, 93 S.Ct. at 1860-61 n.14. <em>See Santa Monica Airport Ass\u2019n v. City of Santa Monica, </em>647 F.2d 3 (9th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-13\">CalTrans asserts it is a proprietor of Lindbergh Field and that the proprietor exception is broad enough to encompass CalTrans\u2019 regulations. We need not address the scope of the exception as CalTrans is not a proprietor within the meaning of <em>City of Burbank.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-14\">The origin of the proprietor exemption appears in a letter by the Secretary of Transportation addressed to the Senate Commerce Committee regarding the 1968 amendments to the Federal Aviation Act. The letter, concurred in by the Committee, stated in part that the \u201cproposed legislation . . . will not prevent airport proprietors from excluding any aircraft on the basis of noise considerations.\u201d S.Rep.No.1353, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1968), <em>reprinted in </em>[1968] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2688, 2693.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-15\">The rationale for this exception is clear. Since airport proprietors bear monetary liability for excessive aircraft noise under <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Allegheny County, </em>369 U.S. 84, 82 S.Ct. 531, 7 L.Ed.2d 585 (1962), fairness dictates that they must also have power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>insulate themselves from that liability.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> But before an entity may possess this power, it must bear the responsibility, either actual or potential, for excessive aircraft noise.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">It has not been demonstrated that, under the current allocation of powers, CalTrans would be liable for excessive aircraft noise from Lindbergh Field under <em>Griggs. </em>There, the question was whether the county, as owner and operator of an airport, was liable for uncompensated takings of air easements necessary for the airport\u2019s operation. The other candidate for liability was the United States, due to its control of all navigable airspace. The Court found that the county was liable for the easements. 369 U.S. at 89, 82 S.Ct. at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">Among the bases given in <em>Griggs </em>for constitutional liability, or proprietorship for <em>City of Burbank </em>purposes, were the county\u2019s ability to obtain the necessary approach easements,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and its status as promoter, lessor, and operator of the airport.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Griggs, </em>369 U.S. at 89, 82 S.Ct. at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-7\">These criteria (ownership, operation, promotion, and the ability to acquire necessary approach easements) comprise a federal definition of proprietors for preemption purposes. To the extent that state law provides these qualities, we inquire into the Port District\u2019s status under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-13\">The California Legislature created the Port District in 1962. San Diego Unified Port District Act, 1962 Cal.Stats., Ch. 67, 1st Ex. Sess., <em>codified in </em>Cal.Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, App. I (West 1978 &amp; Supp. 1981). The Act granted the Port District power to: operate and promote an air terminal, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4, govern itself, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 21, sue and be sued, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 23, hold real property and make contracts, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 25, 31, condemn private property for public uses, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 21, as well as tax property for Port District purposes, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41, 45, 49.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-14\">California has also granted the Port District power to acquire air easements to alleviate the effect of aircraft noise on local residents.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Further, should the Port District desire to expand or begin new construction, the state provides for a limited relocation and compensation program for affected area residents.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-15\">Under state law then, the Port District is the owner, operator, and promoter of San Diego Airport. It has the power to acquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>air easements for the airport\u2019s use and may be sued in its own right. In short, it bears every earmark of proprietorship as recognized in <em>City of Burbank.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">The state concedes this, but denies that the above analysis establishes the Port District as the <em>sole </em>proprietor of the airport facility.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> California contends that, by virtue of the state\u2019s inherent power over its political subdivisions, CalTrans is also a proprietor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-11\">California\u2019s extensive grant of powers to the Port District fatally undercuts this argument. The state has seen fit to grant the Port District lands,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the ability to sue and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>be sued, and the power to operate and plan the airport. The district court found that, due to this delegation of authority, the state had no primary liability. 457 F.Supp. at 293-94. As the Port District is comprised of five San Diego area cities,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> California\u2019s actions have passed any potential aircraft noise liability from all of the state\u2019s residents to the residents of these five constituent cities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\"><em>City of Burbanks </em>proprietor exception looks to who will pay for the taking of air easements. The state, through the Port District Act, has unequivocally stated that the Port District and the residents of its constituent cities will foot the bill.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Since CalTrans bears no liability for excessive aircraft noise at Lindbergh Field, it is not now a proprietor under federal law, and cannot avail itself of <em>City of Burbanks </em>footnote 14.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">Moreover, state law precludes the argument that CalTrans and the district are dual proprietors. Section 21632 of the California Public Utilities Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aul-dedup-1\">[CalTrans] shall not acquire any airport . . . owned or controlled by a political subdivision . . . without the consent of the political subdivision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1379-11\">This constitutes a procedural barrier that the state has erected to its acquisition of Lindbergh Field and, derivatively, to the assumption of proprietorship status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-12\">CalTrans makes the final argument that, since the state could install CalTrans as operator and proprietor of Lindbergh Field by statute, the state can exercise the lesser power of assuming the 'proprietor\u2019s function of direct flight regulation. The argument fails because it confuses the existence of power with its exercise. The state cannot confer proprietor status on CalTrans simply by a course of dialectics when its own political system forbids that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-13\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1368-13\">. These regulations provide both substantive provisions setting the level of permissible noise, 21 Cal.Admin.Code \u00a7\u00a7 5001-5014 (1977), as well as a procedural mechanism for the enforcement of those levels, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5020-5080.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-14\">The regulations seek to measure ambient aviation noise under the Community Noise Equivalent Level Standard [CNEL], <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5006(f) (1977). CNEL represents a scientific effort to quantify an average person\u2019s daily dosage of noise, but by no means is the only available standard. <em>See </em>41 Fed.Reg. 51,522, 51,524 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1368-21\">. The district court found that most major California airports must routinely apply for a variance. 457 F.Supp. at 285. Under CalTrans\u2019 regulations, a variance is required unless the airport\u2019s \u201cnoise impact area\u201d is zero. 21 Cal. Admin.Code \u00a7 5062 (1977). In Lindbergh Field\u2019s case it was determined that the noise impact area was approximately three-quarters of a square mile, requiring the Port District to apply for a variance. While the regulations allow the attachment of \u201creasonable conditions\u201d to the grant of a variance, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5075(b)(7), the state administrative law judge explicitly found that \u201c[tjhere are no realistic solutions presently available to bring Lindbergh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>Field into compliance with the State Noise Standards.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">.

The distinctive purpose of a three-judge court as it was conceived and for most of the existence of its statutory authorization was not to add a greater than normal authority or finality to its decision, but rather to ensure that any decision that may enjoin enforcement of statutes be made after more extensive and considered deliberation than a single district judge might have the opportunity to undertake. <em>See </em>P.

The identity of the proprietor or proprietors of Lindbergh Field has significance beyond <em>City of Burbank\u2019s </em>footnote 14. The federal government, appearing amicus curiae, desires to know who the proprietor is for its certification process under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432 (1976). Section 1432 certificates are issued to airport operators who meet minimum safety standards, and enable the FAA to enforce its safety regulations. Currently, the Port District is the only entity listed as a proprietor under this certificate procedure. Clerk\u2019s Record at 685.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1378-6\">. CalTrans asserts that the tidelands on which Lindbergh Field sits are subject to a public trust of which California is both the settlor and the representative of the beneficiaries. See <em>City of Coronado v. San Diego Unified Port Dist., </em>227 Cal.App.2d 455, 474-75, 38 Cal.Rptr. 834 (1964), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>380 U.S. 125, 380 S.Ct. 806, 13 L.Ed.2d 792 (1965) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-7\">From this premise, CalTrans makes two arguments: first, that its capacity under this trust allows it to direct the activities conducted on the land subject to the trust; and second, that the State Aeronautics Act, which authorizes the regulations at issue here, must be read as a <em>pro tanto </em>amendment of the Port District\u2019s original tidelands grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-8\">An inquiry into the scope of California\u2019s rights under the tidelands trust theory, <em>see generally, Marks v. Whitney, </em>6 Cal.3d 251, 98 Cal. Rptr. 790, 491 P.2d 374 (1971); Eikel &amp; Williams, <em>The Public Trust Doctrine and the California Coastline, </em>6 Urb.Law. 519 (1974), does not aid our analysis. For purposes of federal proprietorship, the key factor is <em>Griggs </em>liability. Nothing in the materials cited by CalTrans or amici indicates that the State of California, as settler and representative of the beneficiaries of the trust, bears fiscal liability for misuse of the Port District\u2019s land. At oral argument, counsel for CalTrans explicitly disclaimed such primary liability. Without such liability, however, congressional intent, as found in <em>City of Burbank, </em>precludes control under the police power, and CalTrans\u2019 argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-9\">CalTrans\u2019 <em>pro tanto </em>amendment theory suffers a similar fate. In addition to not resolving the question of <em>Griggs </em>liability, the authorities cited by CalTrans and the state are of no help. The state asserts that <em>People ex rel. San Francisco Bay Conservation &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n v. Town of Emeryville, </em>69 Cal.2d 533, 72 Cal.Rptr. 790, 446 P.2d 790 (1968), and <em>Mallon v. City of Long Beach, </em>44 Cal.2d 199, 282 P.2d 481 (1955), stand for the proposition that any act by the state legislature automatically affects every tideland grant. While we recognize that the authority to rescind such grants remains in the legislature, <em>see </em>Eikel &amp; Williams, <em>supra, </em>at 552-53, we find these cases inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-13\">In <em>Emeryville, </em>for example, the legislature had created a special commission especially for the administration of tidelands in the San Francisco Bay area. In upholding an injunction in favor of the special commission and against Emeryville, the titleholder of the lands, the court held that the legislature retained the power to amend tideland grants when to do so would serve the \u201cgeneral statewide interest.\u201d 69 Cal.2d at 549, 79 Cal.Rptr. 790, 446 P.2d 790. But there the affected lands were specifically mentioned in the superseding legislation, and the result was within the intent of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-14\">Here, by contrast, the tidelands are not mentioned in the State Aeronautics Act, nor does it appear in that act that the legislature intended to use its power over California\u2019s tidelands to achieve the objectives of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-15\"><em>Mailon </em>involved similar facts. There, the City of Long Beach sued to recover profits from natural resources located in the tidelands. The state legislature had by state law allocated them to the state, and the California Supreme Court held that the legislature had the power to make that amendment to the initial grant of the tidelands. 44 Cal.2d at 207, 282 P.2d 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-16\">Neither case contains language supporting the proposition that each of the many acts of the California legislature automatically affects the terms of every tidelands grant made since 1850. The result would be utter chaos, and we do not attribute that to California\u2019s legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-17\">The cases cited by CalTrans and amici are better read to stand for the proposition that legislation may specifically alter a municipality\u2019s tidelands grant. Here, the scope of the trust would not allow CalTrans to direct the Port District\u2019s activities because we have not been shown that the state legislature specifically exercised its power over the Port District\u2019s tidelands when enacting the State Aeronautics Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-18\">Further, the legislature addressed itself to the particular lands at issue here when it created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>the Port District in 1962. It said that the Port District \u201cshall hold such lands in trust for the uses and purposes and upon the conditions which are declared in this act.\u201d Cal.Harb. &amp; Nav.Code, App. I, \u00a7 14 (West 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-8\">The uses, purposes and conditions included the \u201cacquisition, construction, maintenance, operation, development and regulation of ... air terminal facilities\u201d and the promotion of \u201ccommerce, navigation, fisheries and recreation ... . \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4. <em>See also id. </em>\u00a7 87. The terms of this grant have not been explicitly amended since the Port District\u2019s creation, and we decline to do so now.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1379-9\">. The cities of Chula Vista, Coronado, Imperial Beach and National City select one commissioner each to sit on the Port District\u2019s governing board. San Diego, due to its relative size, selects three commissioners for a total of seven. Cal.Harb. &amp; Nav.Code, App. I, \u00a7 16 (West 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b1379-10\">. It may by true that California could assume liability for excessive noise at Lindbergh Field, but we deal in actualities and not possibilities. California has four methods for its political subdivisions to pay judgments, <em>see </em>Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7\u00a7 970-991.2 (West 1980 &amp; Supp. 1981). Absent these, a subdivision may declare bankruptcy under Chapter Nine of the Federal Bankruptcy Act to eradicate its debt. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-946 (Supp. III 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-16\">Nowhere is it mandated that the state will be ultimately liable for the Port District\u2019s judgments. The Port District, without further and uncertain state action, bears alone the brunt of aircraft noise liability. As such, it is the proprietor for purposes of <em>City of Burbank\u2019s </em>footnote 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1379-17\">. In its reply brief CalTrans argued, for the first time, that this interpretation of federal law would render it unconstitutional under <em>National League of Cities v. Usery, </em>426 U.S. 833, 96 S.Ct. 2465, 49 L.Ed.2d 245 (1976). CalTrans did little more than cite <em>National League of Cities, </em>however, and we are left to guess precisely what it meant to argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-18\">Under these circumstances we may not consider the question. <em>Levy v. Urbach, </em>651 F.2d 1278, 1280-1281 n.3, (9th Cir., 1981).
