Van Dusen, Senior United States Circuit Judge of the Third Circuit sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b689-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b689-23\">This appeal is from a February 15, 1980, judgment and commitment of defendant-appellant, imposing a 10-year sentence to be served consecutively to the Montana state sentence presently being served by him, with eligibility for parole under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(2) at such time as the Parole Commission may determine. The jury found Leo Rubier guilty of (1) bank robbery and assault, putting in jeopardy the life of bank employees by the use of a gun, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d); and (2) aiding and abetting such crimes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, on the basis that he had driven the \u201cgetaway\u201d car (R.T. 27). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-24\">The only evidence directly implicating Rubier was the testimony of Wayne Schrader (R.T. 21-34 &amp; 41). On cross-examination of Schrader, defense counsel sought to show bias by revealing Schrader\u2019s immunity-for-testimony agreement with the Government (R.T. 54-62) and that Schrader was a heroin addict (R.T. 40-43). Defense counsel\u2019s questions, which were mostly lengthy statements, show that he was reading or paraphrasing the two writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>ten letters containing the agreement (R.T. 56-58, 60-62) and thus selectively putting parts of the agreement before the jury. The prosecutor\u2019s reaction to the immunity-for-testimony evidence was to seek admission of the two letters containing all the terms of the agreement (R.T. 62, 65). One letter, dated May 5, 1978 (P-6), was from Schrader\u2019s attorney to Prosecutor Sim and the other a return letter from the United States Attorney dated May 8, 1978 (P-5). Defense counsel raised a general objection to the admission of the letters, asserting that there was not \u201cany basis for ... [admitting the letters] under the rules of evidence,\u201d and arguing that Schrader had never seen or participated in writing either of the letters (R.T. 66).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The district court admitted the letters, holding that the Government was entitled to have all the terms of the agreement put on the record after the defense had brought up the subject of the immunity-for-testimony agreement with the witness (R.T. 66).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">We have concluded that there was no reversible error in admitting the letters into evidence for these reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">A. Facts of independent legal significance constituting a contract which is at issue are not hearsay. See <em>N. L. R. B. v. H. Koch &amp; Sons, </em>578 F.2d 1287, 1290-91 (9th Cir. 1978).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-9\">B. Since no specific objection was made to the admission of the letters on the ground that they supported a contention that the Government was motivating the witness Schrader to testify truthfully, the objecting party is precluded from asserting any such objection on appeal. <em>United States </em>v. <em>O'Brien, </em>601 F.2d 1067, 1071 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>Allen v. Schneckloth, </em>431 F.2d 635, 637 (9th Cir. 1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-10\">C. The letters in question contain the full terms of the immunity-for-testimony agreement and, hence, clarified and rebutted the defense cross-examination seeking to show bias of the witness Schrader. As such, they were relevant as tending to make the existence of the fact of bias less probable than it would be without the contents of the letters. Although the letter of May 5 from Schrader\u2019s attorney (P-6) states that Schrader will testify truthfully at Rubier\u2019s trial in return for the Government\u2019s agreement not to prosecute him for this robbery, the answering letter from the United States Attorney dated May 8, 1978 (P-5), makes no mention of any agreement to speak \u201ctruthfully,\u201d but only mentions that if he does not speak truthfully he will be subject to prosecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">The foregoing facts made clear that this record does not contain any implication that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>\u201cthe prosecutor knows what the truth is and is assuring its revelation.\u201d See <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>618 F.2d 530, 536 (9th Cir. 1980). We conclude that the vouching principle of <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>618 F.2d at 533, namely, that \u201c[i]t is improper for the prosecution to vouch for the credibility of a government witness,\u201d is not applicable to this record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, we note that <em>United States </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>pointed out the desirability of considering \u201can instruction to the jury [to] dispel any improper suggestions\u201d in appropriate circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 536. No request was made for such an instruction in this case apparently because, as noted above, the 1978 letters did not contain a vouching by the Government for the truthfulness of Schrader\u2019s testimony at the 1980 trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\">. In view of the dissenting opinion, we note that it was the defense which injected the immunity agreement into the case. The defense counsel in effect read to the jury the portions of the letters which favored the defense. <em>Cf. </em>R.T. 56-58, 60-62 <em>with </em>P-5, P-6. <em>See also </em>Fed.R. Evid. 106. In overruling defense counsel\u2019s objection to the admission of P-5 and P-6 into evidence, the trial judge stated at R.T. 67:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqa\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, to explain my reasons, I think where you have gone into the terms of the agreement with this witness, the Government is entitled to have spread on the record all of the terms of the agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABo\">Defense counsel did not limit his cross-examination to Schrader\u2019s understanding of what the terms of the agreement were. Counsel repeatedly asked if Schrader had \u201centered into [a] bargain,\u201d and asked, \u201cthe Government had promised to do several things for you. Correct?\u201d R.T. 56. These questions refer to the actual agreement, which was the written letters. Schrader accepted this written agreement through his attorney and by his act of testifying.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-12\">. These final two paragraphs of this letter make clear that the Government had not even interviewed Schrader prior to the writing of the May 8 letter and could not vouch in that letter for his testimony because it did not know what he would say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-13\">\u201cOf course, the United States is interested only in the truth. No deception, whether it hurts the Government\u2019s case or not, will be tolerated. If it is established that Schrader has not been candid with the Government concerning the Lake Stevens robbery, this agreement will be considered to have been breached and he will be subject to prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-14\">\u201cBy copy of this letter I am requesting that the FBI expeditiously arrange to have Schrader interviewed at Lompoc concerning this bank robbery. We can arrange a Grand Jury appearance as soon as I see the results of the interview. As the dates arise when any action that the Government has agreed to needs to be taken in order to have it considered with regard to Schrader\u2019s custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>status, please contact me. I have no other way of knowing when he would need the help that the Government has promised to give him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">The jury could not reasonably have found <em>from </em>the contents of P-6 and P-5 that the Government was vouching for anything Schrader might say in a future interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b691-10\">. The holding in <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>618 F.2d 530, 532 (9th Cir. 1980), is inapplicable to this case since the reversal of the convictions in that case was based on \u201cimproper closing argument.\u201d Also, there is no contention here that vouching by the Government for the truthfulness of Schrader\u2019s testimony was mentioned in the arguments of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b691-11\">. This is not a case such as <em>Roberts, supra, </em>where two participants in a crime testified in a wholly inconsistent way (618 F.2d at 533), since defendant did not take the stand here. At the trial, Schrader testified that defendant Rubier participated in the bank robbery by driving the getaway car. An F.B.I. agent testified (N.T. 152-68) that defendant told him, at an interview in January 1979, that he did not drive that car or participate in the robbery, but that in the two days before the robbery Schrader, McGee, and defendant drove to the bank which was later robbed and \u201cSchrader went in the bank to cash a large denomination bill, ... the purpose being to case the bank for a robbery.... They then drove to a used car lot .... to try to find a getaway car for the bank robbery\u201d (N.T. 155). Also, the agent testified: \u201cWhen he [Rubier] told me these events [Schrader going into the bank and cashing a bill and essentially casing the bank, going with the others to the car lot, and McGee test driving the getaway car, N.T. 162-63], his indication was that at the time they occurred, he knew that is what was going on .... In telling me these events, he indicated to me he knew at the time they went to the bank that it was to case the bank .... \u201d N.T. 163.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b691-6\">BOOCHEVER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"aan-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"A1k\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">As indicated in the majority opinion the only evidence directly implicating Rubier in the robbery and assault was the testimony of Wayne Schrader. Without that testimony Rubier could not have been convicted. Thus Schrader\u2019s credibility was at the core of the government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">On cross examination Schrader testified to his understanding of the bargain, whereby the government agreed not to prosecute him for the robbery in exchange for his cooperation in the robbery investigation and his testimony against Rubier. To bolster Schrader\u2019s credibility the prosecution sought to admit into evidence letters from the prosecutor and Schrader\u2019s attorney setting forth the agreement those two attorneys had reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">Schrader testified that he had never seen the agreement worked out between his attorney and the United States Attorney [TR 62]. When asked if his attorney had \u201cfully laid down to you the details of the agreement that had been worked out,\u201d Schrader replied: \u201cWell, more or less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">In its brief on appeal the government explains why it believes the letters were relevant, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-15\">If the matter had been left as it was at the end of cross-examination, the jury could have believed that Schrader had simply traded immunity for testimony against Rubier. It was important for the jury to understand that had Schrader\u2019s testimony been false, he would have lost his immunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-16\">In the absence of some testimony that Schrader had either read the letters or had all of their terms read or explained to him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the fact that the letters embodied an agreement between the attorneys that the testimony be truthful was not relevant for the purpose of showing that Schrader so understood the agreement. Without testimony indicating that Schrader was aware of the portent of the letter agreement requiring truthfulness, the letters were inadmissible. Considered by themselves, letters between the attorneys have no tendency to make the assertion that Schrader, as opposed to his attorney, had agreed to testify truthfully or lose the benefit of prosecutorial immunity \u201cmore probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An instrument purporting to have been executed by an attorney-in-fact or other agent is not admissible for any purpose absent proof of the agent\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such authentication is necessary to establish the relevancy of the document.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While a defendant\u2019s attorney may enter into negotiations with the district attorney pertaining to a plea bargain, no agreement which they reach can have any effect on the defendant until he or she has knowledge of the existence of its terms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">In <em>Jones v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 252, 255-56 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 839, 91 S.Ct. 79, 27 L.Ed.2d 73 (1970), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbN\">A guilty plea is not necessarily invalid because it rests upon a bargain with the prosecutor, [citation] but knowledge of the existence of such an agreement, its terms, and the negotiations which led to it, are crucial to the effective discharge of the court\u2019s responsibility to assure that the plea is not accepted unless it is voluntarily made .... Moreover, because of the prevalence of such agreements, the judge on his own initiative should explore, on the record, whether such an agreement exists, and, if so, its terms, how they were arrived at, the defendant\u2019s understanding of them, and their influence upon his decision to plead guilty, [footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">Rubier\u2019s trial counsel made an appropriate objection on the basis of Schrader\u2019s lack of familiarity with the communications.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The letters being irrelevant, it was error to admit them over counsel\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">The government does not argue that admission of the letters was harmless error. In fact, as indicated above, it considers it of importance for the jury to have understood that had Schrader\u2019s testimony been false, he would have lost his immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">In addition, I note that the letter from Schrader\u2019s attorney vouched for the truthfulness of Schrader\u2019s testimony by stating: \u201che will testify truthfully before the grand jury and at trial (if necessary) against Leo Rubiera, [sic]While not as flagrant as the circumstances involved in <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>618 F.2d 530, 536 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>1980),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the use of a letter by a witness\u2019 attorney vouching for the truthfulness of testimony certainly affects substantial rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the voucher by Schrader\u2019s attorney is coupled with the contents of the United States Attorney\u2019s letter stating that Schrader would be subject to prosecution if he did not testify truthfully \u201cwhether it hurts the government\u2019s case or not,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I conclude that the erroneous introduction of the letters is reversible.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-5\">.

The two letters explain exactly what the agreement of both parties was. Schrader isn\u2019t required to testify about a particular person, he is required to tell the truth, that\u2019s what he agrees to do, and it clearly specifies that if he doesn\u2019t tell the truth, he\u2019s going to be prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-16\">\u201cThe government isn't interested in anything except the truth. He doesn\u2019t have to say there\u2019s a getaway driver in the bank robbery, but if there was, he has to say so and he has to say who it is, and he has to tell truthfully because if it was really Steve Crockett and he says it\u2019s Leo Rubier and the government finds out about it, which they might, he doesn\u2019t know that they might not, what's going to happen to Wayne Schrader? He\u2019s going to get prosecuted for bank robbery, and the agreement clearly lets the government do that and obligates the government to do that. If there was no getaway driver, that agreement required him to say so and nothing else.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>We note that counsel for defendant made no objection whatever to this rebuttal argument of the prosecutor at the time of the closing arguments to the jury and made no request for any curative instructions to the jury on the issue of alleged vouching.

Without testimony indicating that Schrader was aware of the portent of the letter agreement requiring truthfulness, the letters were inadmissible. Considered by themselves, letters between the attorneys have no tendency to make the assertion that Schrader, as opposed to his attorney, had agreed to testify truthfully or lose the benefit of prosecutorial immunity \u201cmore probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An instrument purporting to have been executed by an attorney-in-fact or other agent is not admissible for any purpose absent proof of the agent\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such authentication is necessary to . establish the relevancy of the document.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While a defendant\u2019s attorney may enter into negotiations with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>district attorney pertaining to a plea bargain, no agreement which they reach can have any effect on the defendant until he or she has knowledge of the existence of its terms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">In <em>Jones v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 252 at 255, 256 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 839, 91 S.Ct. 79, 27 L.Ed.2d 73 (1970), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">A guilty plea is not necessarily invalid because it rests upon a bargain with the prosecutor, [citation] but knowledge of the existence of such an agreement, its terms, and the negotiations which led to it, are crucial to the effective discharge of the court\u2019s responsibility to assure that the plea is not accepted unless it is voluntarily made.... Moreover, because of the prevalence of such agreements, the judge on his own initiative should explore, on the record, whether such an agreement exists, and, if so, its terms, how they were arrived at, the defendant\u2019s understanding of them, and their influence upon his decision to plead guilty, [footnote omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Rubier\u2019s trial counsel made an appropriate objection on the basis of Schrader\u2019s lack of familiarity with the communications.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The letters being irrelevant, it was error to admit them over counsel\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The government does not argue that admission of the letters was harmless error. In fact, as indicated above, it considers it of importance for the jury to have understood that had Schrader\u2019s testimony been false, he would have lost his immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">In addition, I note that the letter from Schrader\u2019s attorney vouched for the truthfulness of Schrader\u2019s testimony by stating: \u201che will testify truthfully before the grand jury and at trial (if necessary) against Leo Rubiera, [sic]. ... \u201d This is analogous to the circumstances involved in <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>618 F.2d 530, 536 (9th Cir. 1980), where the prosecution similarly vouched for the truthfulness of a witness\u2019 testimony. The record in this case has been supplemented with the transcription of the final arguments. As indicated in the portions of the prosecutor\u2019s argument quoted in the Memorandum for Supplemental Petition for Rehearing &amp; Response to that Petition the government exacerbated the error in admitting the letters by using them to vouch for Schrader\u2019s credibility. As we stated in <em>Roberts:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-12\">A strong case can be made for excluding a plea agreement promise of truthfulness. The witness, who would otherwise seem untrustworthy, may appear to have been compelled by the prosecutor\u2019s threats and promises to come forward and be truthful. The suggestion is that the prosecutor is forcing the truth from his witness and the unspoken message is that the prosecutor knows what the truth is and is assuring its revelation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-13\">Conveying this message explicitly is improper vouching. <em>Lawn v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 339, 359-60 n.15, 78 S.Ct. 311, 323 n.15, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958), <em>Gradsky v. United States, </em>373 F.2d 706, 710 (5th Cir. 1972) (improper to imply government checks for credibility before using witness). We conclude that conveying it by implication is equally improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-14\">The prosecutor may not tell the jury that the government has confirmed a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ness\u2019s credibility before using him. <em>Gradsky v. United States, supra. </em>He should be no more able to indicate that the government has taken steps to compel the witness to be truthful. Both of these arguments involve improper vouching because they invite the jury to rely on the government\u2019s assessment that the witness is testifying truthfully, [citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Since the letters were improperly admitted I find no reason to consider whether the use of them for \u201cvouching\u201d in the final argument need be recognized as plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The use of a letter by a witness\u2019 attorney vouching for the truthfulness of testimony certainly affects substantial rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When the voucher by Schrader\u2019s attorney is coupled with the contents of the United States Attorney\u2019s letter stating that Schrader would be subject to prosecution if he did not testify truthfully \u201cwhether it hurts the government\u2019s case or not,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the use of the letters in final argument, I conclude that the erroneous introduction of the letters is reversible.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-11\">.
