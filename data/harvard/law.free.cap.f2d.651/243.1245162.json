Some time during that period, four of the eight key punch positions in appellant\u2019s section were upgraded to the GS-4 level. Appellant\u2019s name, along with the names of her co-workers, was placed on a referral list for consideration for promotion to these upgraded positions. Appellant was not selected for promotion, but was retained at the GS-3 level. On March 17, 1980, she initiated an appeal of that action to the Merit Systems Protection Board (the Board). The Board dismissed her appeal for lack of jurisdiction and her subsequent petition for review of that initial determination was denied. Appellant here seeks review of the dismissal of her appeal by the Board pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(6) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-15\">The sole issue before us is whether the Board correctly declined to review a personnel action by which the Department of the Army denied one of its employees a promotion. We hold that the Board is without jurisdiction and affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-16\">The Board is charged with the hearing or adjudication of such matters as are placed within its jurisdiction \u201cunder any law, rule, or regulation.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7701(a) and 1205(a)(1). By law, \u201cadverse actions\u201d are subject to review by the Board. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(d). These actions, however, are narrowly defined and include only removal, suspension for more than 14 days, reduction in grade, reduction in pay, and furlough of 30 days or less. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512(1-5). <em>See Delong v. United States, </em>621 F.2d 618, 625 (4th Cir. 1980). Appellant\u2019s assertion that she was denied a promotion falls within none of these categories and is, thus, not reviewable by the Board under this authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-17\">Neither is such action subject to the Board\u2019s review under any regulation cited to this court. Appellant contends that the denial of her promotion is reviewable as \u201ca removal or reduction-in-grade\u201d or as a \u201cdenial of with-in grade step increase\u201d pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.3 (1 and 2). Again, the action of the Department of the Army in this case resulted in neither the removal nor the reduction in grade of appellant and was clearly distinguishable from the denial of a within grade step increase. <em>Compare </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5335 with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5104, 5332 and 5334(a)(7). She further asserts that her claim was properly reviewable as one concerning an action \u201cotherwise appealable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the Board involving an allegation of discrimination.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.3(5). We agree with the Board that this section is of no effect where, as here, the alleged discrimination results in no action which is, itself, appealable to the Board. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(aXl)(A). <em>Budnick v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>643 F.2d 278 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that she is entitled to review pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.104 for a claimed violation of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.103 (not taking into account a job analysis). As the Board recognized, however, \u00a7 300.104 applies only to a personnel practice applied by the Office of Personnel Management. If there were a personnel practice at issue here, it was applied by the Department of the Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Having been cited to no law, rule or regulation affording the Board jurisdiction to review an agency\u2019s denial of a promotion, and none appearing, we hold that the Board properly dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We express no opinion as to the merits of appellant\u2019s claim, however, and our decision shall in no manner prejudice her pursuit of any other remedy open to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The decision of the Board is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>2</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-10\">. Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>McCourt v. Hampton, 514 F.2d </em>1365 (4th Cir. 1975), is inapposite here. While that case discussed the substantive right of an incumbent at that time to be promoted when his position was upgraded, it did not touch upon the Board\u2019s authority or lack thereof to review such cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-26\">.
