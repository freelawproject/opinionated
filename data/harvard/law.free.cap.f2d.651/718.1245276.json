App.P. 34(a)) Tenth Circuit R. 10(e). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">This matter comes before the court upon defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the EEOC\u2019s appeal from a judgment in favor of defendant in a Title VII action. Defendant argues that the district court\u2019s order is not final and therefore not appealable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">In its Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law, the trial court found in favor of defendant on the merits and concluded that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to defendant was appropriate under the test set forth in <em>Christianburg Garment Co. </em>v. <em>EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978). However, the court reserved the issue of the amount of such fees until a further hearing. In our recent decision in <em>Gurule v. Wilson, </em>635 F.2d 782 (10th Cir. 1980), we faced a contention that failure to award attorneys fees under The Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976,42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, rendered the judgment interlocutory where such fees had been specifically requested in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. We concluded that the judgment was not final. Here, defendant sought an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in its answer to the EEOC complaint. Given the similarities between fee awards under \u00a7 1988 and Title VII, we believe the analysis in <em>Gurule </em>applies to this action and that the district court\u2019s judgment will not be final until the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-16\">. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed as premature.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
