JONES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">The Board petitions for enforcement of its Order that Allen\u2019s I.G.A. Foodliner (Allen\u2019s) violated Section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act (the Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) and (3), by discharging an employee for his union activity. The Board also found that Allen\u2019s violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act by announcing improved benefits in order to undermine a union and by sponsoring and participating in the circulation of a petition among employees withdrawing support from a union. 244 NLRB No. 25. For the reasons set forth below, we grant enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">EMPLOYEE DISCHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"b499-17\">Allen\u2019s, a Kentucky corporation, operates retail grocery establishments in Morehead, Kentucky. In the fall of 1976, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, Local 227 (the Union) began an organizational campaign among Allen\u2019s employees. Lowell Ray Adkins became actively involved in the Union\u2019s organizational campaign. He distributed union authorization cards and solicited employees to join the Union. An election was held on January 20, 1977, which the Union lost. Based upon the Union\u2019s objections to the election, a second election was ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">During the period between the two elections, Adkins assisted Union officials by arranging and participating in organizational meetings and visits. At a meeting of the meat and produce department employees, store manager Hub Moore stated that Allen\u2019s had \u201ckept quiet long enough,\u201d and announced a new benefit plan. Adkins inquired from the floor whether the plan was similar to a company benefit plan in Louisville. Moore replied that the plans were similar, at least as to time-and-a-half for overtime pay. Adkins challenged Moore\u2019s statement, asserting that the Louisville plan called for double overtime pay, and produced a copy of the Louisville plan to support his assertion. On other occasions, Moore accused Adkins of \u201cspreading lies\u201d by telling employees he could get them improved wages and benefits; charged Adkins with having \u201cmore control over the employees\u201d than Moore did; asked Adkins why he supported the Union; and, told Adkins that he (Moore) had \u201cpeople in the store\u201d that would tell Moore anything he wanted to know and \u201canything that was happening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>A second election was held on August 12, 1977. After the Union\u2019s victory had been announced, Moore angrily stated to Adkins and two other employees, \u201cWell, I guess you all think you won. Well, you didn\u2019t win. You lost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Moore continued to harass Adkins about his union involvement. Moore told Adkins that he would fire Adkins if he caught him \u201ctalking union on the job or on company property.\u201d Moore admonished Adkins for \u201ccosting the people of the store money\u201d and told him that Allen\u2019s had a plan that would improve benefits for the employees, but that it couldn\u2019t be put into effect at this time \u201cbecause of the [Union] problem\u201d they had. Moore berated Adkins for a pro-union slogan written on the restroom wall, and told him he wanted it stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Approximately two weeks after the second election, Moore discharged night manager Billy Snipes. Moore told Snipes that he (Moore) had been instructed to fire Snipes if he was \u201cfor the Union.\u201d Moore then interrogated Snipes concerning a conversation Snipes had had with Adkins a few days earlier. Moore offered Snipes a second chance provided he realized that there were \u201ccertain people you can talk to at work here.\u201d Moore also told Snipes to \u201cstay away from the boys in produce and around back.\u201d Snipes refused and was fired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Several months after the second election, Adkins was elected shop steward and a member of the Union\u2019s negotiating committee. Moore told Adkins about a shop steward in Louisville that Moore had \u201cthrown out of his office more times than he could count.\u201d Moore also told Adkins that the company had \u201cfinally\u201d made the Louisville shop steward an assistant manager, and that he became the \u201cbest\u201d assistant manager they had ever had. On April 7, 1978, Moore notified Adkins that he was being laid off \u201cdue to lack of business\u201d and because he \u201crated below\u201d his fellow employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">It is well settled that an employer is prohibited from discharging an employee because of his union activities. <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., Inc., </em>395 U.S. 575, 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1942, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969); <em>Vic Tanney Intern., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>622 F.2d 237 (6th Cir. 1980). The Board determined that Allen\u2019s discharged Adkins in violation of the Act. In this appeal Allen\u2019s asserts that Adkins was discharged because of a \u201cbusiness retrenchment\u201d and because of his poor performance. Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Allen\u2019s proffered reasons for Adkins\u2019 discharge were pretextual. Although a subsequent increase in business necessitated the hiring of several new employees and the promotion of others from part time to full time, Adkins was never recalled. Allen\u2019s announcement of an increased wage and benefit plan are inconsistent with an economic retrenchment. Additionally, by Allen\u2019s own admission, Adkins was a \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cdependable\u201d worker for eight of his nine years. Only within the year preceding Adkins\u2019 discharge did Allen\u2019s begin to find fault with Adkins\u2019 attitude. Consequently, we hold that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that Adkins\u2019 union activities were the sole reason for his discharge. <em>Wright Line, </em>251 NLRB 150 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">BENEFIT PLAN/EMPLOYEE PETITION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">It is a violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act for an employer to sponsor and participate in the circulation of a petition among employees withdrawing support from a union. There are \u201cfew more specific methods of interfering with employees\u2019 rights freely to choose or not to choose a bargaining representative than to have each summoned to the office of the employer and there to be asked to sign a prepared statement withdrawing from the Union.\u201d <em>NLRB v. H. W. Elson Bottling Co., </em>379 F.2d 223, 225 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">The granting or withholding of benefits in order to discourage union activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ty is proscribed by Section 8(a)(1) of the Act. In <em>NLRB v. Exchange Parts Co., </em>375 U.S. 405, 409, 84 S.Ct. 457, 459, 11 L.Ed.2d 435 (1964), the Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe danger inherent in well-timed increases in benefits is the suggestion of a fist inside a velvet glove. Employees are not likely to miss the inference that the source of benefits now conferred is also the source from which future benefits must flow and which may dry up if it is not obliged.\u201d Applying these principles, we hold that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Allen\u2019s violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act by sponsoring and participating in the circulation of the petition among employees withdrawing support from the Union and by announcing improved benefits in order to undermine the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In May 1978, employee Ivan Connolly approached at least two other employees with a petition which stated, in effect, that \u201cwe, the employees of Allen\u2019s IGA, do not wish to have the Amalgamated Meat Cutters represent us.\u201d Neither employee wished to sign the petition immediately although several other employees had signed the petition. Employee Paula Henderson sought the advice of assistant manager Harold Chapman. He told her that it would be \u201cwise\u201d to sign the petition and she did. The other employee, Donna Withrow, was called to assistant manager Wavell De-Hart\u2019s office to explain her reasons for not signing. She replied that she wished to remain uninvolved and would wait until after a scheduled store meeting before making up her mind. DeHart said it would be \u201cbetter\u201d if she signed at once, whereupon she did sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The day after the DeHart-Withrow incident, store owner Hubert Allen held a meeting for Allen\u2019s employees. He announced the institution of a profit-sharing plan for employees and a raise in their wages. Allen apologized for not instituting these changes sooner, explaining that if he had, he \u201ccould have gotten into trouble.\u201d Allen stated he was glad it was \u201call over now\u201d and the company and its employees would be \u201cone big, happy family again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Allen\u2019s sole contention concerning its sponsoring of the anti-union petition and announcement of benefits is a procedural one: that the allegations as to the Board\u2019s findings are barred by Section 10(b) of the Act. Section 10(b) of the Act states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">Whenever it is charged that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, the Board . .. shall have power to issue ... a complaint stating the charges in that respect . .. provided, that no complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practices occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Allen\u2019s sponsored the anti-union petition and announced increased benefits in May of</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">1978. The <em>original charge </em>filed by the Union on July 10,1978 did not specifically rely on Allen\u2019s anti-union petition and announcement of benefits. It only alleged that Allen\u2019s violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act by discharging employees and \u201cby other acts.\u201d Nor did the Board\u2019s <em>original complaint </em>allege that Allen\u2019s anti-union petition and announcement of increased benefits violated the Act. However, on February 2, 1979, two weeks before the administrative hearing, an <em>amended complaint </em>issued by the Board specifically alleged that Allen\u2019s anti-union petition and announcement of increased benefits contravened Section 8(a)(1) of the Act. Thus, Allen\u2019s argues that the findings of 8(a)(1) violations are not pursuant to a charge filed with the Board. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">As was aptly stated in <em>NLRB v. Central Power &amp; Light Co., </em>425 F.2d 1318 (5th Cir. 1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-14\">The charge is thus not intended to be a detailed pleading or to specify the issues ultimately to be raised before the [Administrative Law Judge]; the Board\u2019s complaint serves that function. All that the requirement is really concerned about is that the instigation of an investigation and complaint proceed under a formal charge made by the party aggrieved and not from the Board\u2019s own initiative. Accordingly, general allegations such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>that the employer \u201cby other acts and conduct ... interfered with, restrained and coerced its employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act,\u201d . .. are legally sufficient to cause inclusion of other acts if they are sufficiently related to the specific acts alleged. And sufficient relation has generally been found between acts that are part of the same course of conduct, such as a single campaign against a union.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aay-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 1320 (citations and footnotes omitted). <em>Accord, NLRB v. Bin-Dicator Co., </em>356 F.2d 210, 214 (6th Cir. 1966). In this case, the Union\u2019s charge was legally sufficient to include Allen\u2019s sponsorship of the anti-union petition and its announcement of benefits. Both of these were part of Allen\u2019s single course of conduct to undermine the union and as such they were sufficiently \u201crelated to\u201d Adkins\u2019 contemporaneous discharge to be raised by the union\u2019s charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Absent this relationship between the particular acts and \u201cother acts\u201d alleged in a charge, a party\u2019s allegations must be pled with factual detail and specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Accordingly, the Board\u2019s order is ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\">. Snipes\u2019 discharge is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-14\">. The Union\u2019s charge was made within six months of the time the violations took place, as required by Section 10(b) of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
