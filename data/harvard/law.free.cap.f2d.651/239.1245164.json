Long, a South Carolina State Senator, appeals his conviction for violating and conspiring to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) and (d). Long assigns the following errors: his Senate seat, described in the indictment as an Office of Senate, was not an \u201centerprise\u201d as defined by the Act; the activities of his office do not affect interstate commerce; the court improperly admitted tapes of recorded conversation; and the jury should not have been furnished transcripts of the tapes. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">Long and Billy Dean Roark, a Senate employee, were charged with accepting bribes, in violation of South Carolina law, paid to induce Long to procure state jobs for the persons who gave the bribes. Roark pled guilty and testified against Long.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">The evidence disclosed the following undisputed facts. Roark urged an acquaintance to buy a state job from Long. This man told an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation about Roark\u2019s suggestion and agreed to act as an informant for the FBI. Wearing a tape recorder, the informant met several times with both Roark and Long, and he paid $700 to Long and $800 to Roark in return for Long\u2019s promise to get him a state job. The informant then introduced Roark and Long to an FBI agent who said he was looking for state employment. The agent also had several meetings with Long and Roark, all of which were taped by a body recorder. At one of thes\u00e9 meetings, the agent paid Long $500 as a down payment for a state job. Although both the informant and the agent obtained interviews with state agencies, including the state Alcohol Beverage Control Commission, neither was given state employment before the grand jury returned the indictments against Roark and Long.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-16\">Roark corroborated the testimony of the informant and the agent. Another witness testified that he had paid Long $1200 in return for a promise of state employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b300-18\">The indictment charges Long with violations of \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c) and (d) of the RICO statute, which state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-19\">(c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>(d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Long claims that the indictment is insufficient because the Office of Senator in the South Carolina legislature is not an \u201centerprise\u201d within the meaning of RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Section 1961(4) of RICO defines \u201centerprise\u201d as \u201cany individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\u201d The indictment charges that \u201c[t]he Office of Senate, District Number 5, Office Number 1 [which Long held] is an \u2018enterprise\u2019 as defined by Title 18, United States Code, Section 1961.\u201d Long claims that the statutory definition of enterprise should not be interpreted so broadly as to encompass the political entity of a state senate seat. He contends that such an expansive definition poses a \u201cthreat of federal control and intimidation over the discretionary acts of a state senator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The Act states that \u201c[t]he provisions of this title [RICO] shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purpose.\u201d Pub.L. No.91-452, \u00a7 904; 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1961 (notes). Complying with this mandate, courts of appeals considering the specific question whether public entities constitute \u201centerprises\u201d have answered affirmatively, holding that such entities as a police department,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a state Bureau of Cigarette and Beverage Taxes,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a city traffic court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are \u201centerprises\u201d within the scope of the RICO statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">One of the few cases holding that a public entity is not an \u201centerprise\u201d is <em>United States v. Mandel, </em>415 F.Supp. 997 (D.Md. 1976). The district court in that case dismissed a RICO count that rested on the allegation that the state of Maryland was an enterprise. Long relies heavily in his brief on <em>Mandel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">The district court\u2019s order in <em>Mandel </em>on the \u201centerprise\u201d issue was not appealed to this court. In two recent RICO cases, however, we have indicated our disapproval of that decision. We have held, in accord with the majority of the cases, that RICO should be construed to include public entities as enterprises. <em>See United States v. Altomare, </em>625 F.2d 5 (4th Cir. 1980) (state prosecutor\u2019s office constitutes an enterprise); <em>United States v. Baker, </em>617 F.2d 1060 (4th Cir. 1980) (sheriff\u2019s department constitutes enterprise).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">Long\u2019s arguments are refuted by the rationale of <em>Baker. </em>There we pointed out that the definition of an enterprise contained in \u00a7 1961(4) did not differentiate between public and private individuals or entities. Moreover, we emphasized that the congressional statement of purpose and findings in the Organized Crime Control Act, of which RICO is a part, denounces racketeering activities because, among other evils, they \u201csubvert and corrupt our democratic processes.\u201d 617 F.2d at 1060, quoting Pub.L.No.91-452 \u00a7 1; 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1961 (notes). Neither the Act nor the courts\u2019 interpretation of it support the contention that its enforcement threatens the discretion state officials must exercise in the discharge of their duties. On the contrary, the definition of \u201cracketeering activity\u201d contained in \u00a7 1961(1) pertinent to Long\u2019s case involves \u201cbribery ... which is chargeable under state law It is the law of South Carolina, not federal law, that places this predicate offense beyond the pale of a senator\u2019s discretion. The Act sustains, rather than threatens, the integrity of the South Carolina Senate.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b301-16\">To establish a violation of the RICO statute, the government must show that the enterprise affects interstate commerce. As our decision in <em>Altomare </em>points out, however, the government need not demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>that the acts of racketeering themselves directly involved interstate commerce. 625 F.2d at 8 n.8. Therefore, it is not necessary for the government to prove that Long\u2019s acceptance of bribes had some effect on interstate commerce. It must only show that the enterprise of a state senate office affects interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">In <em>Altomare, </em>625 F.2d at 8, we held that the enterprise of county prosecutor had sufficient nexus with interstate commerce because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">[t]he record reveals that interstate telephone calls regularly were placed from the prosecutor\u2019s office, that certain of the supplies and materials purchased and used by the prosecutor\u2019s office had their origins outside of West Virginia, and that persons who were not citizens or residents of the State were involved in investigations and litigation conducted by the prosecutor\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The government established that in fulfilling the duties of his office, Long served as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, the Banking and Insurance Committees, and the Labor, Commerce and Industry Committee. He was the chairman of the Senate Invitations Committee. The Clerk of the South Carolina Senate testified that the Finance Committee considered the annual appropriations bill, which for 1979 consisted of approximately 1.5 billion dollars of state funds plus 1.4 billion dollars of federal funds and revenue funds derived from license and gas fees. Funds appropriated by the Finance Committee are used for operating expenses and purchases by state agencies. One such agency is the Alcohol Beverage Control Commission, which is responsible for issuing licenses for the beer, wine, and liquor coming into South Carolina through interstate commerce.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When this cumulative evidence of interstate effect is compared to the evidence in <em>Altomare, </em>we think it plain that there was jurisdiction under the RICO statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">Long claims that the government failed to lay a sufficient foundation for the introduction of the taped recordings of conversations concerning the bribes. Relying on <em>United States v. McKeever, </em>169 F.Supp. 426 (S.D.N.Y., 1958) <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>271 F.2d 669 (2d Cir. 1959),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Long asserts that the government failed to show there had been no changes, additions, or deletions made in the tapes. Long\u2019s brief alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMG\">Yet Appellants presented a very highly accredited expert witness, one who had tested <em>sound </em>tape for the FBI on numerous occasions, who testified under oath, that he had no doubt but that there were splices and erasures in the original tapes. At that point, Appellees presented an FBI agent who had worked with testing sound tape, who stated that any suspicious indications on the tape could be explained by other events than deliberate tampering.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">In <em>Durns v. United States, </em>562 F.2d 542, 547 (8th Cir. 1977), the court explained that the foundation required for admitting tapes was designed to meet the broad goal of insuring that only competent and reliable recorded evidence adverse to the accused is allowed to go to the jury, and the decision to admit or deny evidence in any specific case must be viewed in light of this goal. The FBI agent and the FBI informant both testified that the tapes accurately repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>sented their conversations with Roark and Long. Roark\u2019s testimony corroborated the events revealed by the tapes. Long has presented no evidence suggesting that the tapes misrepresent the conversations, even though Long would be aware of such misrepresentation, at least regarding taped conversations in which he was a participant. Furthermore, the informant, the agent, and Roark were subject to cross-examination. The government adequately proved the other requirements for the admission. We find no error in admitting the tapes, notwithstanding the testimony of Long\u2019s expert witness. <em>See United States v. Albert, </em>595 F.2d 283, 289-90 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Finally, we find no error in the court\u2019s ruling that the jury could be furnished transcripts of the tapes while listening to the recordings. Long\u2019s counsel had been given access to the tapes and transcripts before trial, but his brief does not point out any discrepancies between them. The stenographer who prepared the transcripts was not an essential witness, because the agent responsible for their preparation testified to their accuracy. <em>United States v. Rochan, </em>563 F.2d 1246, 1252 (5th Cir. 1977). The district court properly instructed the jury that if they detected any discrepancy between the transcripts and the tapes, they were to consider as evidence only what they heard on the tapes. The use of typed transcripts as aids to the jury in listening to the tapes is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>United States v. West, 574 </em>F.2d 1131, 1138 (4th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>342 F.2d 849, 853 (4th Cir. 1965). The record contains no suggestion that this discretion was abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\">. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grzywacz, </em>603 F.2d 682 (7th Cir. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\">. <em>United States v.
