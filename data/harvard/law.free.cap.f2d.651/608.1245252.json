Freiberg appeals the district court\u2019s January 8,1981 dismissal of his lawsuit which sought to compel the United States Department of State to intervene on his behalf with officials of the West German Government. The district court concluded it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the case solely presented nonjusticiable political questions and accordingly dismissed the suit pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">The district court correctly dismissed the case on the basis of the political question doctrine. \u201cThe conduct of the foreign relations of our Government is committed by the Constitution to the Executive and Legislative \u2014 \u2018the political\u2019 \u2014 Departments of the Government, and the propriety of what may be done in the exercise of this political power is not subject to judicial inquiry or decision.\u201d <em>Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U.S. </em>297, 302, 38 S.Ct. 309, 310, 62 L.Ed. 726 (1918). <em>See also Logan v. Secretary of State, </em>553 F.2d 107, 108 (D.C.Cir.1976) (per curiam); Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction, </em>\u00a7 3534, pp. 310-13 (1975) (matters dealing with foreign affairs constitute one of the areas in which courts regularly recognize a very broad latitude in the political branches; many questions dealing with treaties likewise are left to executive and legislative disposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">The district court\u2019s dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
