United States, </em>85 Cust.Ct. -, C.D. 4873, 500 F.Supp. 223 (1980), granting the United States\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denying Car-lingswitch\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-21\">This apparently being a case of first impression, we devote substantial discussion to its background and to elucidation of the arguments of both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-22\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b829-23\">Appellant was under investigation in 1974 for allegedly understating the actual costs of certain electrical articles assembled in Mexico from United States products and subsequently imported into the United States. On May 28, 1974, Carlingswitch, through its accountants, voluntarily and without demand paid $41,992.35 to the United States Customs Office in Brownsville, Texas, stating that the funds represented \u201cadditional tariff.\u201d On April 23, 1976, Carlingswitch, through its attorneys, paid the Customs Service an additional $50,-000, designated as \u201cwithheld duties,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-24\">This tender is not to be interpreted as an admission that any particular additional duties are due, that fact not having yet been determined by us. Rather, the tender is made in the spirit of demonstrating our client\u2019s intentions to cooperate fully with your office with respect to the fulfillment of its recognized obligation under the law to pay appropriate duty on its importations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-25\">The trial court stated it to be \u201cundisputed\u201d that the payments were made pursuant to the Customs Service \u201cvoluntary disclosure\u201d practice. That practice, now embodied in 19 CFR 171.1(a), is, briefly, that a voluntary disclosure of violations of the cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>toms laws, accompanied by a deposit of an amount equal to the total loss of revenue to the government will, in specified circumstances, result in mitigation of the penalty to an amount not exceeding the government\u2019s total loss of revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Customs subsequently completed its investigation of appellant and on January 6, 1977, demanded $7,926,778 as forfeiture value on the basis of (1) the undervaluation of the merchandise; (2) false freight figures; and (3) the failure to report the true constructed value figures. Customs notified appellant on June 15, 1979, however, that the statute of limitations had run and that the claim was remitted in its entirety. Appellant requested a refund on June 29,1979, of the $91,992.35 it had paid. That request was denied by Customs which stated that although the statute of limitations had run on the claimed money, the actual revenue loss to the government was $174,573.21, and it assumed that appellant\u2019s voluntary payments were made to cover part of that loss. Appellant filed a protest on October 22, 1979, against this refusal to refund the money, which protest was denied on December 11, 1979. This suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">\n<em>The Trial Court Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ARH\">Carlingswitch contended below that by virtue of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(a)(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which relates to refunds, Customs\u2019 refusal to refund the monies paid amounted to a \u201ccharge or exaction\u201d within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(a)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It further argued that the trial court therefore had jurisdiction over the dispute pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1582,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that its cross-motion for summary judgment should be granted. The government, of course, argued otherwise, and had previously moved for summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">The motion by the government was granted. In support of its decision that it lacked jurisdiction over the case, the trial court cited a number of dictionary definitions of the word \u201cexaction,\u201d concluding that some element of demand or compulsion is necessary for a payment to have been \u201cexacted.\u201d The court further noted that past cases have utilized the term only with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>regard \u201cto actual assessments of specific sums of money.\u201d <em>Alberta Gas Chemicals, Inc. v. Blumenthal, </em>82 Cust.Ct. 77, 81-2, C.D. 4792, 467 F.Supp. 1245, 1249-50 (1979). Accordingly, the court declined to extend the meaning of the word \u201cexaction\u201d to include a refusal to refund money voluntarily paid. The trial court noted, finally, that an appropriate district court, rather than it, had jurisdiction in this type of case (a \u201cpenalty case\u201d) pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1592, citing <em>Sheldon &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>8 Ct.Cust.App. 215, 218, T.D. 37455 (1917); <em>M. M. Scher &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States, </em>24 Cust.Ct. 243, C.D. 1241 (1950); and the Senate Finance Committee Report on H.R. 8149, the Customs Procedural Reform and Simplification Act of 1978 (S.Rep.No.95-778, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 17-21).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Appellant states that the only issue before us \u201cis whether protests will lie against an administrative decision under 19 U.S.C. 1520(a)(3).\u201d In support of its case, appellant asserts that the Court of International Trade, rather than \u201can appropriate district court,\u201d has jurisdiction over the case because it is not a \u201cpenalty case\u201d as that term is typically employed. The usual penalty case is one brought by the government in a district court pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1355 to enforce a claim under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1592 or some related statute, or a case arising under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608. In this case, the penalty has been mooted and there is no issue relating to the merits of the penalty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Appellant contends that the cases cited by the trial court in support of its decision are inapposite. <em>M. M. Scher &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, it argues, spoke of a \u201csum arrived at by the Secretary of the Treasury in mitigation of the penalty fixed by law under the provisions of section 592 of the Tariff Act of 1930,\u201d clearly not the case here, and jurisdiction was proscribed in <em>Sheldon &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>supra, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-8\">If the moneys received by the collector were paid to him as a representative of the United States attorney, or in compromise of a threatened suit in forfeiture and not in satisfaction of duties or of a customs fee, charge, or exaction, then no relief can be granted the importers in this proceeding * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">Thus, the latter opinion also has no relevance, appellant says, because in this case monies were paid in \u201csatisfaction of duties.\u201d The Senate Report relied on by the trial court relates, it is said, only to government suits to enforce penalty claims, \u201ci. e., suits relating to the merits of such claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"An3\">Appellant also asserts that \u201cevery other decision under 19 USC 1520 is protestable, and it would seem unlikely that the legislature would have intended that only 1520(a)(3) be singled out for denial of review by the [trial court].\u201d Appellant says that \u00a7 1514 should be interpreted broadly to cover such a decision \u201cin one or more of its categories. The courts have not hesitated to so interpret section 1514 when justice has required that review be available.\u201d <em>See, e. g., United States v. C. J. Tower &amp; Sons of Buffalo, Inc., </em>61 CCPA 90, C.A.D. 1129, 499 F.2d 1277 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">Additionally, appellant argues that, although the trial court felt it was \u201cundisputed,\u201d the payment of money was not made pursuant to the \u201cvoluntary disclosure\u201d practice. The initial deposit was made only after a Customs audit \u201cdisclosed\u201d alleged duty deficiencies and payment was demanded. The second deposit was made after a formal investigation was commenced, thus negating \u201cvoluntary disclosure\u201d under the Customs Regulations referenced by the trial court. As further support for this conclusion, appellant notes that there \u201cis nothing in the letters accompanying the deposits reflecting any disclosure of violation of 19 U.S.C. 1592.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">In any event, even if the deposits were made pursuant to \u201cvoluntary disclosure,\u201d appellant contends they were obviously deposited \u201con account of a [potential] penalty\u201d as contemplated by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(aX3). Further, since mitigation of a penalty is dependent upon payment of monies, these must be characterized as \u201cexac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>tions.\u201d The word \u201cdeposited\u201d in \u00a7 1520(aX3) is not qualified and it must be assumed that it refers to <em>duties </em>or <em>other receipts </em>deposited on account of penalty. Whether that money is voluntarily tendered or exacted is not made a condition therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">It is also argued by appellant that the deposits in this case may be charged as duties as that term is used in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(aX2).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Lastly, appellant questions what would happen in a case where money was tendered pursuant to a voluntary disclosure and Customs subsequently found no violation. Does not Customs have the authority to refund the voluntary deposit under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(a)(3)?</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">\n<em>Appellee\u2019s Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">The government argues that we should adopt the decision of the trial court that a refusal to refund monies voluntarily deposited does not constitute a \u201ccharge or exaction\u201d under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(aX3). In addition to repeating the court\u2019s reasoning, ap-pellee states that it has been held that customs duties are outside the scope of \u00a7 1514(aX3) and that a demand for payment of duties found due is not an exaction under which a 1514 protest may be filed. If this is so, then neither can a tender labeled as \u201cwithheld duties\u201d be a protestable \u201cexaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Further, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(a)(2) specifically provides for refunds of \u201cfees, charges, or exactions, <em>other than duties and taxes * </em>Congress thus clearly did not intend that customs duties be considered a charge or exaction. This distinction in \u00a7 1520 between duties and charges or exactions should apply with equal force to \u00a7 1514.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The government says the inference by appellant that the monies were deposited on the basis of an underlying demand by the Customs Service, i. e., that they were deposited on account of a fine, penalty or forfeiture, is erroneous. In an affidavit, William F. Bums, Director of Classification and Value for the Customs District of Laredo, Texas, stated, \u201cAt the time the above monies were tendered, there was no fine, penalty, or forfeiture asserted against Carling-switch, Inc., although the question of the proper duties owed by that firm was a matter under investigation over a period of time, resulting in the subsequent assessment of a penalty * * * on January 6,1977, in the amount of $7,926,778.00.\u201d Accordingly, appellee concludes that both payments by appellant were completely voluntary and without demand. The remission of the subsequent penalty did not alter the fact that the payments in issue were tendered as \u201cwithheld duties\u201d to ensure that the government was not deprived of its rightful duties, and in no way inferred that Customs believed an underpayment had not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Additionally, appellee asserts that appellant\u2019s characterization of the payments as \u201cduties\u201d constitutes an admission that the payments were not \u201cexactions,\u201d \u201ccharges\u201d or \u201cmoney deposited on account of fine, penalty, or forfeiture,\u201d although appellant seems to want it both ways. Appellee concludes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-12\">In any event, the holding of the trial court that this was a \u201cpenalty case\u201d is not crucial to the outcome of this appeal. The holding of the court was essentially the predicate upon which the denial of appellant\u2019s motion to amend its complaint was based. It is uncontroverted that appellant\u2019s payments were completely voluntary and were made without compulsion. Accordingly, the record supports the finding of the trial court that there was no \u201cexaction\u201d within the meaning of Section 514(a)(3), <em>supra. </em>It is thus unnecessary to reach the question as to whether this action was a \u201cpenalty case\u201d and whether the Court of International Trade had jurisdiction to hear the action on that ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">As related above, appellant argues that although this is not \u201ca penalty case,\u201d the deposit given the Customs Service was \u201con account of a potential penalty\u201d and, thus, falls within the type of \u201cmoney\u201d referred to in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(a)(3). Furthermore, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>pellant argues that the <em>refusal </em>to refund the deposit, paid \u201cin satisfaction of duties,\u201d should be characterized as a \u201ccharge or exaction\u201d as those words are used in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">We agree with the government that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over this dispute under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1582(a)(3) (1977). (Hiere would be no purpose in restating the rationale, supra, which leads us, as it did the court below, to conclude that a refusal to refund payments (which allegedly should be refunded pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(aX3)) does not constitute a \u201ccharge or exaction\u201d as that term is used in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(a)(3). <em>Alberta Gas Chemicals, Inc. v. Blumenthal, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Appellant alleges it is in dispute whether these payments were made \u201cvoluntarily and without demand,\u201d a fact the trial court apparently utilized to hold that there was no \u201ccharge or exaction.\u201d Edward F. Rosen-thal, an attorney for appellant, states in an affidavit that the payments were made only after appellant discovered that it was under investigation and entered into \u201cnegotiations with [Customs].\u201d It is the <em>refusal to refund </em>which appellant alleges to be a \u201ccharge or exaction,\u201d however, not the two <em>payments </em>made to the Customs Service (otherwise appellant would have argued that the money should be refunded pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(a)(2), which relates to \u201cFees, charges, and exactions\u201d). That a refusal to refund money is not a \u00a7 1514 \u201ccharge or exaction\u201d is the basis upon which we affirm the decision granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Additionally, we disagree with the theory that the payments made by appellant should have been refunded pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(a)(3). That section refers to monies paid \u201con account of a fine, penalty, or forfeiture,\u201d none of which had been charged against appellant at the time of the payments in question. The monies were deposited as \u201cadditional tariff\u201d and as \u201cwithheld duties\u201d to <em>alleviate </em>any <em>potential </em>penalty. The two concepts are not equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">In support of its conclusion that it did not have the authority to hear this dispute, the trial court stated this to be a \u201cpenalty ease\u201d over which the federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction, citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1592. That section, however, is not a jurisdictional statute and we assume the court was referring to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1355, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-13\">1355. <em>Fine, penalty or forfeiture</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuVO\">The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of any action or proceeding for the recovery or enforcement of any fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, incurred under any Act of Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ano-dedup-0\">Noting our previous characterization of appellant\u2019s payments, we cannot regard these monies as for a \u201cfine, penalty, or forfeiture * * *.\u201d Additionally, the Customs Service procedure known as \u201cvoluntary disclosure,\u201d if that is what appellant\u2019s payments may be said to have been paid under, is not one which may properly be labeled as an \u201cAct of Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">As a policy matter, appellant posits, \u201cWhat happens when, for example, the subsequent investigation contemplated by the Regulations results in a determination that no violation has occurred, and no additional duty is due?\u201d In other words, how does one get money back if Customs refuses to refund it?</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">Notwithstanding that appellant has argued that its payments were <em>not </em>pursuant to \u201cvoluntary disclosure,\u201d it is apparently trying to impress upon us that the decision on appeal may \u201cchill\u201d participation in \u201cvoluntary disclosure,\u201d thus defeating the public policy behind this procedure, which is to encourage those who have violated the law to disclose such violation and make appropriate restitution to the government. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>true that because the statutory period for collection of the penalty has passed, appellant may not now contest with Customs, as a <em>defendant, </em>the correctness of the imposition of that penalty or the underlying undervaluation determination. Our decision, however, is limited to holding that, since appellant\u2019s only arguments are that \u201con account of penalty\u201d in \u00a7 1520(a)(3) should be construed to mean \u201cto alleviate any potential penalty,\u201d and that the <em>refusal to refund </em>monies paid should be characterized as a \u201ccharge or exaction\u201d as those terms are used in \u00a7 1514(a)(3), with which arguments we disagree, summary judgment was properly entered against appellant by the court below and its judgment is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-5\">. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520(a)(3) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">(a) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to refund duties or other receipts in the following cases: * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-8\">(3) Fines, penalties, and forfeitures.\u2014 Whenever money has been deposited in the Treasury on account of a fine, penalty, or forfeiture which did not accrue, or which is finally determined to have accrued in an amount less than that so deposited, or which is mitigated to an amount less than that so deposited or is remitted.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-9\">. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514 reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-10\">\u25a0 (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, section 1501 of this title (relating to voluntary reliquidations), section 1516 of this title (relating to petitions by domestic interested parties as defined in section 1677(9)(C), (D), and (E) of this title), section 1520 of this title (relating to refunds and errors), and section 1521 of this title (relating to reliquidations on account of fraud), decisions of the appropriate customs officer, including the legality of all orders and findings entering into the same, as to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-11\">(1) the appraised value of merchandise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-12\">(2) the classification and rate and amount of duties chargeable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-16\">(3) all charges or exactions of whatever character within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Treasury; * * * * sfc *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-18\">shall be final and conclusive upon all persons (including the United States and any officer thereof) unless a protest is filed in accordance with this section, or unless a civil action contesting the denial of a protest, in whole or in part, is commenced in the United States Court of International Trade in accordance with chapter 169 of Title 28 within the time prescribed by section 2636 of that title.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b830-19\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1582, which delineates the jurisdiction of the Customs Court (now the Court of International Trade) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-20\">(a) The Customs Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions instituted by any person whose protest pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, has been denied, in whole or in part, by the appropriate customs officer, where the administrative decision, including the legality of all orders and findings entering into the same, involves: (1) the appraised value of merchandise; (2) the classification and rate and amount of duties chargeable; (3) all <em>charges or exac-tions </em>of whatever character within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Treasury; * *.
