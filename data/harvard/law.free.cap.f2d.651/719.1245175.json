The district court affirmed the Secretary\u2019s decision without opinion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-22\">Mrs. Tsosie is the disabled widow of a veteran, living with five of her nine children. She received a surviving spouse pension from the Veterans\u2019 Administration (VA) of $227 a month, which includes $118 per month because of the five children in her custody. If Tsosie had lived alone, without her children, she would have been eligible for a total of $109 a month. It is undisputed that Tsosie uses the additional funds to meet the needs of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-23\">Prior to 1977, Tsosie also received SSI benefits because of her disability. SSI is a federal income maintenance program administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 <em>et seq. </em>Persons are eligible for SSI benefits if they are aged, blind, or disabled and if their income and resources fall below certain specified levels. <em>See Id. </em>\u00a7 1382(a), (b), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-24\">In January 1977, the SSA terminated Tsosie\u2019s SSI benefits on the ground that she had income in excess of the then existing statutory limit of $167.80 per month. The SSA calculated Tsosie\u2019s monthly income to be $254<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a figure which included the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>VA surviving spouse pension received by Tsosie.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Tsosie requested and received reconsideration by the SSA of its decision to terminate her SSI benefits,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but her claim was denied. At her hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, she argued that the $118 in VA pension benefits she received because she has children in her custody should be counted as her children\u2019s income, rather than her own. If the $118 had not been treated as hers, her income would have been below the statutory limit and she would have remained eligible for SSI benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Administrative Law Judge held that the entire VA pension was countable as her income and that Tsosie was not eligible for further SSI benefits due to excessive income. This decision became the final decision of the Secretary, affirmed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The sole issue in this case is whether the SSA may properly count the portion of the VA surviving spouse pension Tsosie receives on account of her children as income to her in determining her eligibility for SSI benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Tsosie claim's that to attribute the portion of the VA pension paid to her because of her children violates both the letter and the spirit of the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 <em>et seq., </em>defeats the purpose of the Social Security Act, and constitutes a denial of equal protection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">The Secretary responds that the language of the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act and accompanying regulations indicates that money paid to a surviving spouse on account of children is intended to be the spouse\u2019s income, not the children\u2019s. The Secretary notes that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 541 refers to a pension \u201cto the surviving spouse,\u201d not to the child; that although the VA does provide for apportionment or direct payment to the child, it does so only when the child is not in the surviving spouse\u2019s custody, <em>see </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.450(a)(2), or when there is no surviving spouse, <em>see </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 542; and that there is no sanction or penalty requiring a surviving spouse to use any part of the pension on behalf of the spouse\u2019s children. Accordingly, the Secretary asserts that the entire pension is to be treated as Tsosie\u2019s \u201cincome\u201d under the Social Security Act, because it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>money \u201cactually available\u201d to her. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.1102, .1120.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the Secretary asserts that we must give his interpretation a strong presumption of validity because great deference is to be accorded an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">We agree with the principle that a court should accord substantial weight to the interpretation given a statute or regulation by the agency charged with administering it. <em>See Miller v. Youakim, </em>440 U.S. 125, 144, 99 S.Ct. 957, 969, 59 L.Ed.2d 194 (1979); <em>Board of Directors &amp; Officers, Forbes Federal Credit Union v. National Credit Union Administration, </em>477 F.2d 777, 784 (10th Cir. 1973). But this principle has limited application here. The Secretary\u2019s determination that Tsosie\u2019s entire VA pension is to be treated as her income under the Social Security Act turns almost completely on his reading of the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act and VA regulations. The Secretary\u2019s construction is not entitled to special deference to the extent it rests on the interpretation of another agency\u2019s statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We find the Secretary\u2019s interpretation unduly legalistic and technical. It relies on the literal meaning of isolated phrases. Little weight is given to the purpose and spirit of the voluminous rules from which the phrases have been lifted. The Secretary is like one who listens to music for individual notes rather than for the melody: he misses the theme.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">It is evident the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act intends that the money sent a surviving spouse on account of children in the spouse\u2019s custody be spent on the children. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 541, the amount the surviving spouse receives increases with each additional child in the spouse\u2019s custody. If the spouse becomes ineligible for pension payments because of excess income, the child\u2019s portion still continues to be paid. <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.257. If the child is not in the surviving spouse\u2019s custody, the pension otherwise payable to the spouse may be apportioned. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3107(b); 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.450(a)(2). Thus, the whole statutory scheme is structured so as to increase the spouse\u2019s pension income according to the number of children in his or her custody. There would be no reason for doing so if the extra money were not to be spent on the children\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">Even though the entire pension is generally \u201cpaid to the surviving spouse\u201d when the children are in the spouse\u2019s custody, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(b), (c), we do not agree with the Secretary\u2019s contention that this means the spouse is free to spend the children\u2019s portion of the pension payment however the spouse chooses. While \u201c[t]he additional benefits for such dependents will be paid to the ... widow,\u201d they are <em>\u201cfor </em>such dependents.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.450(c) (emphasis added). 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 543(a)(2) provides that when the corpus of a \u201cchild\u2019s estate is such that under all the circumstances ... it is reasonable that some part of the corpus of the child\u2019s estate be <em>consumed for the child\u2019s maintenance,\u201d </em>the additional pension benefits paid the surviving spouse on account of the child are to be denied or discontinued. (Emphasis added). Analogously, the regulations provide that amounts payable to a surviving spouse for a child in his custody but residing with someone else may be apportioned if the surviving spouse <em>\u201cis not reasonably contributing to the child\u2019s support.\u201d </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.450(e) (emphasis added). The regulations also state that \u201c[n]o apportionment will be made where the ... widow <em>... is providing </em>for dependents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3.450(c) (emphasis added). By negative implication, apportion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>ment will occur where the surviving spouse is failing to provide for the dependents. More specifically, the VA regulations provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">\u201cWithout regard to any other provision regarding apportionment where hardship is shown to exist, pension .. . may be specially apportioned between ... the widow and children on the basis of the facts in the individual case .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3.451. Thus, if the surviving spouse creates hardship by failing to care for the children, the spouse\u2019s pension is subject to apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Congress may have chosen to pay both the children\u2019s and the parent\u2019s share to the parent for reasons of administrative convenience, with subsequent apportionment if hardship results. Since the surviving spouse is presumably the person providing for the needs of the children in the spouse's custody, it is simpler to send the money directly to the parent. Moreover, the assumption underlying the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act may be that children are not mature enough to determine how to wisely utilize their pension benefits. The VA regulations do provide for payment to the child when he or she reaches the age of majority. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3.403.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Since the structure of the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act and regulations indicates that the children\u2019s portion of a surviving spouse\u2019s pension check is intended for the children\u2019s needs, it is not consonant with the purpose of either the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act or the Social Security Act to treat those funds as the spouse\u2019s income. The payee of the check should not be determinative. If the money is to be used for the children, it is not the spouse\u2019s income, for it is not money \u201cwhich he can apply ... to meeting his basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1102(a). Nor is it \u201cactually available\u201d in any meaningful sense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">The Sixth Circuit has agreed with the conclusion we reach here. <em>See Webster v. Califano, </em>No. 78-3492 (6th Cir. July 10, 1980) (order affirming No. C-l-77-152 (S.D.Ohio June 12, 1978)). We prefer this construction to the \u201coverly legalistic interpretation\u201d adopted by the Ninth Circuit. <em>Whaley v. Harris, </em>641 F.2d 775 at 778 (9th Cir. 1981) (Hug, J., dissenting). Our interpretation will result in consistent treatment of VA and AFDC benefits by the SSA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It also comports with the basic purpose of the Social Security Act: aiding the very needy. As we stated in <em>Rasmussen v. Gardner, </em>374 F.2d 589, 594 (10th Cir. 1967), \u201c[t]he congressional policy underlying federal social security legislation requires the courts to interpret the Act liberally, and any doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-16\">. This sum consisted of the $227 per month from the Veterans\u2019 Administration pension and $47 per month in Social Security widow\u2019s benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq., </em>less the $20 per month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>exclusion provided under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382a(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-9\">. The SSA also assessed an overpayment for benefits previously received. This was subsequently waived, however, so it is not an issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\">. Under plaintiffs theory, she was entitled to $31.80 per month in SSI benefits at the time the SSA deemed her ineligible for further benefits. The $31.80 figure is calculated by subtracting the $109 in VA benefits Tsosie concedes is her income and the $47 in widow\u2019s benefits from the statutory limit of $167.80, after allowing for the $20 exclusion. Tsosie claims she is currently entitled to $53.50 per month because the statutory limit has been raised to $189.50 a month. Brief for Appellant at 4 n.l. In addition, Tsosie points out that under New Mexico law, the loss of SSI benefits results in the loss of automatic medicaid coverage. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b781-11\">. The issue in this case is to be distinguished from the one present in <em>Hammond v. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, </em>646 F.2d 455 (10th Cir. 1981). There the question was whether the income of a stepfather is to be attributed to a minor child in determining the <em>child\u2019s </em>eligibility for SSI benefits. Income of a parent is attributed to the child \u201cwhether or not such Income is available to the child.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1185(b). Here the question is whether money paid to a surviving spouse on account of her children is to be attributed to the surviving spouse in determining the <em>spouse\u2019s </em>eligibility for SSI benefits. Income is attributed to a surviving spouse only if it is \u201cactually available\u201d to the individual. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1120.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b781-16\">. Tsosie bases her equal protection argument on the fact that the SSA does apportion benefits received by a parent under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 <em>et seq. </em>In determining an AFDC parent\u2019s eligibility for SSI, the Secretary counts as the parent\u2019s income only the portion of the AFDC check attributable to the parent. Tsosie claims that the different treatment of AFDC income and VA pension income irrationally discriminates against widows and children who receiving VA pensions. Since we can dispose of Tsosie\u2019s claim on other grounds, we do not reach the constitutional issue. See <em>United States v. Clark, </em>445 U.S. 23, 27, 100 S.Ct. 895, 899, 63 L.Ed.2d 171 (1980); <em>Califano v.
