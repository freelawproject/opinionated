Ray, 266 Pa. 345; New York &amp; Penna. Co. v. New York Central R. R. Co., 267 Pa. 64), it is not necessary to consider separately the thirty-one assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Restricting ourselves, therefore, to the period between 1877 and 1904, we find but three witnesses testified regarding the use of the alley during that period. One of them said that, from 1877, when he was twelve years old, he used the alley during six or seven years to visit his playmates in each property, and that the alley gates opening therefrom were never closed. He does not say how often he used the alley, or whether by permission or otherwise; and since neither he nor his parents owned or lived in either house, his testimony is of little value in solving the question at issue. Another, who was a daughter of a former owner of plaintiffs property, and moved thereon about 1879, when she was two years old, and left when she was twenty-one, says she never saw nor heard of the gate into defendants\u2019 property being nailed up; that she went \u201cquite often\u201d from her father\u2019s yard to that now owned by defendants, and we \u201cnever had any question with any of our neighbors. We were always friendly\u201d; but she could not tell how old she was when she first remembered the gate, could not say it was there in 1884, or whether it was opened at that time simply as a friendly act for their then neighbors. Nor does she tell of any user by defendants or their predecessors in title or by any one other than herself, and she, as a daughter of the owner of the alley, had a right to use it. The third was the mother of the last witness. She says the gate into defendants\u2019 property was already there in 1877 when she and her family moved into plaintiffs property, and it continued there during the succeeding thirty years; that it was never locked, and was used by the occupants of defendants\u2019 property during that period, without any disturbance regarding it; that its use was not discussed; that when they sold to plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>tiff she told him that \u201cif anybody should be disagreeable and a nuisance Mr. Ulmer says you could fasten the gate up if you wanted to. But we never had any trouble\u201d; that this was her understanding of vt.he right existing in the owner of plaintiff\u2019s property, but they never had occasion to object to the use; she remembered on one occasion being asked by an occupant df defendants\u2019 property to be allowed to use it, and gave permission to him and also, at other times, to other tenants,\u2014the others, however, did not ask permission, but she told them the \u201calleyway Was for the use of both parties......as long as there was no trouble.\u201d She does not say how often it was iised, and it is evident from her testimony, which was somewhat confused and contradictory, probably because of her advanced years, that, there was ample from which the court could find that such use as was made by defendants\u2019 predecessors in title, or their tenants, was permissive and not adverse; and, in any event, it does not compel the conclusion that defendants had successfully sustained the burden of proof of showing open, notorious, adverse and continuous possession for twenty-one years consecutively by any one connected with defendants\u2019 property, especially when taken in connection with the other findings above referred to, and the fact that the trial judge had the benefit of seeing the last mentioned witness, and could, therefore, best judge what credence, if any, should be given to her varying statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">It is clear, therefore, we could not reverse the court below on this vital point without doing violence to our oft expressed rule that \u201cThe findings of fact by a judge, -which involves the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, will be given the effect of a verdict of a jury, and will not be disturbed where there is testimony to support them\u201d (Cruzan v. Cruzan, 243 Pa. 165; Shimer v. Aldine Trust Co., 264 Pa. 444; Gongaware\u2019s Est., 265 Pa. 512, 515); and this we are not willing to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The decree of the court below is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed at the cost of appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
