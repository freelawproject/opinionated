Stahl.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">On February 4, 1964, Jacobs became involved in an argument with Stahl at \u201cMary\u2019s Bar,\u201d at Pratt and Wolfe Streets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>in Baltimore City over a shuffle board game. Both men had been drinking and Mary Krupa, the proprietress, to avoid any trouble at her place, asked Jacobs if he had a knife. Jacobs indicated that he had and the proprietress asked Jacobs to give it to her. He did this. The proprietress had been warned by a witness, Donald Canning, to \u201cbreak it up\u201d as \u201cshe was going to have some trouble.\u201d Canning testified that he had heard Jacobs call Stahl a foul name and state that if Stahl would \u201c \u2018slip out the door I\u2019ll cut you\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ll cut you fast\u2019 or words to that effect.\u201d This argument, however, was confined to verbal abuse. Stahl and others left \u201cMary\u2019s Bar\u201d and, with others, went over to \u201cSophie\u2019s Bar\u201d at Pratt and Durham Streets, near \u201cMary\u2019s Bar.\u201d Stahl played one or two games of shuffle board with Canning and ordered a beer and a bowl of soup. Fifteen to twenty minutes later Jacobs left \u201cMary\u2019s Bar\u201d, after first receiving back his knife from the proprietress of that bar, and entered \u201cSophie\u2019s Bar.\u201d Immediately thereafter the argument between Jacobs and Stahl began again and there was more verbal abuse of Stahl by Jacobs. Miss Sophie, the proprietress of Sophie\u2019s Bar told Jacobs she wanted no trouble and he would have to leave. He then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">There is some variation in the testimony in jregard to how soon Stahl left Sophie\u2019s Bar after Jacobs had gone out. Miss Sophie testified \u201cHe was eating, he was in the place at least fifteen minutes, maybe more, maybe longer.\u201d Jacobs indicated that it was almost immediately, but when questioned by the trial court that \u201cit wasn\u2019t fifteen minutes as they say?\u201d, Jacobs replied \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Canning indicated that Stahl was eating his soup and \u201cwas pretty hot,\u201d and \u201cshortly after that, I thought it was almost immediately, but it must have been some time involved, shortly after that he went outside.\u201d Jacobs was waiting on the outside, called Stahl a foul name, whereupon Stahl hit Jacobs twice and knocked him down. One of the blows fractured Jacob\u2019s nose. Jacobs then cut Stahl with his knife. The wounds required over 300 stitches to close. Stahl was approximately 50 pounds heavier and three inches taller than Jacobs. When Jacobs was asked on cross-examination why he didn\u2019t run, he replied \u201cI guess I was mad, I guess.\u201d When asked \u201cThen you intended to cut him, did you not? You <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>wanted to get even with him, didn\u2019t you\u201d? Jacobs replied \u201cYes, sir, I guess so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Judge Harlan concluded that the evidence established that Jacobs was lying in wait for Stahl outside of \u201cSophie\u2019s Bar\u201d and in view of the prior threats and the whole situation, Jacobs had made the assault with intent to murder Stahl, and found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">We are of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. In view of the prior threat to \u201ccut him and cut him fast,\u201d and the fact that Jacobs was waiting for Stahl when he left \u201cSophie\u2019s Bar\u201d after the passage of some substantial amount of time (the trial court resolved this issue of fact against Jacobs), Stahl was entitled to believe he was in apparent imminent or immediate danger of death or serious bodily harm from his potential assailant and was entitled to take such action as he deemed necessary to protect himself. <em>Guerriero v. State, </em>213 Md. 545, 132 A. 2d 466 (1957). Stahl was justified under these circumstances in striking the first blow, as Jacobs was the aggressor in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">We have said many times, that when the evidence is conflicting, its determination is for the trier of facts and where the case is tried before the trial court, without a jury, the trial court\u2019s \u201cjudgment will not be set aside on the evidence unless clearly erroneous and due regard will be given to the opportunity of the lower court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Maryland Rule 886a. See <em>Johnson v. State, </em>237 Md. 283, 291, 206 A. 2d 138, 143 (1965) and cases therein cited. It is clear to us that upon this record we cannot find that the trial court\u2019s determination of the facts is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
