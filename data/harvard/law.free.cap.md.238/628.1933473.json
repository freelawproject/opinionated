The only question presented is whether he was convicted on the uncorroborated testimony of accomplices. If we assume, without deciding, that the witness McGowan was an accomplice, there was ample corroborative testimony to support appellant\u2019s conviction. The witness Finklestein definitely was not an accomplice, and his testimony, together with that of the other witnesses adduced by the State, was sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">\n<em>Judgment and sentence affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
