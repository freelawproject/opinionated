As filed, the transcript shows that after Judge Harris had told the jury he had ruled admissible statements made to Uieutenant McKew by Melvin (the man the appellant sought to persuade the jury was the rapist) he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">\u201cSome of this testimony by him is obviously hearsay \u2014the statements made to him by Melvin. Those alleged statements were admitted by me only for the purpose of aiding you in judging whether or not the police were justified in arresting and holding the defendants in this case. That testimony, in and of itself, has nothing whatsoever to do with guilt or innocence of the defendant in this case; although you may consider the effect of Melvin\u2019s statement as well as the defendant\u2019s statement in arriving at your verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-12\">\u201cMy purpose in making this statement to you is to emphasize that any testimony in the nature of hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>say, told by Melvin t0' the lieutenant, bears upon only the issue of arrest and upon the issue of the guilt or innocence of the defendant in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Judge Harris has certified that the second paragraph of the portion of his charge quoted above was, as delivered, actually the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cMy purpose in making this statement to you is to emphasize that any testimony in the nature of hearsay, told by Melvin to the lieutenant, bears upon only the issue of arrest and <em>not </em>upon the issue of the guilt or innocence of the defendant in this case.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\u2014that is, that the italicized word \u201cnot\u201d had preceded the words \u201cupon the issue of the guilt or innocence of the defendant in this case.\u201d The court stenographer, under oath, supports the recollection of Judge Harris by deposing that his original notes show that Judge Harris, in delivering the charge, used the word \u201cnot\u201d as indicated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The appellant has moved to correct the record and for a re-argument. The Attorney General has consented to the correction of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The motion to correct has been granted and the motion for reargument denied, and we deem it appropriate to indicate the reason for the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">In the opinion, in answer to appellant\u2019s contention that the charge of the court\u2014to which he made no specific objection or request for change at the trial\u2014ignored his theory that Melvin was the man who had raped Mrs. Kelly, we said of the part of the charge quoted above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">\u201cWe think it clear that Judge Harris meant\u2014and that the jury would have known that he so meant\u2014 that Melvin\u2019s confession alone could not incriminate Dyson and that what Melvin had told the police was not \u2018in and of itself\u2019 evidence against Dyson, but that the Melvin confession bore upon whether the police and the prosecutor rightly and accurately had chosen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>between two suspects, and, therefore, bore upon Dyson\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">This reading, interpretation and effect of the charge as originally filed in the transcript are equally applicable to the charge as corrected. The court\u2019s statement that the hearsay in Melvin\u2019s confession bore only upon the matter of arrest \u201cand not upon the guilt or innocence of the defendant in this case\u201d must be considered in the context of his entire instructions on the point, including his immediately prior statements that Melvin\u2019s confession \u201cin and of itself has nothing to do with guilt or innocence of the defendant in this case,\u201d but that \u201cyou may consider the effect of Melvin\u2019s statement as well as the defendant\u2019s statement in arriving at your verdict.\u201d Thus, as we said originally, \u201cThese instructions did give recognition to the appellant\u2019s theory that Melvin was the only guilty man and aided the jury in accepting or rejecting, as they did, that theory.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
