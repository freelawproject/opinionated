Greene did not appeal from his conviction, but in 1964, he filed a petition for relief under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, which petition was denied by Judge Keating. His application for leave to appeal does not even colorably comply with Maryland Rule BK46(b) which requires a brief statement of the reasons why the order of the lower court should be reversed or modified; and our cases make it clear that the application may be dismissed on this ground alone; <em>Ransom v. Warden, </em>236 Md. 639 (1964) ; <em>Dofflemeyer v. Director, 237 </em>Md. 639 (1965); <em>Taylor v. Warden, </em>238 Md. 645 (1965). Cf. <em>Murel v. Director, </em>231 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>661 (1963); <em>Mumford v. Director, </em>237 Md. 637 (1965), and <em>Bowyer v. Warden, </em>237 Md. 644 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The only point developed at the hearing below was the claim that, since Greene was apprehended by the police with a bushel basket of the stolen goods in his possession, while still on the premises of the owner of the goods, the State must necessarily have failed to prove the \u201casportation\u201d element of the crime of \u201cstealing\u201d (i.e., larceny). But the guilt or innocence of the crime of which a post-conviction applicant stands convicted, and the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain such conviction, are issues which we have repeatedly held are not available in a post-conviction proceeding. <em>Fisher v.
