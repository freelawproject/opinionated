Five of the six contentions urged below have been abandoned in this application and the applicant only presses his first contention which he considers to have been erroneously decided against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The applicant\u2019s contention is that the protections afforded under the Due Process provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution have been violated because, at the applicant\u2019s criminal trial on December 14, 1961, a witness for the State, who gave testimony damaging to the applicant\u2019s case, was known by the State to be the son of one of the jurors. No objection was entered by the applicant at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>time during the trial. The applicant\u2019s counsel only knew of the relationship when the witness was called upon to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">We grant leave to appeal, limited to the above question.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">\n<em>Application Granted. The records of the Circuit Court for Cecil County in Criminal Trial No. 713 and Law No. 5555 are to he incorporated into the record on appeal. The applicants motion to proceed as an indigent and for the appointment of counsel is granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
