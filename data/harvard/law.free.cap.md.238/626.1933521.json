Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">First he said that the suit belonged to him; then he stated that it belonged to his uncle; finally, he explained that it belonged to an acquaintance who was too young to pawn it himself. The lower court, as the trier of fact, rejected the credibility of any of the stories told by the appellant and, finding that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>not met the burden cast upon him of giving a reasonable explanation of his possession of the suit, <em>Oden v. State, </em>223 Md. 244, entered a verdict of guilty as charged. Since it is apparent that the lower court was not wrong, the judgment will not be set aside. <em>Graczyk v.
