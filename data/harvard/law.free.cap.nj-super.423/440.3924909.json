The inmate, Eduardo McLaughlin, alleges violations of the Civil Rights Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:6-1 to 6-2, and the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:1-1 to 12-3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tubby and Rodriguez appeal from the Attorney General\u2019s decisions denying them legal representation in McLaughlin\u2019s civil action pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:10A-1 to -2. Because the underlying facts and legal issues are the same, we consolidate the appeals. We reverse the denials, because they lack adequate support in the record as a whole and do not address the controlling legal principles. <em>Prado v. State, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>413, 427, 895 A.2d 1154 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The incident that is the subject of McLaughlin\u2019s civil claims against Tubby, Rodriguez and the other corrections officers occurred on May 14, 2008. As a consequence of the encounter, McLaughlin was admitted to the infirmary and treated for multiple injuries that included three wounds on the back of his head which had to be sutured, abrasions on his right arm and back, bruises on his upper torso and a closed head injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">The trouble started when the alarm on a metal detector sounded as McLaughlin passed through on his way to another area of the correctional facility. As directed, he walked through the detector again; this time he did not set off the alarm. Nevertheless, McLaughlin was frisked. By his account, his pants were pulled up above his knees, and when he questioned the necessity for the roughness, the officer grabbed his testicles. McLaughlin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>claims that in response to his objection to the touching, another officer called him a name and said McLaughlin would have enjoyed the contact if he were on the street. McLaughlin remarked that the offensive moniker better fit the officer who grabbed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">After McLaughlin left the area of the metal detector, officers followed him through the doors and directed him to stop and submit to a second frisk in the hallway beyond. That hallway is out of the range of the security camera that captured the first frisk. There, McLaughlin faced the wall and placed his hands on the wall above his head. According to him, during the frisk one of the officers choked him, which led him to turn away from the wall. He was then hit on the head twice and fell to the ground where an officer he named, not Rodriguez or Tubby, kicked him in the head and other unnamed officers struck him with \u201csticks\u201d on the right side of his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">According to the officers who provided information about the second frisk and the struggle that followed, McLaughlin was hostile, took his hands from the wall, made a fist and violent and threatening gestures, and resisted efforts to restrain him. One of them admitted that batons were \u201cflying\u201d in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Tubby and Rodriguez admitted using their batons. Tubby was present from the time that McLaughlin first passed through the metal detector. He explained that when he saw McLaughlin take his hands off the wall during the second frisk, he turned to tell another officer to call a code. When he looked back, McLaughlin and the other officers were on the floor; accordingly, he joined the group and struck McLaughlin with his baton three or four times in the area of his thighs while McLaughlin was on the floor. Rodriguez arrived as the second frisk was ordered. He saw McLaughlin try to grab another officer, and he admits to hitting McLaughlin once in the leg with his baton before McLaughlin fell to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The accounts given by the various officers were not entirely consistent, but it is fair to say that someone crediting the versions least favorable to Tubby and Rodriguez could conclude that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>each hit McLaughlin on the head with a baton before he was taken to the floor. Specifically, one officer asserts that he was hit in the hand with a baton and that batons came over his shoulders from positions where he had seen Tubby and Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Following the incident, the DOC took action against McLaughlin and several corrections officers, including Tubby and Rodriguez. An investigator from the DOC\u2019s special investigation division (SID) prepared a report, from which the facts stated above are drawn. The DOC also reported the incident to the Mercer County Prosecutor, but the Prosecutor did not bring any charges. In addition, the DOC filed disciplinary charges against McLaughlin, which are mentioned in the SID report, and against Tubby and Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The SID investigator concluded that there were about seven officers in the \u201cimmediate vicinity\u201d of the second frisk, that using a baton to strike a head is a use of deadly force and that there was no justification for the use of that force. Considering the various conflicting accounts of the officers, the SID investigator also concluded that Tubby and Rodriguez could not have struck McLaughlin below his waist because other officers would have been in the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">McLaughlin was charged with committing a prohibited act\u2014 attempted assault, *.803/*.002 \u2014 in violation of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:4-4.1. He was found guilty of *.306, conduct disruptive of the orderly operation of the facility, on the determination that the evidence did not establish attempted assault but did establish disruption. McLaughlin filed an appeal with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">While McLaughlin\u2019s appeal was still pending in this court, McLaughlin filed his civil action on May 13, 2010. Subsequently, we affirmed the DOC\u2019s determination on the ground that it was supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record. <em>McLaughlin v. N.J. Dept. of Correc., </em>No. A-5553-07, 2010 <em>WL </em>4117169 (App.Div. June 7, 2010) (slip op. at 7). The opinion includes the following summary of the DOC\u2019s findings: \u201c[A]s [the officer] was beginning the search, [McLaughlin] \u2018turned around in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>an aggressive manner causing the attending staff to restrain the inmate,\u2019 \u201d and the officers \u201c \u2018believe[d] that an assault by the inmate was imminent and the inmate had to be restrained\u2019 and that \u2018[t]he inmate\u2019s actions ... placed the staff and the inmate\u2019s safety in jeopardy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">One week after this court\u2019s opinion was filed, on June 14, 2010, officers Tubby and Rodriguez requested representation from the Attorney General in McLaughlin\u2019s civil action. At that time the officers\u2019 administrative appeals from the discipline they received for their role in the McLaughlin incident \u2014 120 days\u2019 suspension for \u201cinappropriate physical conduct or mistreatment\u201d \u2014 were still pending before the DOC. But on July 2, 2010, the DOC dismissed the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Four-and-one-half months later, on November 16, 2010, the Attorney General\u2019s designee completed letter decisions setting forth reasons for denying Tubby and Rodriguez representation in McLaughlin\u2019s civil action. In denying representation, the Attorney General relied exclusively on: the officers\u2019 June 14 requests for representation; the initial civil complaint filed by McLaughlin; the report of SID\u2019s investigator dated October 10, 2008; and the work history of the officers as of June 17, 2010. This court\u2019s opinion on McLaughlin\u2019s appeal and the DOC\u2019s July 2, 2010 withdrawal of the disciplinary charges against Tubby and Rodriguez were not considered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Relying in part on the officers\u2019 suspensions for \u201cinappropriate physical conduct or mistreatment,\u201d and stating that they were \u201cfound to have used deadly force\u201d without a \u201cpredicate basis for such force,\u201d the Attorney General\u2019s designee concluded that the officers\u2019 actions \u201cconstituted willful misconduct under <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:10A-2(b)\u201d and \u201cactual malice under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:10A-2(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The record does not indicate when the Attorney General\u2019s decisions dated November 16, 2010 were served on the officers. But on January 5, 2011, Rodriguez\u2019s attorney wrote to the Attorney General\u2019s designee and requested reconsideration based on information not considered \u2014 specifically, the Mercer County Prosecutor\u2019s decision not to bring charges and the DOC\u2019s dismissal of the disciplinary charges. The Attorney General\u2019s designee did not respond, and the officers filed their respective notices of appeal with this court on January 28 and February 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Before addressing the merits, we reject the Attorney General\u2019s request for a dismissal of the appeals as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">As noted above, the record does not indicate when the Attorney General\u2019s decision was served, and pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:4-l(b), upon which the Attorney General relies, the time for appeal runs not from the date of an administrative decision but from the date \u201cof <em>service </em>of the decision or notice of the action taken.\u201d (emphasis added). Even if we were to assume that the decisions were mailed on the date written and received in due course, Rodriguez\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which tolled the time to appeal until the motion was resolved, <em>R. </em>2:4-3(b), was filed well within the thirty-day period during which this court may extend the time to file an appeal. <em>R. </em>2:4-4(a). The Attorney General\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Hill, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>367, 371, 575 A.2d 42 (App.Div.1990), a case in which a motion for reconsideration was filed beyond the <em>Rule </em>2:4-4(a) thirty-day period, is entirely misplaced. Although Tubby did not seek reconsideration, Rodriguez\u2019s request for reconsideration implicates Tubby\u2019s case as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Because the Attorney General\u2019s obligation to address questions of representation in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:10A-2 and <em>Prado </em>is a matter of public importance and interest, especially in civil litigation involving allegations of correctional officers\u2019 use of excessive force, we decline to dismiss either appeal. <em>Rumana v. Cnty. of Passaic, </em>397 <em>N.J.Super. </em>157, 171, 936 A.2d 971 (App.Div.2007). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>In making that determination, we have also considered the fact that the right to seek judicial review of administrative action is of constitutional dimension. <em>Hirth v. City of Hoboken, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. 149, </em>160, 766 A.2d 803 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">in.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The procedures employed in this case and the Attorney General\u2019s application of the legal standards in denying these officers\u2019 representation raise significant questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The Attorney General\u2019s duty to provide representation for State employees is statutory. Ordinarily, the Attorney General must \u201cprovide for the defense of any action brought against\u201d a state employee \u201con account of an act or omission in the scope of his employment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:10A-1. There are, however, three statutory exceptions to the duty, <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:10A-2(a)-(c), and the Attorney General may deny representation on a finding \u201cthat it is more probable than not that one\u201d of those exceptions applies. <em>Prado, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 427, 895 A.2d 1154. The \u201cburden ... is on the Attorney General to articulate reasons for not providing a defense,\u201d and the Attorney General must give the employee a written decision stating the reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 426-27, 895 A.2d 1154. On a subsequent appeal, this court must give the Attorney General\u2019s decision deference and affirm \u201cunless \u2018it is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable or it is not supported by substantial credible evidence in the record as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427, 895 A.2d 1154 (quoting <em>In re Taylor, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>644, 657, 731 A.2d 35 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The Attorney General is expected to make a determination about representation \u201cshortly after\u201d the request is filed and on the \u201climited record\u201d available even when it \u201cconsists] only of the complaint, an internal investigation by a state agency, and the employee\u2019s submissions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423-24, 895 A.2d 1154. These decisions were not promptly rendered. As noted above, the requests for representation were filed in June, and the Attorney General did not make a decision until mid-November. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the Attorney General relied exclusively on evidential materials available when the requests for representation were filed, the delay is not explained by evidence gathering.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">In this case, the delay raises a question about the Attorney General\u2019s obligation to verify the continued accuracy of the initial information upon which the Attorney General relies to justify a denial of representation. The charges against McLaughlin and the officers were mentioned in the report of SID\u2019s investigator. As a function of the well-settled rights of inmates and State employees to challenge decisions of State agencies imposing discipline, initial charges may be dismissed, modified or reversed. Moreover, along the way to a final decision, factual issues may be resolved that reduce the need to speculate about probable resolution of disputed facts. That is what happened here.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\"><em>Prado </em>permits a decision on a scant record in the interest of a prompt decision on representation. <em>Id. </em>at 424, 895 A.2d 1154. It does not suggest that a decision may be grounded on information that is no longer accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that before the Attorney General denies representation based on an agency\u2019s investigatory report and records of disciplinary charges that are not yet final, the continued accuracy of information that is material to the denial and was subject to change while the request was pending should be confirmed. The obligation to update disciplinary records relied upon to support a denial of representation is consistent with <em>Prado\u2019s </em>allocation of the burden of proof and its requirement that a denial be supported by credible evidence in the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 895 A.2d 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">This obligation is not overly burdensome or time-consuming. It requires contact with the State agency that supplied the information in the first instance or with the deputy or assistant attorney general who represents the agency in the event of an appeal to this court from the agency\u2019s final decision. We do not suggest that the Attorney General must postpone the decision to await the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>final outcome, but when the final outcome is known at the time of the decision, the Attorney General cannot rely on assertions about disciplinary actions that have been altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In this case, the Attorney General\u2019s designee relied in part on the fact that the officers were disciplined even though the DOC \u25a0withdrew the charges one week after the requests for representation were filed. In addition, the designee relied on the SID investigator\u2019s conclusions about the conduct of McLaughlin and the officers that were inconsistent with the findings in McLaughlin\u2019s disciplinary action that were affirmed on appeal. As noted above, this court determined that there was adequate support in the record for the following findings that the DOC had made about McLaughlin\u2019s conduct and the officers\u2019 responses: the inmate \u201c \u2018turned around in an aggressive manner causing the attending staff to restrain the inmate,\u2019 \u201d and the officers \u201c \u2018believe[d] that an assault by the inmate was imminent and the inmate had to be restrained\u2019 and that \u2018[t]he inmate\u2019s actions ... placed the staff and the inmate\u2019s safety in jeopardy.\u2019 \u201d In fact, the Attorney General, representing the DOC, urged us to affirm the DOC\u2019s determination based on those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">We recognize that the Attorney General\u2019s designee may have misread <em>Prado </em>and concluded that the decision could be made only on the basis of the record available on the date of the request. But once Rodriguez asked for reconsideration on the ground that the DOC had withdrawn the charges, it was arbitrary to ignore the information.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Considering the record as a whole, by which we mean the record as supplemented on the motion for reconsideration and on appeal without objection from the Attorney General, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>that several of the Attorney General\u2019s findings deemed material and critical to these denials of representation are not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Apart from the fact that material factual findings are contradicted by the record, the Attorney General\u2019s legal conclusions cannot be sustained on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">As noted above, the Attorney General relied on an exception that applies when an employee has engaged in \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d or acted with \u201cactual malice.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:10A-2(b). In both cases, the Attorney General found that it was more probable than not that the \u201calleged conduct\u201d fell within those exceptions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The terms \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d and \u201cactual malice\u201d appear in several provisions of the Tort Claims Act. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-10 (excusing public entity from liability for acts of its employees in either circumstance); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14 (excluding protection from liability for the employee in either circumstance); <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:10A-2 (authorizing denial of representation). Despite their importance, the Act does not define them. Judicial decisions provide guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">In a civil action alleging injury caused by a law enforcement officer\u2019s violation of the law or departmental policy, \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d has been construed to mean \u2018\u201cthe commission of a forbidden act with actual (not imputed) knowledge that the act is forbidden.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fielder v. Slonack, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>101, 124, 661 A.2d 231 (1995) (quoting <em>Marley v. Borough of Palmyra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>271, 294-95, 473 A.2d 554 (Law Div.1983)). Where application of a rule distinguishing permissible and impermissible conduct is dependent upon the officer\u2019s reasonable belief in a threat of danger, \u201ca mere error in judgment\u201d does not suffice. <em>Fielder, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 125 n. 5, 661 A.2d 231 (discussing regulations governing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>police pursuit, which is analogous to the use of force to subdue an inmate); <em>see id. </em>at 125, 661 A.2d 231 (noting that differences in situations warrant differences in the \u201capplication of willful misconduct\u201d). Thus, even when an officer mistakenly assesses danger material to the permissibility of conduct in the situation, there is \u201cno willful misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 661 A.2d 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In the context of alleged use of excessive force, the Court has suggested that it can be attributed to \u201cactual malice\u201d or \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d when it \u201cinvolv[es] deliberate and totally outrageous behavior.\u201d <em>Moya v. City of New Brunswick, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>491, 504 n. 8, 448 A.2d 999 (1982) (discussing, in dicta, the scope of <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:3-14\u2019s limitation on the Tort Claims Act\u2019s protection). This standard is consistent with the statutory definition of \u201cactual malice\u201d relevant to assessment of punitive damages; in that statutory scheme, \u201c \u2018[a]ctual malice\u2019 means an intentional wrongdoing in the sense of an evil-minded act.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Applying the foregoing standards, the record does not permit the conclusion that this case involves conduct that probably amounts to willful misconduct or action taken with actual malice. <em>Prado </em>does not allow a denial simply because the record, viewed in the light most favorable to a denial of representation, permits a finding of willful misconduct or actual malice. The question is whether conduct of that sort is \u201cmore probable than not.\u201d <em>Prado, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 427, 895 A.2d 1154. Given the disciplinary findings against McLaughlin \u2014 that he gave the officers cause to restrain him and believe that an assault by him was imminent and posed a danger \u2014 it is at least as probable that any excessive use of force was a product of an error in judgment or an accidental landing of a baton on his head during the struggle at the wall. The DOC\u2019s withdrawal of the disciplinary charges against the officers further supports this conclusion, because it is unlikely that the DOC would decline to continue the disciplinary process against these officers if it believed there actions were the product of willful misconduct or actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Because the record is inadequate to permit a denial of representation under the controlling standards, we reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-10\"> These are the charges against Rodriguez and Tubby in McLaughlin's amended complaint filed on November 12, 2010. The Attorney General's decisions discuss McLaughlin's initial complaint filed on May 13, 2010, which apparently included federal and state law claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> In fairness, we stress that there is nothing suggesting that the Assistant Attorney General who signed the decision had actual knowledge that the disciplinary charges against Tubby and Rodriguez had been dismissed on July 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\"> While we recognize that <em>Prado </em>makes representation the rule and denial an exception that the Attorney General is obligated to justify, <em>Prado </em>also indicates that a state employee seeking representation may submit materials for the Attorney General's consideration.
