Defendant, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, appeals from an order requiring it to release unredacted copies of promoter licensing agreements for use of the IZOD Center, a State owned entertainment facility. A reporter employed by plaintiff, the Newark Morning Ledger Co., which publishes <em>The Star-Ledger, </em>filed an OPRA request seeking release of contracts between defendant and event promoters for performances held in the IZOD <em>Center </em>from 2007 to <em>the </em>date of the request, March 19, 2009. Defendant released copies of ninety-eight contracts, however the financial terms in the contracts were redacted. Defendant declined to release the full contracts, claiming the information was exempt from disclosure as proprietary financial information and because its release would create a competitive disadvantage or reveal trade secrets. Defendant also argued plaintiffs request sought confidential information, which was exempt from disclosure under common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Challenging the Law Division\u2019s order mandating the release of the unredacted documents, defendant seeks our review, offering the same arguments presented before the trial court and including a challenge to restrictions the trial court imposed on pre-hearing discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Amicus, the International Association of Venue Managers, a not-for-profit tax exempt corporation consisting of venue operators across the country, supports defendant\u2019s position arguing the association favors \u201cthe protection and non-disclosure of confidential business contracts and other agreements that are negotiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>with promoters, artists, agents, professional teams and numerous other licensees or lessees of assembly venues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Having considered the arguments raised by the parties in light of the applicable law, we affirm. We conclude disclosure of the terms of the licensing agreements is mandated by OPRA. The redacted terms relating to the use of a state facility do not fall within the scope of \u201ctrade secrets\u201d or \u201cproprietary commercial or financial information\u201d as used in <em>N.J.SA </em>47:1A-1.1. Further, disclosure of the details regarding the licensing fees and other remunerative arrangements would not afford an advantage to other venues competing for bookings because they are widely known among those involved in this branch of the entertainment industry, defeating defendant\u2019s claims of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Defendant was created by the State Legislature in 1971 to construct and operate \u201cstadiums and other facilities for the holding of such spectator sports, expositions and other public events and uses,\u201d to \u201cprovide needed recreation, forums and expositions for the public\u201d and \u201cto accommodate trade shows and other expositions in order to promote industry!.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:10-2. Defendant\u2019s certificate of incorporation established it within the Department of Community Affairs as \u201ca public body corporate and politic, ... an instrumentality of the State exercising public and essential governmental functions!.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>5:10-4(a). On behalf of the State, defendant operates several facilities, including the Meadowlands Sports Complex (consisting of the IZOD Center, the Meadowlands Racetrack, and the MetLife Stadium), Monmouth Park Racetrack, the Atlantic City Convention Center and Visitors Center (which manages Boardwalk Hall), and the Wild-woods Convention Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">On March 16, 2009, Ted Sherman, a reporter working for plaintiff, transmitted a written OPRA request to defendant seeking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>1. All contracts with any concert or event promoter for any event held from Jan[uary] 1, 2007 to present. This would include any multi-year contracts signed before this date for events scheduled after January 1, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">2. Any letters or e-mails to and/or from the Sports and Exposition Authority and any concert or event promoter from Janluary] 1, 2007 to the present, referencing the Prudential Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">3. Any letters or e-mails to and/or from the Sports and Exposition Authority and any elected official referencing the future of the [IZOD Center] from Janluary] 1, 2005 to present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Shortly thereafter, defendant responded. As to the first request, defendant agreed to produce the information \u201cnot [otherwise] exempt\u201d by May 3, 2009, and provide the documents for the remaining requests by April 6, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">On April 28, 2009, defendant released ninety-eight contracts it had executed with concert and event promoters leasing the IZOD Center for events. The modified documents blacken all financial terms, such as: licensing fees; obligations for payment of expenses; allocations of revenue generated from parking, ticket, concession, suite revenue and merchandise; ticket prices and other fees; terms regarding complimentary tickets and accommodations; and the name of the promoter executing the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Explaining the basis for redacting the information, defendant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">The information that has been redacted is information that would either a) give an advantage to competitors or bidders, if disclosed; or, b) disclose trade secrets and proprietary commercial or financial information. You have inquired, specifically, about artist dressing room specifications____If [defendant] is required to publicly disclose this information, it could result in an artist\u2019s refusal to perform at this venue, which certainly puts [defendant] and the arena at a competitive disadvantage to other private venues that can protect and respect the personal requests of the artists. It is our belief that disclosure of this information would have a chilling effect on the artists\u2019 willingness to perform at this arena in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">In an effort to avoid litigation, plaintiff requested defendant reassess its position and release unredacted records, asserting there was \u201cno legal authority to withhold the requested contractual information from public disclosure under OPEA as proprietary or trade secret information.\u201d Further, plaintiff maintained there existed \u201cno factual or legal basis for [the] assertion that release of basic financial information about the terms of Ldefendant]\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>tracts would give an advantage to competitors or bidders.\u201d At defendant\u2019s request, plaintiff agreed to \u201crefrain from filing suit\u201d while both sides attempted to resolve the dispute. These efforts were unsuccessfid and plaintiff filed its verified complaint accompanied by an order seeking defendant to show cause why it \u201cshould not be compelled to produce\u201d the entirety of the records requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In response, defendant interposed several defenses, including the assertion plaintiffs claims were barred by <em>Rule </em>4:69-6(b)(3), and its requests were exempt by OPRA. To buttress the latter position, defendant filed largely identical certifications from several concert and event promoters, opposing the release of the redacted contract information, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">3. Throughout my negotiations and subsequent contractual agreements with the [defendant], I always believed and intended that the terms of each agreement and especially each performance and its requirements remain confidential. I never expected that the information within the agreements ... [would] be released publicly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">4. I understand now that certain media outlets have requested as part of New Jersey\u2019s [OPRA] the contracts, addendums, and agreements made with [defendant] containing all of what I considered confidential information. I strongly oppose such a release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">5. If a release were made, I would be very reluctant in considering in the future whether to negotiate and sign any agreement with [defendant] because of the concern that such agreement would be subsequently made public. Both I and the performers that I represent, never intended this information to be made public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">6. The release of this information would greatly impact my impression of [defendant]. I would seriously consider alternative venues that would not release this type of information to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">7. To the best of my knowledge, contracts and agreements that I negotiate with other private venues are not made public and I have always insisted that the financial terms and conditions of any agreement on behalf of performers or artists I represent remain confidential.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Defendant also filed a certification from an Executive Vice President of Ticketmaster, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">[O]ther venues in the [t]ri-[s]tate region that compete with [defendant] to attract concerts and other live entertainment events to their facilities would gain access to this previously confidential information and use this information to their competitive advantage in negotiating against [defendant] with artists\u2019 representatives and others. I further believe, based on my experience, that artists and event providers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>would be more inclined to stage their events at venues other than [defendant\u2019s] out of concern that their contractual arrangements with [defendant] would be made public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Finally, Mark Stefanacci, defendant\u2019s Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel, opposed plaintiffs request, certifying that the Meadowlands Complex, which houses the IZOD Center, \u201ccontinued to outperform its competitive peers in the entertainment industry by setting attendance records and winning industry awards.\u201d Stefanacci asserted defendant \u201cand its venues operate in a well known and fiercely competitive region and environment, and because of its public function it must remain competitive in order to provide tangible benefits to the citizens of the State.\u201d He explained the redacted information \u201cwould reveal the bargain and terms [defendant] offers to different promoters to bring entertainment to citizens of the State[,]\u201d the release of which, he believed, would enable \u201cprivate entertainment venues [to] use the confidential financial information to gain an advantage over the IZOD Center by luring away promoters and entertainers with more lucrative agreements and terms.\u201d Stefanacci concluded defendant\u2019s efforts to book the IZOD Center would be \u201cundercut!,]\u201d resulting in a \u201cchilling effect on the artists\u2019 and promoters\u2019 willingness to contract with [defendant]\u201d for the venue, and eliminate its bargaining power when negotiating agreements, leading to a loss of revenue and ultimately causing the arena to shut down.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In an effort to further support its position that the industry generally considers promoter and artist financial terms of licensing agreements proprietary and confidential, defendant served subpoenas mirroring plaintiff\u2019s request seeking similar contracts on other arena facilities. Newark\u2019s Prudential Center had released two contracts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but all other venues objected claiming the \u201cdocuments were highly confidential and proprietary!,]\u201d because disclosure would place the venue at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace. Defendant also highlighted the fact that plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>tiffs efforts to obtain information from these venues were similarly resisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Over defendant\u2019s objection, the court permitted limited discovery prior to the return date of the order to show cause. The court allowed \u201cthe deposition[ ] of a[t] least some of the promoters who submitted ... certifications in order to delve into the basis for the conelusory statements in the certifications that public release of the information would cause a \u2018competitive disadvantage.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Brian Gale, the Director of Booking and Marketing for Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), an on-site manager of the event calendar for the Prudential Center, was deposed. Gale explained the standard contract used by the Prudential Center does not contain a confidentiality clause because there is an expectation that the financial terms of the contract were confidential. He believed only promoters or someone seeking to rent the Prudential Center would have access to the fee information. Although the \u201cbase licensing fee\u201d for use of the Prudential Center was known by promoters to be $75,000, he was unaware whether the IZOD Center had a similar standard fee. Without relating specific details, Gale explained there were other negotiated rates and terms in the contract with the artists or family-oriented events that were negotiated in addition to the base licensing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Defendant also sought to depose Gordon Lavalette, the Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration of Devils Arena Entertainment, LLC (DAE), an owner of the Prudential Center. Prior to Lavalette\u2019s deposition, plaintiff moved to restrict the scope of inquiry. The court agreed in part, limiting defendant\u2019s questions to four areas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">(1) the decision to partially comply with the subpoena served on or about October 19, 2009; (2) why certain contracts were specifically produced; (3) whether there are other existing contracts; and (4) whether previous requests for entertainment contracts have been made by [plaintiff.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Defendant was specifically precluded from asking Lavalette questions surrounding his understanding of plaintiffs motives for requesting the event contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Lavalette stated he did not consider the information in the two released contracts confidential and would have no concern if a competitor obtained the information regarding the base licensing fee or the event merchandising revenue split negotiated by the Prudential Center. However, he acknowledged there were more than two events held at the Prudential Center during the period covered by the subpoena, even though DAE only released two contracts in response to plaintiffs subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Brian Eric Kert, the Executive Vice President of Business and Legal Affairs for Live Nation Global Touring (Live Nation), explained Live Nation and AEG were the two largest concert promoters in the United States. Kert\u2019s division arranged worldwide tours for various performing artists. Kert noted that the kinds of terms that could be negotiated at various venues were generally known among the big concert promoters. However, the terms of each contract were never made public unless there was a lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In discussing the factors considered when Live Nation contemplated whether to contract with a public venue for one of its artists, Kert stated the possibility of disclosure of the contractual terms is not \u201ca positive factor attached to a venue[,]\u201d yet it may still remain \u201cadvantageous\u201d to book a public venue after considering \u201cthe location, the size of the venue ... timing, [and] availability, all these factors go into\u201d a decision to use a venue, which are \u201call probably going to trump confidentiality.\u201d Kert characterized the possible disclosure of the terms of a contract as \u201clow down on your priority listf,] low down on your radar.\u201d This partly resulted from the fact that disclosure rarely occurred. Kert cautioned if disclosure happened routinely at a venue, the consideration would \u201cbe higher up on the radar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Kert also discussed a Venue Rider he drafted and attached to agreements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Rider included certain financial terms specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to the venue and the artist. This Rider included a confidentially provision and Kert claimed he would not want any of those terms \u201cgoing out into the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Plaintiff also deposed the Co-Chief Executive Officer of Metropolitan Talent, Inc., John Howard Scher, who described the changes he witnessed over the past twenty-five years in the manner concerts were promoted. Scher suggested disclosure of the contractual information would further exacerbate the already heavy competition between \u201cthe artists, the promoters and the facilities.\u201d Scher agreed there is some idea among promoters of what a facility may offer, but no one knows the specifics. He strongly objected to the release of the contractual information suggesting it would negatively impact local promoters like him, because if an artist knows another received a better package of compensation and perquisites, the artist would believe his or her promoter was incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Also deposed was Marla Ostroff, Executive Vice President of National Accounts for Ticketmaster, an automated event ticket seller and the exclusive ticket agent for defendant. Ostroff stated that if the terms of the agreement Ticketmaster negotiated with defendant were made public, it would harm its competitive position in the ticket industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Defendant deposed plaintiffs reporter, Sherman, and Deputy Managing Editor, David Tucker, inquiring as to the motive behind the OPRA request. Several questions posed during these depositions were met with objection, as Sherman and Tucker invoked the Reporter\u2019s Shield Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A-21 (Shield Law)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>asserted the probe inappropriately scrutinized plaintiffs editorial processes and investigative techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Near the close of discovery, plaintiff filed Sherman\u2019s certification, which attached eighteen unredacted concert or event contracts from other venues obtained utilizing public records requests. Defendant sought an order allowing it to resume Sherman\u2019s deposition regarding these documents or, alternatively, to bar their introduction. Defendant\u2019s motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">At a summary hearing, the trial court first addressed defendant\u2019s procedural challenge to the timeliness of plaintiffs action. Defendant maintained the action was filed one week beyond OPRA\u2019s forty-five day limitations period and should be dismissed. Judge Claude M. Coleman disagreed, determining the statute of limitations was tolled based upon plaintiffs forbearance pending the parties\u2019 attempted settlement, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">[A]s long as the parties were working or attempting to avoid litigation on the matter, I think that\u2019s a worthy goal. And even though it might not have been considered by [defendant] to toll the statute, I think it\u2019s not unreasonable for [plaintiff] to consider that ... the statute would be tolled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">And ... I do regard [this] as a very important publie interest question and so I will relax the rules and allow the process to proceed, so that it is heard on the ... merits[.]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Next, the parties addressed whether OPRA\u2019s exemptions shielded public review of the requested contracts. Following argument, the trial court reserved its decision pending an in camera review of the unredacted documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>In a written opinion, Judge Coleman concluded defendant \u201cfailed to carry its burden\u201d to show OPRA\u2019s exceptions applied \u201cto the facts and circumstances in this case.\u201d Although certifications from concert promoters and venue operators were filed, the certifications were \u201cnearly identical\u201d and failed to \u201cg[i]ve specific examples of what harm would occur if the contract information was released.\u201d Moreover, the deposition testimony of several affiants \u201cconceded that disclosure of such information ... would not be a de[c]isive factor in future contracts\u201d negotiated with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Further, the trial court found \u201cnone of the requested contracts have a confidentiality provision\u201d and the \u201cgeneral contract terms are known throughout the industry and are certainly discussed between the promoters and the artists.\u201d Often, the \u201coffer made by one venue is discussed with another venue, even before the contract is signed.\u201d Accordingly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">[n]o sensitive financial information is contained in the contracts. There are no expectations of privacy, and there are no rational reasons why disclosure of such information might cause [defendant] to lose its bargaining power in future agreements or provide a competitive disadvantage to [defendant\u2019s competition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">... Defendant\u2019s argument that the release of the unredacted contract information would cause it immediate and irreparable harm on its face lacks merit. Such alleged harm has not been shown to this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The court noted defendant produced no authority to show what constituted a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d and no evidence explaining how the redacted information represented \u201ctrade secrets\u201d or \u201cproprietary information.\u201d Rather, \u201cdefendant ... presented broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific examples of articulated reasoning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">In evaluating whether disclosure was warranted pursuant to the common law right of access to government records, the trial court discerned the \u201c[c]ommon [l]aw right and statutory rights are not mutually exclusive.\u201d Moreover, the common law right of access \u201cprovides an even broader scope of documents than OPRA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Finding plaintiff \u201cmade its request in good faith[,]\u201d the court found there was a \u201cstrong public interest in disclosure of [defendant\u2019s] contracts!,]\u201d which was \u201cheightened by the political intrigue and dispute between the Prudential Center and [defendant].\u201d In weighing \u201cthe public\u2019s interest in the right to know against the public interest in confidentiality of the contracts, the court [found] the public\u2019s right to know is paramount\u201d because the \u201cpublic has a right to [be] informed about a dispute involving its public agencies, and how it spends its money.\u201d The court ordered defendant to release \u201cunredacted records and information reflecting: all contracts with any concert or event promoter for any event held from January 1, 2007 to present, and include!] any multi-year contracts signed before th[at] date for events scheduled after January 1, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">When defendant failed to turn over the requested contracts, plaintiff moved to compel compliance with the October 25, 2010 order. Defendant filed a cross-motion for a stay of the order pending appeal. Plaintiff also requested an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs as a prevailing party under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-6. Another motion judge<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> awarded plaintiff $126,135.95 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">This appeal ensued. Pending appeal, the trial court stayed both the October 25, 2010 order and the fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">On appeal, defendant raises procedural and substantive arguments. First, defendant suggests plaintiffs action should have been dismissed as time barred. Second, defendant argues the trial court erred in its interpretation of OPRA\u2019s exemptions. Defendant asserts disclosure is exempt as the information sought constitutes proprietary financial information and would result in a competitive disadvantage or disclosure of trade secrets. Third, defendant maintains the common law right of access is inapplicable here because the redacted information is confidential, making it exempt from disclosure. Finally, defendant suggests the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>court abused its discretion by curbing defendant\u2019s discovery efforts regarding plaintiffs motive in obtaining the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We quickly dispel defendant\u2019s procedural assertions seeking to bar plaintiffs action. Defendant contends plaintiff \u201cfailed to file its action within the forty-five day time limit applicable to OPRA challenges\u201d and presented \u201cno justification\u201d for enlarging the time to file its action under the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d exception to <em>Rule </em>4:69-6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The Supreme Court has declared \u201cOPRA actions have a 45-day statute of limitations, consistent with actions in lieu of prerogative writs.\u201d <em>Mason v. City of Hoboken, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>51, 57, 951 A.2d 1017 (2008). <em>See also R. </em>4:69-6(a). The forty-five day limitations period appropriately assures citizens receive \u201cswift access to public records,\u201d and also provides public bodies with certainty regarding possible disputes regarding the accessibility of records. <em>Mason, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 69-70, 951 A.2d 1017. The Court has also made clear trial \u201ccourts can enlarge that time period in the interest of justice,\u201d coincident with the provisions of <em>Rule </em>4:69-6(c). <em>Id. </em>at 70, 951 A.2d 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">We concur with these legal conclusions. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(A). Plaintiffs complaint was filed immediately after a brief period utilized for good faith settlement efforts, but six-days beyond the forty-five day limitations period. The delay was neither tactical nor designed to prejudice defendant, who was acutely aware of plaintiffs intention to press its claims in court. This latter fact is highlighted by defendant\u2019s June 8, 2009 correspondence requesting plaintiff to \u201crefrain from filing suit against [defendant] while [the parties] tried to see if [they] could resolve the OPRA dispute without resorting to litigation.\u201d Although a formal extension was not sought, circumstances reflect defendant knew litigation was imminent.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Moreover, Judge Coleman relaxed the limitations period applying the interests of justice exception, <em>R. </em>4:69-6(c), after finding \u201cimportant public rather than private interests, which require adjudication or clarification.\u201d <em>Borough of Princeton v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of the Cnty. of Mercer, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>135, 152, 777 A.2d 19 (2001) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Based on all the facts and circumstances presented, we conclude the trial court reasonably exercised its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint. <em>See id. </em>at 152-53, 777 A.2d 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Turning to plaintiffs OPRA request and defendant\u2019s claimed exemptions precluding disclosure, our review \u201cof whether access to public records under OPRA and the manner of its effectuation\u201d are legal conclusions that are always subject to de novo review. <em>Sussex Commons </em>Assocs., <em>LLC v.

Armed with this information, [defendant\u2019s rivals could undercut and lure away [defendant\u2019s business by offering more favorable terms to prospective promoters/artists, resulting in the loss of revenue and [defendant\u2019s bargaining power in the industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Keying on the preservation of defendant\u2019s revenue through the maintenance of its bargaining position in the competitive entertainment industry, defendant predicts no promoter will utilize the facility unless afforded \u201cthe most favorable pricing terms previously offered\u201d to another entertainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Amicus Association argues the agreements contain commercial and proprietary information because they \u201cmust have been developed and revised many times over [during] th[e] [thirty-] year period\u201d since the IZOD Center opened. It also maintains the agreement terms were kept confidential by all parties because they were not released to the public and heavy emphasis must attach to this expectation of confidentially.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Plaintiff advances that the trial court\u2019s finding the competitive disadvantage exception does not apply must stand. It argues defendant\u2019s interpretation of the exclusion is \u201coverly expansive!,]\u201d which would \u201cprevent the public from finding out basic contractual information about deals to rent the I[ZOD] Center[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">We touched on this exemption in <em>Tractenberg, supra, </em>finding it inapplicable to protect from release real estate appraisals obtained by the defendant municipality valuing a 120-acre parcel located in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the Highlands. 416 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 361, 378, 4 A.3d 585. The plaintiff taxpayer sought release of the appraisals to determine the value of the property in an effort to prevent further development. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 362, 4 A.3d 585. The defendant\u2019s brief objected on several grounds, which included the competitive disadvantage exception, but this issue was not argued before the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 365, 4 A3d 585. We rejected application of the exemption to the facts presented, which showed the defendant Township had the appraisals for over two years and had not commenced any negotiations to purchase the land, holding: \u201cTo contend that the mere potential for future negotiations, without a strong showing that negotiations are probable, satisfies the OPRA competitive advantage exemption \u2018subverts the broad reading of OPRA as intended by the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379, 4 A.3d 585 (quoting <em>Times of Trenton Publ\u2019g Corp. v. Lafayette Yard Cmty. Dev. Corp., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>519, 535, 874 A.2d 1064 (2005)). We therefore, rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that OPRA\u2019s competitive advantage exemption applied. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">In <em>Rousseau, supra, </em>we reviewed whether limited partnership agreements between the Division of Investment and private investment companies to create a private equity fund using State employee pension deposits were subject to release under OPRA. 417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 348, 9 A.3d 1064. The Division asserted several OPRA exemptions allowed it to withhold the agreements with the private equity funds, including the competitive advantage exemption, primarily based on the harm to the private entities. <em>Id. </em>at 346, 9 A.3d 1064. The agreements under review contained</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">representations <em>concerning </em>the investment strategies and processes followed by the general partners [and] ... the parameters within which the general partners of the funds must operate____They set limits on the types of investments that may be made, the amount of capital that may be invested in the aggregate or in a particular transaction, and the length of time during which capital may be invested____[The agreements] restrict the outside activities of the general parfrners[,] ... limit the liability of the general partners and provide them with indemnification by the partner-ship for certain actions taken on behalf of the funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 349, 9 A.3d 1064 (alterations in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>We considered the detailed affidavit filed by the Director in the trial proceeding explaining how each agreement \u201ccontain[ed] extensive provisions on the need for confidentiality,\u201d and \u201cexplicitly stat[ed] what information [could] be disclosed.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 359, 9 A.3d 1064. The Director also stated \u201cprivate equity fund managers informed him that they would not accept the State as a limited partner if the terms of the agreement were subject to public disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 9 A.3d 1064. Further, the private fund managers filed certifications delineating why disclosure was prohibited. <em>Ibid. </em>We found the defendant\u2019s \u201cexpectation of confidentially [was] manifest,\u201d making disclosure unwarranted. <em>Id. </em>at 359-61, 9 A.3d 1064. Ultimately, the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy was critical to this court when it found the investment agreements fell within the definitions of proprietary information and trade secrets. <em>Id. </em>at 359-62, 9 A.3d 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The facts in this matter are considerably different than those in <em>Rousseau. </em>Aside from the one Venue Rider mentioned above, the IZOD Center agreements neither state they contain confidential information nor restrict disclosure of any terms. The documents reveal nothing about the business operations or financial strength of the promoters, they merely relate the terms negotiated with the State to use the facility. In fact, within the ten sample contracts, one included a disclaimer noting the possibility of disclosure stating: \u201cThe AUTHORITY will not release any box office or attendance figures to any entertainment papers such as Pollstar, Billboard, etc. Notwithstanding the above, due to the [OPRA], the AUTHORITY is required by law to release certain information if it is requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Unlike the limited partnership agreements in <em>Rousseau, </em>the variations in financial terms and conditions among performers\u2019 agreements likely resulted from the popularity of the talent rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>than the proprietary strategies developed by the promoter. Similarly, defendant\u2019s professed fear that other venues, most specifically the Prudential Center, would undercut any given deal was contradicted by the testimony of promoters, who revealed they often shop geographically proximate arenas, pitting one offer against another to get the best arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">We also fail to grasp defendant\u2019s argument that release of its licensing fee, ticket share, merchandising and refreshment splits would allow its closest geographic competitor, the Prudential Center, to obtain a competitive advantage. The two venues differ in age, facility design, size, and other accommodations. More important, \u201cartist preferences\u201d for one facility over the other are predominately controlled by large international promoters like AEG which works with the Prudential Center, and Live Nation which works with defendant at the IZOD Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Further, the promoters\u2019 testimony revealed numerous facts influencing whether an artist would perform at a venue. Kert\u2019s testimony made this clear. Kert, who worked for Live Nation, enumerated the considerations for choosing a venue, testifying \u201cavailability, revenue, location, ... [and] routing on the tour ... are obviously important factors that are probably going to trump confidentiality.\u201d In fact, he acknowledged the possible disclosure of the terms of a contract with a public venue fell \u201clow down on your priority list.\u201d Admittedly, he asserted routine disclosure of contract terms may become a consideration when contemplating a choice of venue, but it \u201ccertainly would not be the dispositive factor.\u201d These comments are a far cry from defendant\u2019s contentions that full disclosure would destroy its ability to negotiate and compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">As a practical matter, we agree with defendant that specific information regarding an artist\u2019s accommodations during a performance are confidential because these details may contain security arrangements or include individual needs that reflect medical or dietary restrictions or account for other personal concerns unrelated to the business arrangement between defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>dant and the promoter, which in fact have a privacy interest attached.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, we reject the general proposition that disclosure of the financial terms contained in the agreements is warranted to protect the artists\u2019 privacy, because they too are viewed as confidential. Interestingly, the confidentiality assertion on behalf of the performers is belied by defendant\u2019s revelation of the named artist, choosing instead to redact the name of the individual promoter. Defendant\u2019s claim is conclusory and the facility licensing agreement does not reflect the remuneration paid to an artist whose arrangement with a promoter is fixed by a separate document.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Finally, Scher\u2019s testimony revealed the terms and conditions for use of the IZOD Center are widely known among promoters, artists, ticket agents, and possibly other arenas. Promoters generally know what they can negotiate at various arenas or venues. In light of these facts, we perceive no reason why public scrutiny should be precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Simply stated, we conclude defendant fails to identify the detrimental effects of disclosure. A broad assertion that disclosure will result in a loss of bargaining power is unsupported by actual evidence. Like Judge Coleman, we conclude defendant\u2019s claims fail to show the release of financial terms of the promoter/event contracts would give an advantage to defendant\u2019s competitors. <em>Gannett, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 215, 877 A.2d 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Defendant next argues the \u201credacted portions of the contracts are further exempt from disclosure under OPRA because they contain both proprietary financial information and trade secrets ... [making them] confidential, and therefore, not subject to disclosure.\u201d Defendant contends \u201cthe specific financial terms contained in each individual contract entered into between [it] and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>various coneert[] promoters are valuable and private and have been treated as confidential by [defendant] and others within the entertainment industry.\u201d Defendant cloaks the financial terms as \u201ctrade secrets\u201d because they are \u201cprivately owned and not communally shared.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">As already noted, when reviewing the applicability of the competitive disadvantage exemption, indicia of confidentiality is not found: only one of the redacted contracts contained a confidentiality clause and the range of fees for use of the IZOD Center is generally known throughout the industry and discussed between promoters, arena managers, and performers. Promoters assertions, submitted in certifications or during deposition testimony, that the parties never intended the information to be made public cannot create an expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In <em>Rousseau, swpra, </em>we examined an OPRA exemption claim based on the proprietary commercial nature of the information sought. 417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 354, 9 A.3d 1064. We additionally determined whether the documents were trade secrets, and similarly excluded as government records. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 9 A.3d 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Relying on the Court\u2019s guidance set forth in <em>Lamorte Burns &amp; Co. v. Walters, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>285, 299-301, 770 A.2d 1158 (2001), we considered \u201cthe key elements\u201d to determine when commercial financial information was proprietary. <em>Rousseau, supra, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 356, 9 A.3d 1064. <em>Lamorte </em>suggested we must analyze \u201cthe relationship of the parties at the time of disclosure[,] ... the intended use of the information[,]\u201d and \u201cthe expectations of the parties.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Lamorte, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 299-300, 770 A.2d 1158). \u201c[U]nder OPRA, if the document contains commercial or proprietary information it is not considered a government record and not subject to disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358, 9 A.3d 1064. We concluded the investment agreements sought by the plaintiffs were proprietary as their content was not intended for wide dissemination, the \u201c[defendants\u2019 expectation of confidentiality [was] manifest\u201d and the agreements delineated the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>terms and specific persons who may review the information. <em>Id. </em>at 359, 9 A.3d 1064. Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">[e]ach agreement contains specific information about the capitalization of the partnership, its commencement and termination date, and other information pertinent to the operational fortunes of the partnership. Finally, each agreement is a complex document. Each reflects years of experience and expertise by trained legal and financial professionals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 359-60, 9 A.3d 1064.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">In analyzing whether information qualifies as \u201ctrade-secrets,\u201d a term not defined by OPRA, <em>id. </em>at 360, 9 A.3d 1064, we considered the Court\u2019s prior reliance on Comment b of the <em>Restatement of Torts </em>\u00a7 757 (1939). <em>Id. </em>at 361, 9 A.3d 1064 (citing <em>Hammock v. Hoffmann-LaRoche, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>356, 384, 662 A.2d 546 (1995)). The comment provides: \u201c \u2018[a] trade secret may consist of any ... compilation of information which is used in one\u2019s business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Restatement of Torts </em>\u00a7 757 cmt. b (1939)). Other considerations</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJx\">include the extent to which the information is known outside of the owner\u2019s business, the extent to which it is known by employees of the owner, the measures taken to guard (he secrecy of the information, the value of the information to the owner and competitors, the effort expended to develop the information, and the ease or difficulty by which the information can be duplicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Hoffman-LaRoche, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 384, 662 A.2d 546).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">\u201c \u2018Trade secrets are a peculiar kind of property. Their only value consists in their being kept private. If they are disclosed or revealed, they are destroyed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Trump\u2019s Castle </em>As<em>socs. v. Tallone, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>159, 163, 645 A.2d 1207 (App.Div. 1994) (quoting <em>In re Iowa Freedom of Info. Council, </em>724 <em>F.</em>2d 658, 662 (8th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Applying these standards, we conclude the facts at hand provide no parallels with those found in <em>Rousseau. </em>The IZOD Center licensing agreements amount to nothing more than form agreements, modified to identify the artist, performance date, the cost to rent the arena, and the exact financial deal struck. Dissemination of the information circulates beyond the IZOD Center\u2019s staff and is generally known throughout the industry by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>promoters, artists, their agents, ticket distributors, and concessionaires. No contractual safeguards limit disclosure of the alleged proprietary information or trade secrets. Instead, the agreements which represent deals struck with promoters on the types of fees and percentage splits for tickets, parking and items sold during a given event, appear to be replicated nationwide in similar venues.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Defendant offers no support for the contention that the information requested would release trade secrets. No evidence shows the redacted information was developed after expense of money and time, or was based on confidential marketing techniques or promotional research. The financial terms of each deal did not result from a methodology honed to attract desirable events to the facility, but merely as a product of negotiation with the individual promoter.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We do not accept defendant\u2019s suggestion that the unique circumstance of a government entity operating in an otherwise private industry expands the need for confidentiality and the exceptions to disclosure. Defendant\u2019s claim that disclosure diminishes its competitive edge is not clearly articulated. We remain at a loss to understand how disclosure of charges to a promoter who pays one fee for artist \u201cB\u201d and a different fee for artist \u201cC\u201d represents proprietary information warranting protection. Likewise, disclosure of a ticket revenue split for an artist represented by promoter \u201cD\u201d that varies with the ticket revenue split for a different artist represented by promoter \u201cE\u201d hardly seems a unique product of organizational or marketing strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In short, defendant did not make a ease for securing secrecy. <em>See Apollo Techs. Corp. v. Centrosphere Indus. Corp., </em>805 <em>F.Supp. </em>1157, 1202 (D.N.J.1992) (holding \u201c[c]onclusory statements in affidavits declaring that information represents confidential business records and trade secrets\u201d are \u201cpalpably insufficient\u201d to prove such facts). The agreements are contracts for lease of a state-owned facility. The fact that the lease involves well-known entertainers will not shroud them in confidentiality. We agree with Judge Coleman\u2019s analysis that the financial terms contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>defendant\u2019s agreements are neither \u201ctrade secrets\u201d nor \u201cproprietary commercial or financial information.\u201d The terms are not subject to exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s January 21, 2011 award of attorney\u2019s fees is based on securing reversal of the underlying order requiring release of the agreements. Defendant argues it \u201cproperly withheld the redacted information from disclosure under OPRA\u2019s competitive disadvantage and/or trade secrets and proprietary financial or commercial information exemptions.\u201d Our determination to the contrary deflates defendant\u2019s position. We conclude the trial court properly assessed reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiff as a prevailing party, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-6. <em>See Mason, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 70-71, 951 A.2d 1017 (discussing fee awards to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under OPRA). The fee award will not be disturbed. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Defendant additionally maintains the redacted information is exempt from disclosure under common law. <em>See Keddie v. Rutgers, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>36, 50, 689 A.2d 702 (1997). Defendant maintains when balancing the respective interests, \u201cthe public\u2019s interest in maintaining the confidentiality of this information to allow the IZOD Center to remain competitive in the market and continue to generate profits for the State far outweigh[s] any private right of access claimed by [pjlaintiff.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">OPRA does not alter the common law right of access to government records. <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-8. <em>Accord Mason, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 67, 951 A.2d 1017. Although the \u201ccommon-law definition of a public record is broader than the definition\u201d contained in OPRA,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cthe right to access common-law records is a qualified one.\u201d <em>Keddie, supra, 148 N.J. </em>at 49-50, 689 A.2d 702.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The common-law right to access public records depends on three requirements: (1) the records must be common-law public documents; (2) the person seeking access must establish an interest in the subject matter of the material; and (3) the citizen\u2019s right to access must be balanced against the State\u2019s interest in preventing disclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\"><em>[Id. </em>at 50, 689 A.2d 702 (internal quotations and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In balancing the asserted need for confidentiality against a requestor\u2019s alleged public interest seeking disclosure, a court considers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">(1) the extent to which disclosure will impede agency functions by discouraging citizens from providing information to the government; (2) the effect disclosure may have upon persons who have given such information, and whether they did so in reliance that their identities would not be disclosed; (3) the extent to which agency self-evaluation, program improvement, or other decisionmaking will be chilled by disclosure; (4) the degree to which the information sought includes factual data as opposed to evaluative reports of policymakers; (5) whether any findings of public misconduct have been insufficiently corrected by remedial measures instituted by the investigative agency; and (6) whether any agency disciplinary or investigatory proceedings have arisen that may circumscribe the individual\u2019s asserted need for the materials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\"><em>[Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 113, 505 A.2d 958.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">In its challenge to what it believes was a flawed analysis by the trial court, defendant agrees the contracts are public records as defined under common law and does not dispute plaintiff has established a legitimate interest in seeking disclosure. <em>See S. Jersey Publ\u2019g Co. v. N.J. Expressway Auth., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>478, 487, 591 A.2d 921 (1991) (finding \u201ca newspaper\u2019s interest in keeping a watchful eye on the workings of public agencies is sufficient to accord standing under the common law\u201d (quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Defendant focuses its arguments on whether the balancing test asserting plaintiffs right to access is outweighed by the State\u2019s interest in maintaining confidentiality. <em>Keddie, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 50, 689 A.2d 702. In doing so, defendant intimates plaintiffs request is not presented in good faith. <em>See Phila. Newspapers, Inc. v. N.J., 232 N.J.Super. </em>458, 464, 557 A.2d 688 (App.Div.1989) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>(observing a citizen\u2019s request for access to confidential government materials must be made in good faith).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">To prevail, defendant must show \u201cthe claim of confidentiality is \u2018premised upon a purpose which tends to advance or further a wholesome public interest or a legitimate private interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Keddie, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 51, 689 A.2d 702 (quoting <em>Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 112, 505 A.2d 958). A slight interest in confidentiality, \u201cstanding alone\u201d is insufficient to defeat \u201cdisclosure to advance a legitimate private interest.\u201d <em>Ibid,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Applied here, we determine the release of unredacted contracts between defendant and promoters allows full public scrutiny of the proper use of government facilities, the defendant\u2019s administrative management of the IZOD Center, and the efficacy of expenditures for such purposes. The check on government allocation of taxpayers\u2019 dollars is highly significant. Allowing examination of the government contracts is designed to dispel rumors of possible preferential treatment or untoward favoritism at the public\u2019s expense, and also permits the public to monitor the efficient allocation of the State\u2019s limited resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">This public interest must be weighed against defendant\u2019s interest, asserted on behalf of the citizenry, to maintain confidentiality of the documents. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 689 A.2d 702. Defendant suggests the trial court overlooked its need to avoid disruption of the arena\u2019s operation and its significant revenue stream. Further, defendant predicts disclosure will harm its competitive edge in the marketplace, compromising its \u201cbargaining power in negotiating future financial terms in agreements\u201d with prospective artists and promoters, causing detriment to the entire State and the closure of its venues.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">On balance, defendant\u2019s forecast of financial peril is contradicted by the promoter\u2019s candor that the possibility of disclosure would be considered a factor whether to contract with defendant but not a deal breaker. The unique aspects of hosting events at the IZOD Center including its stadium character, capacity, multi-state draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>and parking access, along with an artist\u2019s schedule and the availability of tour dates, rank much higher in the consideration of booking the facility than confidentiality of the facility lease terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Defendant further contends \u201c[p]laintiff was serving as a proxy to the Prudential Center,\u201d motivated to \u201cundermine the viability of the IZOD Center.\u201d This bald assertion is unaccompanied by any evidence and flies in the face of the Court\u2019s recognition that newspapers \u201ckeep a watchful eye\u201d on the workings of government. <em>S. Jersey Publ\u2019g Co., supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 487, 591 A.2d 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We again note, while seemingly not an issue regarding the contracts at issue, the personal accommodation requests of the performers relating to security arrangements and dressing room and dietary requests shall remain confidential, as the only public interest in the personal habits or needs of performers is curiosity.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The final issue presented is defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court abused its discretion by denying defendant the ability to obtain certain evidence during discovery. Defendant claims error resulted in the court\u2019s entry of the April 19, 2010 order, maintaining it did not require the owner of the Prudential Center to produce the remaining contracts subpoenaed in contemplation of Gordon Lavalette\u2019s deposition and, further, curtailed questions to Lavalette regarding his knowledge of plaintiffs motives. The second challenge identifies the June 11, 2010 order denying resumption of Sherman\u2019s deposition to \u201cattack [his] credibility,\u201d following his late filing of a certification attaching contracts obtained in response to public records requests submitted to various other public venues. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">When examining a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretionary authority, we reverse only when the exercise of discretion was \u201cmanifestly unjust\u201d under the circumstances. <em>Union Cnty. Improvement Auth. v. Artaki, LLC, </em>392 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 149, 920 A.2d 125 (App.Div.2007). \u201c[I]t is not the appellate function to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>decide whether the trial court took the wisest course, or even the better course\u201d as we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Gittleman v. Cent. Jersey Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>103 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 179, 246 A.2d 757 (App.Div.1967), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>503, 246 A.2d 713 (1968). <em>See also Abtrax Pharms., Inc. v. Elkins-Sinn, Inc., </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>499, 517, 655 A.2d 1368 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Judge Coleman determined defendant\u2019s proposed inquiries were irrelevant to substantiate its claim of the applicability of OPRA\u2019s competitive disadvantage or trade secrets exceptions. That determination recognizes \u201cwe do not consider the purpose behind OPRA requests,\u201d <em>Burnett, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 435, 968 A.2d 1151, which are \u201cgenerally immaterial to the disclosure determination[.]\u201d <em>MAG Entm\u2019t, LLC v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>534, 543, 868 A.2d 1067 (App.Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">It is important to note OPRA matters must proceed \u201cin a summary or expedited manner.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6. Accordingly, discovery is limited. <em>MAG Entm\u2019t, LLC, supra, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 552, 868 A.2d 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">We discern no basis to interfere with the trial court\u2019s orders and its rulings were not \u201cmanifestly unjust.\u201d <em>Union Cnty. Improvement Auth., supra, </em>392 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 149, 920 A.2d 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Following our review of the issues raised on appeal, we conclude defendant has not met its burden to prove \u201cthe denial of access is authorized by law\u201d under OPRA, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6, or that the common law right to access has not been overcome by evidence of the public right to protect confidential information, except as to the limited information related to a performer\u2019s personal accommodations at the IZOD Center. Further, plaintiffs success on the merits was properly accompanied by an award of reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees. Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s entry of the pre-hearing discovery orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-7\"> The Prudential Center\u2019s response was to a subpoena issued by plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\"> Among the ten sample unredacted contracts provided to the trial judge, one contains such a Venue Rider.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\"> Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-21, a person \"employed by news media for the purpose of gathering, procuring, transmitting, compiling, editing or disseminating news for the general public ... has a privilege to refuse to disclose\u201d the \"source, author, means, agency or person from or through whom any information was procured, obtained, supplied, furnished, gathered, transmitted, compiled, edited, disseminated, or delivered;\u201d and \"[a]ny news or information obtained in the course of pursuing his professional activities whether or not it is disseminated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b185-11\"> The trial judge elaborated on this point stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">The <em>Rule </em>allows relaxation in cases involving important and normal constitutional questions, or important public rather than private interests requiring adjudication and/or clarification. <em>Adams v.
