We conclude that the Legislature has delegated exclusive authority to the DDD to determine the appropriate placement of a developmentally disabled person eligible for its services. Therefore, a trial court that has placed a developmentally disabled person on CEPP status lacks authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>to override the DDD\u2019s determination of an appropriate residential placement for that person.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">U.C. is a developmentally disabled person with an autistic disorder who received in-home services from the DDD for a substantial number of years. In early 2010, shortly before his eighteenth birthday, U.C. engaged in serious aggressive behavior towards his mother, grandmother, the driver of his school bus van, and other people in the community. Consequently, on February 6, 2010, U.C.\u2019s mother, I.C., had him admitted into the \u201ccrisis intervention services unit\u201d at the Trinitas Regional Medical Center.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">On February 22, 2010, I.C. wrote a letter to the DDD case worker assigned to U.C.\u2019s case requesting his placement in a residential facility for the developmentally disabled. Her letter stated that U.C.\u2019s aggression at home was \u201cout of control\u201d and that he \u201cneeds 24 hours of round the clock care in a residential home where he can live and go to school.\u201d I.C. suggested three facilities that would be appropriate for U.C., including Woods Services in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">On March 4, 2010, the issue of U.C.\u2019s need for continued commitment was brought before the trial court. Based upon a report submitted by the Trinitas medical staff in accordance with <em>Rule </em>4:74-7(e), the court entered an order placing U.C. on CEPP status. This order also directed the DDD case worker assigned to U.C.\u2019s case to appear at the next hearing to give testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>regarding the DDD\u2019s efforts to secure a residential placement for U.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">On March 18, 2010, following a placement review hearing attended by the case worker, the trial court entered an order continuing U.C.\u2019s CEPP status. This order also directed the case worker\u2019s supervisor to appear at the next placement review hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">On April 1, 2010, following a placement review hearing attended by the supervisor, the trial court entered another order continuing U.C.\u2019s CEPP status. By that date, U.C. had turned eighteen and become an adult. This order also directed a higher level DDD supervisor to appear at the next hearing \u201cto appear on placement efforts for [U.C.] \u2014 in view of Woods School placement availability.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">On April 15, 2010, the court entered yet another order continuing U.C.\u2019s CEPP status. This order also stated that the named DDD supervisors \u201cshall be responsible for agency referrals given to advise acceptance or not by April 22nd.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">On April 29, 2010, following another periodic review hearing, the court determined that it had the authority to order the DDD to fund U.C.\u2019s placement in a residential facility selected by the court. The court also determined that Woods Services, which I.C. had suggested in her February 22nd letter to the DDD and a psychiatrist at Trinitas had recommended, was an appropriate placement for U.C. Accordingly, the court entered an order that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">Patient now an adult and DDD having exhausted all New Jersey placement options and this court being satisfied his stay in this unit [within Trinitas] is inappropriate, inadequate and due to his age perhaps illegal, DDD is directed under their funding to make placement at the Woods School in Pennsylvania by May 6th or as soon thereafter as a bed is available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>On May 5, 2010, the DDD sent U.C. a letter, with a copy to I.C., which offered him an \u201cemergency placement\u201d at the Capitol Care group home in Franklin, New Jersey. This letter described the following circumstances warranting the emergency placement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\">You were admitted to Trinitas Hospital in February 2010 due to aggressive behaviors. Following your admission to Trinitas, your mother informed staff that you could not return home as she is no longer able to manage your behaviors. You are, therefore, homeless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The letter also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">The offer of an emergency placement at Capitol Care is intended to meet your basic needs for food, shelter and personal safety, as required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:46B-3.3(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Finally, the letter advised U.C. of his right to appeal under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:46B-5.1 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:48 from the offer of emergency placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Following this offer, the DDD filed a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s April 29th order. The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing regarding this motion on May 13, 2010, at which representatives of the DDD, a representative of Capitol Care, a psychiatrist employed by Trinitas, and I.C. testified. This testimony has only limited relevancy to our disposition of the appeal. Therefore, it is not discussed at this point in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">After the hearing, the trial court issued a brief oral opinion which concluded that the DDD\u2019s offer of emergency placement of U.C. at Capitol Care was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d because it was not in any sense \u201creasonably comparable\u201d to his proposed placement at Woods Services, and denied the DDD\u2019s motion. The court memorialized this ruling by an order entered on May 13, 2010, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">This court entered on April 29, 2010 an order and permitted DDD through counsel to reopen or reconsider such order. Full testimony was permitted by parent/legal guardian and [DDD]. Based on all of the evidence this court finds placement at the Woods School as soon as available is the only appropriate comparable placement alternative. DDD may continue to explore appropriate in state placement therefore and thereafter as they determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">The DDD requested a stay pending appeal, which the trial court denied. U.C. was subsequently placed at Woods Services in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>conformity with the court\u2019s April 29th and May 13th orders. This placement costs the DDD $132,320 annually.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Before considering whether a trial court has the authority to order the DDD to place a developmentally disabled person on CEPP status in a particular facility the court determines to be most appropriate, we address I.C.\u2019s argument that this appeal is moot. I.C. argues that the DDD acquiesced in U.C.\u2019s placement at Woods Services by completing the paperwork required for this placement and failing to take any steps to find an alternative long-term placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">However, the trial court ordered the DDD to place U.C. at Woods Services and denied the DDD\u2019s motion for a stay pending appeal. Although the April 29th and May 13th orders preserved the DDD\u2019s right to \u201ccontinue to explore appropriate in-state placement,\u201d the DDD could reasonably have expected that any determination it made concerning an \u201cappropriate\u201d in-state placement would be subject to the same form of review by the trial court as its determination that Capitol Care was an appropriate emergency placement. The DDD\u2019s appellate brief unequivocally states that it has \u201cfunded U.C.\u2019s placement at Woods only because it was ordered to do so by the commitment court[,]\u201d and that at no point did it \u201cagree to permanently fund U.C.\u2019s placement as it continues to appeal the commitment court\u2019s order.\u201d Moreover, the DDD represents that if it prevails in this appeal, \u201cit will work with U.C. to secure suitable services in accordance with its regulations!,]\u201d which presumably will result in a placement at a facility other than Woods. Under these circumstances, this appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Furthermore, even if the record indicated that the DDD intends to continue U.C.\u2019s placement at Woods Services in light of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>he has now been a resident of that facility for more than a year- and-a-half, we would conclude that this appeal was not moot. U.C. became a resident of Woods rather than Capitol Care only because the trial court so ordered. The DDD represents that other commitment courts have entered similar orders, and therefore, this appeal presents a \u201csignificant and recurring\u201d issue that needs to be resolved to \u201cprovide guidance in future commitment hearings.\u201d Our courts have recognized that even if a controversy becomes moot during the pendency of an appeal, it nevertheless may be appropriate to decide the appeal if the issue it presents is of substantial importance and capable of repetition yet evading review. <em>See In re Commitment of N.N., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>112, 124, 679 A.2d 1174 (1996); <em>In re Commitment of M.C., </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>151, 155-56, 896 A.2d 495 (App.Div.2006). This is such an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The starting point in deciding whether a trial court that has placed a developmentally disabled civil committee on CEPP status has the authority to order the DDD to fund that person\u2019s placement in .a facility the court has determined to be most appropriate is the statutory sections governing the DDD\u2019s provision of services. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-25.1 to -25.9. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-25.2 states that any party listed in that section, including a developmentally disabled person\u2019s \u201cparent or guardian\u201d and \u201cany court of competent jurisdiction in which the issue of mental deficiency may have arisen,\u201d may apply to the Commissioner of Human Services <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to provide functional services for a developmentally disabled person. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-25.3 requires the Commissioner to make a prompt determination of eligibility for such services. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-25.6 provides that the Commissioner shall provide an eligible developmentally disabled person \u201cwith appropriate functional services to the extent available.\u201d Such functional services include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>\u201cboth residential and nonresidential.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-165.2. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-25.6 also provides that \u201c[i]n the event that the functional service which has been specified as most appropriate ... is not immediately available, the commissioner shall provide alternate service and, at the request of the applicant, shall also place the eligible person on a waiting list for the preferred service pending its availability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Under these statutory provisions, \u201cthe decision as to the type and availability of services that any DDD client receives is ... allocated to the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Rosen v. N.J. Div. of Developmental Disabilities, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>629, 641, 607 A.2d 1030 (App.Div.1992), <em>certif. denied, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>440, 627 A.2d 1145 (1993). In exercising this statutorily delegated authority, the \u201cDDD is faced with the daunting and unenviable task of attempting to provide for a large number of clients with inadequate funding for placement of all those in need of service.\u201d <em>J.D. ex rel. D.D.H. v. N.J. Div. of Developmental Disabilities, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516, 522, 748 A.2d 613 (App.Div.2000). \u201cIn order to establish standards and criteria for the placement of eligible persons, DDD has promulgated a comprehensive set of regulations providing guidelines for placement.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see N.J.A.C. </em>10:46B-1.1 to -5.1; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:46C-1.1 to -1.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">These regulations recognize that although \u201cfamilies provide care for most individuals with developmental disabilities!,]\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:46B-2.1(a), \u201cnot all families or caregivers can provide the individual with a living arrangement!,]\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:46B-2.1(c). If a family is unable to care for a developmentally disabled person in its home, the DDD undertakes, within the limits of its funding, to place the person in a residential facility outside the home. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:46B-3.1(c). However, this funding is insufficient to place all developmentally disabled persons who are in need of a residential facility. Consequently, most residential placements are made from waiting lists established under the rules set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number><em>N.J. AC. </em>10.-46C-1.4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">However, in an emergency, a developmentally disabled person may be placed in a residential facility ahead of those on the waiting lists. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:46B-3.2(a); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:46B-3.3. \u201cAn emergency need for services or placement shall be deemed established when the person is homeless or in imminent peril, as defined in <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>10:46B-1.3j.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:46B-3.3(a). \u201cEmergency services shall meet the individual\u2019s basic needs.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:46B-3.3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The DDD determined in its May 5, 2010 letter to U.C. that he was \u201chomeless\u201d because I.C. could no longer care for him at home and that he thus qualified for an emergency placement. The DDD also determined that U.C.\u2019s residential placement at Capitol Care would provide his \u201cbasic needs for food, shelter and personal safety,\u201d as required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:46B-3.3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">If an applicant disputes a DDD decision regarding placement, such as the decision reflected in the DDD\u2019s May 5th letter to U.C., the applicant is entitled to a \u201ctrial-type hearing before the Office of Administrative Law [OAL].\u201d <em>J.E. ex rel. G.E. v. State, Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>552, 560-69, 622 A.2d 227 (1993); see <em>N.J AC. </em>10:48-7.1. If the applicant disagrees with the DDD\u2019s final decision following that hearing, the applicant may appeal to this court. <em>R. </em>2:2-3(a)(2). Thus, the DDD\u2019s exercise of its statutorily delegated authority to make a residential placement decision regarding a developmentally disabled person is subject to the same type of review by administrative hearing before the OAL and appeal to this court as any other decision by a State administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">It is clear from the statutory sections governing the DDD\u2019s provision of services to developmentally disabled persons that the Legislature has delegated exclusive authority to the DDD to determine the appropriate placement of such persons. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>no statutory authorization for any other agency or a court to make a placement decision or to override the DDD\u2019s placement decision. Moreover, the decisions of the Supreme Court and this court reviewing final placement decisions by the DDD all proceed on the implicit premise that the DDD has exclusive authority to make placement decisions, subject to appellate review. <em>See, e.g., P.F. v. N.J. Div. of Developmental Disabilities, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>522, 529-31, 656 A.2d 1 (1995); <em>J.E., supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 564-67, 622 A.2d 227; <em>Rosen, supra, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 641-45, 607 A.2d 1030. Indeed, the Court in <em>J.E. </em>described the administrative appeals procedure, including the right to a hearing before the OAL recognized in that case, as the \u201conly opportunity\u201d a developmentally disabled person or family member has to challenge a DDD placement decision. 131 <em>N.J. </em>at 567, 622 A.2d 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Notwithstanding the Legislature\u2019s delegation of exclusive authority to the DDD to determine the placement of developmentally disabled persons, the trial court concluded that a court that has placed a developmentally disabled civil committee on CEPP status may order the DDD to fund the placement of that person in a particular residential facility. We reject this conclusion and hold that a court conducting a civil commitment proceeding lacks the authority to override the DDD\u2019s determination regarding the residential placement of a developmentally disabled person.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">A trial court\u2019s exercise of authority in a civil commitment proceeding is governed by the statutory sections relating to civil commitments. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.1 to -27.23.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under these sections, a court\u2019s authority is limited to determining whether a person should be involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.12; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.14; <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.15(a)(b), and thereafter, whether that person\u2019s commitment should be continued or the person should be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>charged, with or without conditions. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.15(e); <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.17. In addition, under <em>In re S.L., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>128, 140-42, 462 A.2d 1252 (1983), if the court concludes it has no authority to continue a civil commitment because the person no longer poses a danger to self or others or property by reason of mental illness, but is unable to survive in the community independently or with the help of family or friends, it may continue the former committee\u2019s confinement within the institution in the environment least restrictive of liberty to protect his or her essential well-being, while efforts are made to seek an appropriate placement outside the institution. <em>See also In re Commitment of M.C., supra, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 161-63, 896 A.2d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">However, there is no authorization in these statutory provisions for a trial court to order an agency within the Department of Human Services such as the DDD to place a civil committee or former civil committee discharged on conditions or placed on CEPP status in a particular residential facility. Rather, all of the pertinent statutory provisions indicate that the Legislature has delegated exclusive authority to the Commissioner of Human Services to determine appropriate placements in State institutions and the funding of placements in non-State institutions. The statutory sections governing civil commitments include <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.21(a) and (b), which confer authority upon the Commissioner to transfer a person committed to a State psychiatric facility either to another State psychiatric facility or to a non-State facility. In addition, pertinent to this appeal, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.21(c) provides that if a developmentally disabled person residing in a State development center or other residential placement is committed involuntarily, \u201cthe physical transfer of the developmentally disabled person from the development center or other residential functional services placement to a State or county psychiatric facility and from the facility back to the developmental center or other residential functional services placement shall be on a two-way commissioner\u2019s order of transfer.\u201d Therefore, the statutory sections governing civil commitments reinforce our conclusion, derived primarily from the statutory sections governing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>provision of services by DDD, that the Legislature has delegated exclusive authority to the Commissioner of Human Services to determine appropriate services for developmentally disabled persons, including residential services, which may not be overridden by a trial court presiding over a civil commitment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In arguing that the trial court had the authority to compel the DDD to fund his placement at Woods Services, U.C. relies primarily upon <em>In re S.L., supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>128, 462 A.2d 1252. However, the Court in <em>S.L. </em>recognized that one of the critical factors a court must consider in a placement review hearing is the \u201cavailability\u201d of a placement that will provide the former committee with necessary \u201ccustodial and supportive care.\u201d 94 <em>N.J. </em>at 140-41, 462 A.2d 1252. The Court indicated that \u201c[i]n the event that placement can be arranged in a facility able to provide the care needed in a setting not unduly restrictive of liberty, the court shall order such placement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141, 462 A.2d 1252. In this case, the DDD concluded that Capitol Care could provide such custodial and supportive care for U.C. The trial court had the authority under statutory sections governing civil commitments and <em>S.L. </em>to determine whether Capitol Care could in fact provide this care. However, the trial court had no authority, if it found placement at Capitol Care inappropriate, to order the DDD to fund U.C.\u2019s placement at Woods Services. Instead, as in any other placement review hearing in which a court determines that \u201cimmediate placement is not possible,\u201d the trial court should have \u201ccontinue[d] [U.C.\u2019s] confinement, required[d] [U.C.] be placed in the environment least restrictive of his ... liberty within the institution, and schedule[d] a subsequent placement review hearing to occur within six months.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">As support for the trial court\u2019s decision, U.C. also relies upon a decision by a panel of this court that characterized the perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>anee by the DDD\u2019s predecessor agency of its statutory duties regarding the type of services required by a developmental^ disabled person as \u201cministerial.\u201d <em>In re Commitment of B.R., </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 187, 494 A.2d 333 (App.Div.1985). However, whether or not this was a proper characterization of the services involved in <em>B.R., </em>there was nothing ministerial about the DDD\u2019s decision to reject U.C.\u2019s proposed placement at Woods Services and instead offer him an emergency placement at Capitol Care. A public official\u2019s performance of a statutory responsibility is considered ministerial only if it is \u201cso plain in point of law and so clear in matter of fact that no element of discretion is left as to the precise mode of [its] performance.\u201d <em>Switz v. Twp. of Middletown, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>580, 588, 130 A.2d 15 (1957). The record developed at the evidentiary hearing in this case and the trial court\u2019s opinion clearly demonstrate that the appropriateness of the DDD\u2019s proposed placement of U.C. in Capitol Care involved factual issues and the DDD\u2019s exercise of discretion. <em>See S.I. v. N.J. Div. of Developmental Disabilities, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>251, 263-65, 626 A.2d 466 (App.Div.1993). Therefore, this decision was not ministerial.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Our conclusion that the trial court lacked the authority to override the DDD\u2019s determination that U.C. should be placed in Capitol Care and instead order the DDD to fund his placement at Woods Services is supported by <em>In re Patterson &amp; Bohuk, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 383 A.2d 467 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>469, 391 A.2d 484 (1978). In that case, a trial court ordered the transfer of two prison inmates who had been committed to a maximum security psychiatric facility to a minimum security psychiatric facility based on their statutory right to treatment under the least restrictive conditions. We reversed that order, concluding, based on our review of the statutory sections governing civil commitments and the Commissioner of Human Services\u2019 administration of the State\u2019s mental health system, that the Legislature had delegated exclusive authority to the Commissioner to determine the State mental health facility in which a civil committee-inmate should be confined. <em>Id. </em>at 94-99, 383 A.2d 467. In reaching this conclusion, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>ITIhe Legislature intended the Commissioner to have power to determine where a convicted inmate-patient will be assigned within the system and when the patient should be transferred. We think it unlikely that the Legislature intended to repose a concurrent transfer and placement power in the many ... judges hearing ... commitment cases ... involving convicted and sentenced prisoners. The statutory scheme contemplates a fundamental distinction between commitment in contest to placement and treatment. Commitment is properly a judicial function, but questions of placement and transfers within the system are the Commissioner\u2019s responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 97, 383 A.2d 467.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Similarly, we conclude based on our review of the statutory sections governing civil commitments and the provision of services by the DDD that, although determinations of whether a developmentally disabled person should continue to be committed, discharged with or without conditions, or placed on CEPP status, and whether, if placed on CEPP status, a proposed placement provides the needed custodial and supportive care, are properly judicial functions, any question regarding the proper placement of a developmentally disabled person eligible for the services provided by the DDD, including one on CEPP status, is within the Commissioner\u2019s exclusive authority, subject to administrative review through a hearing before the OAL and judicial review by appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Accordingly, the April 29 and May 13, 2010 orders of the trial court are reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\"> The parties\u2019 appendices do not include an application for U.C.\u2019s involuntary commitment or an order of temporary commitment, as required by <em>Rule </em>4:74-7A(b)(1) and (2). However, since a parent's voluntary admission of a minor for psychiatric evaluation or diagnosis may not continue for more than seven days, <em>see R. </em>4:74-7A(d)(1), there presumably was an application for an involuntary civil commitment and a temporary commitment order that remained in effect until March 4, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b635-11\"> Woods Services was formerly called the Woods School.
