(Control Company) digital thermometer, instead of the Ertco-Hart digital thermometer referenced in <em>State v. Chun, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>54, 89, 135, 152-53, 943 A.2d 114, <em>cert. denied, </em>555 <em>U.S. </em>825, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>158, 172 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008). <em>State v. Holland, </em>422 <em>N.J.Super. </em>185, 27 A.3d 1212 (App.Div.2011). We held that the \u201cErtco-Hart references in <em>Chun </em>are merely identifiers explaining the necessary firmware modifications and foundational documents required with respect to <em>one </em>[digital thermometer,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 196, 27 A.3d 1212, and therefore \u201cthe use of another manufacturer\u2019s [digital thermometer] to calibrate the Alcotest does not <em>alone </em>compel exclusion of test results. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197, 27 A.3d 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Because \u201cthe State still bears the burden of demonstrating \u2018the proper working order\u2019 of the device[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 197, 27 A.3d 1212, and because questions were raised \u201c[b]ased upon the foundational document itself,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 198, 27 A.3d 1212, we remanded the consolidated cases \u201cfor a hearing before a single judge to be designated by the Assignment Judge of Monmouth County to establish the reliability of the Alcotest results and the validity of the Traceable Certificate of Calibration for Digital Thermometer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>at the time of the Alcotest\u2019s calibration in each ease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 27 A.3d 1212. Specifically, the remand court was asked to determine \u201cwhether and how the differences in the [digital thermometers] had any impact at all\u201d on the performance of the singular function required, namely to accurately read and report the temperatures of the simulator solutions during the Alcotest calibration process, <em>id. </em>at 198, 27 A.3d 1212; whether the Control Company certificate suffers from any \u201cfacial irregularity\u201d that would render the use of its digital thermometer improper, <em>id. </em>at 199, 27 A.3d 1212; and whether the Alcotest calibrations at issue in both eases occurred during the period of time covered by the certificate for the digital thermometer used, <em>id. </em>at 199-200, 27 A.3d 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">On remand, the Law Division conducted a three-day hearing during which it heard expert testimony adduced by the State on the comparability of the Control Company and Ertco-Hart digital thermometers and the validity of the Control Company\u2019s certificate establishing National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceability. Following that hearing, the judge, in a thorough, detailed and well-reasoned sixty-seven page written decision, concluded that the Control Company digital thermometer is comparable in all material respects to the Ertco-Hart digital thermometer previously used during the Alcotest calibration process; that the Control Company certificate is facially valid, establishes NIST traceability comparable to the Ertco-Hart certificate, and satisfies' the requirements as a foundational document as required in <em>Chun; </em>and that the calibration of the Alcotests in the Holland and Pizzo matters were both completed within the two-year period of the thermometer\u2019s certification. These findings, in which we concur, find ample support in the facts and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The procedural and factual background of these matters was set forth in our earlier opinion and need not be repeated here save for a brief description of the calibration process, through which a breath test coordinator certifies that an Alcotest is in proper working condition. The calibration process involves the running of three sets of tests, which results in the printing of three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>reports: the Calibration Record, the Part I Control Test, and the Part II Linearity Tests. Prior to commencing these tests, the testing coordinator will prepare several alcohol solutions. The first is a 0.10% alcohol solution for the control test. The others are 0.04%, 0.08% and 0.16% alcohol solutions for the linearity tests. Each of these solutions must be heated to 34.0 degrees Celsius (plus or minus 0.2 degrees), the average range of human breath, which will create vapors that approximate human breath and provide for successful calibration. To do so, the coordinator will allow each solution to heat for approximately one hour and then ensure that they have reached the appropriate temperature using an external NIST-traceable<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> temperature probe.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">As noted, a Control Company digital thermometer was utilized during the calibration of the separate Alcotests which yielded the BAC results at issue here. The Control Company digital thermometer was used to measure the temperature of the various simulator solutions as part of the control and linearity tests during the respective calibrations of the Alcotests in Neptune City (Holland) and Sea Girt (Pizzo). The Control Company digital thermometers are employed for the sole purpose of insuring that the temperature of the various simulator solutions is 34.0 degrees Celsius at the time the control and linearity test portions of the calibrations process are conducted. There is a permissible tolerance of 0.2 degrees Celsius. As such, the temperature of the various simulator solutions used during the various stages of the calibration process must be between 33.8 and 34.2 degrees Celsius. After confirming a simulator solution is at the correct tempera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>ture, the coordinator turns the digital thermometer off, removes it and returns it to its padded plastic container.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Once the coordinator has determined that the alcohol solutions have reached their appropriate temperatures, the coordinator will begin the actual calibration process, which, we emphasize, does not involve the Control Company probe. First, the coordinator will gain access to the Alcotest with the coordinator\u2019s black key temperature probe and conduct a control test with the 0.10% simulator solution. Upon completion of this process, the Calibration Record is printed. If the results of this test are not within the requisite range, the Aleotest will prompt the coordinator to repeat the control test with a new 0.10% simulator solution. If, on the other hand, the results are acceptable, the Part I Control Test certificate is printed. This document records the temperature of the 0.10% simulator solution as measured during the test \u2014 separate from the temperature recorded by the coordinator with the Control Company, or Ertco-Hart, digital thermometer during precalibration preparations. <em>Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 106 n. 24, 943 A.2d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The coordinator will then conduct two linearity tests on each of the three different simulator solutions of 0.04%, 0.08% and 0.16% by again using the coordinator\u2019s black key temperature probe and the Alcotest\u2019s internal thermometer. If the results of the linearity tests are not acceptable, the Alcotest is placed out of service. If, on the other hand, the results are acceptable, the Part II Linearity Tests certificate is printed. Also contained on this certificate are the temperatures of the three solutions as measured during the test \u2014 again separate from that measured by the Control Company digital thermometer during pre-calibration preparations. Lastly, the coordinator uses a solution to generate a Solution Change Report, which will complete the calibration test sequence and print a calibration report.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Against this background, at the remand proceeding, Dr. Howard J. Baum, who is the Director of the New Jersey State Police\u2019s Office of Forensic Sciences and who qualified without objection as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>an expert in the State\u2019s Breath Testing Program and in scientific measurement, first explained the process of replacing the ErtcoHart digital thermometer. According to Baum, the replacement needed to satisfy several requirements including that the instrument provide a precise temperature, with an accuracy of at least 0.01 degrees Celsius between the freezing and boiling points of water \u2014 \u201c0.0 to 100.0\u201d degrees Celsius<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; be traceable to the NIST to ensure that the thermometer would give an accurate result; be calibrated properly by a laboratory that was accredited and complied with international standards for the calibration of thermometers, to ensure both external and independent inspections of the laboratory; and useable only for an Alcotest calibration during the period between its \u201ccalibration date\u201d and its \u201ccalibration due date\u201d (ie., the date on which the calibration of the digital thermometer expires). Baum concluded that the Control Company thermometer satisfied all these requirements and no evidence to the contrary was adduced by defendants Holland and Pizzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Dr. Baum also compared the relevant characteristics of the Control Company and Ertco-Hart thermometers and identified the differences between the two, ultimately concluding that they are comparable in all material aspects and identical in the performance of the singular function required. They both accurately read and report the temperatures of the simulator solutions during the Alcotest calibration process. In this connection, differences in size, weight and power source actually favor use of the Control Company thermometer, which is easier to use, smaller, more portable and does not require a nearby electrical outlet. Most significant, there is no meaningful difference in accuracy. In fact, conditions identified as having the potential to affect accuracy of both instruments are almost identical. Moreover, no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>was presented that the digital thermometers operate differently under divergent ambient humidity conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">On this score, \u201caccuracy\u201d is determined by how close a temperature reading is to what it actually should be. The accuracy for the Control Company thermometer, as noted, is to one hundredth (0.01) of a degree Celsius. While the Ertco-Hart digital thermometer is more \u201caccurate,\u201d namely, to six thousandths (0.006) of a degree, the difference in accuracy is not scientifically significant for purposes of Alcotest calibrations because the breath test coordinators measure in tenths of a degree, and not in the thousandths of a degree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Lastly, no evidence was adduced that the difference in the calibration time periods had any impact on the operation or accuracy of the thermometers. The Ertco-Hart digital thermometer requires calibration annually whereas the Control Company device is calibrated every two years by an accredited scientific laboratory that makes this determination based on available information and is subject to inspection, analysis and examination as part of the accreditation process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any event, here the calibration of the Alcotests in the Holland (May 26, 2009) and Pizzo (March 6, 2009) matters took place within one year of the calibra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>tion of the Control Company digital thermometer (November 18, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We are satisfied that sufficient credible evidence supports the Law Division\u2019s finding that the two digital thermometers are substantially equivalent in all respects necessary to the performance of their singular functions. The differences noted are neither scientifically significant nor relevant to the use of the thermometer in the Alcotest calibration process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Having found comparability, the Law Division then considered whether the Control Company\u2019s Traceable Certificate of Calibration constituted a proper foundational document for the calibration of its digital thermometers, as required by <em>Chun. </em>Based on the undisputed expert proofs, the court found that the Control Company certificate \u201cprovides substantially more ... relevant information [than the Draeger Certificate] regarding the calibration process, the \u2018due dates\u2019 for the equipment used during the calibration process and other pertinent scientific data____\u201d For instance, the Draeger certificate makes no representation as to an accreditation of Draeger at all and thus it cannot be determined on its face whether the one-year period for the certification of the Ertco-Hart thermometer is supported by the scrutiny and independent approval that accreditation provides. In contrast, the Control Company certificate confirms that Control Company is accredited as a calibration laboratory. The certificate also establishes that the Control Company digital thermometer was calibrated prior to its use in the calibration of the Alcotests in the Holland and Pizzo matters and prior to its expiration date, in other words, while the certificate was valid and effective. Moreover, the remand court found no \u201cfacial irregularity\u201d on the certificate that would render use of the Control Company digital thermometer improper, as claimed before the municipal court in the Holland matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Most significant, the certificate, labeled a \u201cTraceable Certificate of Calibration ...,\u201d establishes that the Control Company digital thermometer at issue here was calibrated with instruments traeea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ble to NIST, a characteristic it shares with the Ertco-Hart digital thermometer and which is the only \u201cdiscernable characteristic\u201d emphasized by the <em>Chun </em>Special Master in his findings and conclusions. <em>Holland, supra, </em>422 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 194-96. Yet despite its comparability to the Draeger certificate found acceptable in <em>Chun, </em>defendants contend that to prove the validity of the Control Company certificate, the State must <em>also </em>demonstrate that the <em>measurements </em>made by the digital thermometer are NIST traceable in accordance with requirements listed, described and published on a May 13, 2011 website admitted into evidence in the remand proceeding. <em>Chun, however, </em>imposes no such obligation on the State. On the contrary, the singular requirement imposed upon the State by <em>Chun </em>with regard to the Ertco-Hart digital thermometer was the production, as a foundational document, of the \u201cDraeger Safety Ertco-Hart Calibration Report\u201d during discovery. <em>Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 153, 943 A.2d 114. That document certified the digital thermometer had \u201cbeen tested for accuracy with instrumentation that is traceable to\u201d the NIST, and contains no representation that its <em>measurements </em>were NIST traceable. The Control Company certificate provides an identical certification, representing that the digital thermometer \u201cwas calibrated using Instruments Traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Simply put, the <em>Chun </em>Court did not require a certificate representing that the digital thermometer\u2019s measurements were NIST traceable. Defendants\u2019 attempt to import and apply a website\u2019s definition of \u201cNIST traceable measurements\u201d fails as it seeks to impose a burden on the State beyond the production in discovery of the certificate of calibration required by <em>Chun. </em>Nor does <em>Chun </em>require, as defendants suggest, production of documentation proving the underlying NIST traceability of the instruments used by Control Company to calibrate its digital thermometer. <em>Chun, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>at 144, 943 A.2d 114 (noting that the \u201ctemperature probe documents\u201d document \u201ctests of tests\u201d); <em>see also State v. Maure, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>269, 283, 573 A.2d 186 (App.Div.1990) (\u201cBeyond such tests lie tests of the devices used to test other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>measuring devices. These tests must end somewhere.... We do not doubt defendants\u2019 sincerity in attacking the adequacy of these procedures. However, the oft-heard layman\u2019s opinion that the enforcement of the law can be frustrated by a \u2018legal bag of tricks\u2019 must not be encouraged by slavish adherence to hypertechnical requirements of myriad testings\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>457, 588 A.2d 383 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Lastly, defendant Holland contends for the first time on this appeal after remand that the State\u2019s decision to switch to the Control Company digital thermometer was made without the \u201ccareful consideration\u201d required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.2. Not only was this issue never raised below and therefore not reviewable on appeal, <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973), it is also without substantive merit, <em>Rule </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E), inasmuch as the internal action of the State Police in procuring instruments peripheral and incidental to breath testing devices does not constitute rulemaking that is subject to the provisions of the administrative code. <em>See State v. Garthe, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7-8, 678 A.2d 153 (1996); <em>State v. Cleverley, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>455, 460-61, 792 A.2d 457 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In conclusion, we are satisfied that sufficient credible evidence supports the remand court\u2019s findings that the Control Company digital thermometer is comparable in all material respects to the Ertco-Hart digital thermometer previously used during the Alcotest calibration process, and that the Control Company certificate is facially valid and satisfies the requirements as a foundational document as required by <em>Chun. </em>Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Law Division in the Holland matter suppressing the Aleotest results for failure to provide a Draeger certificate as a requisite foundational document. We affirm that portion of the Law Division\u2019s order in the Pizzo matter holding that the Alcotest results are not inadmissible solely because the State used a Control Company digital thermometer. We remand both matters to the Law Division for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> The Court in <em>Chun </em>required production of a Draeger Safety, Ertco-Hart Digital Temperature Measuring System Report of Calibration, NIST-traceability as a foundational document certifying the reliability of the temperature probe used to ensure the appropriate temperature of the solutions prior to the commencement of calibration of the Alcotest machine. 194 <em>N.J. </em>at 135, 943 A.2d 114. The Court, however, did not require its admission into evidence because the document is \u201cnot fundamentally a part of demonstrating that the particular device was in good working order.\" <em>Id. </em>at 144-45, 943 A.2d 114.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\"> While the calibration of the Alcotest permitted a range for the simulator solutions of between 33.8 to 34.2 degrees Celsius, Baum required that the replacement thermometer read to the one-hundredth of a degree. This would enable it to distinguish between, for example, 33.99 degrees and 34.00 degrees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\"> As noted, the breath test coordinators utilize a permissible range of 33.8 degrees to 34.2 degrees when taking the temperatures of the simulator solutions. As a result, it is irrelevant if the temperature might be at 33.806 degrees (which could be determined with accuracy by the Ertco-Hart digital thermometer) or 33.80 degrees (which can be determined with accuracy by the Control Company digital thermometer).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> The reliability and accuracy of the Control Company digital thermometer was established by testimony setting forth its calibration by an accredited laboratory, which is regularly evaluated on the quality of its procedures, personnel, and work product in accordance with international standards. Accreditation of a manufacturer's laboratory is regularly relied upon by scientists, providing assurances of accuracy and reliability of the scientific equipment purchased without the need for time-consuming personal investigation. It is this accreditation that assured Baum and the coordinators that the Control Company digital thermometer will maintain its calibration for two years, as represented by the manufacturer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
