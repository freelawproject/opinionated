Instead, Schulmann and his wife deducted the commission expenses from the S corporation income that they reported on their personal income tax returns. The Division of Taxation disallowed the deductions. In a published opinion, Judge Mala Narayanan affirmed the Director\u2019s determination. <em>Schulmann v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>25 <em>N.J.Tax </em>573 (Tax 2011). We affirm substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Narayanan\u2019s cogent opinion. We add these comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Smith v. Director, Division of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 32, 527 A.2d 843 (1987), New Jersey\u2019s Gross Income Tax Act (GIT Act) was not based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>federal Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.), and therefore the GIT Act prohibits certain deductions that the I.R.C. allows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">We disagree that the Legislature patterned the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act on the Internal Revenue Code____The federal income tax model was rejected by the Legislature in favor of a gross income tax to avoid the loopholes available under the Code. For example, the Code taxes all income, from whatever source derived, except income expressly exempted from tax. <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 61. On the other hand, the Gross Income Tax Act only taxes expressly identified classes of income. The Code taxes all income on a net consolidated basis. The Gross Income Tax Act taxes some income on a net basis and other income on a gross basis. <em>The Gross Income Tax Act establishes \u201ccategories\u201d of income against which the cross-netting of losses is barred. No such device is included in the Code.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">We agree with the Tax Court that Sehulmann may not deduct payments made out of his S corporation income as a business expense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-1(b) (net income from the operation of a business). Income from an S corporation is a separate income category, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-1(p), and Sehulmann cannot \u201ccross-net\u201d an alleged business expense against his S corporation income.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">The [GIT] Act imposes taxes on distinct and separate categories of income. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-1. Since income is taxed on a category-by-eategory basis, the Act expressly prohibits the netting of income and losses among the different categories. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-2; <em>Walsh v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax </em>180, 184 (Tax 1995); and <em>Marrinan v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>17 <em>N.J.Tax </em>47, 51 (Tax 1997). The Act provides only one category for the reporting of Subchapter S corporation income, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-1(p), which provides for taxation of the \u201c[n]et pro rata share of S corporation income.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-10\"><em>[Miller v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>98, 104, 799 A.2d 660 (App.Div. 2002).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">We also agree with the Tax Court that, regardless of Sehulmann\u2019s reasons for paying the commissions from his own funds, he may not disregard the corporate form by taking personal deductions for paying corporate obligations. <em>See Sidman v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>636 (Tax 2000), <em>aff'd, </em>19 <em>N.J.Tax </em>484 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>387, 788 A.2d 772 (2001). The fact that the S corporations could have taken deductions for the commissions, had they paid them, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-10, <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 162, and <em>I.R.C. </em>\u00a7 1366, does not mean that Sehulmann <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>can deduct them on his personal tax return. \u201c \u2018[W]hile a taxpayer is free to organize his affairs as he chooses, nevertheless, once having done so, he must accept the tax consequences of his choice, whether contemplated or not ..., and may not enjoy the benefit of some other route he might have chosen to follow but did not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gen. Trading Co. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>122, 136, 416 A.2d 37 (1980) (quoting <em>Comm\u2019r v. Nat'l Alfalfa Dehydrating and Milling Co., </em>417 <em>U.S. </em>134, 149, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>2129, 2137, 40 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>717, 727 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-13\"> The somewhat complex system, in which Schulmann-trained martial arts instructors were financially encouraged to open martial arts schools and train other instructors who would, in turn, also open schools, is described in the Tax Court's opinion and need not be repeated here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
