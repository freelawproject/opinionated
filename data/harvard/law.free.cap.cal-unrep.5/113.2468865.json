The rate of interest on each note was fifteen per cent per annum from date of note until payment,, payable and compounded semi-annually, and each note contained the following: \u201cAnd I further agree that, in the event of suit being brought against me, then there shall be added to any judgment against me rendered in said suit, as counsel fees, an additional sum of ten per centum .... upon the amount of the principal and interest hereof accrued at the time of the entry of such judgment.\u201d Each mortgage was expressly given \u201cas security for the payment of\u201d the principal sum of the note, \u201cwith interest thereon according to the terms of the note,\u201d and a copy of the note secured was set out in each mortgage. But-neither mortgage expressly purported to secure the payment of counsel fees in any event. The trial court \u2022 allowed plaintiff counsel fees amounting to $178.91, and held that the payment of them was secured by the mortgages, and ordered that they be paid from the proceeds of the foreclosure sale. Counsel for appellants contends that the court erred in holding that counsel fees were secured by the mortgages, and whether or not they were so secured is the only question pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>sented on this appeal. Upon this question I think the case of Clemens v. Luce, 101 Cal. 432, 35 Pac. 1032, is clearly in point for appellants. In that case the note secured by mortgage provided for the payment of counsel fees in the same language and form as in this case; and the mortgages in that case stated that they were given \u201cas security for the payment to said <em>mortgagee of </em>the sum of $16,000, with interest thereon according to the terms of a certain promissory note, of date September 22, 1891\u201d\u2014setting out a copy of the note\u2014but said nothing about securing counsel fees. In that case this court said: \u201cAs to what these mortgages were given to secure, was a matter of pure contract between the parties. They could have been given to secure the principal of the note alone, or the interest alone, or both principal and interest, as was actually done, or they could have been given to secure future advances, and attorney\u2019s fees in ease of foreclosure. It follows that security for an attorney\u2019s fee is not provided for in either <em>mortgage, and </em>consequently such fee cannot be made a lien upon the land, and the judgment of the court in that regard is erroneous. \u2019 \u2019 This decision has been affirmed. in at least three unreported cases: See list of unreported cases in 101 Cal. xvii. Counsel for respondent cite the case of Ogborn v. Eliason, 77 Ind. 393; but in that case it does not appear that the mortgage purported to secure only the principal and interest of the note, as in the case at bar. For aught that appears in the report of that case, the mortgage may have expressly purported to secure payment of the note according to its terms, without specifying merely the principal and interest, and omitting counsel fees, as in this case. I think the court erred in deciding that the payment of counsel fees was secured by the mortgages, and that the judgment should be modified by subtracting from the total amount adjudged to be secured by the mortgages the sum allowed for attorney\u2019s fees, to wit, $178.91; and, thus modified, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">We concur: Searls, C.; Belcher, C.</p>\n<author id=\"b116-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"AIo\">For the reasons stated in the foregoing opinion the judgment is modified according to that opinion, and, as so modified, is affirmed.
