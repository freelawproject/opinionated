The fact, impliedly found by the court in exercising jurisdiction, that the notice of appeal had been filed, was, under the circumstances, entirely justified. The marking of the filing is not the exclusively competent evidence of the filing of the paper, and the absence of an entry in the justice\u2019s docket is not conclusive proof of the fact that it had not been filed. Writ dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
