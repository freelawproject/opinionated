Doughty and others, is hereby vacated; for, upon further examination of the papers and records, it appears that notice of the first appeal\u2014that from the decree of distribution\u2014was not served upon all of the parties in interest, for that it was not served upon P. E. Whitney, Esq., representing William Bacon and others, and that, therefore, it should be dismissed. Also, as to the appeals attempted to be taken from \u201cthe order, judgment, and decree settling the final account of executors,\u201d no\" opposition being made to the motion to dismiss, and it being conceded upon argument by appellants\u2019 attorney that the said last-mentioned appeals are imperfect, and have been abandoned, it is hereby ordered that each and all of said appeals be, and the same are hereby, dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
