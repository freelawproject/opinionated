United Railroads, 17 Cal.

Commercial Union Fire Ins. Co., 159 Cal. 55, 112 Pae. 861, where the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, examining a witness, had used the expression \u201cwelching insurance companies,\u201d and on objection had then withdrawn it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b197-4\">BELCHER, C.</author>\n<p id=\"A98\">The plaintiff brought this action to recover damages for injuries to his person alleged to have been caused by the negligence of defendant\u2019s servants and employees, in consequence of which he was thrown from one of its moving cars. The answer denied any liability on the part of defendant, and alleged that the injuries sustained by plaintiff \u201cwere occasioned by the negligence of said plaintiff in jumping from said car while the same was in motion, and that the said negligence of said plaintiff proximately contributed to the injuries alleged to have been received by him.\u201d The case was tried before a jury, and by the verdict plaintiff was awarded damages in the sum of $1,000, for which judgment was entered. From this judgment, and an order denying its motion for a new trial, defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">It was proved on behalf of the plaintiff that the car on which he was riding was going at a greater speed than usual, and that on coming to a switch the front wheels passed on to the switch and the hind wheels remained on the main track; that the car was thereupon brought to a sudden stop, and the plaintiff was thrown off, and, when picked up, was found to be badly bruised and unconscious. John W. Tracy was a witness for plaintiff, and was asked: \u201cWas anybody else thrown off of the car?\u201d He answered: \u201cYes, sir; a lady.\u201d J. J. Kerr was a witness for defendant, and on cross-examination was asked if he saw the plaintiff lying on the ground, and answered that he did. He was then asked: \u201cDid you see anybody else lying on the ground besides this man?\u201d \u201cA. Yes, sir; I saw a lady.\u201d \u201cQ. Was she injured?\u201d \u201cA. Not very much. We picked her up.\u201d Similar questions were propounded on cross-examination to defendant\u2019s witness Conrad Trieber. All of these questions were objected to by defendant upon the ground that they were irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent, and the objections were overruled. It is claimed that the questions objected to were not relevant to the issues presented- by the pleadings, and that the testimony as to the injury of the lady tended to prejudice the minds of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>jury against the defendant. The testimony was evidently offered to meet and overcome the defendant\u2019s theory that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by his own negligence in jumping from the car when it was in motion, and for that purpose it was clearly competent and admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\">William Craven was a witness for defendant, and testified that he was an oiler on the electric road of the defendant, his business being to oil the switches and curves; that it was his duty to examine the switches, and see that they were in good order, and that on the day the accident occurred he examined the switch where plaintiff was hurt at about a quarter past 6 in the morning and again about 11 o\u2019clock; and that on both of these occasions it was in good order. He was then asked the following questions: \u201cMr. Craven, was anything omitted that could have been done, that a man of foresight could have advised, or were you as careful as a man could have been to have avoided an accident, on this day?\u201d \u201cWell, now, in your opinion as a railroad man, used to working on railroads, was everything done that could have been done in the matter to obviate or prevent this accident?\u201d Both questions were objected to by plaintiff upon the ground that they were immaterial, irrelevant and incompetent, and the objections were sustained. The rulings of the court were correct; both questions call for the opinion of the witness upon a matter of fact, which was the principal question at issue, and which it was the sole province of the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">A physician was called as a witness for plaintiff, and stated that he was called to see Him on the day he was injured, and then proceeded to testify as to his injuries and condition. He was asked if he had ever examined the patient in consultation with any other physician, and answered that he had, with Dr. F. S. Cook. Dr. Cook was then called as a witness, and \u201cwas examined at length by counsel for plaintiff.\u201d During the examination, counsel for plaintiff asked: \u201cI want to know, doctor, what is the present condition, physically, of the plaintiff?\u201d Defendant objected to the question upon the ground that it was irrelevant, incompetent and immaterial, and that the proper foundation had not been laid for a question of that kind. The Court: \u201cHave you examined him lately?\u201d \u201cA. Yes, sir; some five weeks ago. \u201d The court then ruled that the witness might tell what he found his condition to -be when he examined him physically. It is now claimed that the admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>sion of the testimony of the witness, against the defendant\u2019s objection as to his competency, was error, \u201cin view of the fact that his competency to testify as a medical expert had not been shown.\u201d But it does not appear that he was not competent to testify. He was shown to be a physician, and. was \u201cexamined at length,\u201d and the presumption must be that the proper foundation had been laid to enable him to testify as a medical expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">During the closing argument of counsel for plaintiff to the jury, he remarked, \u2018 \u2018 There is no road in the city and county of San Francisco that has caused so many accidents as this road, as is well known.\u201d An exception to the remark was taken by counsel for defendant, and the court said, \u201cI would not repeat it. \u201d It is claimed that the remark was improper, and tended to prejudice the minds of the jury against defendant. The judgment cannot, in our opinion, be reversed on this ground. The remark, while improper, appears to have been casual, and there is nothing to indicate that the minds of the jurors were or could have been prejudiced by it against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Finally, it is claimed that the evidence was insufficient to justify the verdict, but we think it quite sufficient for that purpose. There was some conflict in the evidence, but that was a matter for solution by the jury and the trial court. The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We concur: Searls, <em>C.; </em>Haynes, C.</p>\n<author id=\"b199-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajs\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
