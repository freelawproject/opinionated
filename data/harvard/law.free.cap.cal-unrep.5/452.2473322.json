The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that his services thns rendered were reasonably worth the sum of $3,400, that he had been paid on account thereof only the sum of $2,260, and prayed judgment for the balance of $1,140. The defendant denied that the reasonable value of plaintiff\u2019s services exceeded $2,260, which had been paid him. The cause was tried by a jury, whose verdict was in favor of plaintiff for $1,140, the sum demanded. The defendant made a motion for a new trial, which was denied, and his appeal is from the order denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">The only point in dispute relates to the value of plaintiff\u2019s services, as to which appellant contends that the verdict is excessive and not justified by the evidence. Upon this issue, however, there was a substantial conflict of evidence, and for this reason the verdict of the jury should not be disturbed. The order denying a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
