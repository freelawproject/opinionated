Defendant placed with plaintiff, as broker, a certain lot for sale, to remain in his hands for one year, with the condition that \u201cif a sale of said property shall be negotiated during that time by the said Chas. Quiggle, directly or indirectly, for the amount stipulated, or any less amount which I may accept, .... I promise to pay the said Chas. Quiggle a commission of five per cent on the amount of said sale.\u201d A broker\u2019s contract, like .any other, is governed by its terms. There is no evidence showing, or tending to show, that plaintiff negotiated a sale of the property placed in his hands. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">.We concur: McFarland, J.; Henshaw, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
