It would subserve no useful purpose to state the evidence, but it is sufficient to say that while, to our minds, it would seem to preponderate strongly in favor of defendants\u2019 contention that the deed was intended as a mortgage, there certainly was direct and positive' evidence tending to support the finding, and of a character to create a substantial conflict. This conflict was to be determined by the jury, and in such a ease we cannot, under long-established principles, disturb their verdict. Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
