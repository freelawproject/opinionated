It would be profitless to state the evidence, or advert specially to the views of counsel for appellants in his very able and ingenious effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>to sustain his contention, since it is clear to us, after a very careful examination of the evidence, that the fact which, under the settled doctrine of this court, bars us from reversing a case upon the facts\u2014a substantial conflict in the evidence\u2014is presented by the record. This conflict is sharply defined upon the two main issues\u2014that of previous reasonable notice of defendants\u2019 intention to make the excavation complained of, and the exercise of reasonable care in doing the work; and while, upon the question of damages suffered, we are inclined to think the lower court adopted rather extreme figures, in view of the testimony of most of plaintiff\u2019s own witnesses, there is evidence to sustain this finding as well, and it cannot therefore be disturbed. The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
