Appeal dismissed, without costs. An order of reference to hear and report is not appealable. We have considered the merits of the appeal, however, and if we did not dismiss we would have affirmed the order in any event. Beldock, P. J., Brennan, Hill, Rabin and Hopkins, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
