Upon a plea of not guilty, trial was had by jury and a verdict of guilty was returned. Appellant was sentenced to the Indiana Reformatory for a term of not less than two (2) nor more than fourteen (14) years.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">On this appeal, the sole assignment of error is that the trial court erroneously overruled appellant\u2019s motion for new trial. Because of the result reached by this court, it will be necessary to discuss only two issues raised by that motion, namely whether the trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to require the prosecutrix to submit to a psychiatric examination, and whether appellant has a constitutional right to be tried for an infamous crime only on grand jury indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">Due to the nature of the facts in this case, we will refrain from reciting the evidence except insofar as is absolutely necessary to substantiate our holding. Suffice it to say that appellant was convicted of the charge against him on the uncorroborated testimony of a ten year old child. Prior to the swearing of the jury, appellant filed his motion to require the prosecutrix to submit to a psychiatric examination. No action was taken on the motion by the trial court apparently until a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>good portion of the child\u2019s testimony had been admitted. At that time it was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">This court, in the case of <em>Burton </em>v. <em>State </em>(1953), 232 Ind. 246, 111 N. E. 2d 892, indicated the importance of allowing for a psychiatric examination of the prosecutrix in cases involving sex offenses. Several factors are present which clearly demonstrate the need for such an examination. See generally, 3 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 924(a) (3rd Ed. 1940); Report, A. B. A. Committee on the Improvement of the Law of Evidence (1937-1938) ; Juviler, Psychiatric Opinions as to Credibility of Witnesses: A Suggested Approach (1960), 48 Cal. L. Rev. 648; Note, 44 Ind. L. J. 106 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In the <em>Burton </em>case, the defendant had been charged with sodomy and was convicted on the uncorroborated testimony of a 10 year old girl. This court, in reversing, held that it could not place itself in the position of the trial judge in determining credibility of the witnesses or the weight of the evidence, yet it must determine whether there was sufficient evidence to uphold the verdict. The clear implication was that some convictions, standing only on the uncorroborated evidence of the prosecutrix, would not be upheld unless the prosecutrix first be subjected to a psychiatric examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The <em>Burton </em>case was overruled insofar as it purported to <em>require </em>any complaining witness to be examined for the purpose of ascertaining her competency before testifying by the case of <em>Wedmore </em>v. <em>State </em>(1957), 237 Ind. 212, 143 N. E. 2d 649:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">\u201cThere is no statute in Indiana making provision for a psychiatric examination of a prosecuting witness in any case (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">The question of stability and mental condition of the prosecuting witness herein concerned her competency and was a matter for the [trial] court to determine</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">If the [trial] court, within its sound discretion, on request of the defendant-appellant herein, had ordered such an examination appellant would thereby have waived the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>right to object to the report of the examining physician if it was adverse to him, and at the same time he would have been given all the protection against fantasy and fabrication on the part of the prosecuting witness ...\u201d 237 Ind. at 221-224, 143 N. E. 2d 653-655.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGD\">As recognized by the <em>Wedmore </em>court, competency is a question for the trial court and it could, within its sound discretion, order a psychiatric examination upon the request of the defendant. No such request was made in that case. It would appear that the <em>Burton </em>rationale was left intact, however, and that a conviction could be reversed where the uncorroborated evidence of the prosecutrix, under the facts and circumstances of the case, was insufficient to support a verdict. <em>Wedmore </em>merely frees the court from any affirmative duty of determining competency by way of a psychiatric examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In the case of <em>Lamar </em>v. <em>State </em>(1964), 245 Ind. 104, 195 N. E. 2d 98, this court held that the trial court\u2019s refusal to appoint a psychiatrist for the purpose of examining the prosecuting witness was not error where the court had specifically noted the demeanor and testimony of the witness and concluded that no examination was necessary. Clearly the <em>Lamar </em>case restated the principle set forth in <em>Wedmore, </em>namely that it is not mandatory upon the trial court to order the examination, but discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"AmI\">Finally, the case of <em>Binder </em>v. <em>State </em>(1966), 248 Ind. 30, 221 N. E. 2d 886, added a qualification to the holding in <em>Wedmore </em>by stating that any request for a psychiatric examination, to be considered, must be made before the prosecutrix\u2019 testimony is in the record. As was there held, defendant cannot wait and hear the evidence to determine whether it is favorable or unfavorable before objecting to the competency of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"Ams\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>From the above cited cases, it is apparent that the defendant has no right to subject a prosecuting witness, in a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>on a sex offense, to a psychiatric examination. The trial court can, however, on timely motion of the defendant, order such an examination where in its sound discretion it determines one to be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Looking to the case at bar, we note several factors which indicate the necessity of an examination, all of which were apparent from appellant\u2019s motion for psychiatric examination or would have become apparent to the trial judge had he conducted a hearing on the prosecutrix\u2019s competency prior to allowing her to testify. To begin with, the prosecutrix, at the time of trial, was just two weeks past her tenth birthday. Ind. Ann. Stat. \u00a7 9-1603 (1956 Repl.) by virtue of Ind. Ann. Stat. \u00a7 2-1714 (1968 Repl.), makes any child under ten years of age incompetent to testify at a criminal prosecution unless it appears that he understands the nature and obligation of an oath. Although the prosecutrix here was ten years old and beyond the statutory age limitation, her borderline age should certainly have weighed heavily in the trial judge\u2019s mind when passing on her competency to testify at this type of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Coupled with the above is the fact that the prosecutrix had implicated other men in acts of sexual misconduct, a fact brought to the attention of the trial judge by appellant\u2019s motion. In addition to appellant, the prosecutrix claimed that her brothers and an uncle had molested her. In fact, from the evidence adduced at trial, it appears that one of her brothers was at that time serving a prison sentence for such misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Further, evidence clearly shows that the prosecutrix admitted telling \u201cstories\u201d some of which directly related to the type of activity for which appellant is on trial. On cross examination, the prosecutrix testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">\u201cQ.

Do you sometimes tell stories like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-29\">A. Not now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Q.

What happened when you got caught? Do you remember what happened when you got caught?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">Q. Did you ever tell a story like that at school ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-12\">A. I don\u2019t think I ever told a story in school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-13\">Q. Where did you tell stories?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-14\">A. Mostly when I went home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-15\">Q. Sometimes you told stories about people if you were mad at them, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-17\">Q. That was a way of getting back at them, wasn\u2019t it, because they were bigger and you couldn\u2019t fight them so you would tell stories about them, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-18\">A. Sometimes whether they were bigger than me or not, I would just tell it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-19\">Q. But sometimes you told stories about them to get back at them, didn\u2019t you, when you were mad at them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-20\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-21\">Q. And the stories you told, you told when you were mad at someone, wouldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-22\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-23\">Again, had the trial judge conducted a hearing prior to allowing the prosecutrix to testify, her propensity to tell \u201cstories\u201d might well have been made apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-24\">Finally, it must be presumed that the trial judge was aware of the opinion held by various legal scholars on the subject of competency when it relates to a female witness testifying at a trial of a sex offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-25\">\u201cNo judge should ever let a sex-offense charge go to the jury unless the female complainant\u2019s social history and mental makeup have been examined and testified to by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>qualified physician.\u201d 3 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 924 (a) (3rd Ed. 1940)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">\u201cToday it is <em>unanimously </em>held, (and we say \u2018unanimously\u2019 advisedly) by experienced psychiatrists that the complainant woman in a sex offense should <em>always </em>be examined by competent experts to ascertain whether she suffers from some mental or moral delusion or tendency, frequently found especially in young girls, causing distortion of the imagination in sex cases.\u201d Report, A. B. A. Committee on the Improvement of the Law of Evidence (1937-38) (our emphasis).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">It may be true, as was stated in the <em>Wedmore </em>case that the prosecuting witness takes the witness stand clothed with a presumption of competency. It may also be true as was there stated that the question of the stability and mental condition of the prosecuting witness is a matter for the court to determine. To hold, however, that in <em>no </em>cases would there ever be a <em>requirement </em>to order such a psychiatric examination would be to make the presumption of competency conclusive and talk of a trial court\u2019s duty to determine such competency mere rhetoric.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">If indeed the trial judge must pass on the competency of a witness, and we are to take seriously the caveats of the various psychiatrists and legal scholars as to the nature of a female witness in such a case, how is the trial judge to make his determination? Would a lay-person, not versed in the subtleties of the human psychic be able to ascertain a deviant personality? The dangers inherent in glibly allowing a prosecuting witness to testify have been amply documented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cThere is, however, at least one situation in which chastity may have a direct connection with veracity, viz. when a woman or young girl testifies as complainant against a man charged with a sexual crime, \u2014 rape, rape under age, seduction, assault. Modern psychiatrists have amply studied the behavior of errant young girls and women coming before the courts in all sorts of cases. Their psychic complexes are multifarious, distorted partly by inherent defects, partly by diseased derangements or abnormal instincts, partly by bad social environment, partly by temporary physiological or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>emotional .conditions. One form taken by these complexes is that of contriving false charges of sexual offenses by men. The unchaste (let us call it) mentality finds incidental but direct expression in the narration of imaginary sex-incidents of which the narrator is the heroine or the victim. On the surface the narration is straight-forward and convincing. The real victim, however, too often in such cases is the innocent men; for the respect and sympathy naturally felt by any tribunal for a wronged female helps to give easy credit to such a plausible tale.\u201d 3 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 924 (a) (3rd Ed. 1940)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201cThe most dangerous witnesses in prosecutions for morality offences are the youthful ones (often mere children) in whom the sex-instinct holds the foremost place in their thoughts and feelings. This intensely erotic propensity often can be detected in the wanton facial expression, the sensuous motions, and the manner of speech. But on the other hand one must not be deceived by a madonna-like countenance that such a girl can readily assume; nor by the convincing upturn of the eyes, with which she seeks to strengthen her credibility. To be sure, the coarse sensuousness of her demeanor, coupled with a pert and forward manner, usually leaves no doubt about her type of thought. Even in her early years can be seen in countenance and demeanor the symptoms of the hussy-type, which in later years enable one at first glance to recognize the hardened prostitute. With profuse falsities they shamelessly speak of the coarsest sex-matters. Having come early into bad practices, they can weave these into their testimony and decorate their narratives with the most plausible details ... It is just such witnesses that often bring into their picture individuals who have never even been near them and that throw suspicion recklessly on the most worthy persons.\u201d Monkemoller, Psychology and Psychopathology of Testimony, Part 2, Chap. B, \u00a7 a6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In light of the manifest possibilities for injustice it seems only reasonable that a trial judge take advantage of the knowledge and expertise of those more qualified to speak on the question of competency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cIt is further fact that in some of these cases [alleged sex offenses] the personality disturbance which lies at the basis of the accusation would not be discernible to laymen, but that the psychiatrist can in many cases give a definite opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ion as to the witness\u2019 mental state after he has made an examination.\u201d Overholser, The Psychiatrist and the Law 54 (1953).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">\u201cIf the psychiatrist were given all the facts about the witness\u2019 background; if he were given time to do a thorough physical and mental examination; if he could take a psychiatric history on the witness, he could give the trial lawyer a solid opinion about testimonial capacity.\u201d Davidson, Testimonial Capacity, 39 Boston U. L. Rev. 172 (1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQK\">The report or testimony of an examining psychiatrist would provide an invaluable aid to the trial judge in making the threshold determination as to the witness\u2019 competency to testify. It is imperative, however, that the determination as to competency be made before the witness takes the stand, if the defendant is not to be unduly prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Consequently we hold that, in view of the particular facts and circumstances of this case as heretofore outlined, the trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant appellant\u2019s timely request for a psychiatric examination of the prosecutrix was in this case not based on sound judicial discretion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018sound judicial discretion\u2019 always brings into question on appeal whether discretion was \u2018wisely or unwisely\u2019 exercised, or \u2018unreasonably exercised,\u2019 or constituted \u2018prejudicial abuse\u2019 of discretion; or, as stated by the Supreme Court of the United States, whether its exercise was \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019.\u201d <em>Allman </em>v. <em>State </em>(1967), 248 Ind. 357, 235 N. E. 2d 56, 59.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">The resulting prejudice being manifestly obvious, a new trial must be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">We next address ourselves to the question of whether appellant can in fact be retired in view of his allegation that he may be constitutionally tried for an infamous crime <em>only </em>on grand jury indictment. Appellant relies on the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution which reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u201cNo person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public <em>danger; </em>. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">This state long ago provided an alternative to the grand jury system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">\u201cAll public offenses, except treason and murder, may be prosecuted in the circuit or criminal court, by affidavit. . .\u201d Acts 1905, ch. 169, \u00a7 118.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Such action was expressly sanctioned in the recent case of <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1962), 369 U. S. 541, 8 L. Ed. 2d 98 wherein it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-S\">\u201cEver since <em>Hurtado </em>v. <em>California, </em>110 U. S. 516, 28 L. ed. 232, 4 S. Ct. 111, (1884), this Court has consistently-held that there is no federal constitutional impediment to dispensing entirely with the grand jury in state prosecutions.\u201d 369 U. S. at 544, 8 L. Ed. 2d at 104.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Clearly, appellant has no recognized constitutional right to be .charged and tried solely by virtue of a grand jury indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">Arterburn, DeBruler and Givan, JJ., concur; Jackson, J., concurs in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 256 N.
