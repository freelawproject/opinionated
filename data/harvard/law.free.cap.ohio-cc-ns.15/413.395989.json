The husband denied her allegations and by way of cross-petition asked for a divorce from her on the ground of gross neglect of duty and adultery. At the hearing the court- dismissed the petition of the wife and granted a decree of. divorce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>to the husband on the ground of gross neglect of duty. As to the charge of adultery the decree recited that \u201cthe court does not make any finding. \u2019 \u2019 The costs were assessed against the wife, and on a subsequent date the court made an entry finding \u201cas a matter of law that it has no power to grant alimony in its discretion, where the divorce is granted for the aggression of the wife.\u201d An appeal w.as taken from this holding to the circuit court. A motion by the husband to dismiss the appeal having been overruled, he filed an answer, alleging that he had no property except what he had inherited; that as a result of illness in his youth he had never been able to earn anything, and that the plaintiff had not in any way helped him to acquire anything and brought no property to the marriage. The case coming on for hearing in the circuit court, the husband offered to produce evidence tending to show that the plaintiff had been guilty of adultery, which evidence the court declined to hear. The case was argued, and on December 17 the court handed down the following opinion:</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-4\">\u201cNo. 5269. Margaret B. Mathers, Plaintiff, vs. Warren Mathers, Defendant; heard on appeal. .</p>\n<judges data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b422-5\">\u201cSwing, J., Giffen, J., and Smith, J.</judges>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-6\">\u201cThis is an action by the plaintiff for alimony. The defendant filed an answer and cross-petition for a divorce, and on the issues thus made,, the ease came on for hearing on June 18, 1910, at which time the court rendered judgment, granting a divorce to the defendant on his cross-petition, on the ground that the plaintiff was guilty of gross neglect of duty, and ordered the petition of the plaintiff, and her amended petition, to be dismissed. No appeal was presented from this judgment, dismissing plaintiff\u2019s petition. On July 2, 1910, the court, on motion, made an entry modifying the decree of June 18, 1910. This decree, among other matters, contained the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-7\">\u201c \u2018And the court further finds that the plaintiff is not entitled to alimony as of right, the divorce being granted to the defendant for the plaintiff\u2019s aggression, and as to any question of alimony, which it may be in the power of the court in its discretion to grant, and as to whether it is in the power of the court to grant alimony in the exercise of discretion, independent of the petition of plaintiff, this cause is continued.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\">\u201cNo appeal was taken from this decree, although an exception was taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u201cOn November 15, 1910, tbe court entered up the following judgment:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-5\">\u2018 \u2018 \u2018 The court taking up the matters left for further consideration, by the order of July 2, 1910, herein, and having duly considered the same, and being fully advised, finds, as a matter of law,- that it has no power to grant alimony in its discretion, when the divorce is granted for the aggression of the wife. \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">\u201cThis last decision is in effect the same as that of July 2, but the court had, on June 18, dismissed the petition of the plaintiff asking for alimony. This petition was the foundation for whatever <em>alimony </em>the court could grant, and when it was dismissed, there was no longer in the court, the power to grant <em>alimony. </em>An appeal should have been taken from the judgment of June 18, 1910. It follows that there is nothing brought before this court on appeal from the judgment of November 15. But it would seem that plaintiff had really lost nothing by her failure to appeal from the judgment of June 18, dismissing her petition for alimony, for the reason that a divorce having been granted the husband, by reason of her aggression, she would not be entitled to .alimony. 68 O. S., 579.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-7\">\u201cAppeal dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-13\">\u2019 Affirmed by the Supreme Court\" without opinion, <em>Mathers v.

Margaret B. Mathers vs. Warren Mathers; heard on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-11\">\u201cSmith, P. J.; Swing, J., and Jones, J., concur.</judges>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-12\">\u201cIn accordance with our construction of the case of <em>Fiesler </em>v. <em>Fiesler, </em>83 O. S., 200, heretofore announced, we are of opinion that plaintiff should be allowed a share of defendant\u2019s property, and adjudge to her as just out .of his real estate such an amount thereof as will equal in value the sum of $2,500.\u201d \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">The husband also prosecuted error to the action of the common pleas court in allowing alimony pendente lite, etc., against him. In that proceeding the circuit court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">(Filed June 5, 1911.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">\u201c5215. Warren Mathers, plaintiff in error, vs. Margaret B. Mathers, defendant in error.</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>\u201cSmith, P. J.; Swung, J., and Jones, J., concur.</judges>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">\u201cWe think the order allowing alimony pendente lite entered July 14th, 1909, ordered the defendant to pay the sum of $60 immediately after the filing of that entry, and that upon the 25th day of that same month and the 25th day of each month thereafter,' the defendant was ordered to pay the sum of $60.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\u201cFrom the language of this order we can place no other construction upon it different than that of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">\u2018 \u2018 While it is true that on June 18, 1910, a divorce was granted to defendant by reason of the aggression of the plaintiff, nevertheless the question of alimony was on July 2, 1910, continued for further and final order by the court. This, therefore, we think left in operation the decree for alimony pendente lite entered by the court July 14, 1909.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">\u201cWe can not see how we can assist defendant in allowing him a credit for thq amount of costs paid. These costs were ordered paid by the'plaintiff, but defendant voluntarily paid them; this liability he assumed but was not compelled to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">\u201cThe court below and this court having found the defendant liable for the installments of alimony, and that they should have been paid as ordered, interest upon the- same would, naturally attach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">\u201cThe judgment of the court below will be affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Error was prosecuted by the husband to the Supreme Court, where the judgment below ivas affirmed without opinion on April 22, 1913, 87 Ohio State. One of the considerations urged upon the Supreme Court by counsel for the husband was that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">\u201cAlimony is nourishment or maintenance, and wherever the word \u2018alimony\u2019 is used in the statutes, it is used with that meaning, and when the word was used in the entries in this case, it was used in its usual sense, which is .not synonomous with that share of the husband\u2019s property which may be adjudged to the erring wife under Section 11993. Such share of the husband\u2019s property is not nourishment or maintenance, which implies a periodical payment for that purpose. A share of the husband\u2019s property, is a payment in a lump sum, often intended to reimburse the wife for what she may have brought to the marriage, or what she may have contributed to the property acquired by the husband after the marriage.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
