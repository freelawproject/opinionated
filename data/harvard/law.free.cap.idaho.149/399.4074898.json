In the single issue presented on appeal, Fields argues that, following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in <em>Danforth v. Minnesota, </em>552 U.S. 264, 128 S.Ct. 1029, 169 L.Ed.2d 859 (2008) \u2014 finding that the federal retroactivity doctrine does not limit the authority of state courts to retroactively apply rules of law for state criminal convictions\u2014 this Court should find that <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584,122 S.Ct. 2428,153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), has retroactive application under Idaho law. We previously addressed this question of law in <em>Rhoades v. State, </em>149 Idaho 130, 233 P.3d 61 (2010), and find that Fields has raised no new argument here. We therefore affirm the dismissal of Fields\u2019s Petition for Post-Conviction Relief and related motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">Fields was convicted of first-degree felony murder by a jury. After the district court judge determined that the State had proven three statutory aggravating factors, the district court judge sentenced Fields to death on March 7, 1991, in line with I.C. \u00a7 19-2515, which governed at the time. Fields\u2019s subsequent appeal, petition for writ of certiorari, and application for post-conviction relief were all denied. <em>State v. Fields, </em>127 Idaho 904, 908 P.2d 1211 (1995), <em>cert. denied, Fields v. Idaho, </em>516 U.S. 922, 116 S.Ct. 319, 133 L.Ed.2d 221 (1995), <em>dismissal aff'd, Fields v. State, </em>135 Idaho 286, 17 P.3d 230 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">Following final judgment in Fields\u2019s case on direct review, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), on June 24, 2002, requiring that a jury, rather than a judge, perform the fact-finding as to the aggravating circumstances required for the imposition of the death penalty. Within 42 days of the issuance of <em>Ring, </em>on August 1, 2002, Fields filed a Petition for Post^Conviction Relief or Writ of Habeas Corpus (Fields\u2019s Petition) along with \u201cMotions to Correct Illegal Sentences, to Vacate Sentences of Death and for New Sentencing Trial\u201d (Fields\u2019s Motions). The State filed its Response and Motion to Dismiss on September 3, 2002. On August 5, 2008, after extensive briefing and motions back-and-forth, the district court issued a Memorandum Decision and Order and accompanying orders dismissing Fields\u2019s Petition and Motions, and granting the State\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, having concluded that <em>Ring </em>is not retroactively applied to cases on collateral review, and that said petition is expressly barred by I.C. \u00a7 19-2719. Fields filed timely notices of appeal on September 12, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">As this Court wrote in <em>Rhoades v. State: </em>\u201cThis Court exercises free review over questions of law. Statutory interpretation is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review. The constitutionality of Idaho\u2019s capital sentencing scheme is likewise a question of law over which this Court exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>cises free review.\u201d 149 Idaho 130, 132, 233 P.3d 61, 63 (2010) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The question before this Court in the present ease is the same question that was before this Court in <em>Rhoades v. State. </em>Namely, whether \u2014 following the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in <em>Danforth v. Minnesota, </em>552 U.S. 264, 128 S.Ct. 1029,169 L.Ed.2d 859 (2008)\u2014 <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), should be applied to eases on collateral review under Idaho\u2019s retroactivity doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Fields states that the only issue he brings before this Court is \u201cwhether Idaho\u2019s retro-activity doctrine compels the application of <em>Ring\u2019s </em>acknowledgement of the right to jury fact-finding in a capital case to persons whose convictions and sentences were final on June 24, 2002, the date the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Ring.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Fields argues that Idaho has traditionally employed the three-prong retroactivity test from <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965), that this Court should apply it here, and that under application of the <em>Linkletter </em>test, <em>Ring </em>should be given retroactive application to cases on collateral review. The State contends that the district court never properly had jurisdiction to consider this case, because I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5)(c) mandates that the case not be given retroactive application or, alternatively, that Idaho should apply the federal retroactivity test created in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), and, under said test, <em>Ring </em>should not be given retroactive application here. Fields argues that I.C. \u00a7 19 \u2014 2719(5)(e) violates both the U.S. and Idaho Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The positions argued by Fields and the State are identical to those we considered in <em>Rhoades, </em>where we expressly adopted and applied the <em>Teague </em>test for retroactivity. 149 Idaho at 133-34, 233 P.3d at 64-65. In <em>Rhoades, </em>this Court found that under the <em>Teague </em>test the rule announced in <em>Ring </em>would not be given retroactive application to cases on collateral review, and therefore declined to address I.C. \u00a7 19 \u2014 2719(5)(e). We fully reaffirm the reasoning and analysis of <em>Rhoades, </em>and affirm the district court\u2019s decision and order on these grounds. We therefore decline to address the State\u2019s arguments pertaining to I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5)(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">As this Court is presented with an identical issue and argument here as we had before us in <em>Rhoades, </em>and as this a pure question of law, we reaffirm our holding in <em>Rhoades </em>\u2014 that Idaho applies the <em>Teague </em>retroactivity test for criminal cases on collateral review, and that under that test <em>Ring </em>is not retroactively applied. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Fields\u2019s requested sentencing relief. We decline to address the State\u2019s arguments concerning I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5)(c).</p>\n<judges id=\"b433-15\">Chief Justice EISMANN and Justices J. JONES, W.

Incidentally, the constitutionality of I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5)(c) was addressed by this Court in <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>State, </em>149 Idaho 35, 232 P.3d 813 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
