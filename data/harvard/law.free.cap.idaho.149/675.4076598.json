Because there is no final order in the administrative proceedings, we vacate the decision of the district court and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-24\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b708-25\">In 1990, the legislature enacted the Idaho Real Estate Appraisers Act, Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 54-4101 to 54-4119. When doing so, it created the Real Estate Appraiser Board (Board) to administer the Act\u2019s provisions. Idaho Code \u00a7 54-4106(1). The Act empowered the Board to investigate the actions of any state certified real estate appraiser and to suspend or revoke the appraiser\u2019s certification for specified reasons. Idaho Code \u00a7 54-4107(1). The Act also granted the Board the power to \u201cauthorize, by written agreement, the bureau of occupational licenses to act as its agent in its interest.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 54-4106(2)(a). Pursuant to that authority, on October 18, 2004, the Board entered into a written agreement with the Bureau of Occupational Licenses (Bureau). That agreement included a provision stating that the Bureau \u201cshall conduct investigations of complaints within the Board\u2019s authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-26\">On January 20, 2005, the Bureau received a letter alleging misconduct by Timothy Williams, a licensed real estate appraiser. The Bureau conducted an investigation and then filed a complaint with the Board alleging nine counts of wrongful conduct by Williams. Williams moved to dismiss those allegations in the complaint that arose from the investigation prompted by the letter. The motion did not specify which allegations should be dismissed, but during oral argument on appeal Williams\u2019s counsel stated it would be seven of the nine counts. At the time the investigation was commenced, the Act provided that the Board \u201cshall upon a written sworn complaint or may upon its own motion investigate the actions of any state certified real estate appraiser.\u201d Ch. 82, \u00a7 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>1990 Idaho Sess. Laws 164, 168 (current version at Idaho Code \u00a7 54-4107(1)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Williams contended that any counts based upon an investigation that was not prompted by either a sworn complaint or a formal motion and vote by the Board must be dismissed. The Board\u2019s hearing officer recommended that the motion to dismiss be denied. The Board issued an order adopting that recommendation and stating that it was a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">On November 21, 2008, Williams filed a petition for judicial review asking the district court to dismiss with prejudice all claims alleged against him by the Board on the ground that the investigation into his alleged misconduct had not been initiated according to law. The district court held that the Board had properly delegated to the Bureau the discretion to initiate investigations. It affirmed the denial of Williams\u2019s motion to dismiss, and he then timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The controlling issue on this appeal is whether the Board\u2019s order denying Williams\u2019s motion to dismiss is an appealable order. The Board has not moved to dismiss the appeal or otherwise raised the issue. \u201c[S]ince the question is jurisdictional (in a procedural sense) it is one which we must act upon whenever and however it comes to our attention.\u201d <em>State ex rel. State Bd. of Medicine v. Smith, </em>80 Idaho 267, 268, 328 P.2d 581, 581 (1958). This Court will, sua sponte, dismiss for lack of jurisdiction an appeal that is taken from a non-appealable order. <em>Highlands Dev. Corp. v. City of Boise, </em>145 Idaho 958, 960, 188 P.3d 900, 902 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">The Board is an \u201cagency\u201d under the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act (IAPA). Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5201(2). Judicial review of agency action is governed by IAPA unless there is another provision of law applicable to the particular matter. Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5270(1). No one contends that there is some other provision of law granting the right to judicial review in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Williams is seeking judicial review of the Board\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss. That order stated, \u201cThis is the Final Order of the Board.\u201d It also stated, \u201cPursuant to Idaho Code Sections 67-5270 and 57-5272, any party aggrieved by this Final Order ... may appeal this Final Order ... to district court by filing a petition in the district court----\u201d An order is not a final order merely because the agency states that it is. <em>Erickson v. Idaho Bd. of Registration of Prof'l Eng\u2019rs and Prof'l Land Surveyors, </em>146 Idaho 852, 854, 203 P.3d 1251, 1253 (2009). \u201cThe real character of a written instrument is to be judged by its contents and substance, not by its title.\u201d <em>Swinehart v. Turner, </em>36 Idaho 450, 452, 211 P. 558, 559 (1922). Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5270(1) provides, \u201cJudicial review of agency action <em>shall be governed </em>by the provisions of this chapter....\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, regardless of whether the agency states that a particular order is subject to judicial review, it is reviewable by a district court under IAPA only if that Act so provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">The Board stated that its order was appealable pursuant to \u201cIdaho Code Sections 67-5270 and 57-5272.\u201d Because there is no section 57-5272 in the Idaho Code, it undoubtedly intended section 67-5272. That statute governs the venue of petitions for judicial review; it does not specify what agency actions are reviewable. Thus, the issue is whether Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5270 authorizes judicial review of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">The proceedings against Williams were a \u201ccontested ease\u201d under IAPA. Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5240. Under Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5270(3), a party can obtain judicial review of \u201ca final order in a contested case.\u201d An \u201corder\u201d is defined as \u201can agency action of particular applicability that determines the legal rights, duties, privileges, immunities, or other legal interests of one (1) or more specific persons.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5201(12). Assuming that the order denying Williams\u2019s motion to dismiss would constitute an \u201corder\u201d under this definition, it was not a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>IAPA does not expressly define what constitutes a <em>final </em>order for the purposes of judicial review. However, Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5271 provides guidance. Subsection (1) states, \u201cA person is not entitled to judicial review of an agency action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> until that person has exhausted all administrative remedies required in this chapter.\u201d Under this subsection, a final order must be one that is not subject to further administrative review. Subsection (2) states, \u201cA preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling is immediately reviewable if review of the final agency action would not provide an adequate remedy.\u201d This subsection distinguishes between a \u201cpreliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling\u201d and \u201cfinal agency action.\u201d In this context, \u201cintermediate\u201d has the same meaning as \u201cinterlocutory.\u201d The definition of \u201cinterlocutory order\u201d is \u201c[a]n order that relates to some intermediate matter in the case; any order other than a final order.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1123 (7th ed.1999). Likewise, in <em>Newell v. Newell, </em>77 Idaho 355, 362, 293 P.2d 663, 667 (1956), we stated, \u201cInterlocutory means provisional, only temporary, not final; not a final decision of the whole controversy; made or done during the progress of an action: intermediate order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In <em>Evans State Bank v. Skeen, </em>30 Idaho 703, 705, 167 P. 1165, 1166 (1917), we explained the difference between a final judgment and an interlocutory or intermediate order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">A final judgment has been defined to be one which disposes of the subject-matter of the controversy or determines the litigation between the parties on its merits. A judgment, order, or decree which is intermediate or incomplete and, while it settles some of the rights of the parties, leaves something remaining to be done in the adjudication of their substantial rights in the case by the court entertaining jurisdiction of the same, is interlocutory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">We have held, \u201cAs a general rule, a final judgment is an order or judgment that ends the lawsuit, adjudicates the subject matter of the controversy, and represents a final determination of the rights of the parties.\u201d Ca<em>mp v. East Fork Ditch Co., Ltd., </em>137 Idaho 850, 867, 55 P.3d 304, 321 (2002). The same requirement applies to a final order under Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5270(3). A final order would be one that resolves all issues, or the last unresolved issue, presented in the contested case so that it constitutes a final determination of the rights of the parties. If issues necessary for a final determination of the parties\u2019 rights remain unresolved, there is no final order. <em>Matter of Nagle, </em>126 Idaho 139, 140, 879 P.2d 602, 603 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">An order simply denying a motion to dismiss is not a final order. <em>Systems Assocs., Inc. v. Motorola Communications and Electronics, Inc., </em>116 Idaho 615, 617, 778 P.2d 737, 739 (1989). The order denying Williams\u2019s motion to dismiss was not a final order because it did not determine or dismiss the issues of misconduct alleged in the complaint. <em>Jensen v. Pillsbury Co., </em>121 Idaho 127, 823 P.2d 161 (1992). In fact, it did not determine any of those issues. <em>See Thornton v. Hickox, </em>126 Idaho 474, 475, 886 P.2d 779, 780 (1994) (\u201c[T]he denial of the motion to dismiss did not dispose of any claim.\u201d). The order would only be reviewable in connection with a petition for judicial review of the final order ultimately entered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Blaha v. Eagle City Council, </em>134 Idaho, 768, 770, 9 P.3d 1234, 1236 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">There is a reason why a petition for judicial review cannot be granted with respect to any intermediate order that the agency decides to label as final. Over 100 years ago, we explained the adverse consequence of the view that all interlocutory orders of the district court should be immediately appealable to this Court. \u201cIf that view prevailed, there would be no such thing as reaching a final judgment in a trial court in a contested case in any reasonable length of time.\u201d <em>Utah Ass\u2019n of Credit Men v. Budge, </em>16 Idaho 751, 757-58, 102 P. 390, 392 (1909). That reasoning also applies to orders issued in contested administrative proceedings. The Board issued its order November 6, 2008. Had it not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>attempted to make that order a final order so that Williams would be required to appeal if he wanted to preserve the issue, this matter would probably already be resolved. The Board\u2019s action has simply delayed the resolution of the allegations against Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Because the district court did not have jurisdiction to hear the petition for judicial review, we vacate its decision. We likewise do not have jurisdiction to decide the issues raised and must dismiss this appeal. We therefore do not address any of the issues raised by the parties on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">We vacate the decision of the district court and dismiss this appeal. We remand this case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the petition for judicial review without prejudice. We do not award costs or attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b711-7\">Justices BURDICK, J. JONES, W. JONES and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\">.
