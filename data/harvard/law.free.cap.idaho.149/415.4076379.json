JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">Michael Brookbank appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company, finding that Jamey Kinsey was not covered under M. Wilmoth Kinsey\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">Brookbank was injured on August 18, 2007, when he collided with Jamey\u2019s dog while riding his motorcycle. The incident occurred in front of Wilmoth\u2019s residence at 3497 East, 300 North, Kimberly, Idaho. Wilmoth is Jamey\u2019s grandmother, and he was allegedly at her residence to pick up a pair of work boots at the time of the incident. While at Wilmoth\u2019s residence, Jamey\u2019s dog jumped out of the back of his truck and ran across the road, colliding with Brookbank\u2019s motorcycle. Brookbank was seriously injured as a result. Brookbank subsequently filed suit against Jamey to recover damages arising from the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">Wilmoth\u2019s property is covered by a Farm and Ranch Squire Policy issued by Farm Bureau to her and the Kinsey Family Limited Partnership. Jamey is not a member of the partnership. Bodily injury and property damage claims are covered under the policy as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">If a claim is made or a suit brought against any insured for damages of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies, we will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-18\">1. Pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the insured is legally liable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-19\">2. Provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-20\">The policy defines \u201cinsured\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-21\">Insured means you or the entity named in the Declarations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-22\">1. If you are an individual, insured also means, if residents of your household, your spouse, your relatives ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKq\">2. If you are a partnership ... insured also means your members and your partners, but only with respect to your partnership or joint venture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-25\">The policy defines \u201crelative\u201d as \u201ca person related to [the policyholder] by blood [or] marriage ... who is a resident of [the policyholder\u2019s] household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-26\">Based on the policy language, Farm Bureau filed this action for declaratory judgment against Jamey and Wilmoth, seeking a determination of whether the policy covered Brookbank\u2019s claim against Jamey. The parties later stipulated to Brookbank\u2019s intervention. Jamey and Wilmoth never formally appeared. After Jamey and Wilmoth were deposed, Farm Bureau and Brookbank filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the sole issue of Jamey\u2019s coverage under the policy; more specifically, whether Jamey was a resident of Wilmoth\u2019s household at the time of the accident. The district court determined that Jamey was not a resident of Wilmoth\u2019s household based on the following facts: Jamey is 38 years old and financially independent of Wilmoth; Jamey had not stayed in Wilmoth\u2019s house since at latest 2001, other than for occasional overnight visits; Jamey normally lives at his girlfriend\u2019s house; Jamey often spends up to 30 days at a time in the hills and mountains; most of Jamey\u2019s clothing is at his girlfriend\u2019s house; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>testimony of Jamey and Wilmoth that Jamey is not a resident of Wilmoth\u2019s household; the lack of a bedroom for Jamey in Wilmoth\u2019s house; and the infrequent contact between Jamey and Wilmoth. Consequently, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Farm Bureau. Brookbank appealed to this Court on the sole issue of whether Jamey is covered under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Issue Presented on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The sole issue presented on appeal is whether the district court erred in determining that Jamey was not a resident of Wilmoth\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">When reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, we apply the same standard used by the district court in ruling on the motion. <em>Van v. Portneuf Med. Ctr., </em>147 Idaho 552, 556, 212 P.3d 982, 986 (2009). \u201cSummary judgment is properly <em>granted </em>when \u2018the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Idaho R. Civ. P. 56(c)). The burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact is on the moving party. <em>Id. </em>We must construe the record in favor of the nonmoving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>If we find that reasonable minds could differ on conclusions drawn from the evidence presented, the motion must be denied. Id. \u201cThe fact that the parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment does not change the applicable standard of review, and this Court must evaluate each party\u2019s motion on its own merits.\u201d <em>Intermountain Forest Mgmt., Inc. v. La. Pac. Corp., </em>136 Idaho 233, 235, 31 P.3d 921, 923 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">Where the case will be tried without a jury, the district court, as the trier of fact, is entitled to draw the most probable inferences from the undisputed evidence properly before it and grant the summary judgment motion in spite of the potential of conflicting inferences. <em>P.O. Ventures, Inc. v. Loucks Family Irrev. Trust, </em>144 Idaho 233, 237, 159 P.3d 870, 874 (2007). \u201cThis Court freely reviews the entire record before the district court to determine whether either side was entitled to judgment as a matter of law and whether inferences drawn by the district court are reasonably supported by the record.\u201d <em>Potlatch Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Potlatch Sch. Dist. No. 285, </em>148 Idaho 630, 633, 226 P.3d 1277, 1280 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">In those limited instances where \u201cthe evidence is entirely confined to a written record, there is no additional, in-court testimony to be obtained, and the trial judge alone will be responsible for choosing the evidentiary facts he deems most probable,\u201d the trial judge may grant summary judgment on undisputed evidentiary facts, despite conflicting inferences. <em>Argyle v. Slemaker, </em>107 Idaho 668, 670-71, 691 P.2d 1283, 1285-86 (Ct.App.1984). In such instances, the appropriate standard of review on appeal is equivalent to the standard of clear error prescribed by I.R.C.P. 52(a). <em>Flemmer v. Tammany Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 3f3, </em>116 Idaho 204, 207 n. 2, 774 P.2d 914, 917 n. 2 (Ct.App.1989). Thus, we examine the record to determine whether the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by substantial and competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">Policy Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">On appeal, Brookbank argues that the phrase \u201cresidents of your household\u201d is ambiguous and that the district court should have construed the ambiguous phrase against Farm Bureau and in favor of coverage. Brookbank also argues that the evidence in the record demonstrates that Jamey was a resident of Wilmoth\u2019s household under the standard set forth in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mocaby, </em>133 Idaho 593, 990 P.2d 1204 (1999), and AID <em>Ins. Co. v. Armstrong, </em>119 Idaho 897, 811 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>P.2d 507 (Ct.App.1991). Brookbank relies on the following facts: Jamey and Wilmoth have a close relationship, Wilmoth pays some of Jamey\u2019s bills and renews his vehicle registration, some of Jamey\u2019s mail is sent to Wilmoth\u2019s address, Wilmoth\u2019s address is listed on the accident report, and Jamey keeps some belongings at Wilmoth\u2019s home. Farm Bureau argues that the district court did not err because testimony of Jamey and Wilmoth established that they did not view Jamey as being a resident of Wilmoth\u2019s household and that Jamey resided with his girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Because insurance policies are contracts of adhesion that are not usually subject to negotiation between the parties, any ambiguity in a policy is construed strongly against the insurer. <em>Mocaby, </em>133 Idaho at 597, 990 P.2d at 1208. Where the language used in an insurance policy is clear and unambiguous, the language must be given its plain, ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>Coverage will be determined according to the plain meaning of the words in the policy. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA provision in an insurance policy is ambiguous if it is reasonably subject to conflicting interpretations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If confronted with ambiguous language, the reviewing court must determine what a reasonable person would understand the language to mean. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The district court in this case, much like this Court in <em>Mocaby </em>and the Court of Appeals in <em>Armstrong, </em>acknowledged that the phrase \u201cresidents of your household\u201d is potentially ambiguous, but found that sufficient evidence was presented to demonstrate that Jamey was not a resident of Wilmoth\u2019s household in spite of any ambiguity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cWhether a person is a resident of a particular place is to be determined from all the facts of each particular case, not from the facts viewed in isolation from one another.\u201d <em>Mocaby, </em>133 Idaho at 598, 990 P.2d at 1209 (quoting <em>Armstrong, </em>119 Idaho at 901, 811 P.2d at 511). Use of the term \u201cresident\u201d generally indicates \u201ca living arrangement with some degree of permanence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Armstrong, </em>119 Idaho at 901, 811 P.2d at 511). The term \u201chousehold\u201d is generally defined \u201cas residents who dwell under the same roof and compose a family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Armstrong, </em>119 Idaho at 901, 811 P.2d at 511); <em>see also </em>9A Plitt, et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 128:8. \u201cFollowing the general tenets of insurance contract interpretation, these terms are given their broad meaning in cases involving the extension of liability coverage and are construed narrowly in those eases involving exclusion from coverage.\u201d 9A Plitt, et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 128:6.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Factors used to determine whether the individuals in <em>Mocaby </em>and <em>Armstrong </em>were residents of a household included: storage of personal belongings in the named insured\u2019s household; \u201cthe presence or absence of a close continuing connection between the individual and the named insured\u201d; maintenance of a bedroom for the individual in the named insured\u2019s household; the frequency of visits to the named insured\u2019s household; and the named insured\u2019s intent concerning the individual\u2019s residence. <em>Mocaby, </em>133 Idaho at 598, 990 P.2d at 1209 (citing <em>Armstrong, </em>119 Idaho at 901, 811 P.2d at 511). This list of factors is not exhaustive and no single factor is controlling. <em>See </em>9A Plitt, et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 128:7. \u201c[Cjourts will weigh a number of factors in determining whether a particular individual could be considered to have been a resident of an insured\u2019s household depending upon the specific facts of that case.\u201d 9A Plitt, et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 128:6. Other considerations include: the amount of time spent in the household; the nature of the living arrangements; the activities undertaken in the residence; the permanence or transient nature of the individual\u2019s presence in the household; the absence of another place of residence or lodging of the individual; and the age and self-sufficiency of the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>In <em>Armstrong, </em>the Court of Appeals applied several of the above factors to determine that the homeowner\u2019s stepdaughter was not a resident of the household for coverage purposes. 119 Idaho at 900-03, 811 P.2d at 510-13. The liability in <em>Armstrong </em>arose from an incident where the homeowner\u2019s stepdaughter, Becky, shot another child in the eye with a BB gun, causing blindness in that eye. <em>Id. </em>at 899, 811 P.2d at 509. Becky lived with her stepparents for five years pri- or to the accident. <em>Id. </em>Then, three months prior to the accident, Becky was sent to live with her natural father. <em>Id. </em>Two weeks after the accident, Becky returned to her stepparents\u2019 residence. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals found that, based on Becky\u2019s stated understanding that she was to permanently live with her natural father, the fact that she had taken all of her belongings with her to his house, the failure to maintain a bedroom in her stepparents\u2019 residence, her lack of visits to her stepparents\u2019 residence during her time with her father, and a lack of close connection with her stepparents, Becky was not a resident of her stepparents\u2019 household at the time of the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 901-02, 811 P.2d 507. The Court of Appeals made this finding in spite of the fact that Becky\u2019s natural father did not have formal custody over her and despite the fact that she returned to her stepparents\u2019 residence shortly after the accident occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 901-03, 811 P.2d at 511-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">This Court made a similar finding in <em>Mocaby. </em>In that case, Cory Crystal shot Marjorie Upton. <em>Mocaby, </em>133 Idaho at 595, 990 P.2d at 1206. Upton\u2019s guardian, Mocaby, tried to recover for Upton\u2019s injuries from Allstate under Crystal\u2019s grandparents\u2019 homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. <em>Id. </em>Allstate brought a declaratory judgment action against Mocaby, seeking a determination that Crystal was not a resident of his grandparents\u2019 home and, thus, not covered under the policy. <em>Id. </em>Crystal\u2019s grandparents voluntarily agreed to have Crystal live with them after being contacted by the Washington Department of Health and Welfare. <em>Id. </em>After arriving at his grandparents\u2019 home, Crystal spent two days with them and then went to Pocatello to stay with friends. <em>Id. </em>Crystal returned to his grandparents\u2019 home intermittently to shower, change clothes, and eat, but he always returned to Pocatello to be with Mends. <em>Id. </em>Crystal also received mail at his grandparents\u2019 home and gave the police his grandparents\u2019 address after the shooting. <em>Id. </em>at 598, 990 P.2d at 1209. ''This Court found that based on all the above facts, along with Crystal\u2019s stated intention not to live with the grandparents, he was not a resident of their household for policy purposes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Brookbank argues that this case is distinguishable from <em>Armstrong </em>and <em>Mocaby. </em>In support of this position, Brookbank principally relies on a California Court of Appeals case, <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. v. Home Indemnity Co., </em>241 Cal.App.2d 303, 50 Cal.Rptr. 508 (Cal.Ct.App.1966). Brook-bank\u2019s reliance on <em>Hardware </em>is misplaced because the case is procedurally and factually distinguishable from the ease at bar, as well as the previous cases decided by this Court on the issue of residence in a household. In <em>Hardware, </em>Bowens was in an auto accident while driving a car owned by his cousin, Madden, that had been stored in the garage of his uncle, Jones. <em>Id. </em>at 304-05, 50 Cal. Rptr. 508. At the time of the accident, Jones and his wife had a family auto insurance policy that provided coverage to any relative who was using a private passenger automobile with the permission of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 304, 50 Cal.Rptr. 508. Relative was defined as \u201ca relative of the named insured who is a resident of the same household.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The insurer, Hardware, refused to defend Bowens under the policy and filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that he was not a resident of the household for purposes of the policy. <em>Id. </em>The trial court found that Bowens was a resident of the Joneses\u2019 household and entitled to coverage under the policy based on the conflicting evidence presented to it. <em>Id. </em>at 305, 50 Cal.Rptr. 508. Evidence was presented that Bowens had an apartment elsewhere and did not live with the Joneses on a permanent basis. <em>Id. </em>at 309, 50 Cal.Rptr. 508. However, evidence was also presented that Bowens had lived with the Joneses for intermittent periods for several years, and that he often spent the night at their home. <em>Id. </em>There was also evidence that the Joneses\u2019 address was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>on Bowens\u2019 driver\u2019s license, that Bowens gave the Joneses\u2019 address and telephone number to the police and hospital after the accident, and that Bowens stayed with the Joneses for at least two weeks after the accident and was contacted at their home by an accident investigator. <em>Id. </em>at 309-10, 50 Cal.Rptr. 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The California Court of Appeals accepted the trial court\u2019s finding that Bowens was a resident of the Joneses\u2019 household for policy purposes because that was a permissible inference from the evidence presented. <em>Id. </em>at 311, 50 Cal.Rptr. 508. However, the finding in <em>Hardware </em>is distinguishable from <em>Armstrong </em>and <em>Moeaby, </em>as well as this case, based on the evidence presented and the inferences that can be drawn from it. First, there was far more conflicting evidence presented in <em>Hardware </em>than in this case or the other Idaho cases. While the Joneses and Bowens testified that he did not live with the Joneses, there was testimony from his roommate and a great deal of circumstantial evidence that indicated that he spent more time with them than he did in his own apartment. Second, the court in <em>Hardware </em>deferred to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The evidence presented in this case demonstrates that it is much more similar to <em>Armstrong </em>and <em>Moeaby </em>than <em>Hardware. </em>The reasonable inferences drawn from the facts presented in this case establish that, although Jamey sometimes visited Wilmoth\u2019s home and occasionally spent the night there, he was not a resident of her home for policy purposes. Brookbank relies on the fact that Jamey and Wilmoth have a close relationship, that Wilmoth pays some of Jamey\u2019s bills and renews his vehicle registration, that some of Jamey\u2019s mail is sent to Wilmoth\u2019s address, that Wilmoth\u2019s address is listed on the accident report, and that Jamey keeps some belongings at Wilmoth\u2019s home. However, much like <em>Moeaby, </em>the record in this matter demonstrates that any potential incidents of residence were more a matter of convenience than indicative of residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The record on appeal supports the district court\u2019s decision. The record before the district court was largely composed of Jamey\u2019s and Wilmoth\u2019s deposition testimony. Jamey testified that he lives with his girlfriend, Vicky Stanger, 98 to 99 percent of the time. He also testified that he occasionally visited his grandmother and sometimes slept on her couch if he was too tired to drive back to Stanger\u2019s home. In his deposition, Jamey explained that he goes on coyote hunting trips into the mountains and hills and is often gone for thirty days at a time. Jamey also explained that the reason he receives some mail at Wilmoth\u2019s address and the reason his driver\u2019s license and truck registration still list that address is because he has never bothered to change the address since the original time of registration and licensing. He notes that he does not really have an address. He also notes that he does not remember giving the police an address and would not have given them Wilmoth\u2019s despite the fact that it appears on the accident report. Further, even had Jamey given the police Wilmoth\u2019s address, the provision of a mailing address is not the same as a statement of intent to reside at that address, as this Court indicated in <em>Moeaby, </em>particularly in light of Jamey\u2019s testimony that he only uses that address as a matter of convenience. Jamey also testified that Wilmoth only handles some of his finances as a matter of convenience because of his transient lifestyle. Finally, Jamey notes that he does not consider himself covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Wilmoth\u2019s testimony is consistent with Jamey\u2019s. She testified that Jamey\u2019s \u201chome base is Hansen\u201d where he resides with Stanger, noting that \u201cwhen he considers himself home, he lives in Hansen.\u201d She also notes that she sees and speaks to Jamey infrequently, about once every few weeks, even though they are close. Wilmoth testified she thought that Jamey\u2019s mailing address was Stanger\u2019s address. Wilmoth also testified that the reason she receives some of Jamey\u2019s mail is because he has no address and some people send his mail to her home because they do not know where else to send it. Both Jamey and Wilmoth note that the bunkhouse Brookbank assumed Jamey lived in is uninhabitable and used mostly for storage and that Jamey has no established bedroom at Wilmoth\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Based on this testimony, we find the district court\u2019s conclusion that Jamey is not a resident of Wilmoth\u2019s household was a reasonable inference to draw from the uncontroverted evidence in the record. Brookbank argues that the Kinseys\u2019 testimony is not entitled to great weight because it is self interested; however, Brookbank made no attempt to present additional evidence demonstrating that their testimony was untrue, even when presented with an opportunity to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, the parties conceded at the close of the summary judgment hearing that the record before the district court was uncontroverted, meaning that the district court\u2019s sole task was to determine whether the reasonable inferences drawn from that evidence entitled either party to judgment as a matter of law. Brookbank points to the documents that list Jamey\u2019s address as Wilmoth\u2019s as evidence of his residency; however, as discussed above, there is ample evidence in the record to support the district court\u2019s finding that those documents were not dispositive. Further, the district court\u2019s decision is consistent with <em>Armstrong, Mocaby, </em>and <em>Hardware. </em>The district court was entitled to rely on the fact that Jamey had no bedroom on the premises, his contact with his Wilmoth was infrequent, he spent much of his time elsewhere, and neither Wilmoth nor Jamey considered Jamey to be a resident of Wilmoth\u2019s household. From this uncontroverted evidence, it is reasonable to infer that Jamey was not a resident of Wilmoth\u2019s household. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Farm Bureau is supported by substantial and competent evidence and is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">Because the district court\u2019s determination that Jamey is not a resident of Wilmoth\u2019s household and not entitled to coverage under the policy is reasonably supported by the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Farm Bureau. Costs are awarded to Farm Bureau.</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-12\">Chief Justice EISMANN, and Justices BURDICK, W. JONES and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">. The terms \"resident\u201d and \"household\u201d are often challenged as being ambiguous in insurance litigation. <em>See </em>9A Steven Plitt, et al., Couch on Insurance \u00a7 128:6 (3d ed. 2009) (\"Some courts have held that the term 'resident' is ambiguous, due to the fact that this term may be subject to various interpretations depending on the context of the case. Likewise, some jurisdictions, focusing on the term 'household,' have held that this term is also ambiguous. Other jurisdictions do not find that these terms are ambiguous on their face. However, under either circumstance, these courts recognize that a determination of whether a person is a resident of a particular household is an elastic concept entirely dependent upon the context in which the question arises.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-4\">. At the conclusion of the hearing on the parties' summary judgment motions, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">THE COURT:....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">From a factual standpoint from objective facts, I don't see any disputed facts in this case.

HAWKINS: I\u2019ll tell you what, because I\u2019ve thought about that, and obviously I read the depositions and as you always do, you kind of go, why didn\u2019t you ask a few more questions? Could we bring [Jamey] in here and cross examine him and resolve the uncomfortable questions in this case? I don't think so. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get a lot more out of him. I think he\u2019ll become more adamant in his opinion, but the facts won\u2019t change. Or, they might change and it will be really complicated. So, yes, I\u2019m comfortable submitting this to the court with the facts that we have and knowing that a cross motion has also been filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-15\">THE COURT: The same question to you Mr. Hepworth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-16\">MR. HEPWORTH: I think [Mr. Hawkins] answered it well. I agree with him. It would be interesting. The other thing I worry about is whether we could even get him in here. He isn\u2019t the most cooperative person. I think you had a hard time getting him into my conference room to be deposed and I don't have any sense that the oath will make him any more honest than he was. I can dig up more evidence, just like Kent said, I can go dig up more, but I think we\u2019re going to get about as good a record as we\u2019re going to get.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-17\">THE COURT: Well, counsel, I am going to take this one under advisement and issue a written opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-18\">As shown by this exchange, even though given the opportunity to do so, the district court and the parties viewed the record as fully developed and the facts as uncontroverted. Thus, the issue is the whether the proper inferences were drawn from the uncontroverted evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
