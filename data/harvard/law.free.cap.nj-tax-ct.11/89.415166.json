(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">KSS Transportation Corp. (KSS), a New Jersey corporation, appeals the final judgment entered in the Tax Court, appearing at 9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>273 (1987), affirming a use tax assessment under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-1 <em>et seq </em>imposed by the Director, Division of Taxation, upon KSS\u2019 out-of-state purchase of an aircraft. The New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Act imposes a tax upon the receipts from every retail sale of tangible personal property unless exempt under the act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-3. KSS claims an exemption under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.35. Alternatively, it claims that a use tax, applied to its out-of-state purchase when the aircraft was flown to other states before being brought into New Jersey, violates the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">KSS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Webcraft Technologies and, as such, is part of a group of entities owned by Beatrice Companies, Inc. Hangered in New Jersey, the aircraft was purchased primarily to transport property and passengers for the Webcraft/Beatrice entities. In fact, its predominant use has been to transport corporate executives for those entities. It has on occasion transported third parties. On those occasions, Webcraft billed the third parties for use of \u201cthe company plane\u201d. When the aircraft was purchased, KSS applied to the Federal Aeronautics Administration for a \u201c135 Air Taxi Commercial Operators Certificate\u201d. At the time the matter was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>decided by the Tax Court, that application was still pending.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the period in question, KSS did not hold itself out to the public as an air carrier and did not advertise its flight services to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The Tax Court found the predominant use of the aircraft was for private, not common, carriage and, thus, the exemption under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.35 was not applicable. 9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 279. With respect to KSS\u2019 constitutional challenge, the court rejected reliance on the \u201ctaxable moment\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at 282-283. In doing so, Judge Lasser adopted the \u201cfour-prong\u201d test espoused in <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, </em>430 <em>U.S. </em>274, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1076, 51 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>326 (1977). He determined there was a sufficient nexus arising from the location of KSS and its hanger facilities in New Jersey and found the tax fairly related to local benefits provided KSS. He further concluded the tax applied uniformly to residents and nonresidents, interstate and intrastate alike. Moreover, he noted no other sales or use tax had been imposed upon the purchase by any other state. Thus, he found the \u201cfour-prong\u201d <em>Complete Auto </em>test was satisifed. <em>Id. </em>at 283, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in Judge Lasser\u2019s published opinion to which we add the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Exemption under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.35 applies in part to receipts from sales of .aircraft when the aircraft is \u201cutilized by an air carrier as defined by the Civil Aeronautics Board or the Code of Federal Regulations ...\u201d. Critical to this determination is whether the aircraft is used as a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d. 49 <em>U.S.C.App. </em>\u00a7 1301(3), (10), (24). \u201cCommon carrier\u201d is not defined by federal statute or regulation. Judge Lasser noted that an FAA advisory circular issued April 24, 1986 titled \u201cPrivate Carriage v. Common Carriage of Persons or Property\u201d, characterizes a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d as a carrier that \u201c \u2018holds itself\u2019 out to the public, or to a segment of the public, as willing to furnish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>transportation within the limits of its facilities to any person who wants it____\u201d This approach is consistent with the common-law concept of common carrier described in <em>Las Vegas Hacienda, Inc. v. C.A.B., </em>298 <em>F.2d </em>430, 434 (9th Cir.1962), <em>cert. </em>den. 369 <em>U.S. </em>885, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>1158, 8 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>286 (1962). Under this definition of common carrier, the test is whether the carrier is \u201ccompeting commercially in the market for the patronage of the general public ...\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The Tax Court agreed with the Director\u2019s position that providing transportation for one\u2019s company-affiliated executives is not \u201ccompeting commercially in the market\u201d for general public patronage. We are not inclined to disagree with the Director\u2019s expertise in this area. <em>Metromedia, Inc., v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 327, 478 A.2d 742 (1984). We note, moreover, KSS has admitted it did not hold itself out to the public as an air carrier and did not advertise its flight services to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">We agree, moreover, that minimal carriage of third parties cannot qualify KSS for exemption. If the Legislature intended the phrase \u201cwhen utilized\u201d to apply to no more than <em>de minimis </em>use, that phrase would have little meaning, <em>Alling Street Urban Renewal Co. v. City of Newark, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>185, 190, 497 A.2d 1287 (App.Div.1985), certif. den., 103 <em>N.J. </em>472, 511 A.2d 653 (1986), and would easily invite subterfuge. Tax statutes ordinarily are approached with the understanding all property should bear its just and equal share of the public burden of taxation. <em>Princeton Univ. Press v. Princeton, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>209, 214, 172 <em>A.</em>2d 420 (1961). If statutory language is unclear and there is no other indication of legislative intent, it is presumed the probable intent is one of inclusion. <em>Fedders Financial Corp. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>376, 386, 476 A.2d 741 (1984). Tax exemptions are strictly construed against those seeking exemption so long as the language or legislative intent is not distorted. <em>Fairlawn Shopper, Inc., v. Div. of Taxation, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>64, 73, 484 A.2d 659 (1984); <em>Mal. Bros. v. Director., Div. of Taxation, </em>124 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 61, 304 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>750 (App.Div.1973), certif. den., 63 <em>N.J. </em>554, 310 A.2d 469 (1973). KSS has not demonstrated it was competing commercially for public patronage when using the aircraft. Simply put, the predominant use was for private carriage and, thus, not entitled to an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">With respect to Judge Lasser\u2019s rejection of KSS\u2019 constitutional challenge, we note only that if there remained any question of the viability of a \u201ctaxable moment\u201d test after <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra, </em>that has been put to rest. <em>See D.H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara, </em>486 <em>U.S. </em>24, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>1619, 100 <em>L.Ed.M. </em>21 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The final judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\"> We understand the application subsequently was withdrawn because KSS sold the aircraft.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
