The plaintiffs later branded several of the defendant\u2019s subsequent discovery demands as \"improper\u201d or \"irrelevant\u201d, even though the court had specifically rejected these claims in an earlier order and directed the plaintiffs to provide responses to these items. We find that the plaintiffs\u2019 deliberate refusal to comply with the foregoing discovery order, considered in conjunction with the plaintiffs\u2019 history of resisting disclosure, fully supports the court\u2019s exercise of discretion in striking the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.
