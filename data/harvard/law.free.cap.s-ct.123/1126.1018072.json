We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">The former military post of Fort Apache dates back to 1870 when the United States established the fort within territory that became the Tribe\u2019s reservation in 1877. In 1922, Congress transferred control of the fort to the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) and, in 1923, set aside about 400 acres, out of some 7,000, for use as the Theodore Roosevelt Indian School. Act of Jan. 24, 1923, ch. 42, 42 Stat. 1187. Congress attended to the fort again in 1960, when it provided by statute that \u201cformer Fort Apache Military Reservation\u201d would be \u201cheld by the United States in trust for the White Mountain Apache Tribe, subject to the right of the Secretary of the Interior to use any part of the land and improvements for administrative or school purposes for as long as they are needed for the purpose.\u201d Pub.L. 86-392, 74 Stat. 8 (1960 Act). The Secretary exercised that right, and although the record does not catalog the uses made by the Department of the Interior, they extended to about 30 of the post\u2019s buildings and appurtenances, a few of which had been built when the Government first occupied the land. Although the National Park Service listed the fort as a national historical site in 1976, the recognition was no augury of fortune, for just over 20 years later the World Monuments Watch placed the fort on its 1998 List of 100 Most Endangered Monuments. Brief for Respondent 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">In 1993, the Tribe commissioned an engineering assessment of the property, resulting in a finding that as of 1998 it would cost about $14 million to rehabilitate the property occupied by the Government in accordance with standards for historic preservation. This is the amount the Tribe sought in 1999, when it sued the United States in the Court of Federal Claims, citing the terms of the 1960 Act, among others,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and alleging breach of fiduciary duty to \u201cmaintain, protect, repair and preserve\u201d the trust property. App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-16\">The United States moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. While the Government acknowledged that the Indian Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505, invested the Court of Federal Claims with jurisdiction to render judgments in certain claims by Indian tribes against the United States, including claims based on an Act of Congress, it stressed that the waiver operated only when underlying substantive law could fairly be interpreted as giving rise to a particular duty, breach of which should be compensable in money damages. The Government contended that jurisdiction was lacking here because no statute or regulation cited by the Tribe could fairly be read as imposing a legal obligation on the Government to maintain or restore the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>trust property, let alone authorizing compensation for breach.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The Court of Federal Claims agreed with the United States and dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, relying primarily on the two seminal cases of tribal trust claims for damages, <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980) <em>(Mitchell I), </em>and <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983) <em>(Mitchell II). Mitchell I </em>held that the Indian General Allotment Act (Allotment Act), 24 Stat. 388, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 331 <em>et seq. </em>(1976 ed.) (\u00a7\u00a7 331-333 repealed 2000) providing that \u201cthe United States does and will hold the land thus alloted ... in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian,\u201d \u00a7 348, <em>Mitchell I, </em>445 U.S., at 541, 100 S.Ct. 1349, established nothing more than a \u201cbare trust\u201d for the benefit of tribal members. <em>Mitchell II, supra, </em>at 224, 103 S.Ct. 2961. The general trust provision established no duty of the United States to manage timber resources, tribal members, rather, being \u201cresponsible for using the land,\u201d \u201coccupy[ing] the land,\u201d and \u201cmanag[ing] the land.\u201d 445 U.S., at 542-543, 100 S.Ct. 1349. The opposite result obtained in <em>Mitchell II, </em>however, based on timber management statutes, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 406-407, 466, and regulations, 25 CFR pt. 163 (1983), under which the United States assumed \u201celaborate control\u201d over the tribal forests. <em>Mitchell II, supra, </em>at 209, 225, 103 S.Ct. 2961. <em>Mitchell II </em>identified a specific trust relationship enforceable by award of damages for breach. 463 U.S., at 225-226, 103 S.Ct. 2961.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Here, the Court of Federal Claims compared the 1960 Act to the Allotment Act in <em>Mitchell I, </em>as creating nothing more than a \u201cbare trust.\u201d It saw in the 1960 Act no mandate that the United States manage the site on behalf of the Tribe, and thus no predicate in the statutes and regulations identified by the Tribe for finding a fiduciary obligation enforceable by monetary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and remanded, on the understanding that the United States\u2019s use of property under the proviso of the 1960 Act triggered the duty of a common-law trustee to act reasonably to preserve any property the Secretary had chosen to utilize, an obligation fairly interpreted as supporting a claim for money damages. The Court of Appeals held that the provision for the Government\u2019s exclusive control over the building actually occupied raised the trust to the level of <em>Mitchell II, </em>in which the trust relationship together with Government\u2019s control over the property triggered a specific responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">Chief Judge Mayer dissented on the understanding that the 1960 Act \u201ccarve[d] out\u201d from the trust the portions of the property that the Government is entitled to use for its own benefit, with the consequence that the Tribe held only a contingent future interest in the property, insufficient to support even a common law action for permissive waste. 249 F.3d 1364, 1384 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">We granted certiorari to decide whether the 1960 Act gives rise to jurisdiction over suits for money damages against the United States, 535 U.S. 1016, 122 S.Ct. 1604, 152 L.Ed.2d 619 (2002), and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">Jurisdiction over any suit against the Government requires a clear statement from the United States waiving sovereign immunity, <em>Mitchell I, supra, </em>at 538-539, 100 S.Ct. 1349, together with a claim fall<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>ing within the terms of the waiver, <em>Mitchell II, supra, </em>at 216-217, 103 S.Ct. 2961. The terms of consent to be sued may not be inferred, but must be \u201cunequivocally expressed,\u201d <em>Mitchell I, supra, </em>at 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349 (quoting <em>United States v. King, </em>395 U.S. 1, 4, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969)) (internal quotation marks omitted), in order to \u201cdefine [a] court\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Mitchell I, supra, </em>at 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349 (quoting <em>United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Tucker Act contains such a waiver, <em>Mitchell II, supra, </em>at 212, 103 S.Ct. 2961, giving the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to award damages upon proof of \u201cany claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1), and its companion statute, the Indian Tucker Act, confers a like waiver for Indian tribal claims that \u201cotherwise would be cognizable in the Court of Federal Claims if the claimant were not an Indian tribe,\u201d \u00a7 1505.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Neither Act, however, creates a substantive right enforceable against the Government by a claim for money damages. <em>Mitchell I, supra, </em>at 538-540, 100 S.Ct. 1349; <em>Mitchell II, supra, </em>at 216, 103 S.Ct. 2961. As we said in <em>Mitchell II, </em>a statute creates a right capable of grounding a claim within the waiver of sovereign immunity if, but only if, it \u201ccan fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained.\u201d 463 U.S., at 217, 103 S.Ct. 2961 (quoting <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 400, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">This \u201cfair interpretation\u201d rule demands a showing demonstrably lower than the standard for the initial waiver of sovereign immunity. \u201cBecause the Tucker Act supplies a waiver of immunity for claims of this nature, the separate statutes and regulations need not provide a second waiver of sovereign immunity, nor need they be construed in the manner appropriate to waivers of sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>Mitchell II, supra, </em>at 218-219, 103 S.Ct. 2961. It is enough, then, that a statute creating a Tucker Act right be reasonably amenable to the reading that it mandates a right of recovery in damages. While the premise to a Tucker Act claim will not be \u201clightly inferred,\u201d 463 U.S., at 218, 103 S.Ct. 2961, a fair inference will do.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">The two <em>Mitchell </em>cases give a sense of when it is fair to infer a fiduciary duty qualifying under the Indian Tucker Act and when it is not. The characterizations of the trust as \u201climited,\u201d <em>Mitchell I, </em>445 U.S., at 542, 100 S.Ct. 1349, or \u201cbare,\u201d <em>Mitchell II, supra, </em>at 224, 103 S.Ct. 2961, distinguish the Allotment Act\u2019s trust-in-name from one with hallmarks of a more conventional fiduciary relationship. See <em>United States v. Navajo Nation, </em>537 U.S. 488, 123 S.Ct. 1079, 1090, 155 L.Ed.2d 60 (2003) (discussing \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Allotment Act in <em>Mitchell I </em>as having \u201cremoved a standard element of a trust relationship\u201d). Although in form the United States \u201ch[e]ld the land ... in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian,\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 348, the statute gave the United States no functional obligations to manage timber; on the contrary, it established that \u201cthe Indian allottee, and not a representative of the United States, is responsible for using the land,\u201d that \u201cthe allottee would occupy the land,\u201d and that \u201cthe allottee, and not the United States, was to manage the land.\u201d <em>Mitchell I, </em>445 U.S., at 542-543, 100 S.Ct. 1349. Thus, we found that Congress did not intend to \u201cimpose any duty\u201d on the Government to manage resources, <em>id., </em>at 542, 100 S.Ct. 1349; cf. <em>Mitchell II, supra, </em>at 217-218, 103 S.Ct. 2961, and we made sense of the trust language, considered without reference to any statute beyond the Allotment Act, as intended \u201cto prevent alienation of the land\u201d and to guarantee that the Indian allottees were \u201cimmune from state taxa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>tion,\u201d <em>Mitchell I, supra, </em>at 544, 100 S.Ct. 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The subsequent case of <em>Mitchell II </em>arose on a claim that did look beyond the Allotment Act, and we found that statutes and regulations specifically addressing the management of timber on allotted lands raised the fair implication that the substantive obligations imposed on the United States by those statutes and regulations were enforceable by damages. The Department of the Interior possessed \u201ccomprehensive control over the harvesting of Indian timber\u201d and \u201cexereise[d] literally daily supervision over [its] harvesting and management,\u201d <em>Mitchell II, supra, </em>at 209, 222, 103 S.Ct. 2961 (quoting <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, </em>448 U.S. 136, 145, 147, 100 S.Ct. 2578, 65 L.Ed.2d 665 (1980)) (internal quotation marks omitted), giving it a \u201cpervasive\u201d role in the sale of timber from Indian lands under regulations addressing \u201cvirtually every aspect of forest management,\u201d <em>Mitchell II, supra, </em>at 219, 220, 103 S.Ct. 2961. As the statutes and regulations gave the United States \u201cfull responsibility to manage Indian resources and land for the benefit of the Indians,\u201d we held that they \u201cdefine[d] ... contours of the United States\u2019 fiduciary responsibilities\u201d beyond the \u201cbare\u201d or minimal level, and thus could \u201cfairly be interpreted as mandating compensation\u201d through money damages if the Government faltered in its responsibility. 463 U.S., at 224-226, 103 S.Ct. 2961.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">The 1960 Act goes beyond a bare trust and permits a fair inference that the Government is subject to duties as a trustee and liable in damages for breach. The statutory language, of course, expressly defines a fiduciary relationship<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the provision that Fort Apache be \u201cheld by the United States in trust for the White Mountain Apache Tribe.\u201d 74 Stat. 8. Unlike the Allotment Act, however, the statute proceeds to invest the United States with discretionary authority to make direct use of portions of the trust corpus. The trust property is \u201csubject to the right of the Secretary of the Interior to use any part of the land and improvements for administrative or school purposes for as long as they are needed for the purpose,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and it is undisputed that the Government has to this day availed itself of its option. As to the property subject to the Government\u2019s actual use, then, the United States has not merely exercised daily supervision but has enjoyed daily occupation, and so has obtained control at least as plenary as its authority over the timber in <em>Mitchell II. </em>While it is true that the 1960 Act does not, like the statutes cited in that case, expressly subject the Government to duties of management and conservation, the fact that the property occupied by the United States is expressly subject to a trust supports a fair inference that an obligation to preserve the property improvements was incumbent on the United States as trustee. This is so because elementary trust law, after all, confirms the commonsense assumption that a fiduciary actually administering trust property may not allow it to fall into ruin on his watch. \u201cOne of the fundamental common-law duties of a trustee is to preserve and maintain trust assets,\u201d <em>Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., </em>472 U.S. 559, 572, 105 S.Ct. 2833, 86 L.Ed.2d 447 (1985) (citing G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>Bogert &amp; G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 582, p. 346 (rev.2d ed.1980)); see <em>United States v. Mason, </em>412 U.S. 391, 398, 93 S.Ct. 2202, 37 L.Ed.2d 22 (1973) (standard of responsibility is \u201csuch care and skill as a man of ordinary prudence would exercise in dealing with his own property\u201d) (quoting 2 A. Scott, Trusts 1408 (3d ed.1967) (internal quotation marks omitted)); Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 176 (1957) (\u201cThe trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary to use reasonable care and skill to preserve the trust property\u201d). Given this duty on the part of the trustee to preserve corpus, \u201cit naturally follows that the Government should be liable in damages for the breach of its fiduciary duties.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Mitchell II, supra, </em>at 226, 103 S.Ct. 2961.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The United States raises three defenses against this conclusion, the first being that the property occupied by the Government is not trust corpus at all. It asserts that in the 1960 Act Congress specifically \u201ccarve[d] out of the trust\u201d the right of the Federal Government to use the property for the Government\u2019s own purposes. Brief for United States 24-25 (emphasis deleted). According to the United States, this carve-out means that the 1960 Act created even less than the \u201cbare trust\u201d in <em>Mitchell I. </em>But this position is at odds with a natural reading of the 1960 Act. It provided that \u201cFort Apache\u201d was subject to the trust; it did not read that the trust consisted of only the property not used by the Secretary. Nor is there any apparent reason to strain to avoid the straightforward reading; it makes sense to treat even the property used by the Government as trust property, since any use the Secretary would make of it would presumably be intended to redound to the benefit of the Tribe in some way.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">Next, the Government contends that no intent to provide a damages remedy is fairly inferable, for the reason that \u201c[t]here is not a word in the 1960 Act\u2014the only substantive source of law on which the Tribe relies\u2014that suggests the existence of such a mandate.\u201d Brief for United States 28. The argument rests, however, on a failure to appreciate either the role of trust law in drawing a fair inference or the scope of <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976), and <em>Army and Air Force Exchange Service v. Sheehan, </em>456 U.S. 728, 102 S.Ct. 2118, 72 L.Ed.2d 520 (1982), cited in support of the Government\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">To the extent that the Government would demand an explicit provision for money damages to support every claim that might be brought under the Tucker Act, it would substitute a plain and explicit statement standard for the less demanding requirement of fair inference that the law was meant to provide a damage remedy for breach of a duty. To begin with, this would leave <em>Mitchell II </em>a wrongly decided case, for one would look in vain for a statute explicitly providing that inadequate timber management would be compensated through a suit for damages. But the more fundamental objection to the Government\u2019s position is that, if carried to its conclusion, it would read the trust relation out of Indian Tucker Act analysis; if a specific provision for damages is needed, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>trust obligation and trust law are not. And this likewise would ignore <em>Mitchell I, </em>where the trust relationship was considered when inferring that the trust obligation was enforceable by damages. To be sure, the fact of the trust alone in <em>Mitchell I </em>did not imply a remedy in damages or even the duty claimed, since the Allotment Act failed to place the United States in a position to discharge the management responsibility asserted. To find a specific duty, a further source of law was needed to provide focus for the trust relationship. But once that focus was provided, general trust law was considered in drawing the inference that Congress intended damages to remedy a breach of obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\"><em>Sheehan </em>and <em>Testan </em>are not to the contrary; they were cases without any trust relationship in the mix of relevant fact, but with affirmative reasons to believe that no damages remedy could have been intended, absent a specific provision. In <em>Shee-han, </em>specific authorization was critical because of a statute that generally granted employees the damages remedy petitioner sought, but \u201cexpressly denie[d] that cause of action\u201d to Army and Air Force Exchange Service personnel, such as petitioner. 456 U.S., at 740, 102 S.Ct. 2118. In <em>Sheehan, </em>resting in part on <em>Testan, </em>the Tucker Act plaintiffs unsuccessfully asserted that the Court of Claims had jurisdiction over a claim against the United States for money damages for allegedly improper job classifications under the Classification Act. We stressed that no provision in the statute \u201cexpressly makes the United States liable,\u201d <em>Testan, </em>424 U.S., at 399, 96 S.Ct. 948, and rather, that there was a longstanding presumption against petitioner\u2019s argument. \u201cThe established rule is that one is not entitled to the benefit of a position until he has been duly appointed to it .... The Classification Act does not purport by its terms to change that rule, and we see no suggestion in it or in its legislative history that Congress intended to alter it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 402, 96 S.Ct. 948. Thus, in both <em>Sheehan </em>and <em>Testan </em>we required an explicit authorization of a damages remedy because of strong indications that Congress did not intend to mandate money damages. Together they show that a fair inference will require an express provision, when the legal current is otherwise against the existence of a cognizable claim. But that was not the case in <em>Mitchell II </em>and is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Finally, the Government argues that the inference of a damages remedy is unsound simply because damages are inappropriate as a remedy for failures of maintenance, prospective injunctive relief being the sole relief tailored to the situation. Reply Brief for United States 19. We think this is clearly wrong. If the Government is suggesting that the recompense for rundown buildings should be an affirmative order to repair them, it is merely proposing the economic (but perhaps cumbersome) equivalent of damages. But if it is suggesting that relief must be limited to an injunction to toe the fiduciary mark in the future, it would bar the courts from making the Tribe whole for deterioration already suffered, and shield the Government against the remedy whose very availability would deter it from wasting trust property in the period before a Tribe has gone to court for injunctive relief. <em>Mitchell II, </em>463 U.S., at 227, 103 S.Ct. 2961 (quoting <em>Mitchell I, </em>445 U.S., at 550, 100 S.Ct. 1349) (\u201cAbsent a retrospective damages remedy, there would be little to deter federal officials from violating their trust duties, at least until the allottees managed to obtain a judicial decree against future breaches of trust\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is affirmed, and the case is remanded to the Court of Federal Claims for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-13\">.

Navajo Nation, </em>537 U.S. 488, 123 S.Ct. 1079, 155 L.Ed.2d 60 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Both <em>Navajo </em>and the instant case are guided by <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980) <em>(Mitchell I), </em>and <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983) <em>(Mitchell II). </em>While <em>Navajo </em>is properly aligned with <em>Mitchell I, </em>this case is properly ranked with Mitchell II. Mitchell I and <em>Mitchell II, </em>as <em>Navajo </em>explains, instruct that \u201c[t]o state a claim cognizable under the Indian Tucker Act ..., a Tribe must identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary or other duties, and allege that the Government has failed faithfully to perform those duties.\u201d <em>Navajo, </em>123 S.Ct., at 1091. If the Tribe satisfies that threshold, \u201cthe court must then determine whether the relevant source of substantive law \u2018can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation for damages sustained as a result of a breach of the duties [the governing law] imposefs].\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Mitchell II, </em>463 U.S., at 219, 103 S.Ct. 2961).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">In this case, the threshold set by the <em>Mitchell </em>eases is met. The 1960 Act, Pub Law 86-392, 74 Stat. 8, provides that Fort Apache shall be \u201cheld by the United States in trust for the White Mountain Apache Tribe\u201d and, at the same time, authorizes the Government to use and occupy the fort. <em>Ante, </em>at 1130. Thus, as the Court here observes, the Act expressly and without qualification employs a term of art (\u201ctrust\u201d) commonly understood to entail certain fiduciary obligations, see <em>ante, </em>at 1131-1132, and \u201cinvestfs] the United States with discretionary authority to make direct use of portions of the trust corpus,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 1133; cf. <em>Navajo, </em>123 S.Ct., at 1092 (\u201cno provision of the IMLA or its regulations contains <em>any </em>trust language with respect to coal leasing\u201d). Further, as the Court describes, the Tribe tenably maintains that the Government has \u201cavailed itself of its option\u201d to \u201cexer-eis[e] daily supervision ... [and] enjo[y] daily occupation\u201d of the trust corpus, <em>ante, </em>at 1133, but has done so in a manner irreconcilable with its caretaker obligations. The dispositive question, accordingly, is whether the 1960 measure, in placing property in trust and simultaneously providing for the Government-trustee\u2019s use and occupancy, is fairly interpreted to mandate compensation for the harm caused by maladministration of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\"><em>Navajo, </em>in contrast, turns on the threshold question whether the Indian Mineral Leasing Act (IMLA) and its regulations impose any concrete substantive obligations, fiduciary or otherwise, on the Government. <em>Navajo </em>answers that question in the negative. The \u201ccontroversy ... falls within <em>Mitchell I\u2019s </em>domain,\u201d <em>Navajo </em>concludes, for \u201cthe Tribe\u2019s claim for compensation ... does not derive from any liability-imposing provision of the IMLA or its implementing regulations.\u201d 123 S.Ct., at 1084. The coal-leasing provisions of the IMLA and its allied regulations, <em>Navajo </em>explains, lacked the characteristics that typify a genuine trust relationship: Those provisions assigned the Secretary of the Interior no managerial role over coal leasing; they did not even establish the \u201climited trust relationship\u201d that existed under the law at issue in <em>Mitchell I. </em>See 123 S.Ct., at 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">In the instant case, as the Court\u2019s opinion develops, the 1960 Act in fact created a trust not fairly characterized as \u201cbare,\u201d given the trustee\u2019s authorized use and management. The plenary control the United States exercises under the Act as sole manager and trustee, I agree, places <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>this case within <em>Mitchell II\u2019s </em>governance.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> To the extent that the Government allowed trust property \u201cto fall into ruin,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 1133, I further agree, a damages remedy is fairly inferable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b947-7\"> <em>Mitchell I </em>does not tug against this placement. The General Allotment Act (GAA) at issue in <em>Mitchell I, </em>445 U.S. 535, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980), narrowly circumscribed its use of the term \"trust\u201d by making \"the Indian allottee, and not a representative of the United States, ... responsible for using the land for agricultural or grazing purposes.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>at 542-543, 100 S.Ct. 1349. The GAA thus removed one of the \"hallmarks of a more conventional fiduciary relationship.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 1132 (citing <em>Navajo, </em>123 S.Ct., at 1090 (the GAA \"removed a standard element of a trust relationship.\u201d)). The 1960 Act, in contrast, does not modify its mandate that the United States hold the property \u201cin trust for the White Mountain Apache Tribe,\u201d except to confirm that the Government-trustee may occupy and use the property. See <em>ante, </em>at 1133 (internal quotation marks omitted). Occupation of the trust corpus by the trustee is a common feature of trusteeship, and does not itself alter the fiduciary obligations that an expressly created trust ordinarily entails.

As the Court has repeatedly held, the test to determine if Congress has conferred a substantive right enforceable against the Government in a suit for money damages is whether an Act \u201ccan fairly be <em>interpreted </em>as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained.\u201d <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 400, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976) (quoting <em>Eastport S.S. Corp. v. United States, </em>178 Ct.Cl. 599, 607, 372 F.2d 1002, 1009 (1967)) (emphasis added). Instead of faithfully applying this test, however, the Court engages in a new inquiry, asking whether common-law trust principles permit a \u201cfair inference\u201d that money damages are available, that finds no support in existing law. <em>Ante, </em>at 1132. But even under the majority\u2019s newly devised approach, there is no basis for finding that Congress intended to create anything other than a \u201cbare trust,\u201d which we have found insufficient to confer jurisdiction on the Court of Federal Claims in <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980) <em>(Mitchell I). </em>Because the 1960 Act \u201ccan[not] fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for damage sustained\u201d by the White Mountain Apache Tribe (Tribe), <em>Testan, supra, </em>at 400, 96 S.Ct. 948, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">In <em>United States v. Testan, supra, </em>at 400, 96 S.Ct. 948, the Court stated that a \u201cgrant of a right of action [for money damages against the United States] must be made with specificity.\u201d Accord, <em>Army and Air Force Exchange Service v. Sheehan, </em>456 U.S. 728, 739, 102 S.Ct. 2118, 72 L.Ed.2d 520 (1982) (stating that, under the Tucker Act, \u201cjurisdiction over respondent\u2019s complaint cannot be premised on the asserted violation of regulations that do not specifically authorize awards of money damages\u201d). The majority agrees that the 1960 Act does not specifically authorize the award of money damages; indeed, the Act does not even \u201cspea[k] in terms of money damages or of a money claim against the United States.\u201d <em>Gnotta v. United States, </em>415 F.2d 1271, 1278 (C.A.8 1969) (Blackmun, J.). Instead, the Court holds that the use of the word \u201ctrust\u201d in the 1960 Act creates a \u201cfair inference\u201d that there is a cause of action for money damages in favor of the Tribe. <em>Ante, </em>at 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">But the Court made clear in <em>Mitchell I </em>that the existence of a trust relationship does not itself create a claim for money damages. The General Allotment Act, the statute at issue in <em>Mitchell I, </em>expressly placed responsibility on the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>to hold lands \u201cin trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian .... \u201d 445 U.S., at 541, 100 S.Ct. 1349 (quoting 24 Stat. 389, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 348). Despite this language, the Court concluded that the congressional intent necessary to render the United States liable for money damages was lacking. The Court reasoned that the General Allotment Act created only a \u201cbare trust\u201d because Congress did \u201cnot <em>unambiguously </em>provide that the United States ha[d] undertaken full fiduciary responsibilities as to the management of allotted lands.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 445 U.S., at 542, 100 S.Ct. 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The statute under review here provides no more evidence of congressional intent to authorize a suit for money damages than the General Allotment Act did in <em>Mitchell I. </em>The Tribe itself acknowledges that the 1960 Act is \u201csilen[t]\u201d not only with respect to money damages, but also with regard to any underlying \u201cmaintenance and protection duties\u201d that can fairly be construed as creating a fiduciary relationship. Brief for Respondent 11; see also 249 F.3d 1364, 1377 (C.A.Fed.2001) (\u201cIt is undisputed that the 1960 Act does not explicitly define the government\u2019s obligations\u201d). Indeed, unlike the statutes and regulations at issue in <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983) <em>(Mitchell II), </em>the 1960 Act does not \u201cestablish ... \u2018comprehensive\u2019 responsibilities of the Federal Government in managing the\u201d Fort Apache property. <em>Id., </em>at 222, 103 S.Ct. 2961. Because there is nothing in the statute that \u201cclearly establish[es] fiduciary obligations of the Government in the management and operation of Indian lands,\u201d the 1960 Act creates only a \u201cbare trust.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 226, 103 S.Ct. 2961.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">In addition, unlike the statutes and regulations at issue in <em>Mitchell I </em>and <em>Mitchell II, </em>\u201c[n]othing in the 1960 Act imposes a fiduciary responsibility to manage the fort for the benefit of the Tribe and, in fact, it specifically carves the government\u2019s right to unrestricted use for the specified purposes out of the trust.\u201d 249 F.3d, at 1384 (Mayer, C. J., dissenting); see also <em>id., </em>at 1375 (\u201cIt is undisputed that the 1960 Act contains no ... requirement\u201d for the United States \u201cto manage the trust corpus for the benefit of the beneficiaries, <em>i.e., </em>the Native Americans\u201d). The 1960 Act authorizes the \u201cSecretary of the Interior to use any part of the land and improvements for administrative or school purposes for as long as they are needed for that purpose.\u201d 74 Stat. 8. The Government\u2019s use of the land does not have to inure to the benefit of the Indians. Nor is there any requirement that the United States cede control over the property now or in the future. Thus, if anything, there is less evidence of a fiduciary relationship in the 1960 Act than there was in the General Allotment Act at issue in <em>Mitchell I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">If Congress intended to create a com-pensable trust relationship between the United States and the Tribe with respect to the Fort Apache property, it provided no indication to this effect in the text of the 1960 Act. Accordingly, I would hold that the 1960 Act created only a \u201cbare trust\u201d between the United States and the Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">In concluding otherwise, the majority gives far too much weight to the Govern-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>merit\u2019s factual \u201ccontrol\u201d over the Fort Apache property, which is all that distinguishes this case from <em>Mitchell I. </em>The majority holds that the United States \u201chas obtained control at least as plenary as its authority over the timber in <em>Mitchell II.\u201d Ante, </em>at 1133. This analysis, however, \u201cmisconstrues ... <em>Mitchell II </em>by focusing on the extent rather than the nature of control necessary to establish a fiduciary relationship.\u201d 46 Fed.Cl. 20, 27 (1999). The \u201ctimber management <em>statutes </em>(3)27 and the <em>regulations </em>promulgated thereunder,\u201d <em>Mitchell II, </em>463 U.S., at 222, 103 S.Ct. 2961 (emphasis added), are what led the Court to conclude that there was \u201cpervasive federal control\u201d in the \u201carea of timber sales and timber management,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 225, n. 29, 103 S.Ct. 2961. But, until now, the Court has never held the United States liable for money damages under the Tucker Act or Indian Tucker Act based on notions of factual control that have no foundation in the actual text of the relevant statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Respondent argues that <em>Mitchell II </em>raised control to talismanic significance in our Indian Tucker Act jurisprudence. To be sure, the Court did state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-6\">\u201c[A] fiduciary relationship necessarily arises when the Government assumes such elaborate control over forests and properties belonging to the Indians .... \u2018[W]here the Federal Government takes on or has control or supervision over tribal monies or properties ... (unless Congress has provided otherwise) even though nothing is said expressly in the authorizing or underlying statute (or other fundamental document) about a trust fund, or a trust or fiduciary connection.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 225, 103 S.Ct. 2961 (quoting <em>Navajo Tribe v. United States, </em>224 Ct.Cl. 171, 183, 624 F.2d 981, 987 (1980)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">However, this case does not involve the level of <em>\u201celaborate </em>control over\u201d the Tribe\u2019s property that the Court found sufficient to create a compensable trust duty in <em>Mitchell II. Mitchell II </em>involved a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d regulatory scheme that \u201caddressed virtually every aspect of forest management,\u201d and under which the United States assumed <em>\u201cfull </em>responsibility to manage Indian resources and land for the benefit of the Indians.\u201d 463 U.S., at 220, 222, 224, 103 S.Ct. 2961 (emphasis added). Here, by contrast, there are no management duties set forth in any \u201cfundamental document,\u201d and thus the United States has the barest degree of control over the Tribe\u2019s property. And, unlike <em>Mitchell II, </em>the bare control that <em>is </em>exercised by the United States over the property does not inure to the benefit of the Indians. <em>Supra, </em>at 1131. In my view, this is more than sufficient to distinguish this case from <em>Mitchell II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Moreover, even assuming that <em>Mitchell II </em>can be read to support the proposition that mere factual control over property is sufficient to create compensable trust duties (which it cannot), the Court has never provided any guidance on the nature and scope of such duties. And, in any event, the Court has never before held that \u201ccontrol\u201d alone can give rise to, as the majority puts it, the specific duty to \u201cpreserve the property.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 1133. Indeed, had Congress wished to create such a duty, it could have done so expressly in the 1960 Act. Its failure to follow that course strongly suggests that Congress did not intend to create a compensable trust relationship between the United States and the Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">In addition, the Court\u2019s focus on control has now rendered the inquiry open-ended, with questions of jurisdiction determined by murky principles of the common law of trusts,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a parcel-by-parcel determination whether \u201cportions of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>were under United States control,\u201d 249 F.3d, at 1383. Such an approach provides little certainty to guide Congress in fashioning legislation that insulates the United States from damages for breach of trust. Instead, to the ultimate detriment of the Tribe, Congress might refrain from creating trust relationships out of apprehension that the use of the word \u201ctrust\u201d will subject the United States to liability for money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">The Court today fashions a new test to determine whether Congress has conferred a substantive right enforceable against the United States in a suit for money damages. In doing so, the Court radically alters the relevant inquiry from one focused on the actual fiduciary duties created by statute or regulation to one divining fiduciary duties out of the use of the word \u201ctrust\u201d and notions of factual control. See <em>ante, </em>at 1133. Because I find no basis for this approach in our case law or in the language of the Indian Tucker Act, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-5\">. The Court of Claims has observed that the relationship between the United States and Indians is not governed by ordinary trust principles: \"The general relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes is not comparable to a private trust relationship. When the source of substantive law intended and recognized only the general, or bare, trust relationship, fiduciary obligations applicable to private trustees are not imposed on the United States. Rather, the general relationship between Indian tribes and [the United States] traditionally has been understood to be in the nature of a guardian-ward relationship. A guardianship is not a trust. The duties of a trustee are more intensive than the duties of some other fiduciaries.\u201d <em>Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. United States, 21 </em>Cl.Ct. 565, 573 (1990) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b949-7\">. Even assuming the common law of trusts is relevant to determining whether a claim of money damages exists against the United States, it is well established that a trustee is not ultimately liable for the costs of upkeep and maintenance of the trust property. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 244 (1957) (\"The trustee is entitled to indemnity out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>the trust estate for expenses properly incurred by him in the administration of the trust\u201d); 3A A. Scott, W. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts \u00a7 244, p. 325 (4th ed. 1988) (\"[The trustee] is entitled to indemnity for liabilities properly incurred for the payment of taxes, for repairs, for improvements ...\"). Besides making the bald assertion that money damages \"naturally follo[w]\u201d from the existence of a trust duty, <em>ante, </em>at 1133 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court makes no attempt to explain how a damages remedy lies against the United States when the same remedy would not be available against a private trustee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
