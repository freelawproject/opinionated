Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 45.02 and 45.03(1) (2000) (regulations) to effect an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation because the regulations compel access to private property for the physical attachment of wires or cables. The judgment also permanently enjoined the department from implementing those regulations to the extent that they applied to private landowners. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">We hold that the second paragraph of the definition of \u201c[ujtility\u201d in 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 45.02, which includes commercial and multiple dwelling unit buildings, reaches private parties who are outside the legislatively granted scope of the department\u2019s authority, and is thus ultra vires.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>45.04(2)(h), concerning complaints received regarding access to such buildings, is similarly invalid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because we decide that the subject regulations are not statutorily authorized, we need not reach the constitutional issue. We vacate the permanent injunction issued by the judge below as unnecessary in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On July 24,2000, the department promulgated regulations under the authority of G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 25A,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>designated as 220 Code Mass Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 45.00.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The purpose and applicability of the regulations is to \u201ceffect[] legislative policy in favor of competition and consumer choice in telecommunications by providing for complaint and enforcement procedures to ensure that telecommunications carriers and cable system operators have nondiscriminatory access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-ways owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by one or more utilities with rates, terms and conditions that are just and reasonable.\u201d 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 45.01.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The first paragraph of the definition of \u201c[ujtility\u201d in 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 45.02 incorporates precisely the definition set forth in the enabling statute, G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 25A. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>However, additional language in the second paragraph extends the definition of \u201cutility\u201d in the regulation to certain buildings not mentioned in \u00a7 25A. See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Having thus defined a utility, the regulations require that \u201c[a] utility shall provide a licensee [defined in 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 45.02 as \u2018any person, firm or corporation other than a utility, which is authorized to construct lines or cables upon, along, under and across public ways . . .\u2019] with nondiscriminatory access to any pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way used or useful, in whole or in part, for the purposes described in [G. L.] c. 166, \u00a7 25A, owned or controlled by it.\u201d 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 45.03(1).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">On November 3, 2000, the plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 25A, did not authorize the department to regulate commercial and residential building owners as \u201cutilities,\u201d nor did it authorize the department to require any private landowner to provide nondiscriminatory access to utility poles, ducts, conduits, and attachments. The plaintiffs requested a declaration that the regulations exceed the department\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 25A, and are thus ultra vires, and that the regulations effect a taking of private property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. A judge in the Superior Court issued an order for judgment for the plaintiffs, declaring that the regulations constituted a taking of property without just compensation in violation of the Massachusetts and United States Constitutions, and he permanently enjoined the department from implementing 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 45.02 and 45.03(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">By agreement of the parties, the judgment was amended to state that the regulations were unconstitutional \u201cto the extent such regulations apply to \u2018[pjrivate [ljandowners,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and further limiting the permanent injunction prohibiting the department from implementing 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 45.02 and 45.03(1), to the \u201cextent such regulations apply to [pjrivate [ljandowners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Statutes regulating utilities in Massachusetts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>first appeared in the mid-1800\u2019s.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These early statutes permitted private parties to erect and construct wires for telegraph, telephone, and electricity in public ways with permission of the local governing board, and subject to the condition that local authorities could allow other users to obtain access to those poles. See G. L. c. 166, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 24. Today, the definition of a \u201cutility\u201d in G. L. c. 166 (telephone and telegraph companies and lines for transmission of electricity) still includes \u201ca person\u201d who has been or may be granted authority to construct or maintain poles and associated wires in public ways for the purpose of transmitting electricity or telecommunications signals. See G. L. c. 166, \u00a7\u00a7 22A (/), 23 (\u201ccitizens\u201d), 24, 25A.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Thus, the enabling legislation under which the department adopted the regulations in question has a long history of defining a utility as including private individuals, where those individuals request access to public ways in order to install poles, or to run wires or lines for the transmission of electricity or telecommunications signals. The enabling legislation historically has also included persons who were providers of electricity or telecommunications. It has never included as a utility a recipient of electricity or telecommunications. \u201cStatutes are to be construed in the light of the preexisting common and statutory law .... It is not to be lightly supposed that radical changes in the law were intended where not plainly expressed.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Ferullo\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 635, 637 (1954). The regulations at issue, however, purport to regulate, as utilities, private persons who have not requested access to the public ways in order to act as a provider of such services, but who are merely recipients of such services. See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 45.02, second par.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The department essentially asserts that 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 45.02 and 45.03(1) properly allow a provider of telecom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>munications services (a licensee) to insert new wires into the ducts and conduits or onto the poles or building of a private landowner who is a recipient of telecommunications services. It reaches this conclusion by analogy: a private landowner, by \u201cinviting in\u201d the first telecommunications provider is the equivalent of the private landowner going to the board of selectmen in his town and applying for permission to run wires in a public way. He has, it concludes, opened himself up to expanded use of those ways by that initial use of those ways. The department asserts that all that the regulations require of the private landowner is that he not discriminate in providing further access to his poles, ducts, or conduits. This analogy fails. The department\u2019s expansion of the definition of \u201cutility\u201d to include a recipient of services is a radical change in the historical use of the word by the legislature. Absent any legislative support for the department\u2019s construction, we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">There is additional reason for construing the statute so as to conclude that the department has not been given authority to regulate passive recipients of utility services, but only the active providers of those services. General Laws c. 159, \u00a7 12,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the broad enabling legislation for the department, confers authority to supervise and regulate telecommunications companies and services that are furnishing or rendering those services for public use. See <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>New Bedford, Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>329 Mass. 243, 249-250 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>(1952) (\u201cIt is plain . . . that the power of supervision and regulation granted by c. 159 over services furnished or rendered by common carriers is intended to apply only to such services when furnished or rendered by the agencies therein specified\u201d). See note 12, <em>supra. </em>The specific authority of the department to regulate the use of poles, ducts and conduits under G. L. c. 166 (\u201cTelephone and Telegraph Companies, and Lines for the Transmission of Electricity\u201d), must be construed in harmony with the broad authority to regulate these utilities in the first instance under G. L. c. 159 (Common Carriers). See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>431 Mass. 638, 646 (2000), and cases cited. In this case, the regulations at issue are designed to regulate private property owners who do not fall within the class of persons that the Legislature has authorized the department to regulate and, as such, are ultra vires of the enabling legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">We hold that the second paragraph of the definition of \u201c[u]tility\u201d appearing in 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 45.02, as it applies to commercial and multiple dwelling unit buildings, is ultra vires of the department\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 25A.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It necessarily follows that \u00a7 45.04(2)(h) (concerning complaints received regarding access to such buildings) is also invalid. Because \u00a7 45.03(1) no longer applies to such buildings or to \u201cprivate landowners,\u201d the basis for challenging its validity in this appeal is ehminated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We vacate the order for injunctive relief because it is not necessary in the circumstances. See <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>379 Mass. 703, 730 (1980) (injunction should be no more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>intrusive than necessary to accomplish legally justified result, especially where public officials are object of injunction).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The case is remanded to the Superior Court for an order vacating both the injunction and the declaratory judgment. A judgment is to enter declaring that both the second paragraph of the definition of \u201c[ujtility\u201d in 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 45.02 and 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 45.04(2)(h) are invalid as beyond the authority of the Department of Telecommunications and Energy under G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 25A.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b220-11\"> The second paragraph of the definition of \u201c[ujtility,\u201d appearing in 220 Code Mass.
