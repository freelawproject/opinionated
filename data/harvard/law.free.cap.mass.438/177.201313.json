Both the city and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Local 378 (union) appealed from that determination. The Appeals Court held that the commission\u2019s decision and order were insufficient, in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>they required the city to bargain only over the impacts of the decision, whereas the city also had a duty to bargain over the decision itself. <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 106 (2001). We granted the city\u2019s application for further appellate review. For the following reasons, we hold that the city is not required to bargain over the decision to assign truancy enforcement duties to its police officers, and we affirm the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">1. <em>Facts and commission proceedings. </em>The commission found the following facts. The union is the exclusive bargaining representative of a unit consisting of all full-time officers below the rank of sergeant employed by the city\u2019s police department. The union and the city were parties to a collective bargaining agreement at all relevant times. On September 16, 1996, the chief of police advised all commanding officers of a special order to be implemented immediately. The union was not given notice and an opportunity to bargain concerning that special order, its impact, or its implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The special order recited that, on August 26, 1996, the city manager had designated all police officers as \u201csupervisors of attendance with the authority to exercise the duties specified in G. L. c. 76, \u00a7\u00a7 19 and 20, which include the power to apprehend and take to school without a warrant any truant or absentee found wandering in the streets or public places.\u201d The special order proceeded to announce certain mandatory procedures for officer interactions with truants. Whenever an officer encountered a student outside school premises during school hours, the officer was to inquire whether the student was in fact truant, obtaining the student\u2019s name and school. The officer was then to contact the dispatcher, who would in turn contact the school to ascertain the student\u2019s status.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the school confirmed the truancy, the officer was to offer the student transportation to a student attendance center (or, in the case of a vocational school student, to a specified administrative office). If the student accepted the offer of transportation, the student was to be transported by cruiser (not patrol wagon) and without restraints. A patfrisk was to be performed if there was reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>able suspicion that the student was armed, and items in the student\u2019s possession were to be kept on the front passenger seat. After transporting the student, the officer was to file an incident report, including the student\u2019s name, address, age, and date of birth; location of the contact; and the name of the person to whom the student was delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">These procedures applied only to those students who voluntarily accepted the offer of transportation. If the student declined the offer, or otherwise resisted or fled, the officer was to discontinue the contact, unless the officer had some lawful basis for an arrest or reasonable suspicion that the student was committing or was about to commit an unlawful act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the officer broke off the encounter with a truant student, the officer was to supply the center or administrative office with the student\u2019s name and a report of the circumstances surrounding the contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Prior to the issuance of this special order, officers had discretion to investigate whether youths they encountered were truant from school. If the officer chose to investigate, the normal practice was to identify the potential truant, confirm the youth\u2019s status through the dispatcher\u2019s contact with the school, and, if the truant agreed, to transport the truant to the school. Thus, while the steps were similar (the only difference being that formerly a truant student was transported to school whereas under the special order such students would be transported to a center or administrative office), the officer\u2019s discretion to investigate a suspected truancy was transformed into a requirement to investigate all cases of suspected truancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The contacts with truants required by the special order could last from forty-five minutes to one and one-half hours, and the process of transporting a truant might require an officer to leave that officer\u2019s normal patrol route. In such instances, there would be no coverage on the patrol route, as only one patrol car was ordinarily assigned to a patrol route.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The union filed a complaint alleging that the city had engaged in a prohibited practice by requiring the officers to perform these truancy investigation and transportation duties without giving the union notice and an opportunity to bargain. See G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>c. 150E, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(5). Based on the above facts, the commission determined that the decision to require police investigation of suspected truants was a core managerial decision concerning where to deploy public services. That decision was not subject to mandatory bargaining under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, and therefore, the city\u2019s failure to bargain over that decision was not a violation of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 (a) (5). However, the commission held that there remained an obligation to bargain over the impact of such management decisions, and the special order had an impact on the \u201cworkload\u201d of officers when it required them to take measures that had previously been left up to an officer\u2019s discretion. Thus, the city had violated G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(5), and, derivatively, \u00a7 10 (a) (1), when it issued the special order without giving the union notice and an opportunity to bargain concerning the impact of the decision to require officers to investigate suspected truancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Judicial review of commission decisions is to be conducted in accordance with G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11. We therefore must accord deference to the commission\u2019s specialized knowledge and expertise, and to its interpretation of the applicable statutory provisions. See <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, </em>435 Mass. 144, 150-151 (2001), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, public employers must \u201cnegotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours, standards or productivity and performance, and any other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d However, from that expansively defined category of mandatory bargaining subjects, we have exempted certain types of managerial decisions that must, as a matter of policy, be reserved to the public employer\u2019s discretion. \u201c[I]n instances where a negotiation requirement would unduly impinge on a public employer\u2019s freedom to perform its public functions, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, does not mandate bargaining over a decision directly affecting the employment relationship.\u201d Local <em>346, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Police Officers </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>391 Mass. 429, 437 (1984). See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Pat Imen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>403 Mass. 680, 684 (1989); <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Lab Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>390 Mass. 157, 164 (1983); <em>Lynn </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 178-179 (1997). \u201c[T]he inquiry has been directed towards defining the boundary between subjects that by statute, by tradition, or by common sense must be reserved to the sole discretion of the public employer so as to preserve the intended role of the governmental agency and its accountability in the political process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178. \u201c[T]he crucial factor in determining whether a given issue is a mandatory subject of bargaining is whether resolution of the issue at the bargaining table is deemed to conflict with perceived requirements of public policy.\u201d Greenbaum, The Scope of Mandatory Bargaining Under Massachusetts Public Sector Labor Relations Law, 72 Mass. L. Rev. 102, 103 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Thus, for example, a school committee may decide to reduce its level of custodial staffing, <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>388 Mass. 557, 561-562 (1983), or a police commissioner may decide that only one officer, not two, is to be assigned to each marked cruiser, <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 684, or a police chief may require officers suspected of criminal conduct to take a polygraph examination, <em>Local 346, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Police Officers </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 439-440, without bargaining over such decisions. \u201cThe list of factors so fundamental to the effective operation of an enterprise as to be exempt from mandatory bargaining requirements will of necessity vary with the nature of the employer,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 438, and the inquiry as to whether a particular decision falls within that sphere of core managerial prerogatives must therefore be made on a case-by-case basis, <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The present case implicates the city\u2019s ability to set its law enforcement priorities. Children between certain ages are required to attend school, and parents may be prosecuted and fined for failing to cause their child to attend school. G. L. c. 76, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Renfrew, </em>332 Mass. 492 (1955). See also G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 4 (crime of inducing or attempting to induce minor to absent himself from school, or employing or harboring minor who is unlawfully absent from school). That other mechanisms for addressing truancy may also exist, see, e.g., G. L. c. 76, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 20 (school committees shall ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>point \u201csupervisors of attendance\u201d who shall \u201cinquire into\u201d truancy cases), does not eliminate truancy as a valid subject of attention by traditional law enforcement agencies. Nor does past practice relegating a certain problem to other forms of intervention deprive a municipality of its prerogative to change its practice and make that problem a priority of law enforcement. For example, while it may in the past have been common practice for police officers to ignore cases of domestic violence, preferring to treat the subject as a private dispute to be resolved by social service agencies, municipal authorities retained the discretion to adopt a policy of active police intervention in domestic violence cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Setting the priorities for the deployment of law enforcement resources is purely a matter of policy. See <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 164 (decision to assign prosecutorial duties to town counsel instead of to police prosecutors \u201cis an exclusive managerial prerogative, and not a proper subject for collective bargaining\u201d). A city should not have to bargain over which types of infractions merit more attention from law enforcement than others. If the city of Worcester has decided that aggressive enforcement of the law mandating school attendance will reduce juvenile crime, or deter the formation of youth gangs, or otherwise contribute to the safety and well-being of the city, that is a policy decision for the city to make. The allocation of resources among competing law enforcement priorities \u201cmust be reserved to the sole discretion of the public employer so as to preserve the intended role of the governmental agency and its accountability in the political process.\u201d <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 178. Those priorities are not a proper subject of bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The Appeals Court was apparently of the view that the city needed to support its truancy enforcement policy with evidence before it could claim the policy as a management prerogative. <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 106, 113-114 (2001) (recognizing that all public institutions \u201chave some responsibility for ensuring that the young are adequately educated,\u201d but declining to treat decision as core managerial prerogative where \u201cthe record in this case is completely devoid of any suggestion whatsoever that public safety was implicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>by whatever truancy problems afflicted Worcester\u201d or \u201cthat police officers by nature, training, disposition or outlook, are or would be any better or any worse at supervising school attendance than, say, firefighters or employees of the recreation department\u201d). A public employer need not defend the wisdom of a policy choice that it has made in order to have that choice recognized as a core managerial prerogative. It is the fact that the public employer\u2019s choice is one of policy, not the merits of the choice the employer makes, that renders the choice an inappropriate subject of mandatory bargaining. As such, the city did not have to present evidence explaining or justifying its decision to engage police officers in enforcing laws pertaining to school attendance, and its failure to produce such evidence has no bearing on whether the adoption of the special order was a subject of mandatory bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In an attempt to diminish the otherwise unfettered discretion that the city would have to set its law enforcement priorities without bargaining over them, the union posits that the designation of police officers as statutory \u201csupervisors of attendance\u201d requires them to perform duties that are not law enforcement functions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The union misperceives the nature and purpose of that ostensible designation referenced in the special order. The special order lists the precise tasks that police officers are to undertake with respect to truants. Those specified tasks, not the complete duties of a \u201csupervisor of attendance,\u201d are what the special order requires them to do. The city has disclaimed any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>misinterpretation of the special order that would confer such duties on them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">We look therefore to the substance of what the special order now requires police officers to do. That special order requires them to take certain specific steps to enforce the laws pertaining to school attendance \u2014 make inquiry of the youth pertaining to the youth\u2019s status as a truant, confirm that status through inquiry to the dispatcher, and, if the youth is in fact truant and is willing, transport the truant to the appropriate center or office. These are steps that police officers previously took, in their discretion, when they came upon truants. The city\u2019s decision that such steps should be taken in all cases of suspected truancy is the product of the city\u2019s unfettered discretion to decide how its law enforcement resources are to be used to address what it perceives to be an appropriate law enforcement priority. The commission correctly determined that this was a decision concerning \u201cwhere to deploy public services\u201d that came \u201cwithin the penumbra of managerial rights\u201d that was not subject to mandatory bargaining under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Notwithstanding a public employer\u2019s prerogative to make certain types of core managerial decisions without prior bargaining, we have recognized that such decisions may also have impacts or effects that would themselves be the subject of mandatory bargaining. \u201c[I]f a managerial decision has impact upon or affects a mandatory topic of bargaining, negotiation over the impact is required.\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>403 Mass. 680, 685 (1989). For example, while a public employer may decide to reduce the size of some component of its work force, the implementation of that decision \u2014 whether reduction will be accomplished by layoffs or by some other means, on what basis employees will be selected for involuntary layoff, and the timing and terms of such layoffs \u2014 affects \u201cwages, hours, standards or productivity and performance, and any other terms and conditions of employment\u201d over which public employers must bargain. G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6. See <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>388 Mass. 557, 562-564 (1983). See also <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>390 Mass. 157, 164-167 (1983) (town had prerogative to reassign duties formerly held by police prosecutors to town counsel, but was required to bargain over impact where transfer had effect of loss of bonus pay detail and cost two officers loss of pay). Cf. <em>West Bridgewater Police Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 550, 554 (1984) (town\u2019s change in procedures ceasing to require presence of arresting officers at arraignment did not require impact bargaining where only loss was of irregular and unscheduled overtime pay, which was not \u201cterm\u201d of employment and \u201cdid not impinge directly on wages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Here, the commission determined that the city was required to bargain over the impacts of the decision reflected in the special order. Before the Appeals Court, the city argued that that aspect of the commission\u2019s order was inconsistent with prior commission precedent. The city has not argued the point before us, and we treat the argument as waived. We therefore do not need to consider whether the impacts demonstrated here would be sufficient to trigger mandatory impact bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The decision and order of the Labor Relations Commission are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> The dispatcher was also required to perform a record check on any suspected truant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\"> If there was an outstanding warrant or any other basis for arrest, normal procedures for the handling of juveniles were to be followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\"> The powers and duties of supervisors of attendance are specified in G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 20. Supervisors of attendance have responsibilities with respect to maintaining and analyzing records of school enrollment and attendance. G. L. c. 72, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 8. They must \u201cinquire into\u201d cases involving discrimination in admission to public school (G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 5), tuition payments for nonresident children (G. L. c. 76, \u00a7\u00a7 6-11), certificates of vaccination (G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 15), and unlawful child labor (G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 90, 92, 93, 95). If assigned by the court, they may also be called on to supervise a child placed on probation, or to supervise a child who has been granted a work permit. G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 20. G. L. c. 101, \u00a7 19. They may file petitions for children in need of services, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39E, and they may bring complaints for unlawful admission of unaccompanied children to places of entertainment, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 197. The panoply of duties assigned to supervisors of attendance involve many that are far removed from the law enforcement duties of police officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b206-6\"> Indeed, in context, the designation of the officers as \u201csupervisors of attendance\u201d was made solely so that the officers would have the power to take a truant youth into custody. See G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 20 (supervisor of attendance \u201cmay apprehend and take to school without a warrant any truant or absentee found wandering in the streets or public places\u201d). Even that power was apparently conferred on police officers solely as a precaution against claims of unlawful arrest \u2014 the special order makes clear that officers are <em>not </em>to detain or transport a truant youth without the youth\u2019s cooperation and consent, unless they have some other basis for arresting or stopping the youth and therefore do not need authority to \u201capprehend\u201d truants \u201cwithout a warrant\u201d in order to carry out the duties specified in the special order. See G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 20. No term of the officers\u2019 employment has been changed by this precautionary and essentially meaningless designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The designation of the officers as \u201csupervisors of attendance\u201d is also ineffective. The union correctly points out that supervisors of attendance are appointed by a school committee, G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 19, and the city manager\u2019s purported designation of police officers as \u201csupervisors of attendance\u201d would therefore be invalid. The city essentially concedes the point, acknowledging that the designation \u201cmay have been in error.\u201d However, the special order does not designate the officers as \u201csupervisors of attendance\u201d \u2014 it merely references the city manager\u2019s purported designation \u2014 but instead orders the officers to perform certain specific steps when encountering truants during the course of regular patrol work. The city manager\u2019s improper designation of the officers is of no consequence to the operative requirements of the special order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
