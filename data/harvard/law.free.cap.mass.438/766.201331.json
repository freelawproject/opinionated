The defendant also asserts that the judge erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on (1) the judge\u2019s failure properly to instruct the jury on their right to decide the degree of murder; (2) the judge\u2019s failure to conduct a colloquy with the defendant to confirm that he knowingly and voluntarily desired to present an \u201cinsanity defense\u201d or that he waived such a defense; (3) the deprivation of his right to testify at trial; and (4) the deprivation of his right to appear unmedicated at trial. The defendant also seeks relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We reject all claims of error. We also discern no basis to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction and the order denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">The background of the case is as follows. On the afternoon of August 24, 1994, Officer Thomas Guinta of the Fall River police department was in uniform delivering parking permits to residents on Middle Street for use during an upcoming event in the neighborhood. Jean Felix and her daughter, residents of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>second-floor apartment at 591 Middle Street, were outside that building and saw Officer Guinta enter it. The defendant lived in the first-floor apartment. Felix and her daughter heard the defendant ask, \u201cWho is it?,\u201d and then heard Officer Guinta reply, \u201cThe police.\u201d The women then heard yelling, scuffling, and shots. Felix ran next door to dial 911. The defendant, \u201cfull of blood,\u201d and holding a revolver and a walkie-talkie, walked down the stairs leading from his apartment. Felix asked him what he had done, and the defendant replied, \u201cWell, he tried to shoot me, so I shot him back.\u201d Felix said that the officer needed help and asked whether the defendant would shoot her if she went up the stairs. The defendant answered, \u201cNo, Jen.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Felix found Officer Guinta lying on the hallway floor outside of the defendant\u2019s apartment. Officer Guinta was bleeding profusely and was gurgling. Felix asked the defendant to get some towels as she began chest compressions. The defendant placed a pillow under Officer Guinta\u2019s head, then kicked him and said, \u201cHe\u2019s only faking, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Detective Leo Rebello arrived at the scene. As the detective approached the stairway, gun drawn, he saw the defendant step out onto the landing holding what turned out to be Officer Guinta\u2019s handgun, and observed on the stairs a police radio with blood on it. On seeing Detective Rebello, the defendant stated, \u201cYou don\u2019t need that, you don\u2019t need that.\u201d Detective Rebello followed the defendant into the building and observed Officer Guinta on the hallway floor. Detective Rebello pushed the defendant against the hallway wall, and the defendant dropped the handgun. In his right hand the defendant held a speed loader, a device that holds ammunition, and a Fall River police badge, which Detective Rebello had to pry out of his hand. Detective Rebello handcuffed the defendant, moved him back into his apartment, and seated him on a mattress on the floor. The defendant said, \u201c[I] shouldn\u2019t have, [I] shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Detective John DeMello entered the building after Detective Rebello. He saw the defendant drop the gun. Detectives Rebello and DeMello performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Officer Guinta. His eyes were open, he had a pulse, and he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>gasping for air. There was a pool of blood underneath him. Officer Guinta soon thereafter was pronounced dead. A medical examiner testified that he had died from multiple gunshot wounds, with death occurring minutes after the shooting. Officer Guinta suffered three gunshot wounds: a close contact wound to his upper back, at the base of his neck, penetrating his heart and lung; a wound to his lower back; and a wound below the right knee. Officer Guinta also had abrasions and contusions consistent with having been in an altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Other police officers arrived. Sergeant Albert Dupere heard the defendant state, \u201cI don\u2019t know who did it.\u201d Officer Wayne Pope heard the defendant state, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it. Three guys did it. They ran.\u201d The defendant told Officer Michael Malek that he \u201cdidn\u2019t do it,\u201d and that there were three black males who had ran out the back door. Officer Malek checked the apartment, but found no back door and no other suspects. The defendant seemed very nervous, but not excited, and he spoke in a low voice. While being transported to the police station, the defendant talked to himself in a low monotone.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">At the police station, State Trooper Keith Blaney advised the defendant of his Miranda rights, and then interviewed him. The defendant was calm, and his answers were timely and articulate. After providing some information about his background, the defendant recounted his day\u2019s activities. The defendant stated that he awoke from a nap to an altercation outside his apartment\u2019s door. He heard several bangs, opened the door and saw Officer Guinta lying on his side, bleeding, on the hallway floor. The defendant asked Officer Guinta if he was alright. The officer replied that he was, and asked the defendant to get help. The defendant saw the officer\u2019s police radio on the stairwell and tried to call on it. A police officer arrived, asked the defendant \u201cif he was okay,\u201d and then handcuffed him. The defendant denied having handled Officer Guinta\u2019s service revolver or badge. The defendant stated that he was taking prescription medication. Toward the end of the interview, the defendant addressed Trooper Blaney as \u201cYour Excellency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Forensic evidence linked the defendant to Officer Guinta\u2019s shooting. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing revealed that blood consistent with the defendant\u2019s was found on Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Guinta\u2019s gun. The defendant\u2019s left thumb print was found on the gun and on Officer Guinta\u2019s handcuff case. Blood consistent with Officer Guinta\u2019s was found on the floor inside the defendant\u2019s apartment. Blood spatter analysis indicated that Officer Guinta had been inside the defendant\u2019s apartment when he was shot. A copy of the defendant\u2019s resume found by police in a briefcase in the defendant\u2019s apartment contained blood consistent with both the defendant\u2019s and Officer Guinta\u2019s, and bore the defendant\u2019s bloody left thumb print. Firearms identification evidence revealed that Officer Guinta\u2019s gun had been fired six times. Ballistics evidence revealed that the one shot with a traceable trajectory was \u201c[mjost probably\u201d fired from inside the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">While at Bridgewater State Hospital the defendant had numerous conversations with a kitchen worker, and gave two versions of the shooting. The defendant told him that the version he eventually would recount depended on whether he was \u201coffered\u201d a disposition of \u201cjustifiable homicide.\u201d The defendant remarked that, because \u201cno one saw him do it,\u201d he could not be found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">There was evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s behavior before, and on the day of, Officer Guinta\u2019s killing. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence described the defendant as a man who \u201chate[d] fucking cops\u201d; who stated to Felix that the police would be sorry if they threw him off the basketball court again after curfew; who was able to conduct business with his landlord\u2019s property management company and pay his rent; and who was able to drive his automobile and obey traffic laws. On the day of Officer Guinta\u2019s killing, Felix \u201cknew [the defendant] was a little bothered\u201d that the police were giving him parking tickets. The defendant was also angry with a representative of the Fall River Gas Company who unsuccessfully attempted to collect an overdue bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The defendant did not testify. Through cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, and through his own witnesses, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel presented evidence supporting a defense that the defendant was not criminally responsible under the standards of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1967). The defendant was an educated man, who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>obtained both criminal justice and law degrees and had served in the military. In early 1993, the defendant had been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. The defendant\u2019s son, who lived with him in August, 1994, testified that the defendant thought that he (the defendant) was God and a Navy admiral. The defendant did not always recognize his own son. The defendant\u2019s son kept his own daughter away from the defendant because he thought she would not be safe in his presence. The defendant thought inanimate objects were animate, and put food in his hair, saying it needed food. The defendant threw away his medicine. The defendant sometimes left the apartment barefoot and in dirty clothes, and he rarely bathed.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">During her cross-examination, Felix stated that the defendant often exhibited \u201cvery strange\u201d behavior. After speaking with the defendant for about ten minutes, Felix noticed that he would become delusional, stating that he was a Cherokee Indian or that he was going to five in the Taj Mahal and be a king. In a basketball court across from the apartment building, the defendant would play basketball by himself, without shoes, for \u201call hours of the night.\u201d On the day of Officer Guinta\u2019s killing, despite an outside temperature of eighty-five degrees, Felix discovered the defendant inside his apartment with the oven door open and the stove turned on high. On more than one occasion around the time of the killing, a representative from the landlord\u2019s property management company tried to get help for the defendant, as did the defendant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Following the defendant\u2019s arrest, he was evaluated at various times by at least six psychologists and one psychiatrist, all of whom testified that he was mentally ill. Two of the professionals, forensic psychologist Ronald S. Ebert and psychiatrist Martin Kelly, arrived at the opinion, for different reasons, that the defendant was not criminally responsible for killing Officer Guinta. Specifically, Dr. Kelly testified that the defendant\u2019s schizophrenia resulted in the lack of capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, while Dr. Ebert testified that, because of schizophrenia, the defendant lacked the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. The Commonwealth did not produce any expert witnesses to testify to the defendant\u2019s mental illness or criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>1. The defendant contends that, in defining murder in the first degree, the judge \u201ceffectively negated the criminal responsibility instruction that went before.\u201d When instructing on murder in the first degree on the theory of deliberate premeditation, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">\u201cIf the Commonwealth has proven to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the specific intent to kill, then the defendant\u2019s mental impairment, if any, does not excuse or justify his actions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Later, when instructing on murder in the first degree on the theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">\u201cIf the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant had this specific intent to kill or to grievously injure the victim and the defendant had the requisite knowledge of the circumstances in which he acted, the defendant\u2019s mental impairment, if any, does not excuse or justify his actions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The defendant argues that these instructions \u201cinform[ed] the jury that if they found malice then lack of criminal responsibility was no justification or excuse.\u201d The defendant did not object to these instructions, so we review for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>429 Mass. 182, 185 (1999). We find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Our duty is to look at \u201cthe charge as a whole to determine whether it fairly instructs the jury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 386 (1997). We have upheld nearly identical language to that challenged here. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meinholz, </em>420 Mass. 633, 637 (1995). Examining the charge in context, the judge correctly instructed the jury that they could consider the defendant\u2019s mental impairment, if any, in determining the defendant\u2019s capacity to form the specific intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>380 Mass. 672, 683, 685 (1980). The judge also correctly instructed the jury on criminal responsibility in accordance with the standards of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, supra. </em>In giving these instructions, the judge directed the jury that they were not to consider the issue of criminal responsibility, or \u201cinsanity,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>until <em>after </em>the Commonwealth had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had committed criminal acts. The challenged instructions bore only on that first task, which the judge sufficiently explained, and did not deprive the jury of considering whether the Commonwealth also satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was criminally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Next, the defendant asserts, and the Commonwealth concedes, that the judge gave an erroneous, nonexistent \u201cdiminished capacity manslaughter\u201d instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The instruction had been requested by the defendant and was read by the judge as requested almost verbatim. The defendant argues that this instruction \u201cshifted the burden of proof on the issue of insanity to the defendant.\u201d We conclude that the instruction created no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. In reviewing the charge in its entirety, the judge repeatedly instructed the jury that the Commonwealth bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was criminally responsible, and that the defendant had no burden of proving his lack of criminal responsibility. Further, in view of the jury\u2019s return of a verdict of murder in the first degree, it is unlikely that they even considered a manslaughter verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">2. In support of his motion for a new trial, the defendant offered numerous exhibits, including a transcript of an attorney-client conference (made before the defendant rested) on the issue whether the defendant wished to testify at trial, affidavits from the defendant, an affidavit from the defendant\u2019s mother, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>various letters from the defendant to his parents or to his counsel, and various mental health reports. The judge denied the motion without making any specific comments on the credibility of the defendant\u2019s submissions. It can be inferred from the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion, however, that he discredited the defendant\u2019s contentions stated in his affidavits and elsewhere. The judge did expressly refuse to resurrect any issues that the defendant had not properly preserved for appellate review, and declined to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the motion, a decision within his discretion. <em>Fogarty </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>406 Mass. 103, 110-111 (1989). As can be gleaned from our following discussion on the issues raised in the motion, the defendant failed to raise a \u201csubstantial issue\u201d requiring an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 111. The judge properly denied the motion and committed no \u201csignificant error of law or other abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">(a) The defendant claims error in the judge\u2019s failure to read to the jury the last sentence of the murder statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1: \u201cThe degree of murder shall be found by the jury.\u201d Because the defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not request such an instruction or object to the judge\u2019s omission of this language, we review for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaskins, </em>419 Mass. 809, 812 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>384 Mass. 247, 258 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Although we have suggested that a proper charge on murder should comprise a full reading of the murder statute, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 797-798 n.6 (1977), what the murder statute requires is that, where there is evidence of murder in the first degree, the judge must instruct on both murder in the first and second degrees. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paulding, ante </em>1, 10 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doane, </em>428 Mass. 631, 633 (1999). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. 189, 196-197 (1981) (finding no risk of a miscarriage of justice stemming from judge\u2019s failure to read last sentence of murder statute to jury). The judge fulfilled this requirement by instructing the jury first on murder in the first degree and then on murder in the second degree. In addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>defining murder in the second degree, the judge instructed the jury that if, after considering all the evidence, the Commonwealth had not proved murder in the first degree beyond a reasonable doubt, they were then to consider whether the Commonwealth had proved murder in the second degree beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, in examining the entire charge, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, </em>423 Mass. 356, 359, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1045 (1996), the judge conveyed the proper legal concepts to the jury. The judge\u2019s omission of the final sentence of the murder statute did not deprive the jury of their power to find the appropriate degree of murder. The omission created no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">(b) In his submissions accompanying his motion for a new trial, the defendant essentially claimed that his trial counsel failed to honor his choice not to present a defense based on a lack of criminal responsibility, or an \u201cinsanity\u201d defense. In reliance on those assertions, the defendant argues that the judge was constitutionally required to conduct a colloquy with him to confirm his \u201cknowing, intelligent, and voluntary endorsement\u201d of, or waiver of, an insanity defense. The defendant relies principally on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federici, </em>427 Mass. 740, 744-745 (1998), in which we held that a competent defendant may choose to forgo an insanity defense when he \u201chas been fully advised beforehand of the consequences of his actions by both defense counsel and the judge\u201d (footnote omitted). In that case, however, the defendant had made it clear both to the judge and to defense counsel that he did not want to raise an insanity defense. <em>Id. </em>at 745. Here, there was no such apparent conflict between the defendant and his trial counsel that was made clear to the judge. Thus follows the defendant\u2019s argument that even an endorsement of an insanity defense requires a colloquy. We decline to extend our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federici, supra, </em>to impose such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The judge did not err in concluding, inferentially, that the defendant\u2019s submissions made in connection with his motion for a new trial did not raise a substantial issue requiring an evidentiary hearing. There was sufficient evidence, particularly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s affidavit<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the transcript of the extensive attorney-client conference made during the trial, which, obviously credited, warranted the judge in rejecting the defendant\u2019s submissions. The transcript of the attorney-client conference also clearly establishes that, at the time of the trial, the defendant, who had been found competent to stand trial, and who possessed a law degree and a master\u2019s degree in criminal justice, had done his own research on the defense of lack of criminal responsibility and understood, and agreed to the presentation of, that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">(c) Relying on an affidavit in which the defendant states that he wanted to testify to \u201chis actual innocence,\u201d but was precluded from doing so by his trial counsel, and on other documents to that effect, the defendant argues that the record does not support a finding that he made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary decision not to testify. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">A defendant has the right to testify on his own behalf, and a \u201cstrict standard\u201d applies to the waiver of that right. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>399 Mass. 708, 716 (1987), and cases cited. The record of the attorney-client conference between the defendant and his trial counsel, made before the defense rested, demonstrates that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel repeatedly informed the defendant that the ultimate decision on whether to testify belonged to him. The judge likely credited this evidence. While the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, for. various reasons that he explained on the record to the defendant, advised the defendant not to testify, he at all times emphasized that, ultimately, the decision was the defendant\u2019s. The defendant, although wavering, and never rendering a final decision on the record, expressed his understanding that the decision to testify at trial was \u201ccompletely\u201d his to make. The defendant\u2019s uncertainty as to whether he would testify reflects that his attorney had not foreclosed the defendant from making this critical decision, and that the defendant possessed a \u201csufficient awareness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>relevant circumstances and likely consequences\u201d associated with that decision. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 635, 640 (1990), quoting <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 766 (1970). The next morning, the defendant did not protest his trial counsel\u2019s decision to rest without presenting the defendant as a witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hennessey, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 384, 387 (1987). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">(d) The judge correctly denied the motion for a new trial on the ground that the record allegedly did not support an intelligent and voluntary decision by the defendant to be medicated at trial. The defendant\u2019s argument is predicated on \u201c[djefense counsel\u2019s admitted failure to offer the defendant the opportunity to appear unmedicated during trial . . . .\u201d There is no such admission in the record. Rather, in an affidavit, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel stated that he did not \u201cspecifically recall discussing the matter with [the defendant],\u201d but that he had \u201cnumerous conversations with Dr. Ronald Ebert [a defense expert witness] as to his opinion on the issue of [the defendant\u2019s] appearing unmedicated.\u201d The defendant made no showing that he was medicated against his will or that he even asked to stop taking medication. In one of his affidavits, the defendant states that he is \u201cnot crazy,\u201d yet he made no showing how appearing in a medicated state would have undermined his competency to stand trial, limited his ability to present a defense, or otherwise been relevant. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Louraine, </em>390 Mass. 28, 37-38 (1983) (not every defendant treated for mental illness is entitled to be observed by the jury in an unmedicated state, and \u201cin some cases, the defendant\u2019s demeanor in an unmedicated condition will not be relevant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">3. The evidence that the defendant, with Officer Guinta\u2019s own gun, shot six times at Officer Guinta, inflicting three gunshot wounds, two from behind, and then later kicked Officer Guinta in the head while Felix was giving him chest compressions, amply supports the jury\u2019s finding of extreme atrocity or cruelty. Although the Commonwealth presented no expert testimony on the issue of the defendant\u2019s mental illness or criminal responsibility, there is no requirement to do so. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monico, </em>396 Mass. 793, 798 (1986) (the issue of insanity \u201cmay arise from the facts of the case, through the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>monwealth\u2019s witnesses, through lay testimony, or any combination thereof\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 551 (1967) (\u201cpsychiatry is far from an exact science and . . . whether a defendant is to be called sane or insane cannot depend on any certain measurement\u201d). The same principle enures also to the benefit of a defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteo, supra </em>(\u201cExpert psychiatric testimony is not necessary to raise the issue of insanity as a complete defense\u201d). There was evidence from many lay witnesses, who had observed the defendant closer in time to Officer Guinta\u2019s killing than did the defendant\u2019s expert witnesses, that supported the jury\u2019s rejection of the insanity defense. Further, Dr. Ebert and Dr. Kelly were cross-examined extensively and gave testimony that would have warranted the jury in disregarding their ultimate opinions and concluding instead that, because the defendant had engaged in numerous activities that demonstrated an ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, he was criminally responsible. The jury could also have considered the disagreement between them as to the relevant prong of the <em>McHoul </em>test as a matter affecting their credibility. \u201c[I]t is not our function to second guess the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coyne, </em>420 Mass. 33, 35 (1995).
