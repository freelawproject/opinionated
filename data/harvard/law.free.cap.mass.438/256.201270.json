L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, from a final order of the Department of Telecommunications and Energy (department) that approved a rate plan filed by Boston Edison Company, Cambridge Electric Light Company (Cambridge Electric), Commonwealth Electric Company (Commonwealth Electric) and Commonwealth Gas Company<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (distribution companies) pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in connection with the proposed merger of their parent companies<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to create NSTAR.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The proposed rate plan had three main components: (1) a four-year freeze in distribution rates; (2) the recovery of merger-related costs; and (3) a service-quality plan. In addition, two of the distribution companies, Cambridge Electric and Commonwealth Electric, sought, and obtained, an upward rate adjustment in their existing retail distribution rates to correct ah alleged error made in the course of a prior proceeding. The Attorney General, together with the Energy Consortium (TEC) and President and Fellows of Harvard College (Harvard) (appellants), interveners in the proceedings before the department,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> essentially argue that the department (1) applied an erroneous standard of review in evaluating the rate plan; and erred in approving (2) the four-year rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>freeze; (3) the recovery of merger-related costs; and (4) the adjustment to Cambridge Electric\u2019s and Commonwealth Electric\u2019s distribution rates. We reject these arguments, and remand the cases to the county court for the entry of a judgment affirming the department\u2019s decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The background of the cases is as follows. On February 1, 1999, the distribution companies filed their rate plan with the department. They represented that consummation of the merger was contingent on the department\u2019s approval of the plan. The plan was filed expressly pursuant to \u00a7 94. The distribution companies requested that the department approve the plan \u201cas just and reasonable and consistent with the public interest,\u201d and as consistent with \u201c[department precedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As previously stated, the rate plan had three main components: (1) a four-year freeze in distribution rates for the distribution companies from the date of the consummation of the merger; (2) the recovery of merger-related costs; and (3) a service-quality plan to prevent any degradation in service as a result of the merger. Because the first two components of the plan are at issue, some additional information concerning these components follows. With respect to the rate freeze,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the distribution companies maintained that the proposed four-year freeze in distribution rates provided assurance that, during the four-year period, customers would be shielded from their (the distribution companies\u2019) inability to achieve projected cost savings from the merger, and from otherwise potentially recoverable inflationary increases in costs. At the expiration of the four-year rate freeze, distribution rates established by the department in any base rate proceeding would account for savings realized from the merger, net of the recovery of merger-related costs. The distribution companies proposed to demonstrate that merger-related savings would exceed merger-related costs, so that they would not have to make such a showing as part of any future rate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The merger-related costs consist of transaction costs, system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>integration costs, and the acquisition premium. Transaction costs include \u201cprofessional fees paid for assistance on certain aspects of the merger\u201d (such as fees for bankers, lawyers, and consultants), regulatory process costs (the cost of presenting the rate plan as well as required filings, such as filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission), and communication costs (the cost of disseminating information to shareholders, employees, customers, vendors, and others). System integration costs include employee separation, retention, and relocation costs; information technology integration costs; telecommunications costs; insurance costs; transition costs incurred for outside services intended to facilitate the merger; and facilities reconfiguration costs. The acquisition premium represents \u201cthe difference between the acquisition price and the net book value of the acquired company.\u201d Here, the acquisition premium would be the premium over book value that the shareholders in Commonwealth Energy Systems received for their shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The distribution companies proposed to recover merger-related costs in two ways. First, for ratemaking purposes, they proposed to amortize the transaction and system integration costs (and associated tax effects) at the rate of $13.5 million a year over a ten-year period. Second, they proposed to amortize the acquisition premium at the rate of $20.6 million a year over a forty-year period.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The distribution companies represented that, \u201c[although the [r]ate [p]lan provides shareholders the opportunity to recover the up-front costs . . . the magnitude and permanence of the customer benefits will produce a value for customers that far outweighs the associated costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In their rate plan the distribution companies sought to adjust the base rates of Cambridge Electric and Commonwealth Electric to correct an alleged error made in the calculation of base rates in their respective restructuring plans mandated by \u00a7 193 of St. 1997, c. 164, \u201cAn Act relative to restructuring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>electric utility industry in the Commonwealth, regulating the provision of electricity and other services, and promoting enhanced consumer protections therein\u201d (Act), which added \u00a7 1A to c. 164 (requiring an electric company organized under the Act to file, by January 1, 1998, a \u201crestructuring plan\u201d that must include, among other requirements, an accounting of transition costs eligible for recovery, strategies to mitigate transition costs, and \u201cunbundled prices or rates for generation, distribution, transmission, and other services\u201d). See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 ID (\u201cBeginning January 1, 1998, all electric and gas bills sent to a retail customer shall be unbundled to separately reflect the rates charged for generation, transmission, and distribution services . . . contained in the total retail price\u201d). When the two companies developed their restructuring plans and filed \u201cunbundled\u201d rates with the department, they had erred, to their detriment, in determining the proper level of distribution rates. This error occurred because when \u201cunbundling\u201d rates, they used incorrect figures representing demand-side management (DSM) charges<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (they used figures from the wrong year: Act-mandated figures rather than pre-Act figures), and thus erred in determining the proper level of distribution rates. To recoup the shortfall, the distribution companies proposed an adjustment, a calculated increase, to the distribution rates for Cambridge Electric and Commonwealth Electric. To ensure that there would be no over-all rate increase, the distribution companies proposed to reduce the transition costs for Cambridge Electric and Commonwealth Electric, by an amount equal to the increase in the respective distribution charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Prior to conducting evidentiary hearings, the department issued an interlocutory order stating that \u201cthis proceeding does not include a relitigation of the [department\u2019s policy on the recovery of merger-related costs, including the recovery of a merger-related acquisition premium.\u201d That policy, simply put, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>favors mergers and acquisitions of utility companies within its jurisdiction, and permits the recovery of merger-related costs, where consolidation and recovery of costs will serve the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d and is set forth in D.P.U. 93-167-A (1994) <em>(Mergers &amp; Acquisitions).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In <em>Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, </em>the department established guidelines and standards for mergers and acquisitions, and for the recovery of related costs. <em>Id. </em>at 1, 6-9, 18-19. The department recognized the significant changes occurring in the utility industry at the State and Federal levels, noting that \u201c[i]n an increasingly competitive market, mergers or acquisitions may represent one of many measures that could achieve savings, efficiencies, increased reliability, and better quality of service for Massachusetts utilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. The department stated its expectation that all utilities \u201cexplore thoroughly all cost-savings measures and potential opportunities [including some form of consolidation] to achieve efficiencies of all kinds.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The department noted that the standard for judging merger or acquisition proposals is set forth in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 96, and requires the department to determine that the transaction is consistent with the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 6. The \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard requires \u201ca balancing of the costs and countervailing benefits attendant on any proposed merger or acquisition.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The inquiry is case specific and involves an analysis of many factors. <em>Id. </em>at 7-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>With respect to the recovery of acquisition premiums, the department recognized that acquisition premiums \u201crepresent a cost or disadvantage to the ratepaying public. The theoretical basis, however, for allowing a premium is that a transaction otherwise in the public interest would not occur, absent premium allowance, and further that the costs or disadvantages represented by the premium are warranted by the benefits thereby captured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. The department therefore reversed its previous policy of per se disallowance of recovering an acquisition premium, stating that its recovery \u201cwill henceforth be judged on a case-by-case basis,\u201d and pursuant to the \u00a7 96 \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>at 7. The department explained, \u201c[i]f it can be demonstrated that denying recovery of an acquisition premium prevents consummation of a particular merger that would otherwise serve the public interest, then we may be willing to allow recovery of an acquisition premium.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. The department emphasized, however, that it would \u201cnot automatically allow recovery of all premiums associated with each and every merger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Recovery would be considered on a case-by-case basis, as would \u201cthe appropriate level\u201d of an acquisition premium. <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The department held public hearings concerning the distribution companies\u2019 proposed rate plan, and conducted ten days of evidentiary hearings at which over 400 exhibits were introduced. The department ultimately entered a 109-page decision and order approving the rate plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In its order, the department first addressed the appropriate standard of review. Because the department had no jurisdiction over the merging parent companies, it acknowledged that the merger fell outside the scope of \u00a7 96. The department noted, however, that its approval of the rate plan was essential to the merger, and that the merger would have an impact on ratepayers similar to the impact resulting from mergers within its jurisdiction because the acquisition premium would be \u201cpushed down\u201d to the distribution companies and because the distribution companies were seeking to recover that cost as well as other merger-related costs. Consequently, the department characterized the circumstances as raising an issue of first impression and requiring \u201csome degree of adaptation of our standard of review.\u201d The department concluded that adaptation was war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ranted because \u201cthe public interest standard underlies both [\u00a7\u00a7] 94 and 96.\u201d The department also noted that \u201c[w]here statutes of general application allow a broad range of regulatory discretion but do not speak in particularized terms to an instant case\u201d it has the discretion to decide what standard to apply. Thus, the department rejected the argument that it should investigate the \u201cpropriety\u201d of the rate plan under \u00a7 94 to determine if rates were \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and concluded that the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard in \u00a7 96 was the appropriate standard to apply. The department characterized this standard as a \u201cno net harm\u201d standard requiring the department to find that \u201cthe public interest would be at least as well served by approval of a proposal as by its denial.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To satisfy this standard, the department stated that \u201ccosts or disadvantages of a proposed merger must be accompanied by offsetting benefits that warrant their allowance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APg\">Regarding the proposed rate plan, the department approved of the distribution companies\u2019 proposed base rate freeze (subject to certain exogenous cost adjustments not relevant here<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>), concluding that the \u201cratepayers would be at least as well off with the proposed base rate freeze as they would be absent the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>merger.\u201d The department noted that the current distribution rates previously had been approved by the department as just and -reasonable pursuant to \u00a7 94, that there was no evidence demonstrating that those rates were not currently just and reasonable, that a traditional rate case demonstration pursuant to \u00a7 94 was not required because the distribution companies were not seeking \u201ca general increase in rates\u201d under \u00a7 94, and that it was \u201cprobable\u201d that results under a \u00a7 94 investigation, if conducted, would warrant an increase in the present base rates. The department also pointed out that, because the rate freeze did not include an adjustment for inflation, the freeze constituted a \u201creal\u201d rate decrease for customers over the four-year period. Further, the department stated that there was nothing restricting the rights of the Attorney General, or any other party, to seek a review of rates pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 93.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The department added that, if it had any reason to believe that any one of the distribution companies\u2019 earnings were excessive, it would commence an investigation of that company\u2019s rates pursuant to \u00a7 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">With respect to the proposed correction to Cambridge Electric\u2019s and Commonwealth Electric\u2019s distribution rates, the department found that these companies had made an inadvertent mistake in collecting distribution revenue. The department further determined that, if no adjustment were made, the companies would undercollect distribution revenue by approximately $49.8 million. The department concluded that</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">[ujndercollecting the revenue requirement is inequitable for Cambridge Electric and [Commonwealth Electric] because it does not allow them a fair opportunity to earn their allowed rates of return,\u201d and therefore allowed the proposed adjustments to distribution rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Turning to merger-related costs, the department allowed the distribution companies to amortize the merger costs, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the acquisition premium, and to recover those costs in future rate proceedings based on current savings estimates. The department referred to its responsibility to evaluate \u201cboth the margin between projected merger-related costs and savings (i.e., a margin of error in projections) and the quality of evidence supporting those projections.\u201d It also explained that \u201cthe quality of projections can be judged in terms of whether they are substantiated by past experience, and supported by logical reasoning founded on sound theory.\u201d After reviewing the estimated savings and making certain reductions in the projected amounts, the department found that the projected merger-related savings would amount to $632.5 million during the ten-year period following the merger. The department identified the merger-related costs during that same period as $135 million in after-tax transaction and system integration costs, and $205.7 million in acquisition premium amortizations, for a total of $340.7 million in costs. Thus, the department determined that the benefits of the merger exceeded the cost by $291.8 million, which \u201cgoes well beyond meeting the department\u2019s \u2018no net harm\u2019 standard to the point of actually providing net benefits to customers.\u201d The department concluded: \u201cEven if the merger does not produce the level of net savings anticipated by [the distribution companies], the magnitude of the difference between the approximately $632.5 million in savings and $340.7 million in costs supports the conclusion that significant savings to ratepayers will likely result from the merger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The department then compared the merger-related savings during the initial ten-year period to the merger-related costs during the forty-year period after consummation of the merger. The department calculated the net present value of annual amortization of the acquisition premium during the thirty years following the initial ten-year period to be approximately $179 million. The sum of that amount ($179 million), and the amount of merger-related costs during the initial ten-year period ($340.7 million), represents total costs of the merger of $519.7 million, which the department noted was \u201cconsiderably less than the merger-related savings of $632.5 million.\u201d Thus, the department concluded that \u201cthe merger will produce significant benefits for ratepayers\u201d and allowed the merger-related costs to be included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>in the cost of any future rate proceeding. To verify that merger-related savings achieved during the rate freeze would continue beyond that period, the department required the distribution companies to file, not later than ninety days after the end of the rate freeze, a \u201cthorough and well-documented report\u201d of cost-saving measures taken and results achieved during the rate freeze.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">1. The applicable standard of review of petitions under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, was explained in <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 867-868 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">\u201cOur standard of review ... is well settled: a petition that raises no constitutional questions requires us to review the department\u2019s finding to determine only whether there is an error of law. . . . The burden of proof is on the appealing party to show that the order appealed from is invalid, and we have observed that this burden is heavy. . . . Moreover, we give deference to the department\u2019s expertise and experience in areas where the Legislature has delegated to it decision-making authority, pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. We shall uphold an agency\u2019s decision unless it is based on an error of law, unsupported by substantial evidence, unwarranted by facts found on the record as submitted, arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). Moreover, we have acknowledged that the department has broad authority to determine ratemaking matters in the public interest.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In addition, \u201cas we have said and ruled in a variety of contexts, questions of policy are for an administrative agency.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>390 Mass. 208, 228 (1983), and cases cited. See <em>Massachusetts Oilheat Council </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>418 Mass. 798, 805 (1994) (\u201cit would not be appropriate for this court to substitute its judgment for a judgment of the department regarding energy policy that cannot be said to be irrational\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">2. The plaintiffs argue that the rate freeze and allowance of merger-related costs should not have been permitted by the department in the absence of an investigation, pursuant to \u00a7 94, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>into the \u201cpropriety\u201d of the rate plan to determine if the rates were \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d They maintain that the Legislature \u201cassigned two different standards of review for two conceptually distinct activities: rate setting and merger approval.\u201d They argue that the department\u2019s decision to apply the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard for merger approvals pursuant to \u00a7 96 in this case was arbitrary, was erroneous, renders the \u201cpropriety\u201d standard in \u00a7 94 a nullity, improperly revives a valuation practice known as the \u201cfair value\u201d method, and violates the Legislature\u2019s intent. We disagree with these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The review sought by the plaintiffs is used by the department in investigating a gas or electric company\u2019s request for approval of a <em>general increase </em>in rates pursuant to \u00a7 94. As previously noted, \u00a7 94 imposes certain procedural requirements on the department when a gas or electric company makes such a request, including the requirements of (1) notifying the Attorney General; (2) conducting a public hearing; and (3) investigating the \u201cpropriety\u201d of the proposed rates. These procedural requirements are not implicated in this case because, as recognized by the department, the distribution companies\u2019 rate plan sought only an adjustment in certain rates (as discussed below in Part 3) and' a rate freeze, not a \u201cgeneral increase in rates.\u201d The department did not err by failing to investigate the \u201cpropriety\u201d of the rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The department\u2019s decision to apply the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard in \u00a7 96 was proper. The \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard constitutes an overriding consideration in the department\u2019s regulatory and ratemaking scheme. See <em>Boston Real Estate Bd. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>334 Mass. 477, 495 (1956) (\u201cThe controlling consideration of the public interest in the exercise of the department\u2019s statutory regulating power is implicit throughout the statute. It is the standard which supports the grant of power over rates and regulations in general, and it is not necessary to specify further\u201d). See also <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>407 Mass. 363, 369 (1990) (\u201cthe mission of the agency is to regulate in the public interest\u201d). The department realized it could not directly apply \u00a7 96, because it had no jurisdiction over the parent companies and was not approving the merger. The department, however, astutely recognized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>effects of the merger to both the distribution companies, which sought recovery of merger-related expenses, and to customers, who would potentially receive the benefits of savings from the merger in the form of lower rates. Except for a lack of jurisdiction over the merging parent companies, the matter was one that would have been reviewed by the department pursuant to the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard of \u00a7 96. Because neither \u00a7 94 nor any other section of G. L. c. 164 directly dealt with the circumstances presented,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the department possessed discretion to settle on an appropriate standard. See <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 370. The department\u2019s application of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard in \u00a7 96 was hardly unreasonable considering what the plan essentially proposed, a rate freeze and the recovery of merger-related costs in connection with a merger, objectives traditionally evaluated under the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard in \u00a7 96. See, e.g., <em>Eastern-Colonial Acquisition, </em>D.T.E. 98-128, at 7-8, 89, 92, 96, 105-106 (1999); <em>NIPSCOBay State Acquisition, </em>D.T.E. 98-31, at 6-8, 33, 44, 66-67 (1998); <em>Eastem-Essex Acquisition, </em>D.T.E., 98-27, at 1-7, 68, 69, 76 (1998). See also <em>Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, supra </em>at 7-9. Further, application of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard was consistent with the department\u2019s policy favoring \u201csome form of consolidation,\u201d in order to \u201cachieve savings, efficiencies, increased reliability, and better quality of service for Massachusetts utilities,\u201d even though that form of consolidation did not fall under its jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 5. We shall not evaluate the rational policy determinations expressed therein. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The case of <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>333 Mass. 536 (1956), does not require a different conclusion. In that case, Cambridge Electric Light Company sought a determination from the court that, in a ratesetting proceeding under \u00a7 94, the department should be bound to apply its determination of the company\u2019s stock price from a previous stock issuance decision under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 18. <em>Id. </em>at 538. The court disagreed, stating that different considerations underlie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the two different statutory duties that the department was required to perform: (1) the duty under \u00a7 18 to \u201cprevent the issue of stock at a price \u2018so low as to be inconsistent with the public interest\u2019 and (2) the duty under \u00a7 94 to deem a fair rate of return in setting rates. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 539. The court stated that the \u201cdepartment cannot by the manner in which it performs one of these duties disable itself from later performing the other according to law,\u201d and that the two statutory duties did \u201cnot follow parallel lines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that the department was not bound to the stock price in a \u00a7 18 proceeding in determining rates under \u00a7 94. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the department did not \u201cdisable\u201d itself from performing a statutory duty, particularly the duty to investigate the \u201cpropriety\u201d of the rate plan pursuant to \u00a7 94, because, as previously explained, the distribution companies never sought \u201ca general increase in rates\u201d that could trigger an investigation under \u00a7 94 into the \u201cpropriety\u201d of the rate plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Finally, we do not consider the Attorney General\u2019s argument that the department improperly revived a ratemaking practice known as the \u201cfair value\u201d method, because the Attorney General failed to raise the contention before the department. The argument is not properly before us. <em>Hingham </em>v. <em>Department of Telecom. &amp; Energy, </em>433 Mass. 198, 215 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">3. We conclude that the adjustment in distribution rates for Cambridge Electric and Commonwealth Electric, while fully offset by decreases in their respective transition charges, does not represent \u201ca general increase in rates\u201d under \u00a7 94, thereby requiring a rate investigation. The adjustment, as noted by the department, simply allowed the two companies to collect the distribution rates that had been permitted in their restructuring plans. Those adjustments did not permit the companies to increase rates to recover increased costs of service. Because the adjustment leaves the Act-mandated DSM charge unchanged, we reject the argument of TEC and Harvard that the companies are \u201cdouble collecting]\u201d DSM charges. Further, the department acted within its discretion in rejecting, albeit implicitly, evidence proffered that the adjustment was not warranted. Nor did the adjustment represent disfavored single-issue ratemaking. The department did not change rates to account for a cost increase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>in relation to a single item expense. As previously stated, the department permitted an adjustment to correct an error to give effect to the removal of pre-Act DSM charges from distribution rates. Finally, because the distribution companies assert that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim \u201cthat the reduction in transition costs will result in additional transition costs to be recovered in the future [plus associated carrying costs] ... is unfounded,\u201d we reject the appellants\u2019 arguments that, in reality, there is no true \u201coffset.\u201d Should the distribution companies seek to recover additional transition costs and associated carrying costs in the future, that is, after they have collected the respective distribution shortfalls, a rate investigation pursuant to \u00a7 94 should ensue to determine whether recovery of those costs is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">4. In view of our conclusion that the department was not required to investigate the \u201cpropriety\u201d of the rate plan pursuant to \u00a7 94, we reject TEC and Harvard\u2019s various arguments that the department\u2019s approval of the rate plan violated requirements of \u00a7 94. We similarly reject the Attorney General\u2019s arguments that are based on the incorrect premise that a \u00a7 94 investigation into the \u201cpropriety\u201d of rates was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">5. The department requires costs and savings allocation \u201cto prevent a utility from subsidizing non-regulated aspects of a utility\u2019s business from the regulated side.\u201d The Attorney General essentially argues that an allocation system was necessary during the rate freeze. The department considered this argument, and noted that, \u201c[e]ven though [the distribution companies] have shown that estimated aggregate savings from the merger would exceed the expected aggregate merger costs, [it] has no assurance that individual regulated utilities would not be assigned merger-related costs which are not commensurate with savings.\u201d The department recognized the need for \u201can established formula that designates proper allocators of costs among all subsidiaries.\u201d However, the department realized that the \u201ccomplexity of the two corporate structures to be merged and the uncertainty regarding the final structure of the post-merger entity\u201d \u201crequire[d] the [distribution companies] to gain sufficient experience with regard to the integration of operations and the appropriate allocation of cost responsibility among the subsidiaries.\u201d Thus, the department required the distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>companies to develop a cost allocation system consistent with department precedent, and ordered them to submit their allocation method on the earlier of two events, either within ninety days following the end of the rate freeze or upon the fifing of a petition for rate relief pursuant to \u00a7 94. We conclude that the department\u2019s treatment of costs and savings allocation constituted a permissible exercise of its discretion. See <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 872-873 n.39 (1997). In addition, the allocation of net savings would not have any effect on rates during the four-year rate freeze.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">6. The plaintiffs challenge the department\u2019s findings that the rate plan serves the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d First, as to the adjustment approved for Cambridge Electric\u2019s and Commonwealth Electric\u2019s distribution rates, we reject the contention (for the reasons explained in our discussion of the department\u2019s approval of the adjustment) that \u201cnet harm\u201d results to customers from the adjustment. We reiterate that this adjustment did not constitute a request for a \u201cgeneral increase in rates\u201d under \u00a7 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We similarly reject the argument that \u201cnet harm\u201d results to customers as a result of the rate freeze. This argument is based on the contention that the distribution companies will achieve savings during the four-year rate freeze, but will not pass on those savings to customers in the form of lower rates, and that \u201cthere was a complete lack of fairness . . . between shareholders and ratepayers [customers]\u201d in the distribution of merger-related benefits or savings. These contentions (1) rest on an improper comparison between the rates in effect during the <em>four-year </em>rate freeze following the merger and the projected savings in the amount of $632.5 million during the <em>ten years </em>following the merger; and ignore (2) the significant difference between merger-related savings and merger-related costs during that period (with savings exceeding costs by $291.8 million); (3) the risks borne by the distribution companies during the four-year rate freeze to achieve savings; (4) the fact that in the absence of the rate freeze, rates would likely increase, even if only to account for inflation; (5) the fact that the department would be monitoring cost-saving measures and results during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the four-year rate freeze; (6) the fact that the department stated that if it had any reason to believe that earnings are excessive, it would investigate rates pursuant to \u00a7 93; and (7) the evidence that customers will receive approximately eighty per cent of net merger-related savings following the four-year rate freeze and during the term of the acquisition premium recovery and, thereafter, will fully enjoy the benefits of merger-related savings. The department could balance these factors and conclude, in the exercise of its discretion, that the combination of the rate freeze together with merger-related savings would not necessarily produce excessive earnings during the rate freeze and would not, in the distribution of costs and savings, result in a \u201cnet harm\u201d to customers; thus, the department properly permitted the rate plan in the exercise of its considerable discretion. Further, as to the distribution of merger-related savings, we are not bound by regulatory actions taken in other jurisdictions. See <em>Seagram Distillers Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 713, 718 (1988). We also reject TEC and Harvard\u2019s conclusory assertion that the department\u2019s approval of the rate freeze was unsupported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d That assertion expressly relies on an incorrect premise, namely, that the evidentiary record must support \u201ca conclusion that the rate freeze would produce just and reasonable rates.\u201d We cannot say on this record that the plaintiffs have met their \u201cheavy burden\u201d of establishing that the department\u2019s approval of the rate plan was unsupported by substantial evidence. See <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">7.
