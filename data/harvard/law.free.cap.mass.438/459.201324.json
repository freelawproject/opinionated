(KDCC) sued Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), alleging breach of contract, misrepresentation, and violation of G. L. c. 93A. The contract claim was eliminated on DEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the writings failed to comply with the Statute of Frauds, but the trial judge, who was not the motion judge, allowed KDCC to present its contract claim at trial under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-201 (2), an exception to the Statute of Frauds. The common-law counts were tried to a jury in the Superior Court, and the judge reserved all aspects of the c. 93A claim to himself. The jury found for DEC on the count alleging breach of contract, but awarded KDCC damages in the amount of $65,500.80 on the count alleging misrepresentation. The judge found for KDCC on the c. 93A count, and awarded damages of $90,920.30, which he doubled after determining that DEC\u2019s violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, had been wilful and knowing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DEC appealed, asserting that the judge committed error (1) by permitting KDCC\u2019s counsel to read to the jury DEC\u2019s alternative affirmative defense to the contract claim; (2) by excluding the deposition testimony of a DEC sales manager, who was unavailable to testify on the subject of the alternative affirmative defense; (3) in his instructions on reasonable reliance; (4) by denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (judgment n.o.v.) on the misrepresentation claim; and (5) by finding a violation of G. L. c. 93A, including a finding that the unfair conduct complained of occurred primarily and substantially within the commonwealth. KDCC cross-appealed, claiming error in the allowance of DEC\u2019s motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>judgment as to the contract claim, and in the denial of prejudgment interest on the multiple damages awarded under c. 93A. We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. We affirm the judgment on the contract count, and reverse the judgment on the count alleging misrepresentation because DEC\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been allowed. We also reverse the c. 93A judgment because the conduct in question \u201cdid not occur primarily and substantially within the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, eighth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">1. The jury could have found the following facts. KDCC is a Kuwaiti corporation engaged in the business of buying and selling computer equipment and systems, principally in the Middle East. It had business dealings with DEC, a Massachusetts business corporation, in Massachusetts during the mid-1980\u2019s, but in 1989 DEC insisted that any future business involving products destined for resale in Kuwait be conducted either through DEC\u2019s United Kingdom facility or independent distributors responsible for delivery of products to Kuwait.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In September, 1991, Kuwait University, in Kuwait, awarded a fixed-price turnkey contract to KDCC to supply, install, and maintain computer systems for its college of engineering. The contract called for installation of various computer systems by mid-January, 1992. Duplicate VAX 6510 systems made by DEC were to be the centerpiece of the project, and smaller systems made by other manufacturers would also be needed. Because of the fixed-price structure of its contract, KDCC sought to minimize its expenses by obtaining an educational discount on its purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Farouk Ayoub, a representative of Kuwaiti Digital Computer Co., a Massachusetts business corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of KDCC, contacted DEC\u2019s Waltham office on behalf of KDCC and sent a list of requirements for the VAX 6510 systems for the college of engineering at Kuwait University. Ayoub also advised that KDCC was looking for the educational discount. He was referred to DEC\u2019s Washington, D.C., office, having been informed that educational discounts were handled by that office. DEC\u2019s Waltham office forwarded the list of requirements to Norris Roy, the designated salesperson in its Washington office.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Roy telephoned Ayoub a few days later and quoted a price of approximately $900,000. Ayoub told him it was out of the question and that KDCC needed the educational discount because the system was for a university. Roy said he would get back to him. The two talked several times over the following several days, and Ayoub told Roy that his budget was in the neighborhood of $600,000. As the negotiations progressed Roy expressed an interest in closing the deal before the end of September. Ayoub arranged a teleconference among himself; his superior at KDCC, Sayed Ismail; Roy; and Roy\u2019s supervisor, Luletha Cheatham. They discussed price, the need to network the various components made by other manufacturers, and the delivery deadline in Kuwait.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Ayoub, Ismail, and Roy met in Washington for three days, starting October 1, 1991, to finalize the deal. Ismail had authority to negotiate all matters on behalf of KDCC, and because Ismail had a tight time schedule, Cheatham told Ismail that Roy had authority for DEC. Cheatham was not able to attend the meeting because of a prior commitment. Ismail and Ayoub produced evidence at the meeting, as requested, that they were acting for an educational institution. That evidence consisted of a letter from the dean of Kuwait University, Kuwait, indicating that KDCC was awarded the contract for delivery of systems to the university. At that meeting, Roy understood, if he had not understood before, that the computer systems were to be shipped to Kuwait.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">By October 3, 1991, Roy and Ismail reached an agreement about the parts and pricing issues. Roy prepared a quotation that included a price of $601,799.20, with the educational discount, and the list of specific parts and components agreed on. The quotation also contained qualifying statements that it was \u201can invitation to offer only,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny contract resulting from the quotation must be accepted at [DEC\u2019s] Corporate offices by a duly authorized representative of [DEC].\u201d Although Ismail and Ayoub reviewed the quotation for parts and pricing, they did not take the time to read these statements, which were contained in two paragraphs appearing below the total price quote and above Roy\u2019s signature. Roy did not discuss the qualifying language with Ismail, and he did not tell Ismail that any further approval was required from anyone at DEC. At Roy\u2019s request, Ismail prepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>a purchase order. The purchase order, signed by Ismail, expressly referred to the quotation prepared by Roy. Roy also gave Ismail details for a letter of credit that would be needed for payment. The three men expressed satisfaction with the deal, shook hands, and parted.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">On Monday, October 7, 1991, Roy delivered the paperwork to Robert Burklow, DEC\u2019s district operations manager, for approval. Burklow expressed doubts about the transaction because it would violate established DEC policies: (1) the educational discount was not available to educational institutions outside the United States, and (2) he was not authorized to approve transactions involving shipment of goods outside his district. At Roy\u2019s request, Burklow agreed to make inquiry at higher corporate levels to see whether an exception to company policy could be made. Burklow was told that an exception would not be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Roy, who thought the deal was \u201cdead\u201d as of October 8 or 9, never alerted Ayoub to any problems during their ongoing telephone conversations until sometime during the week of October 14. When Roy broke the news to Ayoub, he only told Ayoub that there were some problems but that they would work it out. Roy and Cheatham telephoned Ayoub a few days later and told him that DEC wanted an additional $150,000. They did not tell him the real reasons for the rejection. Ayoub was angry and asked to speak with someone higher up the corporate ladder. They referred him to Edward Scully, the Washington district sales manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Ayoub left a message for Scully, who called him back three or four days later. Scully told Ayoub that KDCC would have to pay an additional $150,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ayoub demanded that Scully refer him to the \u201chighest level\u201d at DEC. Scully referred him to Robert Nealon, head of the operations department, whose office was in Boxborough, Massachusetts. Ayoub explained the situation to Nealon, who asked Ayoub to send him copies of the documents he had, and said that he would look into the matter. Nealon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>telephoned Ayoub about ten days later and explained that DEC would not go ahead with the deal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">KDCC then moved quickly to obtain the same DEC systems through an alternative supplier. On October 25, 1991, KDCC contracted with Cambridge Trading Services Corporation (CTSC) to deliver the same systems for $667,300 by the end of November, 1991, before the mid-January, 1992, installation deadline in its contract with Kuwait University. CTSC arranged to purchase the systems through an undisclosed DEC distributor. Due to various mishaps, the turnkey project was not accepted by Kuwait University until May 11, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">2. <em>Contract claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">(a) <em>Statute of Frauds. </em>KDCC argues that the motion judge erred by allowing DEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its contract claim. The judge had ruled that the writings were insufficient \u201cto indicate that a contract for sale has been made.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-201 (l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Applying the standard of review for a grant of summary judgment, we take the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party to determine whether all material facts had been established and whether DEC was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The writings in question were Roy\u2019s quotation and Ismail\u2019s purchase order, both prepared on October <em>3, 1991. </em>Roy\u2019s quotation was qualified by statements that it was an \u201cinvitation to offer only,\u201d and that \u201c[ajny contract resulting from the quotation must be accepted at [DEC\u2019s] Corporate offices by a duly authorized representative of [DEC].\u201d The qualifying language appears between the total price quote and Roy\u2019s signature, and there was no evidence that it was concealed from Ayoub or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Ismail. Ayoub and Ismail reviewed the quotation and had the opportunity to read the qualifying language, but instead ignored it.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Roy\u2019s quotation and Ismail\u2019s purchase order do not evidence an existing contract within the meaning of G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-201 (1). Rather, the qualifying language of the quotation looks toward some future contract. See <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>20th Century Corp., </em>491 Pa. 189, 201 (1980); <em>R.S. Bennett &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Economy Mechanical Indus., Inc., </em>606 F.2d 182, 185-186 (7th Cir. 1979). This court has said that a price quotation generally is not an offer, but \u201ca request or suggestion that an offer be made.\u201d <em>Cannavino &amp; Shea, Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Works Supply Corp., </em>361 Mass. 363, 366 (1972). That is especially true here, where the quotation states that it is an invitation only, and that further approval by someone in authority is required before a contract can be formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">We would reach the same result under G. L. c. 259, \u00a7 1, the Massachusetts general Statute of Frauds. In <em>Fichera </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>312 Mass. 287, 288 (1942), this court held that a memorandum of an auction sale that contained a condition that conveyance of property was \u201cdependent upon acceptance of the deposit and confirmation of the sale by the city or its duly authorized representative\u201d was not an enforceable contract within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Ismail\u2019s claim that he had no knowledge of the qualifying language in Roy\u2019s quotation because he never read it and because Roy never brought it to his attention is to no avail. Roy\u2019s quotation was incorporated by reference in Ismail\u2019s signed purchase order. Because Ismail intended that they serve as a legal document, he is presumed to know their contents. See <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Attleboro Sav. Bank, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 18, 24 (1992), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">(b) <em>Writing in confirmation. </em>The trial judge granted KDCC partial relief from the order for summary judgment on its contract claim, as he permitted KDCC to proceed on an alternate theory. \u201cAlthough a judge should not lightly undo the work of another judge, <em>Barbosa </em>v. <em>Hopper Feeds, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 610, 622 (1989), the power to reconsider an issue remains in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>court until final judgment.\u201d <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, </em>409 Mass. 239, 242 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">At trial, KDCC proceeded on the theory that a writing satisfying the requirements of G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-201 (1), was not required because of the existence of circumstances recognized under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-201 (2),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as an exception to \u00a7 2-201 (1). Under KDCC\u2019s theory, Ismail\u2019s purchase order of October 3, 1991, was \u201ca writing in confirmation\u201d of an oral contract made between merchants, and DEC\u2019s failure to give KDCC a written notice of objection within ten days of receipt thereof satisfied the requirement of a writing under \u00a7 2-201 (1). See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-201 (2). We need not address the validity of this argument because the jury found in favor of DEC. The jury answered special questions indicating that they had accepted KDCC\u2019s evidence and its theory, but the jury determined that DEC had not failed to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">KDCC argues that the verdict was erroneous, for two reasons. First, although it concedes that the jury were properly instructed on the contract claim, KDCC contends that the jury were confused and their verdict was inconsistent with the uncontroverted evidence. Faced with such a result, a party must request the judge to instruct the jury to reconsider their verdict before they are discharged and when there is time to correct any inconsistency. Failure to make such a timely request constitutes a waiver of any challenge to the verdict on the ground that it is inconsistent. See <em>Service Publ., Inc. </em>v. Goverman, 396 Mass. 567, 573 (1986). The issue is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Second, KDCC contends that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. See <em>Scannell v. Boston Elev. Ry., </em>208 Mass. 513, 514 (1911). The issue is not properly before us. Whether the verdict was against the weight of the evidence is not a question for an appellate court to decide in the first instance. It is a question committed to the discretion of the trial judge in a motion for a new trial. If an appeal is taken from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>judge\u2019s action on such a motion, we will review that decision for an abuse of discretion. See <em>Hartmann </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>323 Mass. 56, 60 (1948).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">3. <em>Misrepresentation claim. </em>DEC claims error in the denial of its motion under Mass. R. Civ. R 50 (b), as amended, 428 Mass. 1402 (1998), for judgment n.o.v. on KDCC\u2019s misrepresentation claim. DEC had alleged in its motion that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding that KDCC\u2019s reliance was both reasonable and detrimental. See <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Riemer, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 365 (1993). When reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment n.o.v. we must ask \u201cwhether \u2018anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, 374 </em>Mass. 206, 212 (1978), quoting <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">(a) <em>Reasonable reliance. </em>The primary points on which KDCC relied were the statements and actions of Roy on October 3, 1991, when, at the end of negotiations, Roy, Ayoub, and Ismail shook hands and expressed satisfaction with the deal they had struck. The obstacle to a finding of reasonable reliance is the qualifying language in the quotation prepared by Roy.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">It is true, as KDCC contends, that in <em>Yorke </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>332 Mass. 368, 374 (1955), this court adopted the rule of the Restatement of Torts \u00a7 540 (1938), which states: \u201cThe recipient in a business transaction of a fraudulent misrepresentation of fact is justified in relying on its truth, although he might have ascertained the falsity of the representation had he made an investigation.\u201d The court also noted, however, that \u201c[t]he plaintiff here was not relying on a statement of opinion nor on a representation that was either preposterous or palpably false. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>See Restatement of Torts \u00a7 541.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 540 and 541 (1977) are similar to their 1938 Restatement counterparts. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 540 states: \u201cThe recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation of fact is justified in relying upon its truth, although he might have ascertained the falsity of the representation had he made an investigation.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 541 states: \u201cThe recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation is not justified in relying upon its truth if he knows that it is false or its falsity is obvious to him.\u201d There is thus a distinction between a falsity that could only be uncovered by way of \u201cinvestigation\u201d and a falsity that was readily apparent or \u201cobvious.\u201d Comment a to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 540, <em>supra, </em>states that, \u201cif a mere cursory glance would have disclosed the falsity of the representation, its falsity is regarded as obvious under the rule stated in \u00a7 541.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Reliance on any statement or conduct of Roy made during the course of mutual congratulations at having reached a deal was unreasonable as a matter of law because it conflicted with the qualifying language of Roy\u2019s quotation, which stated that it was only an invitation to offer, and that any contract required approval from someone with authority at DEC. A cursory review of this language in the quotation would have alerted Ayoub and Ismail that they could not rely on (or interpret) Roy\u2019s statements as indicative of a final deal. The qualifying language was presented essentially contemporaneously with Roy\u2019s statements. No \u201cinvestigation\u201d was required. All that was required of Ayoub and Ismail was that they read the document to ascertain the obvious. See <em>Mahaney </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 6 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 919, 920 (1978); <em>Coll </em>v. <em>PB Diagnostics Sys., Inc., </em>50 F.3d 1115, 1124-1125 &amp; n.6 (1st Cir. 1995); <em>Trifiro </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>845 F.2d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 1988). There was no evidence that Roy tried to conceal the qualifying language from Ayoub or Ismail, or that he lulled them into ignoring it. See <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>368 Mass. 433, 446 (1975). There was no evidence that Roy represented that the deal would be approved by those with that authority. Cf. <em>Cellucci </em>v. <em>Sun Oil Co., </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 726 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">There is no merit to KDCC\u2019s assertion that it also relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the representations of Cheatham as to Roy\u2019s authority, because those representations, like Roy\u2019s assertion of a deal, were contradicted by the qualifying language in Roy\u2019s quotation. Even if KDCC reasonably could have relied on the late-September, 1991, representations by Cheatham that Roy had authority to contract,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> KDCC could not show that such reliance was reasonable after October 3, 1991, when it received Roy\u2019s quotation. It should have been obvious to anyone who took the time to read the entire quotation that Roy did not have authority to make a contract. The brightest star in KDCC\u2019s constellation of points on which it relied, Roy\u2019s expression of satisfaction at having reached a deal, was flickering \u201cno deal\u201d by virtue of the qualifying language in the quotation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">KDCC\u2019s theory as to other alleged misrepresentations is unavailing. Scully\u2019s statement suggesting that KDCC pay an additional $150,000 was a statement of rejection, not that a deal had been struck. Contrary to KDCC\u2019s urging, any statements by Burklow, Scully, and Nealon to make further inquiry reasonably could not be relied on as representations that a contract would be executed. Such statements may properly support hope, but they do not support reasonable reliance. At best, they were no more than a promise to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">(b) <em>Detrimental reliance. </em>KDCC\u2019s evidence of misrepresentation was also deficient on another necessary element. KDCC offered no evidence that any losses it incurred were caused by its reliance on a misrepresentation attributable to DEC. See <em>Hurwitz </em>v. <em>Bocian, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 365, 370-371 (1996). In particular, KDCC offered no evidence that, but for the alleged misrepresentation, it could have obtained computer equipment at a lower price than it subsequently paid. Nor was there evidence of delay damages, as KDCC found a substitute provider who agreed to install the computer at Kuwait University within the time provided under its turnkey contract. Evidence of other expenses incurred by KDCC were not shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>to have been caused by any misrepresentation attributable to DEC.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">DEC\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. should have been allowed either on the ground that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding that KDCC reasonably relied on a misrepresentation attributable to DEC, or on the ground that KDCC had not shown that it reasonably relied to its detriment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">4. <em>Chapter 93A. </em>DEC challenges the judge\u2019s determination that its alleged unfair conduct occurred \u201cprimarily and substantially\u201d in Massachusetts. The burden of proof on this issue rests with DEC. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, eighth par.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact on this issue absent clear error, but whether DEC met its burden is a question of law subject to plenary review. See <em>Sonesta Int\u2019l Hotels Corp. </em>v. <em>Central Fla. Invs., Inc., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 154, 158 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The judge determined that the unfair and deceptive practices occurred primarily and substantially in Massachusetts. We summarize his findings on the issue. DEC was at all material times a Massachusetts corporation; DEC and Kuwaiti Digital (KDCC\u2019s subsidiary) had done a substantial amount of business between 1984 and 1988; DEC moved its servicing of KDCC\u2019s inquiry to its Washington office, ostensibly because it believed that the inquiry was for a university in the Washington area; until October 2, 1991, what had occurred between the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>did <em>not </em>occur primarily and substantially in Massachusetts and, if DEC had broken off negotiations before the culmination of negotiations on October 3, 1991, DEC\u2019s conduct would not have been unfair and deceptive; from October 2, 1991, forward, after Roy received the letter from the dean of Kuwait University, Kuwait, and realized that the computers would be delivered out of the Washington area and out of the country, \u201cthe deceptive and unfair stringing along of [KDCC] by DEC really began[,] [a]nd that stringing along culminated in late October with DEC\u2019s pretextual application of its own internal business policies as a basis for refusing to go forward with the agreement reached on October 3, 1991\u201d; \u201c[t]he business policies that formed the underpinning of DEC\u2019s breach were created, issued and imposed from DEC corporate headquarters in Massachusetts\u201d; and Nealon, from his office in Massachusetts, \u201creemphasized the DEC policies which effectively slammed the door in the face of the deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The \u201cprimarily and substantially\u201d test under c. 93A first appeared in \u00a7 3 (1) <em>(b), </em>inserted by St. 1967, c. 813, \u00a7 1, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201c(1) Nothing in this chapter shall apply to . . . <em>(b) </em>trade or commerce of any person of whose gross revenue at least twenty per cent is derived from transactions in interstate commerce, <em>excepting however transactions and actions which (i) occur primarily and substantially within the commonwealth, </em>and (ii) as to which the Federal Trade Commission or its designated representative has failed to assert in writing within fourteen days of notice to it and to said person by the attorney general its obligation to action proposed by him and set forth in said notice . . . .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Section 3 (1) <em>(b) </em>was struck by St. 1983, c. 242. The test was reintroduced by St. 1986, c. 363, \u00a7 4, which amended \u00a7 11 by rewriting the last paragraph. See note 11, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">We previously have considered the \u201cprimarily and substantially\u201d test under the former \u00a7 3 (1) <em>(b) </em>in <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Mark IV Homes, Inc., </em>387 Mass. 575, 582 (1982), and <em>Bushkin Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>393 Mass. 622, 638 (1985). Those cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>provided a limited opportunity to address the scope of the test.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In both cases we declined to create a list of factors to be used in determining whether conduct alleged to be actionable under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, occurred primarily and substantially within the Commonwealth. See <em>id. </em>at 637 &amp; n.11; <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Mark IV Homes, Inc., supra </em>at 580 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">We have misgivings about the utility of a formula for analyzing all cases under \u00a7 11. Whether the \u201cactions and transactions [constituting the \u00a7 11 claim] occurred primarily and substantially within the commonwealth\u201d is not a determination that can be reduced to any precise formula. Significant factors that can be identified for one case may be nonexistent in another.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Any determination necessarily will be fact intensive and unique to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>each case. Cases in the nature of contract will be different from cases sounding in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In addition, it may, or may not, be appropriate to decide cases involving wrongful conduct in multiple jurisdictions based on which jurisdiction was the source of the most instances of misconduct. On the one hand, a single instance of misconduct in one jurisdiction may have greater significance for a case as a whole than a multiplicity of instances of misconduct in another jurisdiction. On the other hand, the sheer number of instances of misconduct in one jurisdiction may produce the heft needed to resolve the question. The same observations may be made about the nature and number of instances of misconduct received, and misconduct acted on.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As Justice Kaplan noted, \u201cThe attempts, however, to single out particular factors that might control the functional inquiry and then to place these factors in some order of importance, are necessarily not fully satisfactory.\u201d <em>Sonesta Int\u2019l Hotels Corp. </em>v. <em>Central Fla. Invs., Inc., supra </em>at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">We conclude that the analysis required under \u00a7 11 should not be based on a test identified by any particular factor or factors because of a tendency to shift the focus of inquiry away from the purpose and scope of c. 93A. Section 11 suggests an approach in which a judge should, after making findings of fact, and after considering those findings in the context of the entire \u00a7 11 claim, determine whether the center of gravity of the circumstances that give rise to the claim is primarily and substantially within the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">We turn to the judge\u2019s analysis. We are satisfied that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>judge made an appropriate analysis based on facts that he found. However, some critical facts found by the judge are plainly erroneous. In particular, essential to his conclusion that DEC had failed to show that the wrongful conduct and transactions had not occurred \u201cprimarily and substantially\u201d in Massachusetts was DEC\u2019s application of its internal business policies, which he found were \u201ccreated, issued and imposed from DEC corporate headquarters in Massachusetts.\u201d However, the judge did <em>not </em>find that there was any impropriety in the creation or issuance of those policies, or that the policies themselves were unfair or deceptive. The policies were essentially neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The judge further found that the policies were used to \u201cunfair[ly] string along\u201d KDCC. However, the judge found that Scully told Ayoub during the week of October 14, 1991, that corporate policy prevented the Washington office from handling a transaction that involved shipment of computers to a region that fell outside the jurisdiction of that office. There was no \u201cstringing along\u201d at that time, as Scully told Ayoub that the Washington office could not sell him the computer system. Under the facts found by the judge, Scully\u2019s prompt and straightforward application of a neutral corporate policy could not be unfair or deceptive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The same applies to Ayoub\u2019s conversation with Nealon. The judge found that Nealon told Ayoub that DEC policy prohibited the sale of computers by a district office in whose district delivery would not be made, and that the educational discount was not available to schools, colleges, and universities not located in the United States. Nealon had told Ayoub essentially what Ayoub had already heard from Scully, namely, that neutral corporate policy prohibited the sale by the Washington office. There was nothing unfair or deceptive about those policies, or the manner in which they were applied by Scully or Nealon. There was no evidence that Nealon could have responded sooner, or that the ten days it took him to get back to Ayoub caused KDCC any harm. Consequently, the fact that the policies were adopted and applied in Massachusetts, and the fact that Nealon was in Massachusetts, cannot be considered on the question whether the wrongful conduct occurred \u201cprimarily and substantially\u201d in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The judge\u2019s reliance on <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 474 (1991) (\u201cConduct \u2018in disregard of known contractual arrangements\u2019 and intended to secure benefits for the breaching party constitutes an unfair act or practice for c. 93A purposes\u201d), is misplaced. There were no known contractual arrangements that were disregarded or breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The matter of the adoption and application of corporate policies thus having been removed from consideration, virtually all the conduct that can be said to be unfair or deceptive, and the underlying negotiations, occurred in Washington. DEC was entitled to judgment on the c. 93A count because it met its burden of proving that the actions and transactions constituting the \u00a7 11 claim occurred primarily and substantially outside the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment on Count I (breach of contract) is affirmed. The order denying DEC\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. on Count II (misrepresentation) is vacated and we remand for entry of an order allowing DEC\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. The judgment on Count m (c. 93A) is reversed, and judgment is to enter for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-12\"> General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 11, provides for an award of multiple damages if the violation of \u00a7 2 is wilful or knowing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\"> In his findings on the c. 93A count, the judge credited Scully\u2019s version, in which Scully told Ayoub that the sale could not go through the Washington, D.C., office, but had to be handled by the overseas sales office, and that government procedures also had to be met before foreign sales could be approved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\"> The judge\u2019s c. 93A findings credited Nealon\u2019s testimony on this point, in which Nealon told Ayoub that DEC\u2019s policy only permitted educational discounts for schools in the United States, and DEC policy did not permit sales to be made out of the district. Nealon recommended that Ayoub attempt to purchase the systems through DEC\u2019s foreign sales office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b486-10\"> The parties have at all relevant times assumed that the applicable law is the law of Massachusetts. We accept that assumption for purposes of this appeal. The parallel provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code contained in D.C. Code \u00a7 28:2-201(1) and (2) (2001) are identical to G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-201 (1) and 2-201 (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\"> General Laws c. 106, \u00a7 2-201 (2), states: \u201cBetween merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) against such party unless written notice of objection to its contents is given within ten days after it is received.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\"> Because of our ruling, we need not address DEC\u2019s argument that it was error for the judge to permit KDCC\u2019s counsel to read in evidence as an admission to the existence of a contract DEC\u2019s sixth affirmative defense, namely, \u201cAny contract formed as alleged by KDCC was due to mistake.\u201d We note, however, that there is merit to DEC\u2019s argument. DEC pleaded mistake and the Statute of Frauds as alternative affirmative defenses in its answer to the complaint. \u201c [Alternative or inconsistent pleadings may not be used as binding judicial admissions.\u201d <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 386 (1979), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\"> The deposition testimony of Cheatham, which the judge would not permit DEC to read, indicates that Cheatham denied making such representations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b491-8\"> KDCC\u2019s further assertion that it relied on DEC\u2019S original home office referral to its Washington office similarly fails. Nothing in the mere fact of that referral would reasonably be interpreted as countermanding the qualifying language or expanding the scope of Roy\u2019s authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\"> There is no merit to KDCC\u2019s claim that the jury properly awarded contract (benefit of the bargain) damages. In an action for misrepresentation, this measure of damages is available where, unlike here, a party has been induced by fraud to enter into a business transaction and thereafter discovers that he did not receive what was promised. Recovery is in the nature of damages for breach of warranty. See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Price, </em>340 Mass. 502, 507, 510 (1960); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 549 comment 1 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b492-9\"> Because our holding is dispositive of the misrepresentation claim, we need not address DEC\u2019s claims that the judge committed error by excluding the deposition testimony of Cheatham, and in his instruction on reasonable reliance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b492-10\"> General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 11, eighth par., states: \u201cNo action shall be brought or maintained under this section unless the actions and transactions constituting the alleged unfair method of competition or the unfair or deceptive act or practice occurred primarily and substantially within the commonwealth.

See <em>Play Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>LDDS Metromedia Communications, Inc., </em>123 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir. 1997); <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Royal Bank, </em>109 F.3d 820, 829, 831 (1st Cir. 1997) (\u201cthe pragmatic, functional analysis is not necessarily limited to the three factors\u201d); <em>Clinton Hosp.

The situs of loss may, nevertheless, be considered in the determination.

See, e.g., <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Royal Bank, supra </em>at 830 (\u201cbulk\u201d of wrongful acts; \u201cslightly more\u201d misrepresentations received in Canada); <em>Computer Sys.
