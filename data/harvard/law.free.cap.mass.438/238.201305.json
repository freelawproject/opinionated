L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(j), </em>applies to BB guns as well as other firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-16\">1. <em>Background. </em>On February 19, 2001, a student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst reported to the university police that a man had carried a black firearm into a room of one of the dormitories. Responding to the report, the university police went to the room and found several people, among them the defendants Douglas Sayers and Frederick Fessenden. Sayers matched the description of the man who had been reported carrying the firearm, but he denied possessing such a weapon. On further inquiry by the police, Fessenden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>produced a Marksman .177 caliber BB pellet gun. Sayers eventually admitted having been in possession of the BB gun earlier that night.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The defendants were charged with carrying a firearm on university grounds in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (/). Each filed a motion to dismiss the complaint against him. A judge in the District Court granted the motions, concluding that he was constrained to dismiss the complaints by this court\u2019s holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>389 Mass. 641 (1983), that \u201cthe provisions of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 12B, contain the exclusive regulatory language governing the possession of air rifles and BB guns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644. Because the defendants had not been charged with violating G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 12B, the court reasoned, they could not be found guilty of a BB gun related offense. The Commonwealth appealed, and we transferred the cases to this court on our own motion. We now reverse the order of the District Court trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>There are three provisions of G. L. c. 269 relevant to this case. First, \u00a7 10 (a) prohibits the possession of a firearm, rifle, or shotgun unless certain exceptions are met, such as the possession of a license. One of these exceptions is \u201chaving complied\u201d with the requirements of \u00a7 12B. G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a) (5) and (6). The word \u201cfirearm\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 10 (a) is defined as \u201ca pistol, revolver or other weapon . . . from which a shot or bullet can be discharged and of which the length of the barrel or barrels is less than [sixteen] inches.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. Second, \u00a7 10 (/) forbids anyone to carry \u201con his person a firearm as hereinafter defined ... in any building or on the grounds of any . . . college or university without the written authorization of the board or officer in charge\u201d and provides a different and broader definition of \u201cfirearm,\u201d which includes \u201cany pistol, revolver, rifle or smoothbore arm from which a shot, bullet or pellet can be discharged by whatever means.\u201d Finally, \u00a7 12B prohibits minors from possessing BB guns and air rifles in public unless licensed or in the company of an adult. G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 12B.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>this court clarified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>relationship between \u00a7 10 (a) and \u00a7 12B. In that case, the defendant, an adult, was charged with violating \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>for possessing a BB gun without a license. This court held that compliance with \u00a7 12B was the equivalent of the possession of a firearm license and therefore such compliance would excuse a defendant from prosecution under \u00a7 10 <em>(a). </em>Because \u00a7 12B prohibited <em>only </em>juvenile possession of BB guns, and that section was the \u201cexclusive regulatory language\u201d governing BB gun possession, the court reasoned that an adult who possessed a BB gun even without a license was in compliance with \u00a7 12B, and therefore with \u00a7 10 (a). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra </em>at 644-645. The court supported its conclusion by hypothesizing a situation in which an adult wisely decides to confiscate a BB gun in the hands of a minor whom the adult is accompanying. It could not be the intent of the Legislature, the court thought, to make the adult\u2019s confiscation illegal by prohibiting the adult from possessing the gun. See <em>id. </em>at 645-646. The court therefore upheld the dismissal of the charge against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The defendants in this case argue that because we said that \u00a7 12B is the \u201cexclusive regulatory language\u201d governing BB gun possession, their compliance with \u00a7 12B insulates them from any criminal liability under \u00a7 10 (/'). We disagree. In the <em>Rhodes </em>case, we harmonized \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>which regulates the possession of firearms, by requiring, inter alia, a license or compliance with other specified statutes in order to possess them outside of one\u2019s home, with \u00a7 12B, which sets forth the specific requirements for the possession of a BB gun in a public place. Section 10 <em>(j) </em>is a provision of a different character. It specifically bans the possession of any firearm on school campuses, and it does so \u201cnotwithstanding any license\u201d that may provide a defense to a \u00a7 10 (a) prosecution. G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(j). </em>While compliance with \u00a7 12B is a defense to a prosecution under \u00a7 10 (a), just as the possession of a firearm license would be, it provides no similar defense to a prosecution under \u00a7 10 (/), assuming the other elements of the offense are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The only other element of \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>at issue in this case is whether the BB gun that the defendants possessed was a firearm as defined in \u00a7 10 <em>(j). </em>It was. As noted above, that definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d includes any pistol or smoothbore arm \u201cfrom which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>a shot, bullet or <em>pellet </em>can be discharged by whatever means\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>if). </em>This definition clearly includes a BB gun regardless whether it is specifically identified by name.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertion, our conclusion in this case with regard to the interplay among \u00a7\u00a7 10 (a), 12B, and 10 <em>(j) </em>is not anomalous. As a matter of legislative intent, it would be perfectly reasonable for the Legislature to provide more freedom for the possession of a BB gun than for the carrying of other firearms in public, but then equate the two when it came to protecting the schools of the Commonwealth from violence. The possession of a BB gun by an adult or minor on school grounds, when not permitted by one of the exceptions outlined in \u00a7 10 (/), thus violates that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We therefore reverse the allowance of the motions to dismiss and remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\"> The defendants claimed that Fessenden had purchased the gun at a local Wal-Mart store, and that he had intended to use it for an art class project.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
