According to the town charter, town meeting representatives \u201cshall exercise all legislative powers of the town.\u201d There are 104 elected town meeting representatives, eight each from thirteen precincts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They meet once a year to approve bylaws, budgets, and bond issues proposed by the board. Any Plymouth resident or taxpayer may speak at town meeting, but only the elected town meeting representatives may vote on the articles in the town meeting warrant. Town meeting representatives are not compensated for their service or their expenses. They are required to obtain only ten signatures to appear on the ballot, run in nonpartisan elections, and do not report their campaign finances to the office of campaign and political finance. If elected, they serve three-year terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The plaintiff, Eugene T. Lane, Jr., is a Plymouth town meeting representative. He does not campaign, raise funds, or publish position papers. In the 1994 election, Lane was elected on the receipt of 345 votes, representing less than one per cent of the total population of the town. Lane is also a Plymouth fire fighter and the son of the chairman of the board. With his brother, he operates a hydroseeding and landscaping business.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The defendant MPG Newspapers is the publisher of The Old Colony Memorial, a weekly newspaper. It employs the defendants Nan Anastasia, Phyllis Hughes, Charles Mathewson, and Mark Pothier.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">On July 20, 1995, The Old Colony Memorial published a story that on July 9, 1995, Lane stole water from a town fire hydrant to fill the 500-gallon tank of his hydroseeding truck. The story, entitled \u201cFirefighter Steals Hydrant Water\u201d and subtitled \u201cSelectman\u2019s Son Calls Newspaper Story Slander,\u201d mentioned in its first paragraph that Lane was a town meeting representative. As the subtitle of the article suggests, Mathewson, the author of the article, conducted an interview with Lane, who denied that he had been in the vicinity of the hydrant that day. After being contacted by Mathewson, however, Lane ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>plied to the town water superintendent for and received a permit to take water from town hydrants. The newspaper delayed publication of the article until July 20 to allow Mathewson an additional week to conduct further fact checking.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Lane filed suit against the defendants in the Superior Court alleging libel and infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The motion judge ruled that Lane was neither a public official nor a public figure<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by virtue of his job as a fire fighter or his familial relationship to the chairman of the board. The judge also held that the record before him was insufficient to decide whether Lane\u2019s status as a town meeting representative made him a public official. Two years later the defendants again moved for summary judgment. On April 10, 2000, the motion judge, applying the criteria set forth in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., 361 </em>Mass. 849 (1979), ruled that Lane, as a town meeting representative, was a public official. In addition, he found that Lane had no reasonable expectation of proving that the defendants published the article with actual malice, as required by <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, 316 </em>U.S. 254, 279-280 (1964), and therefore granted summary judgment for the defendants on both the libel claim and the infliction of emotional distress claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Lane appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. Before us are two issues: (1) whether Lane is a public official, as that term is used in defamation law, due to his position as a town meeting representative; and (2) whether the motion judge properly granted summary judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>2. <em>Discussion, </em>(a) In the absence of disputed material facts, the question whether a person is a public official is one of law, which we review de novo. See <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., supra </em>at 862-863.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the protections afforded speech in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution require a public official to prove actual malice<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to sustain a claim for defamation based on criticism relating to his official conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 279-280. The Court\u2019s decision rested on a \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 270, and on an understanding \u201c[t]hat erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate, and that it must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the \u2018breathing space\u2019 that they \u2018need ... to survive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271-272, quoting <em>N.A.A.C.P. </em>v. <em>Button, </em>371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The public official in the <em>New York Times </em>case was an elected commissioner of the city of Montgomery, Alabama, and there was no need for the Court to decide whether everyone holding a public position, elected or appointed, was a \u201cpublic official\u201d for defamation purposes. Consequently, it noted that it was not establishing a test to determine \u201chow far down into the lower ranks\u201d public official status extended. <em>Id. </em>at 283 n.23. Since the decision in <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>there has been decisional law both in State and Federal courts regarding whether certain public employees are \u201cpublic officials\u201d for defamation purposes. See, e.g., <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Baer, </em>383 U.S. 75, 85-86 (1966) (stating that public official status \u201cat the very least\u201d applies to appointed government employees who have substantial responsibility for or control over conduct of government affairs); <em>Rotkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sadowsky, </em>431 Mass. 748 (2000); <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting &amp; Cable Inc., </em>603 F. Supp. 377, 387 (E.D. Pa.), aff\u2019d, 780 F.2d 340 (3d Cir. 1985) (holding police officer to be public official); <em>Nodar </em>v. <em>Galbreath, </em>462 So. 2d 803, 808 (Fla. 1984) (holding public high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>school teacher not to be public official); <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Corinthian Television Corp., </em>583 P.2d 1101, 1102 (Okla. 1978) (holding public school coach to be public official). In attempting to answer this question, courts have fashioned a variety of \u201ctests\u201d focusing on an employee\u2019s responsibilities and status. For example, in <em>Rotkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sadowsky, supra, </em>this court concluded that a police officer was a public official, and enumerated the following factors to be considered in mating such a determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201c \u2018The employee\u2019s position must be one which would invite public scrutiny and discussion of the person holding it, entirely apart from the scrutiny and discussion occasioned by the particular charges in controversy.\u2019 . . . Some of the other relevant considerations ... are the government employee\u2019s ability to set policy guidelines that are of importance to public debate; ... the impact of the government position on everyday life; the potential for social harm from abuse of the government position; as well as the employee\u2019s access to the press\u201d (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 753, quoting <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Baer, supra </em>at 86-87 n.13.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Notably, none of the defamation cases decided by the United States Supreme Court since <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>on the question \u201chow far down into the lower ranks\u201d a public employee must be to escape the public official label, has involved an elected official. See, e.g., <em>Masson </em>v. <em>New Yorker Magazine, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 496 (1991) (nonelected professor and psychoanalyst); <em>Milkovich </em>v. <em>Lorain Journal Co., </em>497 U.S. 1 (1990) (nonelected high school wrestling coach); <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323 (1974) (nonelected prominent at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>torney); <em>Curtis Publ. Co. </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130 (1967) (nonelected public university athletic director); <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Baer, supra </em>(nonelected county recreation area supervisor).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similarly, defamation cases decided by our appellate courts have dealt exclusively with the status of appointed public employees. See, e.g., <em>Rotkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sadowsky, supra </em>(police officer); <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., supra </em>(non-elected local redevelopment authority member); <em>Netherwood </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, Local 1725, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 11 (2001) (nonelected regional school district director of maintenance and transportation).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">When they have addressed the status of elected officials, cases decided in Federal jurisdictions are uniform in either deciding or assuming that elected officials are public officials for defamation purposes. See, e.g., <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of the Socorro Consol. Sch. Dist., 777 </em>F.2d 1403, 1408 (10th Cir. 1985) (elected school board members); <em>Fadell </em>v. <em>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co., </em>557 F.2d 107, 108 (7th Cir. 1977) (elected township tax assessor); <em>Dostert </em>v. <em>Washington Post Co., </em>531 F. Supp. 165, 166 n.l (N.D. W. Va. 1982) (elected judge). State courts have been similarly consistent. See <em>Nodar </em>v. <em>Galbreath, supra </em>at 808 n.3 (distinguishing nonelected public school teacher from elected superintendent); <em>Flannery </em>v. <em>Allyn, 15 </em>Ill. App. 2d 365, 373 (1966) (\u201clittle doubt that a Commissioner of Police, who was an elected official, is a public official\u201d); <em>Beeching </em>v. <em>Levee, </em>764 N.E.2d 669, 679 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002) (\u201celected school board members could easily be determined to be \u2018public officials\u2019 because of their elective office\u201d); <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>601 So. 2d 792, 797 (La. Ct. App. 1992) <em>(New York Times </em>rule applies to \u201celected public officials\u201d); <em>A.S. Abell Co. </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>258 Md. 56, 75 (Ct. App. 1970) (plaintiff not public official in part because \u201c[sjhe held no elective office . . .\u201d); <em>Silsdorf </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>59 N.Y.2d 8, 17 (1983) (\u201cPlaintiff [mayor and participant in election for office] clearly ... a \u2018public of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ficial\u2019 \u201d); <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Corinthian Television Corp., supra </em>at 1102 (\u201cperson may become a public official within contemplation of the New York Times rule ... [by being] an elected official\u201d); <em>Braig </em>v. <em>Field Communications, </em>310 Pa. Super. 569, 577 (1983) (\u201cappellant concedes he is certainly an elected \u2018public official\u2019 \u201d); <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Curtis Publ. Co., </em>72 Wash. 2d 999, 1006 (1967) (considering whether <em>New York Times </em>rule applies to cases \u201cother than those involving elected public officials\u201d); <em>Long </em>v. <em>Egnor, </em>176 W. Va. 628, 636 (1986) (\u201cno question that [elected] Board [of Education] members must be treated as public officials, as that term is used in libel law\u201d); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Coursolle Broadcasting of Wis., Inc., </em>127 Wis. 2d 105, 115 (1985) (former State assemblyman not public official since resignation from elected office). Lane has not directed our attention to any State or Federal court ruling that an elected official is not a public official, and we have found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Leading defamation treatises also conclude that a rule that considers all elected officials to be public officials for defamation law purposes is appropriate. In B.W. Sanford, Libel and Privacy \u00a7 7.2.3.1 (2d ed. 1991 &amp; Supp. 1993), the author states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">\u201cSome positions seem immutably appropriate for \u2018public official\u2019 status. Elected officials must satisfy the <em>Sullivan </em>standard. An elected member of a legislative body, or an individual holding the office of mayor, for instance, clearly should be held a \u2018public official.\u2019 Indeed, it is doubtful that <em>any </em>elected governmental position is so \u2018far down into the lower ranks\u2019 that it is inappropriate for application of the <em>[New York Times Co. </em>v.] <em>Sullivan </em>rule\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\"><em>Id. </em>Similarly, R.D. Sack concludes that \u201c[a]ll elected officials are \u2018public\u2019; by running for office they place their character and behavior before the public for consideration.\u201d 1 R.D. Sack, Libel, Slander and Related Problems \u00a7 5.2.1, at 5-6 (3d ed. 1994 &amp; Supp. 2002). See R.H. Phelps &amp; E.D. Hamilton, Libel: Rights, Risks, Responsibilities 175 (rev. ed. 1978) (\u201c[Misstatements are protected] on all three levels \u2014 national, state and local. All elected officials are covered, from the President on down\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">In summary, there is a consensus that all elected officials are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>public officials for the purpose of the application of defamation law. Despite this consensus, Lane\u2019s argument is, in essence, that as one of 104 town meeting representatives who convene only once a year to vote on policies and budgets developed by the board of selectmen, his position is so insignificant that it ought to qualify as an exception to the rule. He points out by analogy that the office of campaign and political finance does not even require town meeting representatives to report their campaign finances.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">While we agree that the limited responsibilities of an elected town meeting representative may place that position at the far end of a continuum of elected public officials from that of the President of the United States, the principle of \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open\u201d public debate regarding the conduct of those we elect to govern applies equally to both. <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 270. See, e.g., <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>384 U.S. 214, 219 (1966) (\u201cpress serves and was designed to serve ... as a constitutionally chosen means for keeping officials elected by the people responsible to all the people whom they were selected to serve\u201d); <em>Medico </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>643 F.2d 134, 141 (3d Cir. 1981) (\u201cElected officials derive their authority from, and are answerable to, the public .... [T]here can be no penalty for exposing to general view the possible wrongdoing of government officials\u201d); <em>Ellerbee </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>262 Ga. 516, 517 (1992) (\u201cpeople should be free to question and criticize those who govern them\u201d). As Justice Black stated in <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>\u201cThis Nation of ours elects many of its important officials; so do the States, the municipalities, the counties, and even many precincts. These officials are responsible to the people for the way they perform their duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296 (Black, J., concurring).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">By making the office of town meeting representative elective, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>the town has invited public scrutiny of the qualifications of candidates for that office as well as their performance. Consequently, we hold that Lane is a public official, and we perceive no circumstances in which any elected official holding public office would be considered otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The rule that we announce today does not affect the requirement that, to be protected, a defendant\u2019s speech must relate to a public official\u2019s official conduct or qualifications for office. This requirement has been clearly established by the Supreme Court. See <em>Ocala Star-Banner Co. </em>v. Damron, 401 U.S. 295, 299 (1971); <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 259, 283 &amp; n.23. In this case, we have no trouble concluding that the article alleging Lane\u2019s theft of town water related to his position as a town meeting representative. That position was mentioned twice in the article, including in the first paragraph, and the subject of the article was Lane\u2019s use of town property. Moreover, a \u201ccharge of criminal conduct against an official or a candidate ... is always relevant to his fitness for office for purposes of applying the <em>New York Times </em>rule of knowing falsehood or reckless disregard of the truth.\u201d <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., supra </em>at 863, quoting <em>Ocala Star-Banner Co. </em>v. <em>Damron, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">(b) Based on the summary judgment record before him, the motion judge concluded that Lane could not reasonably expect to prove that the defendants acted with actual malice, and therefore that summary judgment was appropriate. Lane appeals from this ruling.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We will affirm an order granting summary judgment to the defendants if they have demonstrated that the plaintiff \u201chas no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of the case at trial.\u201d <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., </em>426 Mass. 122, 127 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Given Lane\u2019s status as a public official, he would have to prove, by \u201cconvincing clarity,\u201d that the defendants published the allegation of water theft knowing that the allegation was false or recklessly disregarding whether it was false. <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 285-286. The judge concluded that Lane could not sustain this burden. We agree. First, there is no evidence that any of the defendants knew the article to be false. Second, there is no evidence that the defendants acted with \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the truth or falsity of the article. In <em>St. Amant </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, 731 (1968), the Supreme Court held that in order to establish reckless disregard in these circumstances the plaintiff must show \u201cthat the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication,\u201d but proceeded to publish anyway. The record does not reveal any realistic way in which Lane could show that the defendants entertained serious doubts about the truth of the publication.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The only evidence even possibly supporting such a conclusion is that the publication of the article was delayed by one week for fact checking. But the affidavit of Mathewson, the writer of the article, and the interrogatory answers of the managing editor of The Old Colony Memorial make clear that the extra week was used by the defendants only to solidify the story; the defendants themselves did not doubt its accuracy. Summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order of the Superior Court judge granting summary judgment for the defendants is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\"> The population of the town, according to the 1990 census, was 48,329.

Lane does not challenge these rulings on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\"> Actual malice in this context means either knowledge that a statement made about the official is false or reckless disregard for whether it is false or not.

There we relied on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Baer, </em>383 U.S. 75 (1966), for the proposition that public officials are officials who \u201chave, or publicly appear to have, substantial responsibility for control of public affairs,\u201d and that a public official\u2019s position \u201cmust be one which would invite public scrutiny and discussion of the person holding it, entirely apart from the scrutiny and discussion occasioned by the particular charges in controversy.\u201d <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., supra </em>at 863, 864, quoting <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Baer, supra </em>at 86-87 n.13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\"> The United States Supreme Court has held the <em>New York Times </em>standard to apply to candidates for public office.

Out of caution, we will therefore address the point on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> There is, in fact, nothing in the record to suggest that the defendants should have entertained any doubts about the veracity of the story. The story was based on two eyewitness accounts of Lane\u2019s use of the town hydrant as well as two interviews with Lane, the statement of the town water superintendent that Lane did not have a permit to use the hydrant and a review of Lane\u2019s home water usage records that suggested that he had not obtained the water at home. In these circumstances, the defendants could reasonably have expected the story to be correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
