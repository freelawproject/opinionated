L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, to vacate an arbitration award. The arbitrator concluded that the school committee had violated its collective bargaining agreement with the defendant, United Educators of Pittsfield (union), when it ordered the involuntary transfer of a teacher, Karen Woolis, to a position in a different school. He ruled that the teacher must be reinstated to her former position, or a comparable one, at her former school and be paid the supplemental stipend that she would have received but for the transfer. The judge entered judgment on the pleadings for the union and affirmed the award. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion, and now affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The case was submitted to the Superior Court judge on the pleadings. The parties do not dispute the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings, which we summarize. This controversy arose at the end of the 1998-1999 school year. At that time, Woolis had worked in the Pittsfield school system for eleven years as a resource room teacher at the Egremont Elementary School (Egremont). Woolis was a teacher entitled to \u201cprofessional teacher status\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> certified to teach mild-to-moderate special-needs students from preschool to grade nine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>At Egremont, she worked with special-needs students on an as-needed basis. Although she was a member of the \u201cbuilding assessment team\u201d that determined individual education plans for students, she was not involved in developing students\u2019 educational curricula. Woolis was also Egremont\u2019s \u201cbuilding technology integrator\u201d (BTI), working with teachers to integrate technology into the classroom. Woolis earned an annual stipend of $2,500 for the BTI position.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The terms of Woolis\u2019s employment as a teacher in the Pitts-field school district were covered by a collective bargaining agreement (agreement) between the school committee and the union, effective August 28, 1996, through August 25, 1999. The agreement identifies the union as \u201cthe exclusive bargaining agent for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to . . . conditions of employment for: All full and part-time classroom teachers . . . teachers of students with special needs . . . and all other employees of the [Pittsfield] school system.\u201d Among other things, it sets forth a procedure for the involuntary transfer of teachers,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and provides for final and binding arbitration of grievances that cannot be resolved administratively.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In May, 1999, shortly after expressing frustration with her job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>to Stephanie Case, who is described in the record only as \u201csupervisor of special education,\u201d Woolis was approached by Michael Meyer, the acting director of special education, who asked her to consider a teaching position in the special education program at Herberg Middle School (Herberg).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Woolis agreed to explore the option. She visited the Herberg program and discussed it with several of the paraprofessionals who worked there. Woolis learned that the Herberg position was significantly different from her position at Egremont: the children were older and had more severe disabilities<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; her class would be composed solely of special-needs children for whom she would be the sole responsible teacher; her classroom would be less spacious and the technological resources less up to date than at Egremont; and her working hours would change significantly. Woolis concluded that she was not properly certified for the position, and decided that a move to Herberg would not be in her best professional interest. She declined Meyer\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Nevertheless, Meyer believed that Woolis, an experienced and competent educator, would do well at Herberg, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>current special education teacher was \u201cstruggling.\u201d The day after Woolis informed Meyer and Case that she declined the transfer, Meyer and Case met with Woolis in the hopes of persuading her to change her mind. When she did not, Meyer handed Woolis a letter stating that he was in any event transferring her to the Herberg position for the 1999-2000 academic year. The teacher whom Woolis was replacing had agreed to a voluntary transfer to Egremont. Meyer testified that \u201che discussed the matter with the principals at the schools and they agreed to the personnel moves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Woolis, viewing Meyer\u2019s action as an involuntary transfer, filed a grievance challenging the transfer. She also argued to the assistant superintendent and the Department of Education (department) that she was not qualified for the new position. The department determined that Woolis was qualified for the position at Herberg. When she did not succeed in resolving the grievance administratively, Woolis, represented by the union, submitted the dispute to binding arbitration. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>She sought recision of the transfer directive and a restoration of her $2,500 yearly BTI stipend.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The school committee presented the following issue to the arbitrator: \u201cWhether the decision to involuntarily transfer a teacher is arbitrable under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and under state law.\u201d The union raised one issue: \u201cDid the administration violate the Collective Bargaining Agreement by the manner in which it transferred Karen Woolis from Egremont Elementary School to Herberg Middle School? If so, what shall be the remedy?\u201d After an arbitration hearing, the arbitrator issued a written decision that set out his factual findings, reasoning, and conclusions, as the agreement required him to do. He determined, first, that the matter was arbitrable because (1) it concerned a grievance based on the provision of the agreement concerning involuntary transfers, and (2) the provision was not invalid under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, as amended by the Reform Act, governing the managerial authority of principals, or the regulations promulgated under St. 1972, c. 766, concerning special education. Turning to the merits, he found that the school committee had violated the agreement because it did not transfer Woolis to a comparable position. He ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Woolis reinstated to the same or a comparable position at Egremont and ordered the school committee to pay Woolis the BTI stipend that she would have received had she remained at Egremont.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The school committee sought to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award in the Superior Court. See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11. In an order and memorandum on the school committee\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, the judge, reviewing only the question of arbitrability, concluded that, because involuntary transfers implicate district-wide personnel policies, the matter of involuntary transfers is properly within the ambit of collective bargaining and arbitration between the school committee and the union and not contrary to any of the provisions of the Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">2. <em>Scope of review. </em>Public policy in the Commonwealth strongly encourages arbitration. <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. J. <em>Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990), and cases cited. Arbitration has long been viewed as a particularly appropriate and effective means to resolve labor disputes. See, e.g., G. L. c. 150E (collective bargaining between public employers and employees). Arbitration would have little value if it were merely an intermediate step between a grievance and litigation in the courts. For this reason, the Legislature has narrowly circumscribed the grounds to vacate arbitral awards, and a party challenging such an award faces formidable obstacles. See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 ll<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., supra. </em>Absent proof of one of the grounds enumerated in G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, to vacate arbitral awards, we are strictly bound by the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law, even if they are in error. See <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>435 Mass. 54, 61-62 (2001), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Here, the school committee claims that the matter before the arbitrator is not arbitrable because it concerns a matter \u2014 involuntary transfers \u2014 that is the exclusive province of school principals pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B. See G. L. c. 150C, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>\u00a7 11 (a) (3). In considering the school committee\u2019s claim, \u201cwe look only to determine if the arbitrator here exceeded his scope of reference, acted against clearly defined public policy, or ordered conduct prohibited by State or Federal law.\u201d <em>Duxbury </em>v. <em>Duxbury Permanent Firefighters Ass\u2019n, Local 2167, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 464 (2000). See <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., supra </em>at 1007. Whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority must be determined on a case-by-case basis. <em>Higher Educ. Coordinating Council/Roxbury Community College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n/Mass. Community College Council, </em>423 Mass. 23, 31-32 (1996). For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the arbitrator did not exceed his powers or render an unlawful award, and that the judgment declining to vacate the award should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">3. <em>Analysis. </em>The school committee contends that resort to arbitration is precluded by the Reform Act, St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 53, which vests the decision to hire or fire individuals employed in a particular public school with the school\u2019s principal. While conceding, as it must, that G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, does not explicitly refer to a principal\u2019s authority over the involuntary transfer of teachers, the school committee contends that such power is necessarily encompassed within the broad managerial authority given to principals in \u00a7 59B to \u201chire\u201d teachers. This position requires us to examine the scope and purpose of \u00a7 59B, its relation to other provisions of the Reform Act, and its relation to laws concerning collective bargaining. Cf. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>373 Mass. 53, 57 (1977) (noting that collective bargaining agreements relating to school personnel often implicate \u201ca composite of issues affecting conditions of employment and issues affecting educational policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 59B, is but one of the 105 provisions enacted as the Reform Act. The Reform Act was intended as a \u201ccomprehensive reform of our public schools\u201d meant to \u201censure[] that all of our children will be prepared to compete in the global economy.\u201d Education Reform Act of 1993, Conference Committee Report (May 24, 1993). See G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1. Major features of the Reform Act include the establishment of performance standards for students, St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 29; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>abolition of teacher tenure, St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44; the authorization of charter schools, St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 55; and the creation of a new school financing formula, St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 32. The Reform Act also significantly alters the management and accountability structures of public schools. See St. 1993 c. 71, \u00a7 53. Prior to passage of the Reform Act, responsibility for hiring and firing teachers resided with the local school committees, see <em>Higher Educ. Coordinating Council/Roxbury Community College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n/Mass. Community College Council, supra </em>at 29 n.6, a process that the conference committee\u2019s report described as imposing \u201c[b]ureaucratic and political barriers to reform.\u201d Under the Reform Act, the school committee retains \u201cthe authority to \u2018establish educational goals and policies for the schools in the district\u2019 \u201d and the \u201c [responsibility for hiring or terminating a school superintendent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37, as amended. Superintendents, in turn, are responsible for appointing school principals, while principals assume primary responsibility for hiring, disciplining, and terminating teachers and \u201cother personnel assigned to the school,\u201d subject to the \u201capproval\u201d of their superintendents. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B. The impetus for enhancing school principals\u2019 management authority was to increase their accountability. As described in the conference committee\u2019s report, \u201cPrincipals will be put in charge of their schools with the elimination of school committee hiring and firing. With increased managerial powers over the day to day operations of their schools, principals will be held accountable for performance.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See 1992 House Doc. No. 5750 at 2 (letter from Governor introducing bill) (\u201cPrincipals will be clearly established as part of the management team of the school district, with strict accountability for educational performance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In changing the management structure of schools, however, the Legislature granted to public school principals only the degree of managerial latitude that relates to internal school matters, for which the principal is strictly answerable. Even as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>relates to internal school matters, the Legislature did not grant principals unfettered discretion. For example, principals, while they may negotiate individual employee contracts, may not enter into collective bargaining agreements and must follow strict procedural and substantive provisions before firing a teacher with professional status. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 44.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under the Reform Act, the school committee remains the entity that, among other things, determines expenditures within the district\u2019s education appropriation, see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> sets broad education policy, see <em>id., </em>establishes performance standards for teachers, see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38, and negotiates and enters into collective bargaining agreements with teachers and other school personnel, see G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Nor did the Legislature\u2019s commitment to school reform trump the Commonwealth\u2019s strong public policy favoring collective bargaining between the public employers and employees over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the conditions and terms of employment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 921 (1999). A school principal may have the authority to fill a vacant position, but personnel policies related to the terms and conditions of employment remain properly the subject of collective bargaining agreements negotiated on behalf of the school district by the school committee as its exclusive bargaining agent. See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2. And it has long been the policy in Massachusetts that \u201ca school committee may bind itself to follow certain procedures with respect to decisions committed to its exclusive authority, and a failure to observe those procedures may be the basis for an arbitrable grievance.\u201d <em>Higher Educ. Coordinating Council/Roxbury Community College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n/Mass. Community College Council, supra </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In sum, by enacting \u00a7 59B, the Legislature carefully balanced school-based management reforms with the district-wide needs of school systems and the collective bargaining rights of school employees over the terms and conditions of their employment. See, e.g., <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Local 159, Serv. Employees Int\u2019l Union, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 690, 693-694 (1997). We must now consider whether, as the school committee maintains, within these interwoven statutory schemes, the principal\u2019s and superintendent\u2019s authority to transfer employees involuntarily is a \u201chiring decision\u201d under \u00a7 59B. If so, as the school committee argues, then the involuntary transfer is insulated from the collective bargaining process.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In support of its position, the school committee relies principally on two recent Appeals Court decisions. In <em>School Comm. of Peabody </em>v. <em>Peabody Fed\u2019n of Teachers, Local 1289, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 909, 911 (2001), the court held that an arbitration award that directed a school committee to transfer certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>school employees who had requested, but had been denied, a transfer to a different school violated the provision of \u00a7 59B establishing the principal as the sole hiring authority for a school. While recognizing the right of collective bargaining .agreements to \u201cestablish procedures for applying for transfers and filling vacancies,\u201d the Appeals Court nevertheless concluded that the voluntary transfer provisions of the collective bargaining agreement in question, by not recognizing prior approval rights of the principal of the transferee school, violated G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, and thus were not arbitrable. Similarly, in <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Local 159, Serv. Employees Int\u2019l Union, supra, </em>the Appeals Court ruled that an arbitrator\u2019s award directing a school committee to honor the successful bid of a school custodian to transfer from one school to another should be vacated because the relevant provisions of the collective bargaining agreement usurped the principal\u2019s and superintendent\u2019s power of appointment under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B. <em>Id. </em>at 692-693. The court noted that, while the statute does not define the word \u201chire,\u201d the term must be \u201cgiven its ordinary meaning, \u2018employ.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692. \u201cBecause it is apparent that the Legislature sought to give to school principals the power to select all teachers and staff assigned to their school, subject to the approval of the school superintendent, we conclude \u00a7 59B embraces transfers as well as new hires; otherwise, the principal\u2019s power of selection would be thwarted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We agree with the arbitrator and with the judge that <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Local 159, Serv. Employees Int\u2019l Union, supra, </em>as well as the subsequent decision, <em>School Comm. of Peabody </em>v. <em>Peabody Fed\u2019n of Teachers, Local 1289, supra, </em>have little application here. Both cases concerned a voluntary transfer. Woolis\u2019s grievance concerns an involuntary transfer. A \u201cvoluntary transfer\u201d and an \u201cinvoluntary transfer\u201d are distinct personnel actions both as a matter of definition and under the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A \u201cvoluntary transfer,\u201d as was the case in <em>School Comm. of Peabody </em>v. <em>Peabody Fed\u2019n of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number><em>Teachers, Local 1289, supra </em>at 910, is an affirmative application made by an employee to move from one school to another. It is, in essence, an application to be hired for a new or different position. In the case of voluntary transfers, a process allowing the applicant to change jobs without the consent of the principal of the transferee school would impair the prerogatives of principals as managers of their schools. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In contrast, an \u201cinvoluntary transfer\u201d is the movement of an employee from one position to another, not at the employee\u2019s request, but to satisfy the general staffing needs of the employer. In the case of the school district, it means the assignment of a school employee from one school to another to satisfy district-wide staffing concerns. Such an involuntary relocation decision is not the \u201chiring\u201d of an employee in ordinary parlance or within the meaning of \u00a7 59B, and is consonant with the school committee\u2019s statutory power to direct the district\u2019s over-all staffing, while leaving intact the principal\u2019s governing authority over his or her school pursuant to \u00a7 59B. As such, the involuntary transfer procedure is a proper subject of collective bargaining between the school committee and the union and subject to the binding arbitration provisions of the agreement. See <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The agreement itself does not define the term \u201cinvoluntary transfer,\u201d but requires that such transfers must be to a \u201ccomparable position\u201d and that, after the required procedures are followed, the \u201ctransfer will be subject to the grievance procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>but the decision of the [school committee] will be final.\u201d We agree with the arbitrator that the latter language does not preclude resort to binding arbitration where the agreement provides that a grievance is a \u201ccomplaint that there has been a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of [the] [a]greement\u201d and where resolution of the grievance requires applying and interpreting the agreement\u2019s express terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Because the parties\u2019 dispute is arbitrable, we do not review the arbitration award itself. See <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>435 Mass. 54, 61 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Superior Court judge to enter judgment on the pleadings for the union and to affirm the arbitrator\u2019s award is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\"> We acknowledge the amicus brief of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO; Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Association; Massachusetts Federation of Teachers; Service Employees International Union; American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 93; Massachusetts Laborers\u2019 District Council; SEIU Local 3, National Conference of Firemen &amp; Oilers; SEIU Local 285; SEIU Local 509; United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 1495; and United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 328.

See <em>id. </em>Instead, in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Department of Education, \u201c[t]he principal with the assistance of the Administrator of Special Education shall coordinate the delivery and supervision of special education services within each school building.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 28.03(3)(b) (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b778-8\"> The arbitrator found that the Egremont position was a \u201c502.2\u201d position and the Herberg position was a \u201c502.4\u201d position. These numbers refer to regulations jointly issued by the Department of Education and the Department of Social Services in accordance with St. 1972, c. 766, the special education statute that contains \u201cprototypes\u201d reflecting \u201cthe amount of time that a child in need of special education is separated from children not receiving special education services.\u201d 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.401(7) (1993). Prototype 502.2 refers to children who need less than twenty-five per cent time outside the regular education classroom and prototype 502.4 refers to children who need more than sixty per cent time outside the regular education classroom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b780-8\"> General Laws c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (3), states: \u201cUpon application of a party, the superior court shall vacate an award if: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">\u201c(3) the arbitrators exceeded their powers or rendered an award requiring a person to commit an act or engage in conduct prohibited by state or federal law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b782-6\"> The school committee does not argue on appeal that Meyer, as Pittsfield\u2019s special education director, could have required Woolis to be transferred involuntarily to another school without the consent of both school principals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b783-6\"> Significantly, principals in \u201cchronically under-performing schools,\u201d defined as \u201c[s]chools that have consistently failed to improve the academic performance of their students,\u201d have expressly broader authority over personnel decisions than do other public school principals. See G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1J, inserted by \u00a7 29 of the Reform Act, which provides in part that the principal of a chronically under-performing school must be \u201cimmediately removed and shall not be assigned to the school for the following school year unless the board [of education] finds that the principal did not play a significant role in the under-performance of the school.\u201d The superintendent may then designate a new principal, who has \u201cextraordinary powers,\u201d including the power to dismiss teachers with professional status, without regard to many of the statutory safeguards for protecting such teachers\u2019 positions, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>and without regard to contrary provisions of any collective bargaining agreement. However, teachers so dismissed \u201cotherwise retain such rights as may be provided under law or any applicable collective bargaining agreement.\u201d G.

See 1992 House Doc. No. 5750, \u00a7\u00a7 36, 37, 51; 1992 House Doc. No. 5993, \u00a7 23.
