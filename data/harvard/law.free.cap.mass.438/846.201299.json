However, the judge has vacated the contempt judgment. The appeal is moot and is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>We sketch the factual background. The defendants in the underlying criminal proceedings were convicted of various drug offenses in the \u201cdrug court sessions\u201d of the Brighton and Roxbury Divisions of the District Court Department.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each was sentenced to a \u201cLevel II\u201d community corrections program as a condition of probation. See G. L. c. 21 IF, \u00a7 3 (providing for sentence to community corrections program for certain offenders).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As of January, 2002, as part of their probation the defendants here were required by court order to be tested randomly for drugs at specified intervals by the office of community corrections (OCC), which operates the community corrections programs (see G. L. c. 21 IF, \u00a7 2). The order entered in the defendant Anastos\u2019s case is representative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-5\">\u201cI order the Office of Community Corrections to conduct random drug testing at least one time per week until December 20, 2002 or further order of the court. I further order that all results, positive and negative, be reported to the Brighton Probation Department by noon of each Tuesday.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The OCC operates under the direction of the office of the commissioner. G. L. c. 211F, \u00a7 2 (c). On December 11, 2001, the office of the commissioner had issued a memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>reflecting a change in drug testing protocols. This was in response to a November 27, 2001, memorandum from the Chief Justice for Administration and Management of the Trial Court (CJAM) expressing concern that \u201c [exceptional measures\u201d would be required due to \u201ca very difficult fiscal situation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, she stated that funding in an account covering \u201cNon Employee Services\u201d was \u201c$1.8 million less than needed to cover costs for services related to the processing of cases [including] the cost of drug testing.\u201d She sought \u201csuggestions\u201d on how to reduce such expenses without delaying case processing. The commissioner\u2019s office responded with the December 11 memorandum. Effective December 11, 2001, only limited testing would be afforded to Level II probationers. Subject to fiscal restraints at any particular testing center, Level II probationers would be tested twice a month. Testing would terminate if, inter aha, the probationer submitted negative test samples for ninety consecutive days (i.e., six negative tests over the three-month period). The judge recognized that, because of the December 11, 2001, memorandum, the defendants\u2019 sentences were not being executed as ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">There followed a series of hearings at which the judge required the commissioner or his representative to appear. We need not discuss each hearing in detail. The essence of the judge\u2019s orders was that the probationers be tested at the frequencies he ordered at the same level of scientific accuracy as the testing that had previously been done for OCC by a specific laboratory (batch analyzer testing). The commissioner asserted that drug testing using \u201ctest cups\u201d was as scientifically rehable as batch analyzer testing. The commissioner at one point indicated that he had complied with the judge\u2019s orders, but in reality he was using test cups, a testing method the judge said he had specifically rejected. Eventually (after being ordered to do so by the CJAM), the commissioner agreed to provide batch analyzer testing, provided it was administered by local proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>tion officers, rather than directly by the OCC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge, however, evidently frustrated by what he termed \u201cflouting\u201d of his orders as well as certain other conduct that the judge described as evidencing \u201cdefiance and mendacity,\u201d insisted that the testing be done at OCC and, when the commissioner refused, held him in contempt. He ordered the commissioner held in \u201ccivil jail\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and fined until he complied. The commissioner quickly complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">From the beginning it was the position of the commissioner that the issues of method, frequency, and location of testing were issues of allocation of resources, and were within his discretion to decide, any dispute being resolved in the first instance by the CJAM as an administrative matter. The judge\u2019s order was not lawful, in the commissioner\u2019s view, and in any event, it was not appropriate for the judge to use his contempt power to force the commissioner to allocate resources differently from the manner the commissioner wished. The judge, however, defined the issue as one that went to the heart of his judicial authority, and believed that the commissioner\u2019s conduct was insubordinate and that his representations to the court were designed to mislead. He rejected the proposed drug testing alternatives as being of inferior quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">In the time since this appeal was filed, all the probationers involved in this case successfully completed their sentences. The judge terminated his drug testing orders and vacated the contempt judgment. This appeal is therefore moot. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rape Crisis Servs. of Greater Lowell, Inc., </em>416 Mass. 190, 192-193 (1993). We have at times expressed our opinion on moot questions \u201cbecause of the public interest involved and the uncertainty and confusion that exist\u201d or because there is an issue that is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Metros </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>396 Mass. 156, 159 (1985), quoting <em>Southern Pac. Terminal Co. </em>v. <em>ICC, </em>219 U.S. 498, 515 (1911). See <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 782-784 (1984). The issues in these cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>are unlikely to arise again in substantially the same form. We trust that the commissioner, under the supervision of the CJAM, will devise a means of providing the type, frequency, and duration of drug testing necessary to support the mission of the drug court sessions. \u201cIf, in fact, the issues should reappear, they need not evade review before they become moot. The litigants and this court will be in a position, respectively, to present and to decide them promptly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 785. See <em>First Justice of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, ante </em>387, 407-408 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\"> According to the trial court policy for drug court sessions, these are essentially sessions involving \u201cintense court supervision,\u201d whose typical cases are those of \u201crepeat offenders . . . severely addicted to narcotic drugs, alcohol or other harmful substances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\"> Section 3 of G.
