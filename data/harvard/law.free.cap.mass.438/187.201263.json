L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 32E V2 contains requirements for notices to automobile renters advising that purchase of a CDW may not be necessary (CDW notices).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A judge in the Superior Court granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the ground that Enterprise failed to display information regarding CDWs in the manner and to the extent required by \u00a7 32E <em>lk. </em>The judge reported the case to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 64 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996), and asked two questions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We granted the parties\u2019 applications for direct appellate review, and now vacate the judge\u2019s order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The case is one of statutory interpretation only. The salient facts are not in dispute. Enterprise is a rental company whose business practices regarding CDWs are governed by G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E V2, which defines a rental agreement as \u201cany written agreement setting forth the terms and conditions\u201d for automobile rental. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E <em>lk </em>(A). A CDW is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u201c[A]ny contract or contractual provision whether separate from or a part of a rental agreement, whereby the rental company agrees, for a charge, to waive. . . claims against the renter for damages to or loss of the [vehicle] during the term of the rental agreement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Subsection (C) (1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u201cA rental company, in a rental agreement for a term of thirty days or less, may not sell a [CDW] unless the renter agrees to such [CDW] in writing by initialing the appropriate portion of the rental agreement at the time the rental agreement is executed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Throughout the relevant time, subsection (C) (2), inserted by St. 1990, c. 440, \u00a7 1, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">\u201cNo rental company may sell or offer to sell a collision damage waiver unless the rental agreement which applies to the particular transaction includes the notice required in section one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The reference in the last words of subsection (C) (2) to the notice in \u201csection one\u201d is ambiguous and unexplained, but the parties agree (and the only logical reading is) that the applicable notice is provided in subsection (B) (2). This subsection states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">\u201c[E]ach [CDW] must display the following notice in no smaller print than ten point type:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">\u201c \u2018NOTICE: This contract offers, for an additional charge, a Collision Damage Waiver to cover your financial responsibility for damage to the rental vehicle. Your personal automobile insurance may already cover you for damage to a rental car. The purchase of a Collision Damage Waiver is optional and may be declined. For Massachusetts residents: If you have an automobile policy on your personal vehicle with coverage for collision, your policy will cover collision damage to the rental vehicle, less the deductible on your policy. If you have comprehensive coverage on your vehicle, your policy will cover loss on the rental vehicle caused by fire, theft or vandalism, less the deductible on your policy. Drivers who hold poli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>cies in other states should check with their insurance agents to determine whether their policies extend to rental vehicles.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Violation of \u00a7 32E V2 is punishable by a fine or civil penalty in an action brought on behalf of the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E V2 (D). The director of consumer affairs and business regulation is directed to inform the Attorney General (charged with enforcement of the statute) of violations. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E V2 (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The plaintiffs rented automobiles in Massachusetts from Enterprise using the so-called \u201cticket jacket form\u201d of rental agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This form, in use since May, 1997, consists of four attached pages. The first page contains boxes to be filled out on the front, and terms and conditions on the back. The next two pages are carbonless duplicat\u00e9s of the first, identical except that the terms and conditions are not reproduced on the back of the second page but are on the back of the third page, the customer copy. The fourth page is the so-called \u201cticket jacket.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After the customer initials and signs the agreement on the first page, the ticket jacket page remains attached to the customer copy and could be folded over it. In the center of the first page of the agreement are boxes where the customer initials accepting or declining CDW and, in the bottom left, the following notice appears in type more prominent than most of the other type on the page: \u201cSee ticket jacket for Collision Damage Waiver Notice Addendum, Mass. Law Chap. 90, Sect. 32E V2 hereby incorporated by reference and made part hereof.\u201d The bottom left quarter of the front of the ticket jacket (the fourth page of the agreement) contains a CDW notice, the language and size of which the parties agree satisfied \u00a7 32E V2. The CDW notice contained a heading in boldface capital letters: \u201cCOLLISION DAMAGE WAIVER NOTICE ADDENDUM.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The judge concluded that the ticket jacket form failed to display information regarding CDWs \u201cin the manner and to the extent required by [\u00a7 32E V2],\u201d and to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>extent granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs. We must therefore resolve whether the notice provided complies with the requirements of \u00a7 32E <em>lh. </em>There is no dispute that the language and type size requirements are satisfied. The only issue is the location of the CDW notice. The plaintiffs argue that subsection (B) (2) controls where the CDW notice must appear, and that it must be \u201cdisplay[edj\u201d <em>in </em>the <em>CDW. </em>Enterprise argues that it is subsection (C) (2) that controls, and thus the notice must be \u201cinclude[d]\u201d <em>in </em>the <em>rental agreement. </em>We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation and conclude that the notice must be included in the rental agreement. \u201c[A] statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>437 Mass. 54, 63 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>431 Mass. 417, 421 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Section 32E Va \u201cin certain aspects lacks precision and verbal consistency.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass. 186, 190 (1976), quoting <em>LaPierre </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>354 Mass. 165, 174 (1968).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Read literally, subsection (C) (2) referred to a provision of the statute (\u201csection one\u201d) nowhere to be found. The ambiguity is exacerbated by the way the statute uses the term \u201cCDW.\u201d \u201cCDW\u201d is defined as a \u201ccontract or contractual provision.\u201d Read literally, \u201cCDW\u201d refers to <em>language. </em>Elsewhere in the statute, the term \u201cCDW\u201d is used to refer not to contractual language, but to the <em>product </em>the language creates. This must be so, for it would be absurd to read subsection (C) (1) to authorize sale of a \u201ccontract or contractual provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u201cWhere, as here, \u2018[t]he draftsmanship is faulty ... the duty devolves upon us to give . . . [the statute] a reasonable construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>quoting <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Auth. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>347 Mass. 524, 528 (1964). \u201cIn doing so, we should take care to construe the statute to carry out the legislative intent . . . giving effect to all words in the statute but not overemphasizing any\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 190-191.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Section 32E V2 is clearly designed to benefit consumers who rent private passenger automobiles by notifying them that purchase of CDW might duplicate coverage already provided by their automobile insurance. Although we interpret consumer protection statutes broadly to effectuate their remedial purposes, see, e.g., <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Finance Assocs. of Auburn, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 182, 191 (1974), we must remain faithful to the legislative intent. We conclude that the Legislature did not intend to specify precisely where in the rental agreement the CDW notice must appear. In doing so, we conclude that it is subsection (C) (2) that provides the operative language, not subsection (B) (2). Subsection (C) (2) simply required that a CDW not be sold \u201cunless the <em>rental agreement . . . </em>includes\u201d the CDW notice (emphasis added). G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E V2 (C) (2), inserted by St. 1990, c. 440, \u00a7 1. We impart to this language its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 537 (1992). See <em>School Comm. of Gloucester </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>324 Mass. 209, 212 (1949) (court must construe various statutory provisions concerning subject matter in issue to give rational and workable effect to whole as far as practicable). A rental company that included the CDW notice <em>in </em>the rental agreement located it in compliance with \u00a7 32E V2.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Our interpretation is consistent with this and other basic principles of statutory construction. Had the Legislature intended to require that the notice appear in a <em>particular </em>location, it could have done so easily, as it has elsewhere in the General Laws in the context of consumer contracts. See, e.g., G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 68D <em>(a) </em>(contract for purchase of services of credit services organization must contain \u201cconspicuous statement. . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>in immediate proximity to the space reserved for the buyer\u2019s signature\u201d); G. L. c. 255D, \u00a7 9 D (retail instalment sale agreement shall contain notice \u201cappearing conspicuously directly above the space reserved ... for the signature of the buyer\u201d); G. L. c. 255D, \u00a7 27 A (revolving credit agreement shall contain notice \u201cappearing conspicuously directly above the space reserved ... for the signature of the buyer\u201d). See also <em>Resendes </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 344, 354 (1995) (court declined to insert language Legislature omitted especially where such language found elsewhere in General Laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Other States with statutes requiring a CDW notice in specific statutory language have stated expressly where the notice is to appear. See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6-l-203(l)(e) (West 2002) (agreement containing CDW \u201cshall display\u201d notice \u201con the <em>face </em>of the agreement, set apart and in bold-faced type . . . at least as large as ten-point type\u201d [emphasis supplied]). See also Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 50-657(e) (1994); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2091.5 B(5) (West 1995); Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 646.859(2) (2001); Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 59.1-207.31 B (Michie 2001). Each of these statutes predates \u00a7 32E Va and could have been used as guidance by our Legislature if it intended to require the notice to appear in a specific location. The Legislature\u2019s silence on the subject cannot be ignored. Cf. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Judge Baker Guidance Ctr., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 153 (1982) (concluding from reading Massachusetts statute and statutes of other jurisdictions that had Legislature intended to provide for equitable apportionment, \u201cit knew how to do so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">We turn now to the plaintiffs\u2019 construction of the statute: that subsection (B) (2) requires that the CDW notice be <em>in </em>the <em>CDW. </em>First, we note that this construction would be an odd way for the Legislature to impose a specific location requirement. The Massachusetts statutes discussed above show that the Legislature used quite specific language when it intended to do so in similar contexts. Its failure to do so here makes the plaintiffs\u2019 construction quite unlikely. In addition, the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation makes subsection (C) (2)\u2019s requirement that the rental agreement <em>include </em>the CDW notice superfluous, a disfavored result. See <em>Acting Supt. of Bournewood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>431 Mass. 101, 105 (2000). Subsection (A) permits the CDW provision to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201cseparate from\u201d the rental agreement. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation would require the CDW notice to be repeated in multiple places, whereas the statute nowhere suggests any such intent. We interpret statutes as a whole to produce internal consistency. <em>Id. </em>at 104, quoting <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>395 Mass. 868, 873 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We cannot ignore the practical effect of the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation. See <em>North Shore Realty Trust </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>434 Mass. 109, 111-112 (2001); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Cambridge, </em>310 Mass. 484, 489 (1941) (construction of ordinance that would lead to absurd and unreasonable conclusion should not be adopted where language is fairly susceptible to construction that would lead to logical and sensible result). The plaintiffs would locate the \u201cCDW\u201d in the box on the first page of the rental agreement requiring a customer to initial acceptance or declination:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">According to the plaintiffs, the notice must be \u201cin\u201d the boxes above. The language of the statute suggests that this cannot be correct. Subsection (C) (1) requires initialing of the \u201cappropriate portion\u201d of the rental agreement rather than the \u201cCDW,\u201d implying that the \u201cappropriate portion\u201d might be separate from the \u201cCDW.\u201d In addition, although they renounce this argument now, the plaintiffs at one point below argued that the paragraph on the reverse side of the rental agreement, stating the \u201cterms and conditions,\u201d also might be viewed as the CDW, or part thereof.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This paragraph contains some elements of what the statute defines to be a \u201cCDW\u201d (the terms of the agreement to waive damage claims against the renter). The Legislature could not have intended the notice to be placed near this paragraph, as that would banish the notice to obscurity. Nor would it make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>sense to require the identical notice to be duplicated in both places.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Our view that subsection (B) (2) does not include a location requirement is further supported by the recent amendment to \u00a7 32E V2. The Legislature has amended subsection (C) (2) to provide: \u201cNo rental company may sell or offer to sell a [CDW] unless the rental agreement. . . includes <em>on the signature page of the individual rental agreement . </em>. . the notice required in paragraph (1) of subsection (B)\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E 1/2 (C) (2), as amended by St. 2002, c. 232, \u00a7 2. Thus, the Legislature has now inserted a location requirement not by amending subsection (B) (2), but by amending subsection (C) (2). This corroborates the conclusion we have reached: that it was (C) (2), not (B) (2), that stated <em>where </em>the CDW notice was to be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">We also reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the ticket jacket page was not part of the \u201crental agreement.\u201d While \u00a7 32E <em>lh </em>defines \u201crental agreement\u201d as \u201cany written agreement setting forth the terms and conditions\u201d for automobile rental, it does <em>not </em>require each page to state at least one term or condition in order to be considered a component of the agreement. The CDW notice contained on the ticket jacket page was physically part of the rental agreement and was explicitly referenced on the first page of the agreement. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 132 comment c at 343 (1979) (document physically attached to signed writing is part of contract under Statute of Frauds); 4 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 23.3 at 781 (rev. ed. 1997) (same); 10 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 29:30 (4th ed. 1999) (same). Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the ticket jacket was merely an \u201cadvertising sheet,\u201d the ticket jacket page also contained information about supplemental liability protection and personal accident insurance, both of which were discussed on the face of the agreement and also in the terms and conditions on the reverse side. As noted recently by the Appeals Court, \u201cCommon sense is as much a part of contract interpretation as is the dictionary or the arsenal of canons.\u201d <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 361, 366 (2002), quoting <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>LaSalle Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>247 F.3d 300, 302 (1st Cir. 2001). The same is true for statutory interpretation. <em>Sun Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Director </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>of the Div. on the Necessaries of Life, </em>340 Mass. 235, 238 (1960) (statutes should be interpreted with sound judgment and common sense). Common sense, as well as rules of construction, indicate that the CDW notice was included in the agreement \u201csetting forth\u201d the terms and conditions of rental.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The plaintiffs also argue that Enterprise violated \u00a7 32E V2 because it failed to \u201cdisplay\u201d the notice with sufficient prominence. The plaintiffs refer to our interpretation of \u201cconspicuous\u201d in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Perkins Mach. Co., </em>352 Mass. 535, 539-540 (1967) (interpreting \u00a7 2-316 of Uniform Commercial Code), and urge that we use a \u201csimilar test\u201d to define the word \u201cdisplay.\u201d The plaintiffs in effect would modify \u201cdisplay\u201d with a word such as \u201cconspicuous.\u201d We need not try to decide whether the \u201cdisplay\u201d at issue is \u201cconspicuous,\u201d a term which invites subjective interpretation. The Legislature has expressly established how the notice is to appear \u2014 in ten-point type. Whether a given reader would consider this to be conspicuous in the context of the form is not relevant. Contrast examples where the Legislature, rather than expressly define how the notice is to look, has utilized the term \u201cconspicuous.\u201d See, e.g., G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 18B, first par. (coin-operated laundry \u201cshall display, in a conspicuous manner,\u201d notice to consumers of drying time); G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25C (&lt;?) (list of minimum consumer resale price of alcoholic beverages \u201cshall be conspicuously displayed\u201d); G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 185 <em>(g) </em>and 187 <em>(h) </em>(public employers and health care facilities \u201cshall conspicuously display\u201d notice of rights against retaliation).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">We hold that before the recent amendment, \u00a7 32E V2 required that the rental agreement include the notice, without specifying precisely where the notice must be. The plaintiffs\u2019 G. L. c. 93A claims relative to the ticket jacket form were founded on alleged violations of \u00a7 32E <em>1h. </em>As we have concluded that there was no violation, those claims must be dismissed. We vacate the judge\u2019s order and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\"> The plaintiffs claim to represent a class of \u201c[a]ll persons and entities who, on and after May 27, 1995, rented a private passenger automobile from [Enterprise] in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d The judge deferred ruling on class certification pending this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\"> General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 32E <em>lh, </em>has recently been amended in material respects resolving the very problem this case raises.
