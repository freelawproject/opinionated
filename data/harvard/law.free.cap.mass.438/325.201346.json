We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review, and we now vacate the order and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The defendant was convicted on multiple indictments stemming from a series of sexual assaults perpetrated against his girl friend\u2019s two daughters, Kerri and Kathy Ann.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The victims had lived in the same household with the defendant and their mother throughout the time period of the alleged abuse. Kerri, who was fifteen years old at the time of trial, alleged that the defendant had assaulted her from the time she was seven or eight years old until she was thirteen years old. Kathy Ann, eighteen years old by the time of trial, alleged that the defendant\u2019s sexual assaults began when she was nine years of age and continued until she was fifteen years old. When she was ten years old, Kathy Ann had disclosed the abuse to her mother, but then retracted the allegation at the defendant\u2019s insistence. Several years later, she again complained to her mother about the defendant\u2019s abuse, at which point the defendant made some incriminating admissions to the mother and promised to seek counselling. Notwithstanding that promise, Kathy Aim reported some months later that the abuse was still continuing. The family finally reported the allegations to the police in July, 1993, a month after Kathy Ann attempted suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Indictments were returned on February 24, 1994. Prior to trial, counsel reviewed certain Department of Social Services (department) records and treatment records from the Family Care Center. The treatment records were obtained by way of the procedures set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169, 181-182 (1993) <em>(Bishop). </em>As to the department\u2019s records, Kathy Ann had signed her own release authorizing their disclosure, and the mother had signed a similar release on behalf of Kerri. The records reviewed by trial counsel contained references to other treatment providers who had rendered services to Kathy Ann during potentially relevant time periods (e.g., records pertaining to Kathy Ann\u2019s suicide attempt immediately prior to the family\u2019s decision to report her allegations to the police). Notwithstanding the potential relevance of those other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>records, and notwithstanding counsel\u2019s apparent awareness of their existence, he made no effort to obtain access to any of those records. The defendant was tried and convicted in October, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">While the defendant\u2019s direct appeal was pending, he moved for a new trial, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel for counsel\u2019s failure to seek production of those additional treatment records. On appeal from the denial of that motion, this court agreed that counsel\u2019s failure to seek such records, which met at least the \u201clikely to be relevant\u201d standard of <em>Bishop, </em>was not the product of any reasoned \u201ctactical\u201d decision. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, supra </em>at 614-615. However, without knowing the contents of those records, the issue of alleged prejudice resulting from counsel\u2019s failure could not be resolved. <em>Id. </em>at 615-616. Proceeding from the \u201cassumption that the records requested were privileged,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 616, the matter was remanded for the judge\u2019s examination of the records and his determination whether they contained any relevant material. If not, the motion for a new trial was to be denied, as counsel\u2019s failure would not have resulted in any prejudice; if they did contain relevant material, defense counsel was to be given access to the records so that he could pursue a further motion for a new trial \u201cindicating how the material in the records would have been useful to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615-616.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">On remand, however, the underlying assumption regarding the privileged nature of the records turned out to be incorrect. The defendant requested that the remand proceedings begin with the judge\u2019s determination whether the records were in fact privileged. The defendant argued that he should be given access to any unprivileged records, and to any records for which no privilege was asserted, without further assessment of relevance. The judge disagreed. Relying on the underlying requirement that discovery under Mass. R. Grim. P. 14, 378 Mass. 874 (1978), is limited to materials that are \u201crelevant,\u201d the judge was of the view that where his in camera inspection of a record revealed that that record was not \u201crelevant,\u201d he could deny the defendant access to even an unprivileged record. He also held that, in the absence of any assertion of privilege, he could make the determination that a particular privilege applied to the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ords and treat them as privileged (thereby subjecting the records to the remaining stages of Bishop).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Three sets of records were summonsed to the clerk\u2019s office: (1) records from Charlton Memorial Hospital pertaining to three inpatient admissions of Kathy Ann; (2) records from Corrigan Mental Health Center, pertaining to two assessments of Kathy Ann and one admission; and (3) records from the Center for Health &amp; Human Services, Inc., pertaining to some eighteen months of consultations and sessions with Kathy Ann and other members of her family. Neither Kathy Ann nor any member of her family asserted any privilege with respect to any of the summonsed records,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and none of the health care providers asserted any privilege on her or their behalf. Notwithstanding the absence of any assertion of any privilege, the judge inspected the entirety of the records in camera. His determinations with respect to the specific records at issue were as follows.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">As to the hospital records, the judge determined that the records were not privileged. He concluded that the records pertaining to Kathy Ann\u2019s hospital admission in June, 1993 (the date of her suicide attempt and immediately prior to the report to the police), were \u201cmarginally\u201d relevant, but that the other two admissions (in January, 1994, and December, 1994) were for \u201cphysical conditions wholly unrelated to any issue [in] this case\u201d and the records of those admissions were therefore \u201centirely irrelevant.\u201d Based on those determinations, the judge allowed counsel to review the records from the \u201cmarginally\u201d relevant June, 1993, admission, but denied access to the records pertaining to the other two \u201cirrelevant\u201d hospital admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">As to the records from Corrigan Mental Health Center, the judge determined that they were protected by either the psychotherapist-patient privilege (G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B) or the social worker-client privilege (G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135B), or both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>those privileges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He concluded that the records of a June 16, 1993, assessment were \u201crelevant,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but that the remainder of the records from Corrigan Mental Health Center (pertaining to an assessment performed on April 22, 1994, and an admission on June 3, 1994) were not. He allowed the defendant access only to the record of the June, 1993, assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Finally, with respect to the records of the Center for Health &amp; Human Services, the judge again concluded that those records were protected by either the psychotherapist-patient privilege (G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B) or the social worker-client privilege (G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135B), or both of those privileges.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The records, pertaining to multiple sessions involving Kathy Ann and other family members, covered the time period from the fall of 1993 to the spring of 1995. The judge determined that \u201c[njone [of the records] contains any detailed description of the complaining witness\u2019s interaction with the defendant in this case or other information that is relevant to this case.\u201d Pursuant to that relevancy determination, the judge denied the defendant access to the entirety of the Center for Health &amp; Human Services, Inc., records.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Assertion of a privilege. </em>The defendant contends that the statutory privileges on which the judge relied are not self-executing and that, absent an affirmative assertion of the privilege, the records should not be treated as privileged. \u201cTestimonial privileges \u2018are exceptions to the general duty imposed on all people to testify\u2019 \u201d and therefore \u201cmust be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Three Juveniles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>390 Mass. 357, 359 (1983), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corsetti, </em>387 Mass. 1, 5 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 408-409 (1982) (communication with staff psychologist who did not meet licensure and educational requirements for \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, was not privileged communication under that section; court declined \u201cto extend the patient-psychotherapist privilege beyond the bounds established by the Legislature\u201d). The privileges at issue here are both created by statute; we therefore look to the wording of those statutes to determine what steps, if any, are required to trigger the applicability of those privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The psychotherapist-patient privilege created by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, provides that \u201cin any court proceeding ... a patient shall have the privilege of refusing to disclose, and of preventing a witness from disclosing, any communication, wherever made, between said patient and a psychotherapist relative to the diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s mental or emotional condition.\u201d Thus, in the operative language defining the privilege, the patient may \u201crefus[ej\u201d to disclose or \u201cprevent)]\u201d a witness from disclosing the communications in question. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B. Both of those verbs connote action by the patient to stop the disclosure. That connotation is reinforced by other provisions of the same section. The statute provides that \u201c)i]f a patient is incompetent to <em>exercise or waive </em>such privilege, a guardian shall be appointed to act in his behalf ...\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>It further provides that <em>\u201c[u]pon the exercise </em>of the privilege granted by this section, the judge or presiding officer shall instruct the jury that no adverse inference may be drawn therefrom\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The social worker-client privilege is worded in essentially identical terms. \u201c)I]n any court proceeding ... a client shall have the privilege of <em>refusing </em>to disclose and of <em>preventing </em>a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>witness from disclosing, any communication, wherever made, between said client and a social worker . . . relative to the diagnosis or treatment of the Ghent\u2019s mental or emotional condition\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135B. As with the psychotherapist-patient privilege, \u201c[i]f a client is incompetent to <em>exercise or waive </em>such privilege, a guardian shall be appointed to act in the Ghent\u2019s behalf,\u201d and \u201c[u]pon the <em>exercise of the privilege </em>granted by this section, the judge or presiding officer shall instruct the jury that no adverse inference may be drawn therefrom\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Thus, as described in the statutes creating these privileges, some action by the patient or chent is necessary to \u201cexercise\u201d the privilege therein created. The privilege is not self-executing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe patient must therefore affirmatively exercise the [G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B,] privilege in order to prevent the psychotherapist from disclosing confidential communications at trial.\u201d P. J. Liacos, M.S. Brodin &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 13.5.2, at 796 (7th ed. 1999). See <em>Adoption of Carla, </em>416 Mass. 510, 515 (1993) (\u201cSince the existence of the privilege alone does not disqualify a psychotherapist from testifying, a party desiring to exercise the privilege must make an attempt to do so at trial\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>410 Mass. 506, 518 (1991) (\u00a7 20B does not \u201cdisqualify a psychotherapist from testifying\u201d where defendant \u201cfailed to make any attempt to exercise the statutory privilege at trial\u201d); <em>Adoption of Diane, </em>400 Mass. 196, 201-202 (1987) (mother contesting petition to dispense with her consent to adoption could not invoke G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, to object to psychiatrist\u2019s testimony where \u201cneither the child\u2019s attorney nor the guardian ad litem chose to exercise the privilege\u201d); <em>Petitions of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>Adoption, </em>399 Mass. 279, 290 n.21 (1987) (\u201cBecause the [\u00a7 20B] privilege belongs to the patient, it appears that the burden should be on the patient to assert the privilege\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souther, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 219, 223 (1991) (\u00a7 20B privilege \u201cis to be <em>exercised </em>by the refusal of the patient to disclose or by the patient\u2019s <em>preventing </em>a witness from disclosing the communication with the therapist\u201d [emphasis in original]; \u201cthe patient, who is the holder of the privilege, must take some affirmative step [most often, one supposes, through counsel] to keep the psychotherapist from giving evidence which discloses information developed in consultation and treatment\u201d); <em>Adoption of Abigail, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 191, 198 (1986) (\u00a7 20B is privilege \u201cwhich a patient may exercise\u201d; where \u201c[n]o effort was made to do so,\u201d no error in admitting psychologists\u2019 reports).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Our jurisprudence concerning defendants\u2019 requests for access to such materials similarly refers to the need for some affirmative assertion of these statutory privileges. Under Stage I of <em>Bishop, </em>\u201c[i]f the complainant or the keeper of the target records <em>refuses </em>to produce the records because of a statutory privilege against disclosure, the fact [of such refusal] is brought before the judge,\u201d and the judge then decides whether the records are privileged and issues a written decision \u201cwith specific reference to the privilege or privileges <em>claimed and found, </em>if any\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 181. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>427 Mass. 427, 429 &amp; n.4 (1988) (describing <em>Bishop </em>Stage I as requiring judge to make determination of privilege where defendant seeks \u201caccess to records <em>claimed </em>to be privileged,\u201d noting that \u201calleged victim or the keeper of the target records may <em>refuse </em>to produce them <em>claiming </em>a statutory privilege or privileges against disclosure\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>This requirement that the privilege be asserted cannot be dispensed with as a mere technicality. In the absence of any assertion of either of these privileges, a judge attempting to make a privilege determination solely from the records themselves would often have no information as to the professional status of the persons whose \u201ccommunications\u201d with the patient or client are reflected in the record. Here, it was precisely because of the absence of any assertion of privilege that the judge had to resort to \u201cinferences\u201d concerning the actual status of the professionals whose signatures and initials appeared in the records, leading him to conclude, based only on the substantive contents of the entries, that they were probably made by persons who qualified as either a \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, or a \u201csocial worker\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 35B. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>Although not directly challenged here, this approach illustrates the difficulty of determining the privileged nature of a record in the absence of any claim of privilege. For example, a notation in a record concerning a patient\u2019s mental or emotional condition may be made by a physician, psychologist, or nurse who does not meet the definition of \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d set forth in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Rosenberg, 410 Mass. 347, 353-354 (1991) (psychologist with doctoral degree in education but not in psychology was not \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d within \u00a7 20B privilege; communications with psychologist and therapist lacking those credentials not privileged); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 408-409 (1982) (communication with staff psychologist at community health center not privileged where psychologist did not have requisite license or degree required by \u00a7 20B); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 580, 585-586 (1981) (no privilege where therapist lacked \u00a7 20B credentials). A patient asserting the \u00a7 20B privilege, however, can at least provide the information necessary for such a determination, e.g., that the doctor in question is in fact a psychiatrist. Thus, the affirmative assertion of such a privilege appears not only to be a requirement of the statute as worded, but is, as a practical matter, a necessary component to determining whether the factual predicate for the privilege exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We also reject the assumption that all complaining witnesses would necessarily wish to assert a privilege in these circumstances, so that the lack of a formal assertion of privilege may automatically be viewed as the product of mere inadvertence. While such records may contain personal information of an embarrassing nature, they do not necessarily do so, and one\u2019s perception of what is personal, private, or embarrassing is itself highly individualized. Some people view a particular subject matter as intensely private and would not disclose it absent extreme compulsion, while others openly discuss that same aspect of their personal history on nationally televised talk shows. With regard to the specific issue of a complaining witness\u2019s willingness to reveal privileged materials to the defendant, the potentially embarrassing information in those materials may be something that is already known to the defendant, and the witness may perceive no embarrassment in having the record revealed to someone who is already familiar with whatever embarrassing details are contained therein.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And, whatever the reluctance to divulge such records to a defendant might be, a complaining witness may also take into account the consequences of asserting a privilege \u2014 delay in the proceedings, and, where the issue is at all close, the uncertain outcome of any appeal concerning the court\u2019s decision to deny the defendant access to the records. For some complainants, although initially dismayed at the prospect of divulging a privileged record, they may ultimately prefer to disclose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>record, and thereby obtain a prompt trial and final resolution of all related proceedings. Indeed, as illustrated by this case, Kathy Ann and her mother affirmatively waived privileges applicable to their department records. Thus, one cannot assume that all complainants will always prefer to assert all applicable privileges and thereby presume the assertion of the privilege. The actual assertion of the privilege is a requirement of the statute, not a meaningless formality or a foregone conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We also reject the judge\u2019s theory that the failure of any of the providers to assert a privilege on behalf of Kathy Ann must have been a breach of their duty to her so that he can, sua sponte, opt to remedy that ostensible breach by proceeding as if the privilege had been asserted. The record does not reflect whether any of the providers contacted Kathy Ann, or what (if anything) she communicated to them. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kobrin, </em>395 Mass. 284, 285, 287 &amp; n.8 (1985) (upon receipt of summons for patient records, psychiatrist contacted patients \u201cto determine whether they wished to assert their statutory privilege to prevent disclosure of communications\u201d; patients provided psychiatrist with their written assertions of \u00a7 20B privilege). A provider\u2019s obligation to keep matters confidential may stem from a statute imposing such an obligation (oftentimes with a host of exceptions to that obligation), or may arise as a matter of professional ethics. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brandwein, </em>435 Mass. 623, 628-630 (2002). However, as discussed above, the statutes at issue here recite as a predicate the <em>patient\u2019s </em>assertion of the privilege. They do not contain an absolute prohibition on disclosure. Cf. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J (sexual assault counsellor \u201cshall not disclose such confidential communication, without the prior written consent of the victim\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Health care providers that maintain records as to which the patient may assert a privilege have standing to assert that privilege on behalf of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>patient who wishes to do so, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kobrin, supra, </em>but that does not mean that all providers are \u201cobligated\u201d to assert all potential privileges in all circumstances. See <em>Adoption of Carla, </em>416 Mass. 510, 515 (1993) (\u00a7 20B privilege \u201cdoes not disqualify a psychotherapist from testifying\u201d where patient does not exercise the privilege); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>410 Mass. 506, 518 (1991) (same). One cannot, from a provider\u2019s mere production of records in response to a summons, assume that the provider\u2019s production of records was necessarily in violation of some \u201cobligation\u201d to the patient or client. Moreover, even if the provider has committed such a violation, the immediate remedy would be to stay the disclosure of the material until such time as the patient or client, the actual holder of the privilege, can be notified and given an opportunity to express his or her own wishes on the subject. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>The remedy would not be to proceed as if a proper privilege had been asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We recognize that, in the context of a criminal proceeding, pragmatic difficulties face a witness wishing to prevent the disclosure of privileged records. The witness is not a \u201cparty\u201d to the case; the district attorney does not represent the witness, and may have interests that conflict with the witness; the witness will often not have (and not be able to afford) counsel; and, of the utmost concern, the witness may not even receive timely notice that the records are being sought. Against that backdrop, it is difficult for a witness to make an informed, intelligent choice whether to assert a privilege, and difficult to exercise the privilege in a timely and proper manner if that is the witness\u2019s choice. Judges have devised various methods to enable witnesses to make an effective choice concerning the assertion of a privilege, by requiring notice to the witness, by appointing counsel or a guardian ad litem for the witness, or by recommending that the summonsed health care providers contact the patient, obtain the patient\u2019s waiver prior to production of records, or assert any applicable privileges on the patient\u2019s behalf. Steps that enhance a witness\u2019s ability to make an affirmative, informed choice between waiver or assertion of a privilege, or that protect potentially applicable privileges while waiting to hear directly from the witness, are permissible and appropriate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>It is not appropriate for the judge to effectively assert the privilege on the witness\u2019s behalf on the assumption that, if informed, the witness would assert the privilege. While well intentioned, such assumptions do not necessarily reflect the witness\u2019s actual preferences, and may indeed be contrary to the witness\u2019s wishes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Absent an affirmative assertion of the privileges established by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, and G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135B, the court must treat such records as if they were unprivileged. Where no privilege was asserted by anyone here, the judge erred in subjecting those records to procedures that are applicable only to privileged records.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">b. <em>Relevance. </em>Where the records should not have been treated as privileged, we must address the judge\u2019s decision to withhold even unprivileged records based on his determination, after reviewing them in camera, that they were not \u201crelevant.\u201d The judge took the position that he was to review all the records (including the hospital records that he found not privileged) and was not to release any of them to the defendant unless that review confirmed their \u201crelevance.\u201d Thus, while he went through the exercise of determining the potential applicability of various privileges, the judge ultimately determined that their status as privileged or unprivileged had no bearing on whether the records would be released to the defendant. Rather, records were withheld or released based solely on the judge\u2019s assessment of their relevance. For the reasons discussed above, the absence of any assertion of the potentially applicable statutory privileges required the judge to treat those records as if they were unprivileged, and it is conceded that the hospital records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>are not privileged. The issue, then, is whether records that are not privileged, or as to which no privilege has been asserted, can be withheld based on the judge\u2019s in camera review. For the following reasons, we conclude that they cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We start this analysis recognizing the unique procedural posture of the inquiry now being made. Because these particular records were not sought prior to trial, they are now being sought for the narrow purpose of determining whether counsel\u2019s failure to obtain those records deprived the defendant of \u201can otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). In other words, present counsel is seeking to ascertain what would have happened if trial counsel had sought access to the records prior to the defendant\u2019s trial. As such, we must apply the law as it then existed,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and must allow counsel to investigate what difference a timely request for the records would have made to the defense. To conduct that investigation, present counsel must be allowed to see whatever prior counsel would have seen if the request for records had been made at that earlier juncture. As such, we should not skew the course of that investigation because of such factors as the judge\u2019s familiarity with the case from having presided at trial. Devoid of the convoluted procedural trappings that the case now carries, the question is whether records that have been summonsed into court would, in the absence of any claim of privilege, be turned over to defense counsel without any further review by the judge or any further consideration of their \u201crelevance.\u201d Such records would, in the ordinary course, be turned over to defense counsel and, therefore, the records at issue here should also be turned over (assuming no privilege is asserted on remand, see note 13, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The Commonwealth correctly points out that a defendant does not have an unlimited right to summons witnesses and documents in advance of trial, but may only do so after making a threshold showing of relevance. Pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (a) (2), 378 Mass. 874 (1978), a judge may, on the defendant\u2019s motion, \u201cissue an order of discovery requiring that the defendant be permitted to discover, inspect and copy any <em>material and relevant </em>evidence [or] documents\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant does not dispute the requirement that he make that threshold showing, but correctly contends that he has already made it. This court has previously determined that the records in question are \u201clikely to be relevant to the issue of Kathy Ann\u2019s credibility, particularly because they are likely to reveal evidence of the entire situation in the family of which the defendant had been a part.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, supra </em>at 615. For that reason, a summons to each of the providers was issued commanding production of the records in question. Absent any assertion of privilege with respect to such documents, there would be no in camera review of the documents produced in response to the summons, no redaction of the documents based on a more fine-tuned assessment of their relevance, and no basis for essentially modifying the scope of the summons that was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Nothing in rule 14 (a) (2) suggests that there is such a \u201csecond look\u201d prior to production of documents. As often happens (and as happened here), the category of documents requested turns out to include some items that are relevant, but not every single item in that category contains relevant information. By definition, such requests for production of documents deal in likelihoods, i.e., a sufficient likelihood that the requested documents or objects will contain some information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>that is material and relevant. And, where the summons to a third party must not be \u201cunreasonable or oppressive,\u201d Mass. R. Grim. R 17 (a) (2), 378 Mass. 885 (1978), the category of documents must be sufficiently well defined and not overly broad. No one, however, expects that there will be a perfect overlap between the category of documents described in the summons and the precise documents that are found to contain relevant information. As happened here, it is to be expected that some irrelevant material will be contained in the same category of documents that also yields relevant information. Absent someone interposing an objection to the summons (on grounds of privilege or otherwise), it is counsel, not a judge, that sifts through the material produced to separate the relevant \u201cwheat\u201d from the irrelevant \u201cchaff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">It is only where a privilege is asserted and found to be applicable that the in camera review of <em>Bishop </em>occurs. See <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 184 (\u201cIf the judge rules that the undisclosed clinic records are not privileged, then the judge shall release the records to the parties\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neumyer, </em>432 Mass. 23, 30 (2000) (\u201cOnce the determination is made that the records are not privileged, the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>procedure is no longer applicable\u201d). There is no reason to conduct an in camera <em>Bishop </em>review for \u201crelevance\u201d in the absence of any asserted privilege. Indeed, we have recognized that it is difficult for a judge to take on the role of an advocate and examine documents from one side\u2019s perspective, attempting to determine what use an advocate for that side might make from the information contained in those documents. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, </em>409 Mass. 867, 882 (1991). That the court has opted to accept the potential problems posed by a judge\u2019s in camera examination of records as a necessary compromise to protect privileges, see <em>Bishop, supra, </em>does not mean that we should accept them in the absence of some countervailing interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">A conscientious and well-informed judge can still fail to grasp the significance of a particular item in a record, especially where its significance lies not in its own immediate relevance but rather in its indication of the existence of some other avenue of fruitful inquiry. And, as happened here, a judge\u2019s explanation as to why an item is ostensibly \u201cirrelevant\u201d can itself reveal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>tantalizing possibilities of potential relevance. The judge\u2019s assessment that the records from one of the providers were not relevant was due to his determination that they did not contain \u201cany <em>detailed </em>description of the complaining witness\u2019s interaction with the defendant\u201d (emphasis added), suggesting that the records contained at least some general descriptions of those interactions, and leaving counsel only to wonder at the judge\u2019s distinction between a \u201cdetailed\u201d as opposed to a merely general \u201cdescription\u201d of a subject matter that was itself of obvious relevance. Zealous advocates should not, in the absence of any privilege pertaining to the records, be required to settle for someone else\u2019s assessment of when relevant information has become sufficiently \u201cdetailed\u201d to be of use to their clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We recognize that, in the context of a motion for a new trial, the defendant will ultimately have to show that the materials in the records were not only relevant but that they were of such significance that their absence deprived him of \u201ca substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). Where, as here, the judge who presided at the defendant\u2019s trial is of the view that the withheld records do not even contain \u201crelevant\u201d information, it is tempting to leap to the conclusion that the records would be unavailing as to the ultimate merits of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and that there is therefore no purpose in allowing the defendant\u2019s current counsel to see those records. However, the ultimate merits of that yet to be filed motion are not before us. What is before us is the defendant\u2019s request that he be allowed to investigate the consequences of his former counsel\u2019s failure to request these records. He should be allowed to complete the steps in that investigation, which, of necessity, include his review of whatever documents would, in the ordinary course, have been revealed to him if they had been sought at the proper time. Absent any assertion of privilege, the records would not have been subject to any in camera review and would have been seen by defense counsel. The fortuity that this judge <em>has </em>seen the records in camera (either because of his belief that he should do so even if unprivileged or in response to a remand order that assumed all the documents were privileged) should not alter that reconstruction of what would have happened if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>records had been timely sought. That reconstruction must take its full course so that the defendant\u2019s motion, whatever its chances of success, may be premised on an accurate and complete reconstruction, not an abbreviated or partial reconstruction, of what effective counsel would have seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order denying the defendant access to the records of Charlton Memorial Hospital, Corrigan Mental Health Center, and the Center for Health &amp; Human Services, Inc., is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\"> We use the same pseudonyms for the victims used in the court\u2019s earlier opinion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>431 Mass. 609, 610 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\"> There is nothing in the record to indicate whether Kathy Ann or anyone in her family was notified of the issuance of these summonses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-9\"> The judge\u2019s initial memorandum and order on remand was entered on December 15, 2000, and later amended by an order on motion for clarification on February 1, 2001.

L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J), but later corrected that ruling, concluding that that privilege was not applicable. With respect to the two statutory privileges that the judge did find applicable, he did so \u201cbased on inferences\u201d stemming from the presence of \u201cprofessional initials\u201d after signatures placed on the various assessments and evaluations, and on the fact that \u201c[t]he content of the records are, in each case, consistent with what one would generally expect a psychiatrist, psychologist or social worker to seek and obtain in the course of a mental-health consultation.\u201d The defendant does not contest the propriety of those inferences. But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Rosenberg, 410 Mass. 347, 353-354 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 408-409 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 580, 585-586 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\"> Again, the date of that assessment corresponds to the time period of Kathy Ann\u2019s suicide attempt, which itself corresponds to the time period of the last of her disclosures and the family\u2019s decision to report her allegations to the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\"> As with the records from Corrigan Mental Health Center, the judge had originally ruled that the records from the Center for Health &amp; Human Services, Inc., were covered by the sexual assault counsellor-victim privilege (G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 201), but later concluded that that privilege was not applicable. His conclusion as to the two privileges that he found applicable was again based on \u201cinferences,\u201d and that conclusion is not challenged on appeal. See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\"> The Legislature can, of course, create a privilege that is automatic and that does not require any action on the part of the holder of the privilege. For example, the sexual assault counsellor-victim privilege created by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J, prevents such a counsellor from disclosing communications \u201cwithout the prior written consent of the victim.\u201d Thus, absent an affirmative written waiver from the victim, communications covered by that section are privileged. Section 20J does not suggest that the victim need do anything to \u201cexercise\u201d the privilege contained therein, or to \u201crefuse\u201d to disclose the communications, or to \u201cprevent\u201d the counsellor from disclosing the communications. The wording of \u00a7 20J illustrates that the Legislature can create a self-executing privilege when it intends to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\"> Where the statutory privilege in question leaves it to the patient to affirmatively assert the privilege, even a provider\u2019s assertion of that privilege may be treated as only a temporary precaution pending confirmation of the patient\u2019s own intentions. See 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2386 (McNaughton rev. 1961) (although physician witness may initially decline to answer on ground of patient\u2019s privilege, \u201cstill the claim of privilege must formally be made . . . by the patient, if he is before the court, or by his attorney; if he is not, then technically he should be given an opportunity to claim before the examination is proceeded with\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b355-5\"> The term \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d is defined as \u201ca person licensed to practice medicine, who devotes a substantial portion of his time to the practice of psychiatry,\u201d and includes \u201ca person who is licensed as a psychologist by the board of registration of psychologists; a graduate of, or student enrolled in, a doctoral degree program in psychology at a recognized educational institution [under G.

From the mere subject matter of an entry in a record, one can glean little (if anything) as to whether the person with whom the patient communicated has the requisite credentials to satisfy this definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\"> This might well be the case where, as here, the defendant lived in the same household with the complaining witness. For example, while Kathy Ann would presumably be reluctant to divulge the history of her suicide attempt to persons outside her family or closest friends, the incident was not a secret to this defendant living in the household at the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\"> The judge relied on our statement in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216, 220 n.3 (1996), that the rape crisis center in that case \u201chas the obligation to assert the privilege provided by \u00a7 20J on behalf of its clients.\u201d As discussed above, (note 7, <em>supra), </em>however, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J, is an example of a self-executing privilege, as the provider is prohibited from making any disclosure absent the client\u2019s \u201cprior written consent.\u201d One cannot apply the statement about a rape crisis center\u2019s \u201cobligation\u201d in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, supra, </em>to statutory privileges that contain very different language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\"> Here, we have no way of knowing whether Kathy Ann would have preferred to reveal the privileged records, as she did with her department records, in order to hasten the resolution of this already overly protracted post-conviction motion.

Bishop, 416 Mass. 169, 181-182 (1993) <em>(Bishop), </em>not \u201cthe more stringent standards\u201d for Stage II enunciated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216, 226 (1996) <em>(Fuller).

The law at the time the record request should have been made is the law by which this record review must be conducted, <em>id., </em>and the parties have not asked us to consider any further modifications to the procedures mandated by <em>Bishop </em>and <em>Fuller. </em>But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheehan, </em>435 Mass. 183, 193-200 (2001) (Sosman, I., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b361-6\"> While Mass.

I agree with the result and most of the reasoning in the court\u2019s opinion. The precise issue is whether the records summonsed to court should be considered privileged in the absence of the assertion of a privilege or privileges. Our holding is that \u201cas described in the statutes creating [the] privileges [under consideration], some action by the patient or client is necessary to \u2018exercise\u2019 the privilege therein created.
