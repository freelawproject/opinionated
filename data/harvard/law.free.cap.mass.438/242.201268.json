L. c. 143, \u00a7 51, a statute that imposes strict liability on the property owner (among others) for injuries resulting from building code violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">The essential facts are not in dispute. The Dorfmans owned a two-family home in Revere (the house), lived on the first floor, and rented the other apartment. They owned no other rental property at the time in question. They hired a contractor to paint parts of the exterior of the house. The contractor in turn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>hired the plaintiff Driton Banushi to perform this painting work. On or about August 12, 1995, Banushi was painting the house; he fell from his ladder onto wood debris left by other workers<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and sustained permanent and serious injuries. The Banushis claim that the Dorfmans violated State building code regulations relative to debris cleanup, causing Banushi to be injured; and that, pursuant to G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 51, the Dorfmans are strictly liable for his injuries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">A Superior Court judge granted summary judgment for the defendants, concluding that the statute does not apply to an owner-occupied two-family home in which the owner rents one unit to a tenant. Separate and final judgment for the Dorfmans was entered. See Mass. R. Civ. R 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974). The Banushis appealed to the Appeals Court and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We conclude that the judge was correct in ruling that the statute does not apply in this case. Our conclusion derives from past cases of this court and from canons of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">General. Laws c. 143, \u00a7 51, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201cThe owner . . . being the party in control, of a place of assembly, theatre, special hall, public hall, factory, workshop, manufacturing establishment or building shall comply with the provisions of . . . the state building code relative thereto, and such person shall be liable to any person injured for all damages caused by a violation of any of said provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">We have already concluded that the statute does not apply to a single-family house. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eakin, </em>427 Mass. 590, 592 (1998). In that case, we said that the Legislature could not have intended the word \u201cbuilding\u201d in the statute, \u201cwhich appears in a series with other, more specific words (\u2018assembly, theatre, special hall, public hall, factory, workshop, manufacturing establishment\u2019) to mean any and every structure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 90, 91 (1996). We proceed from that point to determine whether the word \u201cbuilding\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>encompasses an owner-occupied two-family home in which the owner rents one unit to a tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In considering the language of the statute, the doctrine of ejusdem generis is applicable: \u201cWhere general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.\u201d 2A NJ. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.17, at 273-274 (6th ed. rev. 2000). See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Freetown-Lakeville Regional Sch. Dist. Comm., </em>392 Mass. 656, 660 n.8 (1984). The doctrine is most appropriate when a series of several terms is listed that concludes with the disputed language. See <em>Perlera </em>v. <em>Vining Disposal Serv., Inc., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 496 n.8 (1999). Here, each of the words in the series preceding the disputed word describes a place of public or commercial use. The final word, \u201cbuilding,\u201d is a general word. Pursuant to the doctrine of ejusdem generis, we construe the general word \u201cbuilding\u201d to refer to structures similar in nature to those described by the preceding specific words, i.e., places of public or commercial use, places of assembly or places of work. \u201c \u2018Building\u2019 [in the statute] must be read to refer to structures used for purposes like those of the other structures listed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eakin, supra </em>at 592. An owner-occupied two-family home in which the owner rents one unit to a tenant is not a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the terms of the statute. Although the owner may derive some minimal income from the rental, it is not the type of commercial, public use, assembly, or workplace structure contemplated by the statute. \u201cThe large number of owners of [these types of homes] in the Commonwealth should not be exposed to expanded civil liability deriving from the regulatory provisions of chapter 143 except by express and clear legislation evidencing that intention.\u201d <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, supra </em>at 94. See <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Massios, </em>372 Mass. 79, 84 (1977). We do not attempt to define the class encompassed by the statute more precisely, see <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, supra </em>at 92, preferring to leave that either to the Legislature or to development on future factual records.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The broad definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d found in G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>(\u201cIn this chapter the following terms . . . shall have the following meanings\u201d), as \u201ca combination of any materials, whether portable or fixed, having a roof, to form a structure for the shelter of persons, animals or property,\u201d does not alter our interpretation. Although this global definition may be appropriate for various sections of G. L. c. 143, if it were applied to the instant section, it would render the remaining words in the listing superfluous. We do not read a statute so as to render any of its terms meaningless or superfluous. <em>Bynes </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 264, 268 (1991), and cases cited. See also <em>St. Germaine </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>411 Mass. 615, 619 (1992) (\u201cIt is apparent. . . from the specific types of structures mentioned in \u00a7 51 . . . and the definition contained in G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 1 ... for the general term \u2018building,\u2019 that \u00a7 51 is not meant to apply to a single family home that is under construction\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, supra </em>at 93. Renting one portion of one\u2019s own home does not bring the homeowner within the terms of the statute. There is nothing to indicate that the Dorfmans\u2019 home is public or commercial in the sense of the words of the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\"> Another subcontractor had the responsibility of removing debris from the site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b265-10\"> The plaintiffs also filed claims of negligence and loss of consortium against other defendants and a claim of negligence against the Dorfmans. These claims are not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\"> Separately, we observe that the Legislature simply may have intended the word \u201cbuilding\u201d as a synonym for a \u201cmanufacturing establishment.\u201d There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>no comma in that portion of the definition that contains the phrase \u201cmanufacturing establishment or building.\u201d Such an intent is consistent with our decision today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b267-9\"> The Appeals Court has held that a watchmen\u2019s cottage at a commercial marina qualified as a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of the statute, and implied, by referring to the broad definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d in G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 1, that a single-family house would be a \u201cbuilding\u201d under \u00a7 51 as well. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duda, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 922, 923 (1992) (rescript opinion). Any such suggestion has clearly been discredited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eakin, </em>427 Mass. 590, 591-592 (1998); <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 90, 93-94 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b267-10\"> The cases from other jurisdictions relied on by the plaintiffs do not assist their argument. These cases are based on statutes whose wording differs from the statute before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b267-11\"> The plaintiffs claim that the defendants violated 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 114.1.3 (1992) (disposal of debris at worksite) and 454 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10:03 (1) (1988) (protection of health and safety of employees at worksite), and it is the violation of these regulations on which the Banushis premise the Dorfmans\u2019 liability. The Dorfmans argue that neither of those regulations placed any obligation on them, but were applicable solely to particular contractors at the site. As it is unnecessary to our decision, we express no opinion whether these regulations would be applicable to a homeowner in the instant circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
