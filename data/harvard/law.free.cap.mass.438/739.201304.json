L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, a Superior Court judge vacated the award of an arbitrator finding that the school committee of Newton (school committee) had violated the terms of a collective bargaining agreement (agreement). The arbitrator had ordered the school committee to offer to an unsuccessful candidate the position of cafeteria manager in a Newton school. The judge ruled that the arbitrator exceeded the limits of his authority by usurping the rights of the school\u2019s principal under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, to hire all school personnel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a) </em>(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The union appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">We must first determine whether the arbitrator had jurisdiction to decide whether the school committee had violated certain provisions of the agreement concerning the filling of open positions and, if so, whether G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, precluded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>remedy ordered by the arbitrator. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the arbitrator did have authority to determine whether the school committee had violated the agreement, but that the remedy he fashioned impermissibly infringed on the statutory hiring prerogatives of the school principal. We vacate the judge\u2019s order and that portion of the arbitrator\u2019s award relating to remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts found by the arbitrator. During the relevant time period, the school committee, as the exclusive bargaining agent for the Newton school district, see G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 1, was party to an agreement with \u201cthe Nutrition Workers Unit\u201d of the Newton School Custodians Association, Local 454, Service Employees International Union (union).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The union was the exclusive collective bargaining agent for cafeteria managers, food truck drivers, cooks, and cafeteria helpers in the Newton school district. Article IX, \u00a7 4, of the agreement establishes certain criteria to be considered when filling new or vacant<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> positions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">\u201cWhen the [school] [c]ommittee plans to fill vacancies in existing positions or when new positions are established, it is the intention of the [administration to fill such positions after consideration of the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">a. Length of service from date of original permanent appointment in classification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">b. Knowledge, training, ability, skill and efficiency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">c. Physical fitness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-10\">d. Leadership qualities.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Under art. IX, \u00a7 5, seniority prevails when, in the principal\u2019s judgment, the other qualifications listed in art. IX, \u00a7 4, are equal among candidates.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The agreement also sets out procedures for the resolution of any \u201cgrievance or dispute\u201d that \u201cmay arise between the parties involving only the application, meaning, or interpretation of the [ajgreement.\u201d It provides that grievances or disputes not settled at the administrative level through procedures established in the agreement may be submitted by either party to \u201cfinal and binding\u201d arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">In 1999, there was a vacancy in the position of cafeteria manager at Newton South High School. A vacancy notice was posted in accordance with procedures set out in the agreement. Five individuals, all of whom were members of the union, applied for the position. Linda Cloonan, the grievant, was among them. At the time, Cloonan was employed as a school cook. Four of the applicants, including Cloonan, were interviewed for the position by Jeanne Sheridan, the director of food services, and her production assistant, Jeanne Johnson. Sheridan and Johnson were employed by Chartwells Division of the Compass Group USA, Inc., a private company contracted by the school committee to manage the school district\u2019s cafeteria services. Sheridan had asked for and obtained permission from Michael Pierce, the school committee\u2019s manager of support services, to have \u201csubstantial input\u201d in the hiring process because the cafeteria manager position was important to running the school\u2019s cafeteria operation. In agreeing to give Sheridan an active role in the hiring process, Pierce told her that the school\u2019s principal, Roberta Dol\u00edase, would need to be \u201cactively involved in the decisional process.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sheridan and Pierce also discussed the qualification factors established by art. IX of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">In addition to the interviews of the four candidates she selected, Sheridan also spoke with Cloonan\u2019s direct supervisor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>a cafeteria manager, who was strongly supportive of Cloonan\u2019s candidacy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Sheridan concluded that Cloonan and two of the other applicants were viable candidates. Although she preferred one candidate (not Cloonan) who had some management experience in food services, Sheridan felt that any of the candidates she chose could handle the job well. Sheridan passed the names of the three candidates on to Heidi Black, Dol\u00edase\u2019s administrative assistant, and informed Black which candidate she preferred. Sheridan did not share with Black any of the information she had learned from Cloonan\u2019s supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">At Dol\u00edase\u2019s direction, Black interviewed all three candidates. Because the Newton South High School cafeteria had been having problems with staff motivation and had experienced increasing demands on employees due to a shortened student lunch period, Black was determined to find and to recommend to Dol\u00edase the candidate demonstrating the strongest leadership ability. In separate interviews, she asked each candidate the same set of questions that she had drawn up to evaluate each candidate\u2019s leadership skills. The arbitrator stated that \u201cBlack candidly acknowledged that beyond assessing leadership only from their interview answers, she did not attempt to compare the three candidates regarding knowledge, training, ability, skill and efficiency, nor did she compare their seniority.\u201d Black did not review the candidates\u2019 resumes, job evaluations, or references. She \u201cassumed\u201d that all three candidates were equally qualified in all respects other than leadership ability because Sheridan had presented all three as viable candidates. Black \u201cunequivocally\u201d recommended one candidate to Dol\u00edase. That person was not Cloonan, nor was she Sheridan\u2019s preferred candidate. The arbitrator found that \u201cDol\u00edase simply accepted Black\u2019s recommendation; she conducted no independent evaluation of the candidates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>The union filed a grievance on Cloonan\u2019s behalf, claiming that the school committee had violated the provisions of art. IX of the agreement when it refused to offer Cloonan the cafeteria manager position.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When the dispute could not be resolved at the administrative level, the union and Cloonan submitted the grievance to binding arbitration in accordance with the dispute resolution terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The union presented the following issue to the arbitrator: \u201cDid the Employer violate Article IX of the collective bargaining agreement in the appointment of a cafeteria manager at Newton South High School? If so, what shall be the remedy?\u201d The school committee sought to add a threshold question: \u201cIs the grievance substantially arbitrable?\u201d The union took the position that it would consent to arbitrate the school committee\u2019s issue only if the parties agreed that the arbitrator\u2019s decision on the matter was final and binding. The school committee, determined to preserve the arbitrability question for court review, refused. The arbitrator then proceeded solely on the issue raised by the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">After determining that Cloonan had greater seniority than the successful applicant, see note 10, <em>supra, </em>the arbitrator concluded, in relevant part, that the \u201c[e]mployer\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> violated the provisions of art. IX of the agreement by failing to make a reasonably well-informed, good-faith judgment about the candidates\u2019 relative abilities. Specifically, he determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Black, the effective decision maker, had acted in an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d manner by failing to apply the factors listed in art. IX, \u00a7 4, and by failing to take reasonable steps to assess the candidates\u2019 relative leadership abilities. He determined that the appropriate remedy was to order that Cloonan be offered the position of cafeteria manager and otherwise to \u201cmake her whole\u201d by paying her back salary with interest and granting her benefits and seniority as if she had been hired as the school\u2019s cafeteria manager in March, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The school committee filed a complaint in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (3), to vacate the arbitral award on the ground that it unlawfully usurped the principal\u2019s \u201cexclusive managerial powers\u201d under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B. The union answered and counterclaimed for judicial confirmation of the award. See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 10. The judge allowed the school committee\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. She held that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority by ordering that Cloonan be offered the cafeteria manager position because, contrary to the findings of the arbitrator, the judge found that Sheridan and Johnson, under Dol\u00edase\u2019s direction, had fully evaluated the art. IX, \u00a7 4, criteria, and because G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, authorized Dol\u00edase to decide on a successful candidate based only on Black\u2019s assessment of the applicants\u2019 leadership qualities.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">2. <em>Analysis. </em>We have today reiterated the circumscribed scope of review applicable to challenges to arbitration. See <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, post </em>753, 758-759 (2003). Those standards are controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Resolution of this case turns on whether the provisions of the agreement that establish procedures for filling nonprofessional school positions address a matter within the school committee\u2019s discretion that may properly be the subject of collective bargaining, or whether they concern a matter within the school principal\u2019s discretion that cannot be contracted away. <em>Id. </em>The school committee claims that art. IX, \u00a7 4, of the agreement unlawfully usurps a principal\u2019s discretion under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, to choose individuals to fill available positions in a school. In essence, it asserts that \u00a7 59B, as rewritten by the Reform Act of 1993 (Reform Act), St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 53, shifts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>from the school committee to the principal the sole authority to establish the qualifications for positions at the principal\u2019s school. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We begin by examining the hiring authority of school principals pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B. In <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, supra, </em>we concluded that, in crafting the Reform Act, the Legislature sought to improve the quality of public school education in the Commonwealth, in large measure by instituting a system of school-based management. Under that system, school principals are strictly accountable for the educational performance of their schools, see G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1J, inserted by St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 29,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and they may be immediately dismissed if their schools are determined by the board of education to be \u201cchronically under-performing.\u201d See <em>id. </em>Accompanying the greater accountability of school principals is enhanced management authority over the day-to-day management of their schools. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 53.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This enhanced managerial authority includes the power, formerly reserved to the school committees, to hire, discipline, and terminate teachers and other school personnel.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">However, while the Reform Act granted public school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>principals new management authority over personnel within their respective schools, such power was carefully cabined. Except in the case of \u201cchronically under-performing\u201d schools, see G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1J, the Legislature declined to accord principals the power to hire, discipline, or terminate individuals without the approval of the superintendent. See <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, supra </em>at 760. The Legislature also subordinated the principals\u2019 hiring authority to the school committees\u2019 exclusive prerogatives to set school budgets and to promulgate \u201cdistrict personnel policies.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In other words, the Reform Act gives principals broad discretion to determine, among other things, whom to hire from a pool of available applicants, but it leaves intact the authority of the school committee, subject to standards established by the Board of Education, to determine the minimum qualifications, and hence the permissible pool, of applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The authority of a school committee to control district-wide personnel policy necessarily encompasses the prerogative, if the school committee so chooses, to establish procedures for carrying out its personnel policies. Our courts, both before and after passage of the Reform Act, have consistently held that such personnel-related procedures may properly be open to collective bargaining, and that the bargained-for procedure will be enforced so long as it does not result in an abdication of the school committee\u2019s, or a principal\u2019s, core statutory authority. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>See, e.g., <em>Blue Hills Regional Dist. Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Flight, </em>383 Mass. 642, 643 (1981) (\u201ccollective bargaining agreement provided explicitly that appointments would be made without regard to sex, and . . . that provision was arbitrable\u201d); <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66 </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>370 Mass. 455, 462 (1976) (\u201cthe provision for the hiring of substitute teachers was a proper subject of collective bargaining\u201d); <em>School Comm. of Peabody </em>v. <em>Peabody Fed\u2019n of Teachers, Local 1289, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 909, 911 (2001) (\u201cThis decision is not to be interpreted as invalidating collective bargaining provisions that establish procedures for applying for transfers and filling vacancies that do not encroach upon the powers to approve or' disapprove reserved to principals and superintendents by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B\u201d); <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 921 (1999) (Reform Act \u201cdid not abrogate collective bargaining agreements with school committees insofar as the agreements concerned terms and conditions of employment or procedures for making appointments, as opposed to decisions about hiring or firing designated categories of school employees\u201d); <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Local 159, Serv. Employees Int\u2019l Union, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 690, 693 (1997) (\u201cWe do not perceive the procedures for filling vacancies to infringe upon the powers of the principal and superintendent so long as they retain the right of approval of the employee selected pursuant to those procedures\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The provisions of art. IX that are at issue here do not encroach on a school principal\u2019s managerial control over hiring. Consistent with G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, art. IX of the agreement does not remove from the principal the actual, first-line determination of whom to hire. Far from dictating the choice of a certain individual, art. IX merely establishes the \u201cintention\u201d of each \u201c[ajdministration\u201d (in this case, the school principal) to \u201cconsider[j\u201d at least four factors before filling a vacancy. Three of these factors (\u201c[kjnowledge, training, ability, skill and efficiency\u201d; \u201c[pjhysical fitness\u201d; and \u201c[ljeadership qualities\u201d) are highly subjective. The fourth factor, \u201c[Ijength of service,\u201d concerns an employment status whose benefits have long been a subject of collective bargaining in matters between the public employers and employees. See <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Lo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>cal 159, Serv. Employees Int\u2019l Union, supra </em>at 693 (refusing to invalidate provisions of collective bargaining agreement establishing process for filling vacancies by bidding and seniority, \u201cso long as the prior approval which was vested in the school committee rests now with the principal and superintendent\u201d). Moreover, art. IX does not purport to restrict the principal\u2019s review to only the four listed factors, or to require the principal to assign any certain weight to those factors. Under the agreement, for instance, the principal remains free to minimize the importance of seniority in considering employee qualifications, although the principal is required to put her reasons for doing so in writing. At most, the contested provisions of art. IX require the principal to make a good-faith effort to evaluate a job applicant\u2019s qualifications in four enumerated areas, and to resort to seniority if the principal independently determines that the candidates stand on identical footing with respect to the other more subjective criteria. The intrusion on the principal\u2019s hiring discretion is minimal and well within the school committee\u2019s statutory authority over \u201cdistrict personnel policies.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with other statutes concerning the authority of school committees to enter into collective bargaining agreements.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>PGR Mgt. Co., Heath Props. </em>v. <em>Credle, </em>427 Mass. 636, 640 (1998) (courts \u201cconstrue statutes to give reasonable effect to all the statutory provisions and create a consistent body of law\u201d). The Legislature has expressly mandated school committees to negotiate in \u201cgood faith\u201d with their employees\u2019 representatives on matters concerning \u201cwages, hours, standards [of] productivity and performance, and any other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6. The phrase \u201cterms and conditions of employment\u201d is general and broad, and must be determined \u201con a case by case basis.\u201d <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>390 Mass. 157, 164 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The Legislature has also authorized a school committee to enter into binding arbitration to settle disputes relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. In particular, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 8, provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe parties may include in any written agreement a grievance procedure culminating in final and binding arbitration to be invoked in the event of any' dispute concerning the interpretation or application of such written agreement. . . . Where binding arbitration is provided under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement as a means of resolving grievances concerning job abolition, demotion, promotion, layoff, recall, or appointment and where an employee elects such binding arbitration as the method of resolution under said collective bargaining agreement, such binding arbitration shall be the exclusive procedure for resolving any such grievance <em>notwithstanding any contrary provisions of sections thirty-seven, thirty-eight. . . and section fifty-nine B of chapter </em>seventy-one\u201d (emphasis added). The phrase italicized was added by St. 1988, c. 186, \u00a7 1, and was left undisturbed by the Reform Act, which did amend G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 1. See St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The union contends that the provisions of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 8, cited above control the arbitrability issue in this case and provide a substantive right to collective bargaining over matters of job appointments.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That position is difficult to reconcile with the plain language of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 8, which merely permits the parties to elect binding arbitration of certain issues, including job appointments, but by its plain terms does not require that result. <em>Salem Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 323, 325 (1988) (\u201cThe distinction in statutes between \u2018shall,\u2019 a word of command, and \u2018may,\u2019 a word of permission, is not one which courts pass over lightly unless context or other provisions require it\u201d). See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6 (employer\u2019s obligation to bargain in good faith \u201cshall not compel either party to agree to a proposal or make a concession\u201d). The union amici\u2019s position is also difficult to reconcile with G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7, which enumerates statutory provisions that <em>must </em>be overridden when in conflict with a collective bargaining agreement but makes no mention of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B. We must presume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>that when the Legislature acts to truncate a school committee\u2019s authority, it does so explicitly. See <em>School Comm. of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. 106, 113 (1977) (\u201cWhenever the Legislature has limited the powers of school committees, it has done so in express terms, and it is expected that a radical departure from prior policy would be clearly indicated, and not left to doubtful implication\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is not inconsistent that the Legislature granted individual principals certain authority over personnel <em>selection </em>under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, while at the same time preserving the right of school committees to elect to resolve issues related to personnel procedures by final and binding arbitration. In the absence of explicit legislative commands to the contrary, we construe statutes to harmonize and not to undercut each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The facts before us are not unlike those in <em>School Comm. of Peabody </em>v. <em>Peabody Fed\u2019n of Teachers, Local 1289, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 909 (2001), and <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Local 159, Serv. Employees Int\u2019l Union, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 690 (1997). In each case, the court concluded that an arbitration award could not usurp a principal\u2019s hiring authority under \u00a7 59B, but in each case, the court was also careful to state that the school committee retained the authority to establish procedures for implementing personnel policies that may be submitted to collective bargaining. See <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, post </em>753, 762-763 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Nevertheless, although the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in considering the union\u2019s grievance, in ordering the principal and the school committee to offer Cloonan the cafeteria manager position and to \u201cmake her whole\u201d for the initial failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>to offer her the position, he went beyond the boundaries of his jurisdiction. While an arbitrator enjoys considerable latitude in fashioning an award, see <em>Old Rochester Regional Teacher\u2019s Club </em>v. <em>Old Rochester Regional Sch. Dist. Comm., </em>398 Mass. 695, 701 (1986), he may not fashion an award that contravenes existing law or requires others to transgress existing law. See <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990). We agree with the judge that the arbitrator\u2019s order that Cloonan be offered the cafeteria manager position in effect substituted the arbitrator\u2019s discretion for that of the school principal, in contravention of \u00a7 59B. See <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Local 159, Serv. Employees Int\u2019l Union, su</em>pra; <em>School Comm. of Peabody </em>v. <em>Peabody Fed\u2019n of Teachers, Local 1289, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the judge\u2019s order is vacated.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On remand, an order is to enter in the Superior Court remanding the case to the arbitrator for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-12\"> General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 59B, states in pertinent part: \u201cPrincipals employed under this section shall be the education administrators and managers of their schools and shall supervise the operation and management of their schools and school property, subject to the supervision and direction of the superintendent. Principals employed under this section shall be responsible, consistent with district personnel policies and budgetary restrictions and subject to the approval of the superintendent, for hiring all teachers, athletic coaches, instructional or administrative aides, and other personnel assigned to the school, and for terminating all such personnel subject to review and prior approval by the superintendent and subject to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b762-13\"> General Laws c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a), </em>states, in pertinent part: \u201cUpon application of a party, the superior court shall vacate an award if: . . .

The precise relationship between that entity, \u201cNutrition Workers Unit,\u201d and the named defendant in this action is not clear from the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b763-12\"> Article IX, \u00a7 1, of the agreement defines a vacancy as \u201ca new position or an opening in an existing position (which is to be filled at the discretion of the [school] [cjommittee) caused by promotion, death, retirement, resignation, permanent transfer, or discharge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b763-13\"> \u201cAdministration\" is not defined in the agreement. From the parties\u2019 and the arbitrator\u2019s use of the term, we understand \u201cadministration\u201d to refer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>entity in charge of the hiring of cafeteria employees subject to this agreement. Here, under the Reform Act, that is the principal, subject to the approval of the superintendent. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b764-10\"> Article IX, \u00a7 5, of the agreement provides that, \u201c[wjhere b, c, and d, in [\u00a7] 4 above, are equal in the judgment of the Administration, the length of service from the original date of appointment shall govern.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b764-11\"> The arbitrator stated, \u201cSheridan could not recall more precisely whether Pierce said the principal would need only to give input into the decision, or would need to make the final decision.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\"> The arbitrator noted: \u201cCafeteria Manager Scena [Cloonan\u2019s supervisor] stated that Cloonan had filled in as manager during his absences, and had done well in that role of acting cafeteria manager. Scena [also] informed Sheridan that [Cloonan] met the criteria of being able to communicate effectively, both verbally and in writing, with students, staif, administration, and parents; and of using appropriate customer service techniques. Scena also told Sheridan that [Cloonan] met the criterion of \u2018demonstrated supervisory skills.\u2019 In sum, Scena told Sheridan that he strongly supported [Cloonan\u2019s] application to become the cafeteria manager at Newton South High.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\"> Cloonan alleged that there were violations of art. EX, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, and 6, of the agreement. Section 6 provides: \u201cIf an employee has bid and is to be passed on the seniority roster through the filling of the vacancy by an employee lower down on such seniority roster or by others, the employee passed shall be notified of that fact and the reasons therefore <em>[sic] </em>in writing with a copy sent to the Union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The arbitrator determined that Cloonan had been a cook fifty-six days longer than the successful applicant, although both were certified as cooks on the same day, March 1, 1999. The union claimed, and the arbitrator agreed, that Cloonan\u2019s certification would have occurred eight weeks prior had the school committee submitted the paper work in a timely manner. Both applicants were certified as cafeteria helpers on the same day, March 2, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b766-9\"> \u201cEmployer\u201d is not defined in the agreement. For purposes of collective bargaining, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 1, defines the \u201cschool committee\u201d as the \u201cemployer.\u201d The arbitrator, however, uses \u201cemployer\u201d when referring to (1) the school committee; (2) the \u201c[administration,\u201d as used in the agreement, see note 6, supra; and (3) the hiring decision maker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\"> See G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 1, which declares the Commonwealth\u2019s intent to ensure \u201c(1) that each public school classroom provides the conditions for all pupils to engage fully in learning as an inherently meaningful and enjoyable activity without threats to their security or self-esteem, (2) a consistent commitment of resources sufficient to provide a high quality public education to every child, (3) a deliberate process for establishing and achieving specific educational performance goals for every child, and (4) an effective mechanism for monitoring progress toward those goals and for holding educators accountable for their achievement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b768-8\"> A 1994 amendment (St. 1994, c. 60, \u00a7 95) pertaining to principals of schools that require examination for admission is not relevant here. In 1996, \u00a7 59B was further amended to give principals authority over hiring athletic coaches. St. 1996, c. 134, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\"> The parties do not contest that G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, authorizes a public school principal to hire the school\u2019s cafeteria manager. There is, however, a threshold question whether the position at issue here involved not a hiring decision within the meaning of \u00a7 59B, but a redeployment of staff among current employees of the school system. Section 59B mandates that the principal \u201cshall\u201d be responsible for hiring \u201cpersonnel assigned to the school.\u201d As we state in <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, post </em>753, 763 (2003), quoting <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Local 159, Serv. Employees Int\u2019l </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number><em>Union, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 690, 692 (1997), \u201cwhile the statute does not define the word \u2018hire,\u2019 the term must be \u2018given its ordinary meaning, \u201cemploy.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Were we to adopt the classification of employees that the union amici urge, the principal\u2019s authority to control hiring of all \u201cpersonnel assigned to the school\u201d would be impermissibly narrowed. See <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Local 159, Serv. Employees Int\u2019l Union, supra </em>(applying \u00a7 59B to dispute concerning bid of school custodian to transfer to another school).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b769-7\"> The Reform Act further clarified the lines of accountability for school performance by vesting school committees with the authority to hire superintendents, see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 35, who in turn have the authority to hire principals, see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, as appearing in St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 53, and by making the school committee itself answerable to the Legislature for district-wide performance. Under the Reform Act, under-performing districts are subject to a number of sanctions, including the appointment of a receiver. See G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 IK, inserted by St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\"> The Legislature may define what matters are proper subjects for collective bargaining. See <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>370 Mass. 455, 464 n.5 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\"> The argument was raised first by the union amici and adopted by the union at oral argument. See <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>419 Mass. 448, 454 n.12 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\"> Similarly, we reject the school committee\u2019s argument that, because G. L. c. 150B, \u00a7 7, does not list G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, among the statutory provisions whose terms must be overridden by collective bargaining agreements, the Legislature intended that no feature of a principal\u2019s hiring practices can ever be the subject of collective bargaining. We presume that, at the time it enacted G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, \u201cthe Legislature was cognizant that the school committee remained the exclusive bargaining agent for the school district,\u201d <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Local 159, Serv. Employees Int\u2019l Union, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 690, 693 (1997). While it is true that collective bargaining agreements may not diminish a principal\u2019s managerial authority under \u00a7 59B, it is equally true that a principal\u2019s managerial authority under \u00a7 59B must not diminish the school committee\u2019s authority over \u201cdistrict personnel policies,\u201d including the authority to bargain over the terms and conditions of employment uniformly across the district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\"> To the extent the judge reviewed the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings and substituted her own, this was impermissible.
