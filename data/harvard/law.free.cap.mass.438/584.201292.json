Vatcher, fatally shot his eleven year old son, James. A Superior Court jury convicted him of murder in the first degree on a theory of deliberate premeditation. The defendant does not contest that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. Rather, on appeal, he argues that the trial judge\u2019s denial of his request for a voluntary manslaughter instruction was reversible error. The defendant also asks that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the verdict to voluntary manslaughter or, alternatively, to murder in the second degree. We decline to reduce the verdict and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">1. Viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the facts are as follows. On the morning of the shooting James\u2019s mother left for work shortly before 8 a.m., leaving the defendant and James alone together. James had a number of physical and developmental disorders, including hypotonia<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and attention deficit disorder. He was a third grader who participated in a special needs program, could not read, bathe himself, or tie his shoes, and had some difficulty climbing stairs and walking. At trial, James\u2019s teachers described him as a \u201cvery easy going, lovable child\u201d who got along well with other children at school. He \u201cenjoyed being with people and people enjoyed being with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Some time after James\u2019s mother left for work, an argument erupted between father and son, the details of which we reserve for later discussion. The argument escalated, culminating with the defendant firing one shot from a bolt-action .22 caliber rifle into James\u2019s abdomen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> James said, \u201cYou shot me, it hurts.\u201d The child tried to run upstairs, but the defendant caught him. The defendant later told police that he \u201cwanted [his son] to die quick,\u201d and so, as James \u201cwheez[ed],\u201d \u201cgaspfed],\u201d and \u201cstruggled],\u201d the defendant tried to cover his son\u2019s nose and mouth with his hand. When that \u201cwasn\u2019t working,\u201d the defendant took a shoelace from a boot and wrapped it around his son\u2019s neck.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As James was dying, the defendant \u201ckept telling him how he was going to heaven and that no one was going to kick him or yell at him anymore.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">After the shooting, the defendant covered James\u2019s body with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>trash bags and blankets and left the body in the cellar. The defendant left the house around 2 p.m. after unsuccessfully trying to asphyxiate himself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> James\u2019s mother returned home at about 4 p.m. When she discovered and began to play an audiotape recording in which the defendant admitted to killing James, she telephoned the police.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">When officers arrived, James\u2019s mother directed them to the audiotape recording, which they played in full. Among other things, the defendant admitted that he \u201cbought a rifle and [he] shot [James],\u201d then \u201cstrangled him cuz he wasn\u2019t dead.\u201d He stated that James\u2019s body was in the basement. The defendant explained that, \u201cI was gonna do this a long time ago, but I kept putting it off. I couldn\u2019t put it off anymore. . . . All I wanted was a normal kid, an average kid, but no, I didn\u2019t get that.\u201d He also stated, \u201c[T]he only way I could\u2019ve done this is if I lost control and I did. I lost control this morning.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An officer found James\u2019s body in the cellar and shortly thereafter an emergency medical technician confirmed that James was dead. After obtaining a search warrant, police collected several pieces of evidence from the Vatcher residence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The following day, a New Hampshire State trooper who had spotted the defendant driving in his car arrested him following a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>brief exchange. After being informed of and waiving his Miranda rights, the defendant gave a statement to police in which he admitted killing James.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The defendant did not testify at trial. The Commonwealth introduced in evidence his audiotape recording, the confession given to police, the suicide note, and other notes written by the defendant. The defendant was convicted as charged and filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">2. The defendant argues that the judge committed reversible error by denying his request for a voluntary manslaughter instruction. In so doing, the judge concluded that the evidence did not show an \u201cadequate, reasonable provocation\u201d and thus, that under \u201cno view of the evidence could a rational jury validly return a voluntary manslaughter [verdict].\u201d We agree. \u201cVoluntary manslaughter has been defined as a killing committed in \u2018a sudden transport of passion or heat of blood, upon a reasonable provocation and without malice, or upon sudden combat.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garabedian, </em>399 Mass. 304, 313 (1987), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod., </em>394 Mass. 727, 738, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Aiello </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>474 U.S. 919 (1985). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>356 Mass. 442, 445 (1969).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An instruction on voluntary manslaughter is appropriate \u201cif there is evidence of provocation deemed adequate in law to cause the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>accused to lose his self-control in the heat of passion, and if the killing followed the provocation before sufficient time had elapsed for the accused\u2019s temper to cool.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>422 Mass. 236, 237 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schnopps, </em>383 Mass. 178, 180 (1981), <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 722 (1984). \u201cThe evidence must be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt in the minds of a rational jury that a defendant\u2019s actions were both objectively and subjectively reasonable. That is, the jury must be able to infer that a reasonable person would have become sufficiently provoked and would not have \u2018cooled off\u2019 by the time of the homicide, and that in fact a defendant was provoked and did not cool off.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Groome, </em>435 Mass. 201, 220 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, supra </em>at 738. \u201cIn assessing whether a voluntary manslaughter instruction was warranted, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Groome, supra </em>at 220. \u201cIf any view of the evidence . . . would permit a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder, a manslaughter charge must be given.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>431 Mass. 804, 812 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>431 Mass. 326, 334 (2000). However, a judge should not give a voluntary manslaughter instruction where the evidence does not support it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Groome, supra </em>at 220; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 745-746 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The evidence was that on the morning of the shooting, James threw waffles in the trash, threw other objects around the house, kicked a brass planter, attempted to destroy his mother\u2019s birthday cards, got into a \u201cwrestling match\u201d with the defendant, hit the defendant with an afghan, kicked the defendant, followed him around the house and into the cellar three times, told the defendant he wanted him to leave the house, cursed at him, and laughed at the defendant when he cried. In short, the evidence described a child having an extended temper tantrum, which, according to his mother\u2019s testimony, was not atypical behavior for her son when he was at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">It is well settled that \u201c[ijnsults and quarreling alone cannot provide a reasonable provocation,\u201d even between adults. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Seabrooks, </em>425 Mass. 507, 514 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>433 Mass. 439 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>401 Mass. 627, 632 (1988). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Groome, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Estremera, </em>383 Mass. 382, 392 (1981) (\u201cverbal insults and arguments, even if obscene or hostile, cannot constitute sufficient provocation, for a reasonable person \u2018can be expected to control the feelings aroused\u2019 thereby\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Masello, </em>428 Mass. 446, 449 (1998) (\u201cheated oral argument that escalated during the course of the evening, without more, does not constitute adequate provocation\u201d). Indeed, a victim\u2019s offensive use of physical force against a defendant will not necessarily constitute \u201cadequate provocation,\u201d particularly where the defendant responds with excessive force. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianchi, </em>435 Mass. 316, 329 (2001) (no adequate provocation where victim called defendant obscenity and punched defendant in face, where defendant was weightlifter, outweighed victim by over 170 pounds, was armed with fully loaded weapon, and was violating protective order in pursuing victim); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>363 Mass. 311, 321 (1973), <em>S.C., </em>391 Mass. 123 (1984) (\u201c[i]t is an extravagant suggestion that scratches by the wife could serve as provocation for a malice-free but ferocious attack by the defendant with a deadly instrument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">This confrontation was between an adult and a child. However \u201cprovocative\u201d in the ordinary sense of the term the actions of this eleven year old physically challenged boy may have been, however frustrating, annoying, and even infuriating his behavior, it did not rise to \u201cadequate provocation\u201d within the meaning of our laws. James\u2019s behavior may have warranted ordinary parental discipline, but such behavior cannot reasonably be said to have called forth the stark breakdown in self-control that may attend \u201cthe heat of blood\u201d or sudden combat requirements and thereby mitigate murder to manslaughter. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garabedian, </em>399 Mass. 304, 313 (1987). As the judge noted, no evidence suggested that James acted in \u201ca way above and beyond causing a guardian or father to be exasperated, bothered, upset, impatient, lose one\u2019s temper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The defendant argues, however, that the judge should have considered the defendant\u2019s actions \u201cin the broader context of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the persistent difficulties\u201d that he experienced in caring for James. The defendant contends that it was properly for the jury to decide whether the defendant\u2019s actions were reasonable \u201cin the totality of the circumstances.\u201d This is incorrect. If anything, the evidence of James\u2019s \u201crelentless,\u201d \u201coppositional,\u201d \u201cfrustrating,\u201d or \u201cexasperating\u201d behavior suggests that James\u2019s bad behavior on the day in question would have come as no surprise to the defendant, and would not have elicited \u201csuch a state of passion, anger, fear, fright, or nervous excitement as would eclipse his capacity for reflection or restraint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sirois, </em>437 Mass. 845, 854 (2002).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are persuaded from our careful review of the record that the judge considered all of the evidence and discussed the requested voluntary manslaughter instruction with counsel, before denying the requested instruction. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">3. The defendant asks that, in the interests of justice, we employ our extraordinary power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the jury verdict from murder in the first degree to voluntary manslaughter or, alternatively, to murder in the second degree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For the reasons stated above, \u201cthere is no question of reducing the verdict below murder; the question that presents itself is the less drastic one whether there is ground for reducing from first to second degree murder.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cadwell, 374 </em>Mass. 308, 316 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>346 Mass. 107, 109 (1963). We conclude that no such ground exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The defendant\u2019s own clear, unequivocal admissions in the audiotape recording, his handwritten note, and a voluntary confession to police, all entered in evidence at trial, amply support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>jury\u2019s finding that the defendant deliberately premeditated the killing with malice aforethought. The defendant stated that he \u201chad been thinking about helping [James] end the suffering for a while,\u201d \u201cwas gonna do this a long time ago, but . . . kept putting it off,\u201d \u201cbought a rifle and shot [James],\u201d \u201choped that [he] had hit [James] in the heart [because he] wanted him to die quick,\u201d and then \u201cstrangled [James] cuz he wasn\u2019t dead.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The verdict stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\"> James\u2019s mother testified that \u201chypotonia\u201d is a condition that causes low muscle tone throughout the body.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\"> The defendant acquired the rifle in May, 1999, in exchange for a semiautomatic rifle he had purchased in March, 1999. The defendant was not known to his family or his neighbors to be interested in guns or hunting or to own a gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b607-9\"> The evidence at trial was that the defendant was over one foot taller than James and more than double his weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b607-10\"> In various statements introduced at trial, the defendant stated that he had not wanted a child, that he considered James \u201can intrusion\u201d into his married life, and that he did not believe he was or could be a good father. Evidence at trial showed that James had been the frequent target of his mother\u2019s verbal abuse and his father\u2019s physical abuse. Over the years, the defendant had banged James\u2019s head on the floor, struck James in the chest, and hit James\u2019s head against the bathroom door. The defendant told police that on one occasion he had hit James so hard that he, the defendant, broke his own finger. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>a \u201csuicide\u201d note introduced in evidence, the defendant described himself as \u201cthe kind of guy who strikes back when struck,\u201d and wrote that he could \u201chit harder\u201d than James could. The medical examiner who conducted the autopsy testified that he observed a number of bruises on James\u2019s body and limbs that were of different ages and varieties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b608-11\"> The record indicates that the defendant tried to kill himself on two other occasions prior to his arrest the next day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b608-12\"> In addition to the statement on the audiotape recording, the defendant made several other statements admitted in evidence, including statements in a suicide note written the day of the killing and a statement to police made after his arrest. The defendant filed various motions to suppress these statements, all of which were denied, except that his statement to police was redacted in part.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b608-13\"> The quotations are from a transcript of the audiotape recording admitted in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b608-14\"> The evidence consisted of two notes in the defendant\u2019s handwriting, a discharged cartridge casing, a spent projectile, and traces of blood. A few days later, the police secured a second warrant and retrieved a gun box and a shoelace or bootlace from the home. In a separate search, officers retrieved from the defendant\u2019s automobile a suicide note, a box of live rounds of .22 caliber ammunition, a gun lock, and a rifle which an expert subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>determined discharged the casing found in the Vatcher\u2019s home. All the items of physical evidence were admitted at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\"> The Commonwealth argues that there is no evidence that the defendant acted on \u201csudden\u201d provocation adequate to support an instruction on voluntary manslaughter. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeClair, </em>429 Mass. 313, 317 (1999), and cases cited (revelation \u201cmust constitute a \u2018sudden discovery\u2019 in order to reduce the degree of culpability\u201d). The evidence indicates, among other things, that the defendant had been frustrated with James for some time and was \u201cgonna do this a long time ago, but [he] kept putting it off.\u201d Years of frustration do not make for \u201csudden\u201d passion or heat of blood. See, e.g., <em>Tripp </em>v. <em>State, </em>36 Md. App. 459, 471-472 (1977) (\u201cThe law . . . recognizes human frailty when one is in the clutches of blind and sudden fury. The long-smoldering grudge, by way of contrast ... is a telltale characteristic of premeditation\u201d). The defendant\u2019s self-recorded and self-justifying statement after the incident that \u201cthe only way I could\u2019ve done this is if I lost control and ... I lost control this morning,\u201d even if claimed to be \u201csudden\u201d provocation, was not provocation otherwise adequate at law to mitigate the murder of a misbehaving child by a parent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\"><em> Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schnopps, </em>383 Mass. 178 (1981), <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 722 (1984), on which the defendant relies, does not persuade us that a different result is warranted. In that case, the critical factual issue was how long the defendant had known about the allegedly provocative act, the sudden discovery by the defendant of his spouse\u2019s infidelity. See <em>id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\"> The defendant cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, </em>435 Mass. 675 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, 427 </em>Mass. 659 (1998); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vizcarrondo, 427 </em>Mass. 392 (1998), <em>S.C., </em>431 Mass. 360 (2000), for the argument that we should reduce the verdict in this case to voluntary manslaughter. Those cases, whi\u00f3h involve the so-called \u201cthird prong\u201d of malice, are inapposite. Here, the evidence of a specific intent to kill was clear, indeed overwhelming.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\"><em> Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>388 Mass. 128, 134 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starling, </em>382 Mass. 423, 425-426 (1981); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cadwell, </em>374 Mass. 308, 316-320 (1978), on which the defendant also relies, do not persuade us to reduce the verdict to murder in the second degree. Each of these cases involved beatings to young children where the evidence of deliberate premeditation was either nonexistent or insufficient. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kane, supra </em>at 129 n.1 (unclear under which theory of murder in the first degree Commonwealth proceeded, but judge entered required finding of not guilty on that portion of the indictment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starling, supra </em>at 425; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cadwell, supra </em>at 316-317 (although evidence of deliberate premeditation could \u201cperhaps be pieced out of the evidence,\u201d the \u201csurest surmise is that the lethal blows were struck by the defendant in an excess of anger and frustration,\u201d and thus there was \u201can irreducible doubt in all the circumstances whether the defendant consciously formed a purpose that morning to do the child mortal injury\u201d). In this case, the jury had strong evidence, including the defendant\u2019s own words, to support a finding of deliberate premeditation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
