We affirmed the conviction and the denial of the defendant\u2019s first motion for a new trial, and we denied his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>second motion for a new trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>393 Mass. 367 (1984). The defendant has since filed a third motion for a new trial, based in part on the allegation that the prosecution withheld exculpatory and material evidence in violation of his Federal and State constitutional rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallarelli, 399 </em>Mass. 17, 19 (1987), and cases cited. After an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denied the motion for a new trial. A single justice of this court allowed the defendant\u2019s petition for leave to appeal. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We now affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Facts presented at trial. </em>The facts of this case are set out in full in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Healy, supra </em>at 369-372. As background to the present appeal, we set forth those facts pertinent to the claimed failure to disclose exculpatory evidence. The twenty-nine year old victim lived with his girl friend in an apartment in Holyoke. Police were summoned to the apartment on a report of hearing the victim screaming for help at approximately 1 or 1:30 a.m. on August 8, 1980. The police found the victim\u2019s body on his bed. He had been stabbed fourteen times in the chest, twice in the neck, and once on his right thigh. The pathologist who conducted the autopsy opined, based on the location and angle of the wounds, that the perpetrator had been kneeling on the bed to the right of the victim at the time the wounds were inflicted. The victim\u2019s body was naked, except for a towel wrapped around his neck and a pair of jeans pulled halfway down his legs. There was no underwear on the body. The victim\u2019s hands were bound with socks tied together, and a gag of socks was tied around his mouth. On the floor at the foot of the bed, police found a pair of boots, also tied together with socks. On top of a dresser in the bedroom, approximately four to five feet from the body, police found a pair of undershorts. Testing of the shorts revealed the presence of semen consistent with the victim\u2019s blood group.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">There was some evidence concerning recent changes in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>victim\u2019s behavior that, although only general in nature, \u201ctended to show that in the week before his death the victim had formed a sexual relationship with someone other than his girl Mend.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Healy, supra </em>at 378. Then, on the night of the murder, the victim\u2019s gM friend had telephoned the apartment and spoken to the victim. In the background, she heard a \u201cvery soft\u201d male voice. When the girl friend asked who was there, the victim was evasive, and ultimately told her that it was his downstairs neighbor. The neighbor testified that he had not been there,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from which the jury could infer that the victim had lied about the identity of the man who was in his apartment. At the scene, the police found no sign of forced entry into the apartment. The front and back doors were locked, and the victim\u2019s dog, a Doberman pinscher, was locked in another room.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Evidence that the defendant committed the crime was entirely circumstantial. After initially telling the police that he had not seen the victim for some months, the defendant acknowledged that he had purchased rum, soda, and ice and taken them to the victim\u2019s apartment on the night of the murder. The cash register receipt for those items was found, stained with blood, on the third-floor landing of the front stairs. A knife on the dresser in the bedroom had a mixture of blood, consistent with a mixture of the defendant\u2019s blood type and that of the victim. A search of the defendant\u2019s apartment uncovered a shirt with a bloodstain, also consistent with a mixture of the victim\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s blood. The defendant had a cut on his hand, which he claimed had occurred at his home the morning after the murder. However, the physician who treated that cut opined that it had been inflicted some hours earlier than the defendant claimed. Finally, the Commonwealth presented consciousness of guilt evidence, consisting of the defendant\u2019s conflicting versions as to when he had last seen the victim, the nature and extent of his encounter with the victim on the night of the murder, his whereabouts later that night, and the time that he had returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>home. In particular, the Commonwealth stressed the fact that the defendant had asked his partner to lie to the police concerning the time the defendant had returned home. The defendant claimed that his reluctance to tell the police where he had been on the night of the murder was due to the fact that he had gone to two \u201cgay\u201d bars after leaving the victim\u2019s apartment and did not want to disclose to the police that he was homosexual. The Commonwealth countered that explanation with evidence that the defendant had led an openly \u201cgay\u201d lifestyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">b. <em>Third motion for a new trial. </em>In 1994, the defendant filed a motion for the release of certain exhibits for the purpose of conducting DNA testing. The motion was allowed in part, and the items were made available to the defendant\u2019s chosen laboratory. A motion for a new trial was filed in 1997, along with a motion for further discovery. In the course of gathering materials to investigate potential grounds for a new trial, defense counsel<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> became aware of three documents prepared by Dr. H. Paul Wakefield, a pathologist at Holyoke Hospital, who had performed the autopsy of the victim at the direction of the medical examiner. Trial counsel had requested, and by way of a pretrial conference report the Commonwealth was required to provide, exculpatory material, \u201cmaterial and relevant physical evidence and documents,\u201d \u201creports of mental or physical examinations and of scientific tests,\u201d and witness statements. New counsel alleged that, while one of Dr. Wakefield\u2019s reports had been provided in discovery, the other two reports had not been provided. In 1999, counsel filed an \u201camended\u201d motion for a new trial to \u201csuper[s]ede his original motion in all respects.\u201d The amended motion alleged prosecutorial misconduct in failing to provide exculpatory evidence, along with other claimed errors not relevant to the present appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The reports from Dr. Wakefield, which form the basis of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, consist of the following. Dr. Wakefield authored a four-page report dictated shortly after the August 8, 1980, autopsy and bearing the heading \u201cHolyoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Hospital Pathology Department Post-Mortem Examination\u201d (postmortem report). In the first paragraph of the postmortem report, Dr. Wakefield indicated that the victim\u2019s genitalia were \u201cexamined closely\u201d and that \u201cno evidence of marks of recent origin\u201d were identified. The rectum was \u201csimilarly viewed revealing no abnormal findings on the external surface.\u201d The postmortem report went on to note that \u201c[s]mears [were] made by use of a swab from both the mouth as well as rectum to be examined under the microscope.\u201d The next document at issue was a handwritten note (note) of Dr. Wakefield dated August 10, 1980, two days after the autopsy, reflecting the results of the microscopic examination of the oral and rectal smears: \u201cSmears made from mouth and rectum fail to reveal spermatozoa present.\u201d The final document was a two-page report dated November 28, 1980, entitled \u201cAutopsy Report,\u201d that included a subheading of \u201cFinal Diagnosis\u201d (final diagnosis). The final diagnosis included the cause of death and gross anatomical description, but did not make any reference to examination of the victim\u2019s rectum and genitalia, the taking of any swabs or smears, or the results of any examination of swabs or smears.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In support of the amended motion for a new trial, an affidavit of trial counsel was submitted alleging that in preparation for trial he had received and reviewed the- final diagnosis, but that he had not seen the postmortem report or the note and was not aware of the taking of any swabs. Following an evidentiary hearing on the issue of what items had been provided in discovery, the motion judge found that the hospital had forwarded both the postmortem report and the final diagnosis to the district attorney\u2019s office. However, the district attorney\u2019s office gave the defendant\u2019s trial counsel only the final diagnosis, not the postmortem report.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge concluded that this failure on the part of the prosecutor was the product of inadvertence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>not wilful misconduct. With respect to the note, the motion judge was unable to determine whether the hospital or Dr. Wake-field had ever turned the note over to the district attorney\u2019s office, and hence did not find any form of prosecutorial misconduct with respect to the note. Notwithstanding the prosecutor\u2019s failure to provide defense counsel with the postmortem report, the motion judge held that the defendant did not meet his burden of showing that the postmortem report was exculpatory or material. He therefore denied the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">2. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">a. <em>Waiver. </em>The Commonwealth argues that the defendant\u2019s claim of failure to produce exculpatory evidence should not be reviewed because it was waived. The theory of waiver i&amp; premised on the fact that the defendant\u2019s previous attorneys could have subpoenaed the hospital\u2019s records and discovered the documents in time to use them at trial or as part of either of his prior motions for a new trial. The fact that it would have been possible for defense counsel to obtain the documents from the hospital, if he had known of their existence, does not operate as a waiver of his constitutional claim that the prosecutor failed to turn over exculpatory information.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct was not \u201cgenerally known and available at the time of trial or appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>437 Mass. 366, 370 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pisa, </em>384 Mass. 362, 365-366 (1981). The defendant had no reason to believe that the pathologist had generated more than one report concerning the autopsy of the victim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At no time was defense counsel aware, nor did he have any reason to suspect, that there were additional materials pertaining to the autopsy that he did not have. The prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>agreed as part of the pretrial conference report to turn over all witness statements, scientific reports, and exculpatory evidence. \u201c[W]here a prosecutor fails to disclose evidence in his control which is also within the scope of a pretrial agreement having the force of a court order, such failure amounts to a representation on which the defendant is entitled to rely, that no such evidence exists.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallarelli, </em>399 Mass. 17, 23-24 n.7 (1987). Justifiable reliance on the prosecutor\u2019s fulfilment of discovery obligations will not result in waiver of a claim of violation of those obligations merely because the items the prosecutor was obligated to produce could have been obtained from some other source. We thus conclude that there was no waiver of the claim now being made.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">b. <em>Nondisclosure of alleged exculpatory evidence. </em>The defendant contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory material in violation of his Federal and State constitutional rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>376 Mass. 1, 21 (1978) (\u201cthe rule of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 [1963] . . . [is] that suppression by the prosecution of requested material evidence which is favorable to the accused is a denial of due process,\u201d [citations omitted]). \u201cIn instances where, as here, a judge hearing a motion for new trial was not the trial judge, \u2018we regard ourselves in as good a position as the motion judge to assess the trial record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salvati, </em>420 Mass. 499, 500 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986). \u201c[W]hen a new trial claim is constitutionally based, as in the instant case[], \u2018this court will exercise its own judgment on the ultimate factual as well as legal conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salvati, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 409 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Accepting the motion judge\u2019s finding that the postmortem report was not produced (see note 6, <em>supra), </em>the sole issue before us is whether the evidence withheld by the prosecution would qualify as exculpatory and material such that the failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>to produce it would constitute a violation of due process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 106 (1976); <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra </em>at 87. \u201cThe <em>Brady </em>obligation comprehends evidence which provides some significant aid to the defendant\u2019s case, whether it furnishes corroboration of the defendant\u2019s story, calls into question a material, although not indispensable, element of the prosecution\u2019s version of the events, or challenges the credibility of a key prosecution witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, supra </em>at 22. To prevail on a claim that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evidence, the defendant must first prove that the evidence was, in fact, exculpatory. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>381 Mass. 90, 107 (1980). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schand, </em>420 Mass. 783, 787 (1995), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adrey, </em>376 Mass. 747, 753 (1978), and cases cited (\u201cdefendant must establish that the evidence existed, that it tended to exculpate him, and that the prosecution failed to deliver the information\u201d). \u201c \u2018[Ejxculpatory\u2019 in this context is not a narrow term connoting alibi or other complete proof of innocence, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, [supra </em>at 22 n.9], but rather comprehends all evidence \u2018which tends to \u201cnegate the guilt of the accused\u201d ... or, stated affirmatively, \u201csupporting the innocence of the defendant.\u201d \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pisa, </em>372 Mass. 590, 595, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 869 (1977).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Germain, </em>381 Mass. 256, 261 n.6 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Where, as here, the defendant specifically requested the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>evidence that was not disclosed,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201ca standard of prejudice more favorable to the defendant is justified.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, supra </em>at 407. In such circumstances, \u201ca defendant need only demonstrate that a substantial basis exists for claiming prejudice from the nondisclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412. However, despite this more favorable standard, the burden of establishing the requisite \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for a claim of prejudice rests with the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schand, supra </em>at 788 n.l; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, supra </em>at 404 n.2, and cases cited. In cases involving a specific request for evidence, we look to the record to determine \u201cwhether we can be confident that, even if the prosecution had supplied the report to the defendant!] in timely fashion, the report or available evidence disclosed by it would not have influenced the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 729 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The defendant argues that the postmortem report and note showed that the pathologist searched for, and could not find, signs of recent sexual activity involving the victim. The defendant posits that this evidence was crucial because it would have undermined the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that the murder was the product of a homosexual encounter gone awry. He also contends that the fact that the police instructed the pathologist to conduct a microscopic search for signs of homosexual activity shows that the police were biased, and had \u201crush[ed] to judgment,\u201d and that he could have used this evidence to cast doubt on the integrity of the investigation. We are unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s characterization of how this evidence would potentially have affected the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The defendant overstates the factual import of the postmortem report and note when he argues that they would have contradicted the theory that the murder was connected with some form of sexual encounter. The absence of spermatozoa in the victim\u2019s rectum or mouth means only that any sexual activity that occurred had not resulted in ejaculation in or around those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>specific areas.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, the absence of any \u201cmarks\u201d or \u201cabnormal findings\u201d on the victim\u2019s genitals and rectum means only that any sexual activity that occurred had not been sufficiently forceful or forcible to have inflicted visible injury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is a wide range of sexual activity, up to and including many forms of sexual assault, that leaves neither sperm nor signs of injury to sexual organs. The Commonwealth presented no evidence, and did not make any suggestion to the jury, concerning precisely what forms of sexual activity may have taken place, or at what point in that sexual activity the encounter had turned violent, and no such precision with respect to the nature of the posited sexual encounter was even remotely necessary to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Thus, that Dr. Wakefield\u2019s examination had arguably eliminated a few specific types of sexual activity did not, in any sense, undermine the evidence suggesting that the stabbing had occurred during the course of some form of sexual encounter. We agree with the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that the postmortem report and note \u201cwould not have provided any more material information or raised any more doubts about the sexual nature of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Moreover, the theory that the murder had occurred during a sexual encounter was of significance to the case in only a narrow, limited sense. The Commonwealth did not even reference this theory in closing argument, except to counter one point raised during defense counsel\u2019s closing argument. In his closing argument, defense counsel had argued to the jury that, given the number of stab wounds and the extremely bloody crime scene, the perpetrator\u2019s clothes would have had extensive bloodstains. By comparison, although blood of the victim\u2019s type was found on the defendant\u2019s shirt, the amount was quite small. The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument responded to this defense argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>ment by pointing out the distinct possibility that the perpetrator had no clothes on at the time of the stabbing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u201cThis man was stabbed seventeen times. Blood was going all over the place. Would it be logical, Ladies and Gentlemen, that the person who stabbed him could be covered with blood and would it necessarily follow, Ladies and Gentlemen, that that person be wearing any clothing? Now, you\u2019ve seen the photographs, Ladies and Gentlemen. The one I just showed you, what kind of activity do you think was going on in that bedroom? Ask yourselves that. Don\u2019t leave your common sense at home. Does it necessarily follow, Ladies and Gentlemen, that that person who was with [the victim] had any clothes on at all? Could you infer, Ladies and Gentlemen, that he washed the blood off and walked through the bedrooms and walked into the kitchen and washed that blood off? [The victim] was naked except for pants below his knees. Do you think you can infer that this person was necessarily clothed that was with him in that bedroom?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">As indicated above, the Commonwealth\u2019s theory did not rely on evidence of any specific form of sexual activity, nor did the Commonwealth suggest any motive for the stabbing of the victim. The only way in which the sexual nature of the encounter had any significance was to establish the reasonable possibility that the perpetrator may have been naked, so that the jury would not attach undue importance to the fact that the defendant\u2019s shirt was bloodstained in only one small area. The absence of sperm in the victim\u2019s mouth or rectum, and the absence of signs of physical injury to his genitals or rectum, would not have detracted from the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that the perpetrator may well have been unclothed at the time of the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The defendant correctly points out that there was extensive reference at trial to the defendant\u2019s homosexuality. However, that issue was raised by the defendant\u2019s own explanation as to why he had initially lied to the police about his whereabouts on the night of the murder and why he had asked his partner to concoct a false alibi. The defendant claimed that he had been reluctant to tell the police his true whereabouts because he had been at two \u201cgay\u201d bars. To illustrate the implausibility of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>proffered explanation, the Commonwealth introduced evidence that the defendant was openly homosexual, with no need or desire to conceal his sexual orientation. This evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s homosexuality had nothing to do with any theory how or why the murder had been committed, but was directed instead at the interpretation to be placed on what the Commonwealth had proffered as consciousness of guilt evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">As illustration of the minimal significance that the issue of the hypothesized sexual encounter played at trial, defense counsel\u2019s lengthy closing argument nowhere mentioned the fact that the Commonwealth had presented no physical evidence of any such sexual encounter. While the defendant now protests that he would have made great use of the postmortem report and note had he had them at trial, he ignores the fact that, on the evidence presented at trial, he could have but did not register <em>any </em>criticism of the lack of evidence on this issue. We agree that, in the absence of the postmortem report and note, defense counsel would reasonably have refrained from cross-examining Dr. Wakefield on the absence of such evidence (for fear of eliciting some unforeseen harmful evidence). However, once the evidence was closed, defense counsel could have vehemently \u2014 and safely \u2014 argued to the jury that the prosecution had not presented any physical evidence from the victim\u2019s body to corroborate that sexual activity had preceded the murder. The Commonwealth had not presented any evidence of seminal fluid or sperm on the victim, or any evidence of forcible penetration. If, as the defendant now contends, it was crucial to his defense that he cast doubt on the theory that there had been a sexual encounter, it is puzzling that he did nothing whatsoever to cast doubt on that theory with the evidence (or lack thereof) that was presented at trial. We are not confronted with a situation where an argument made at trial could have been made more forcefully if defense counsel had had the withheld evidence. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 410 (1992) (counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>argued at trial that police failure to produce photographs warranted inference favorable to defendant; actual frontal photograph, when later discovered, provided \u201cirrefutable demonstration on the same subject\u201d). Here, there was no such argument made at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The only difference between the argument that could have been made at trial and the argument that could have been made with the postmortem report and note was that the Commonwealth had looked for certain signs of sexual activity and not found those particular signs. If the absence of that particular evidence related to sexual activity had, in fact, been important to the defense, that absence would surely have been pointed out to the jury. Instead, the defendant\u2019s closing argument did not in any way contest the inference that the attack on the victim had occurred during the course of some unidentified form of sexual activity. What the defendant now proffers as the \u201cmore plausible theory\u201d to explain the condition of the victim\u2019s body \u2014 that he was \u201cset upon by looters,\u201d \u201ctied up simply to incapacitate and silence him,\u201d and that \u201che managed to wriggle free of his boots (possibly dislodging his pants) and was stabbed to prevent his getting away\u201d \u2014 is a theory that could have been, but was not, presented to the jury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">As to the defendant\u2019s contention that the postmortem report and - note would have helped him establish that the police investigation was biased, we reject the suggestion that mere examination and testing of the victim\u2019s body for signs of sexual activity somehow suggests police bias. From the condition of the victim at the crime scene \u2014 semi-naked, bound, pants pulled down, and genitals exposed \u2014 it would be reasonable for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>police to consider and investigate the possibility that the murder had some connection to sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Having reviewed the entire trial transcript, we are \u201cconfident that, even if the prosecution had supplied the report to the defendant!] in timely fashion, the report or available evidence disclosed by it would not have influenced the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 729 (1992). As such, we find no error in the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s third motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\"> The defendant\u2019s motion also alleged error in certain jury instructions and ineffective assistance of counsel.

The building had telephone service, but no electricity, and the building had been condemned. The victim had remained in his apartment with his dog to guard against looting, but the occupants of most other apartments had moved out. The victim\u2019s girl friend-had lived in the victim\u2019s apartment, but she was staying elsewhere in the wake of the fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\"> New counsel had been assigned to represent the defendant in connection with his third motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\"> The motion did not rely on (or make reference to) the results of the defendant\u2019s expert\u2019s forensic testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b698-6\"> The Commonwealth contends that this finding is clearly erroneous, and points to compelling evidence that it in fact turned over the postmortem report. The determination of what was provided to defense counsel was complicated by the fact that trial counsel\u2019s original file had been destroyed in a basement flood. For reasons that are unclear, neither side obtained the file from the attorney who had represented the defendant in his original appeal and first two motions for a new trial, which presumably would have contained a copy of trial counsel\u2019s entire file. In the absence of either counsel\u2019s files, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>motion judge had to make his determination based on the testimony of attorneys concerning what they had and had not seen or done during discovery and trial some twenty years earlier. We do not disturb the factual findings of the motion judge unless they are clearly erroneous, and we must defer to his assessment of witness credibility. Notwithstanding the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and argument concerning its production of the postmortem report, we must therefore accept the motion judge\u2019s contrary finding on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b699-14\"> Indeed, one of the reasons that the judge found the prosecutor\u2019s failure to produce the postmortem report was inadvertent was that the prosecutor would understandably make the same assumption, i.e., that having produced a report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>of the autopsy, the prosecutor would reasonably conclude that there was no need to review the file for another report on the same subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b701-6\"> The prosecutor\u2019s obligation to disclose alleged exculpatory evidence extends only to those things in his possession or subject to his control. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salvati, </em>420 Mass. 499, 502 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 734 (1992). The defendant did not establish, and the motion judge did not find, that the note was within the prosecutor\u2019s possession or control. However, had the postmortem report been turned over to defense counsel, it would have alerted him to the fact that oral and rectal swabs had been taken for further examination, and competent counsel would presumably have followed up on that information and thereby obtained the test results that are reflected in the note. Thus, although the Commonwealth\u2019s obligation to turn over documents did not extend to the note, the failure to produce the postmortem report effectively deprived the defendant of access to the note. We therefore also examine whether the note would qualify as exculpatory and material. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, supra </em>at 729 (court considers whether withheld report \u201cor available evidence disclosed by it\u201d would have influenced jury).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\"> The request for \u201creports of mental or physical examinations and of scientific tests\u201d qualifies as a \u201cspecific request\u201d for the postmortem report. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallarelli, </em>399 Mass. 17, 21-22 (1987) (pretrial agreement for production of \u201cscientific reports\u201d was \u201cspecific request\u201d covering laboratory report of test performed on defendant\u2019s knife).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\"> Four to five feet from the victim\u2019s body was a pair of undershorts stained with semen. As the court noted in response to the defendant\u2019s earlier argument that that semen-stained underwear should not have been admitted, that evidence was \u201cespecially relevant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Healy, 393 Mass. 367, 378 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\"> At the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Wakefield explained that his examination of the victim\u2019s rectum revealed \u201cno distention and ... no redness or tears,\u201d and that examination of the victim\u2019s genitalia uncovered \u201cno evidence that the penis was abraded or particularly red.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\"> Similarly, as part of its impeachment of the defendant\u2019s partner (who had given testimony favorable to the defendant), the Commonwealth introduced evidence of their long-standing intimate relationship for the purpose of demonstrating bias.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\"> It was presumably not presented for the simple reason that the theory did not comport with other evidence. Aside from the implausibility of the notion that \u201cwriggl[ing] free\u201d of his boots would cause the victim\u2019s pants to fall to his knees, the suggestion that the crime was perpetrated by \u201clooters\u201d was contradicted by the evidence of no forced entry, no sign of any rummaging through the victim\u2019s belongings, and no missing property. It is also difficult to understand why \u201clooters\u201d would bypass numerous empty apartments and seek to loot the one apartment that was occupied by a man and his Doberman pinscher. The contents of the postmortem report would not have helped the defendant overcome the numerous shortcomings of the now proffered theoiy that \u201clooters\u201d stabbed the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
