Reese was a sexually dangerous person as defined in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. The judge based his finding of no probable cause on subsidiary findings that the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert that Reese (1) was a pedophile; (2) suffered from a \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d; and (3) was likely to commit additional sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility, was not credible. Therefore, he concluded that the Commonwealth had not met its burden of establishing that \u201ca reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt to be a sexually dangerous person based on . . . credible evidence.\u201d We conclude that the judge misapplied the applicable standard of proof to the evidence adduced at the probable cause proceeding, relied on hearsay evidence improperly admitted in evidence over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, and misinterpreted the requirement that the defendant be \u201clikely\u201d to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility. Consequently, we vacate the judge\u2019s finding of no probable cause and remand the matter to the Superior Court for a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>On June 24, 1998, Reese pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child and one count of assault with intent to rape a child. The gravamen of these offenses was a series of sexual assaults on an eight year old boy and a ten year old girl occurring during the six-week period from June 15, 1997, to July 31, 1997, while Reese lived in the home of one of the victims and babysat for the other. Reese was approximately thirty years old at the time of the offenses and had been homeless prior to being invited to live with the family of the male victim. He was arrested on August 1, 1997, and remained incarcerated until his plea of guilty. He was sentenced to a total of four years in a house of correction to be followed by five years of probation, with special conditions including sex offender treatment, alcohol and drug treatment for an apparently life-long substance abuse problem, and no contact with either the victim or other minors under the age of sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>On February 14, 2001, while Reese was serving his sentence, the Commonwealth filed a petition in the Superior Court that Reese be civilly committed as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commonwealth secured Reese\u2019s temporary detention pending a probable cause hearing, which was held on March 26 and 28, 2001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 5, 2001, the hearing judge found no probable cause to believe that Reese was a sexually dangerous person as defined in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. Because Reese had completed his term of imprisonment as of that date, and was being held in custody solely on the basis of the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for civil commitment, the judge ordered Reese\u2019s immediate release from custody, subject to the terms of his conditional probation. The release order was not stayed and the Commonwealth appealed. We granted its application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">2. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">a. <em>The probable cause standard. </em>Following a petition by the Commonwealth to commit a person as sexually dangerous pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>a judge is required to hold a hearing to determine whether \u201cprobable cause exists to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually dangerous person.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(c). </em>At the \u00a7 12 <em>(c) </em>hearing, the subject of the petition has the right to be represented by counsel, to present evidence, and to cross-examine the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(d). </em>If probable cause is found, the person is committed to the treatment center for sixty days during which time he is to be examined by two \u201cqualified examiners,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who must file with the court a written report of their examination, diagnosis, and recommendation no later than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>fifteen days prior to the expiration of the sixty-day period. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a). </em>Following the filing of this report, the district attorney has fourteen days within which to petition the court for a trial on the question whether the person is sexually dangerous. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a). </em>If a petition for trial is filed, the trial must be held within sixty days, absent a continuance for good cause or in the interests of justice. <em>Id. </em>The reports of the qualified examiners are admissible at trial. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The first question we address is the standard to be applied by the judge to the evidence at the \u00a7 12 (c) hearing. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 510 (2000), we noted that \u201c[t]he \u00a7 12 (c) . . . hearing is more like [a] bind-over hearing, with its formal requirements and adversary nature\u201d than an ex parte grand jury proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, we concluded that the \u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard appropriate to a bind-over hearing was \u201cappropriate to this type of proceeding,\u201d not the \u201cprobable cause to arrest\u201d standard applicable to a grand jury proceeding. <em>Id. </em>The \u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard used in a bind-over hearing, as articulated in <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 850 (1973), is \u201cwhether there is enough credible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>evidence to send the case to the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhat this unavoidably entails for the hearing judge is that she make some assessment of the credibility of the evidence that is presented when making the determination as to whether sufficient evidence has been presented to warrant further proceedings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blanchette, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 165, 173 (2002). This, however, \u201cis an exercise requiring a very deft touch and considerable restraint on the part of the judge,\u201d <em>id., </em>recognizing that credibility determinations are to be left to the ultimate trier of fact except in cases \u201cin which a witness\u2019s testimony is so \"weak or contradicted by sufficiently clear facts that the judge should have the power to dismiss the case.\u201d <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 853 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">While the bind-over hearing may be the analogue to the \u00a7 12 <em>(c) </em>hearing, it is not its twin. Although they share a similar primary function, to screen out nonmeritorious criminal cases and petitions for commitment, the consequences of a probable cause finding in each context are different. If probable cause is found in a bind-over hearing, the criminal charges proceed to trial and the individual is held for trial on terms of release or in lieu of bail. If probable cause is found in a \u00a7 12 <em>(c) </em>hearing, the individual is transferred from his place of incarceration to the treatment center for expert examination and evaluation. Depending on the outcome of that examination, the district attorney may or may not petition the court for a trial on the merits, but must do so within fourteen days of the filing of the examination report with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Perhaps the most important difference between the bind-over and \u00a7 12 <em>(c) </em>proceedings is the quality of the evidence available to the judge. Unlike at a bind-over hearing, where the Commonwealth is presumably in a position to present at least its most important evidence of guilt (evidence that it will again present at the criminal trial), the necessary and critical expert evidence of sexual dangerousness that will be offered at a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>on a petition for commitment under G. L. c. 123A is largely unavailable at the time of the \u00a7 12 (c) hearing. That evidence will be the product of the \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>examination that occurs only after a finding of probable cause is made at the \u00a7 12 <em>(c) </em>hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, the hearing judge, in assessing the credibility of expert witnesses who will not yet have access to the most important sources of information in the case at the time they are called to testify, must act with even more restraint than a judge assessing the credibility of Commonwealth witnesses in the context of a bind-over hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Considering the function of the \u00a7 12 <em>(c) </em>hearing and the constraints on the evidence that will be available at the time it is to occur, as well as the substantial public safety and liberty interests at stake, we approve the formulation adopted by the Appeals Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blanchette, supra </em>at 175, regarding the implementation of the \u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard in the context of the \u00a7 12 <em>(c) </em>hearing. Specifically, the decision-making process ought to consist of a two-part inquiry, one quantitative and the other qualitative. \u201cThe judge must be satisfied, first, that the Commonwealth\u2019s admissible evidence, if believed, satisfie[s] all of the elements of proof necessary to prove the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Second, she must be satisfied that the evidence on each of the elements is not so incredible, insubstantial, or otherwise of such a quality that no reasonable person could rely on it to conclude that the Commonwealth had met its burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In conducting the second part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>this assessment, the judge is to determine whether the evidence presented is of suitable quality to allow the action to proceed further along a course that was legislatively designed next to include a full expert examination of the subject. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Applying this standard to the judge\u2019s findings in this case requires vacating his finding of no probable cause. For example, the judge found the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, Dr. William B. Land (whose credentials as an expert witness were not challenged by the defendant), that Reese suffered from the mental abnormality of pedophilia, not to be credible because the evidence on which that opinion relied did not meet one of the \u201cfeatures\u201d of the diagnosis set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (rev. 4th ed. 2000), by the American Psychiatric Association (commonly referred to as DSM-IV).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the judge concluded that because one of the diagnostic criteria of pedophilia set forth in the DSM-IV is, inter alia, sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activities with a prepubescent child <em>over a period of at least six months', </em>and because the expert only had evidence of such sexual activity occurring during the six-week period before Reese was arrested, the diagnosis of pedophilia was \u201cso incredible that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the judge rejected Dr. Land\u2019s explanation that the DSM-IV is only a diagnostic tool that does not always completely and accurately describe every clinical situation encountered in the field, and is to be used in conjunction with the expert\u2019s clinical experience with similar patients and behaviors. He also rejected Dr. Land\u2019s opinion that six weeks of the admitted sexual misbehavior, when combined with the presence of other criteria indicative of pedophilia, was an adequate basis from which a diagnosis of pedophilia could be made.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In ruling that the expert\u2019s testimony was \u201cincredible,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>judge couched his findings in terms of any reasonable fact finder, that is, he concluded that \u201cno reasonable factfinder could accept [Dr. Land\u2019s diagnosis that Reese was a pedophile].\u201d It is, however, apparent from the record that the ruling is an expression of the judge\u2019s personal conclusion regarding the expert\u2019s credibility, based on his own opinion of the proper application of the DSM-IY, and the significance of the differences between Dr. Land\u2019s testimony and the DSM-IV text. This was error. The testimony of the expert is not \u201cso incredible, insubstantial, or otherwise of such a quality that no reasonable person could rely on it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blanchette, supra </em>at 175.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">b. <em>Likelihood of committing additional sexual offenses. </em>In addition to finding that the Commonwealth had failed to satisfy its burden of establishing probable cause to believe that Reese suffered from either a mental abnormality or a personality disorder, the judge also concluded that it had not adequately established that Reese was \u201clikely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility.\u201d The judge based this conclusion both on his assessment of the credibility of Dr. Land\u2019s testimony that Reese would \u201clikely\u201d commit such an offense, and on his legal conclusion that \u201clikely to engage in sexual offenses\u201d means that \u201cthere is a substantial likelihood, at least more likely than not, that the respondent will commit a new sexual offense within the immediate future, understood generally to be within the next five years but with a longer time horizon if the anticipated harm is extremely serious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The judge\u2019s rejection of Dr. Land\u2019s testimony that Reese was likely to commit sexual offenses, and his formulation of the meaning of the statutory requirement that a person be \u201clikely to engage in sexual offenses,\u201d were, in turn, based largely on his conclusion that articles authored by Dr. R. Karl Hanson on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>sexual recidivism and studies of sexual recidivism were more reliable than Dr. Land\u2019s testimony and more legally authoritative. These articles were offered in evidence by Reese\u2019s counsel at the judge\u2019s urging during the \u00a7'\" 12 (c) hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Their admission was objected to by the Commonwealth and was error. The articles were never established as reliable or authoritative, contain nothing but inadmissible hearsay, and do not satisfy any of the exceptions to the hearsay rale. They do not fall within the \u201clearned treatises\u201d exception as set forth in Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 803 (18), because that rale only allows statements in treatises or periodicals that have been established as reliable authorities to be read in evidence on cross-examination of an expert, and does not permit their admission as exhibits. <em>Brusard </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>429 Mass. 597, 601 (1999). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass. 387, 395-396 (1992). Similarly, the articles are not admissible as \u201clearned treatises\u201d under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C, which only provides for the admission of treatises or periodicals \u201cin actions of contract or tort for malpractice, error or mistake against physicians, surgeons, dentists, optometrists, hospitals and sanitaria,\u201d where the author of the treatise is established as an expert on the subject. Finally, they are not admissible under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (c), which authorizes the admission in evidence at the commitment, <em>trial </em>\u201cany other evidence tending to show that such person is or is not a sexually dangerous person.\u201d This exception by its terms applies only to the admissibility of evidence at trial, and authorizes the admission only of evidence that is independently admissible under the rales of evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>376 Mass. 632, 638 (1978), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bladsa, </em>362 Mass. 539, 541 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Finally, as to the meaning of the term \u201clikely,\u201d the judge did not have the benefit of our recent decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, ante </em>274 (2002), interpreting that term as it is used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>G. L. c. 123A. The meaning that we have ascribed to it does not include the requirement that the Commonwealth prove that the respondent is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to commit additional sexual offenses if not confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">3. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the finding of no probable cause and remand the case for a new probable cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\"> In relevant part, a sexually dangerous person is defined in G.
