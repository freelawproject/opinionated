L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H, 111 (act).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that economic coercion alone may constitute \u201cthreats, intimidation or coercion\u201d in violation of the act, but that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate such actionable coercion in this case. We affirm the Superior Court\u2019s judgments and orders with regard to all matters appealed from by the plaintiffs and by one defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The plaintiffs and one defendant, Goffe, Inc. (Goffe), appeal from judgments and orders entered by a Superior Court judge. The plaintiffs, a trustee and two beneficial owners of a real estate trust, filed an amended complaint alleging that the defendants Goffe; Duffy Brothers Management Co., Inc.; and Norman J. Duffy, Robert L. Duffy, and Kevin Duffy (Duffys) violated the act (Count II) and G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11 (Count III), and intentionally interfered with their contractual and advantageous relations with the defendant George W. Moore, Inc. (Moore) (Counts VII and VIII), all in connection with a real estate dispute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Goffe counterclaimed that the plaintiffs committed a breach of a settlement stipulation entered into with Goffe in certain bankruptcy proceedings and that the plaintiffs\u2019 reneging on the agreement was an unfair or deceptive business practice in violation of G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">On April 27, 2000, after conducting an eight-day jury-waived trial on the issues of liability, a Superior Court judge issued a lengthy memorandum that made extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered an order for judgment for the defendants on all four of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>filed a motion for reconsideration on, among other things, the ground that two decisions issued after the judge\u2019s order, <em>Brunelle </em>v. <em>Lynn Pub. Schs., </em>433 Mass. 179 (2001), and <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>433 Mass. 1 (2000), demonstrated error in certain of the judge\u2019s key conclusions of law. On July 24, 2001, the judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 reconsideration motion and allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on both counts of Goffe\u2019s counterclaim. On October 9, 2001, the judge entered partial final judgments on both the plaintiffs\u2019 claims described above and Goffe\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In addition to appealing from both the April, 2000, and the October, 2001, judgments, the plaintiffs appeal from the judge\u2019s pretrial discovery order denying their motion to compel, the order denying two motions to make additional findings of fact and amend the judgment, and the order denying the plaintiffs\u2019 reconsideration motion. Goffe appeals from the adverse summary judgment ruling. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">2. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the judge\u2019s findings of fact, supplementing these findings with undisputed material of record where necessary. We reserve some details for later discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">(a) <em>The parties and the properties. </em>Beginning in 1973, the defendants began to acquire property on Waverly Oaks Road in Waltham, and by 1996, they had purchased enough land to build a retail shopping center, to be located at 313 Waverly Oaks Road. One of the pieces of the Duffys\u2019 Waverly Oaks Road land abutted the plaintiffs\u2019 property, located at 110 Beaver Street.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 property contained two buildings that the plaintiffs sought to develop as commercial rental property.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Before the Duffys could begin developing the shopping center, which was on land designated as a wetlands site, they were required to obtain an \u201corder of conditions\u201d (essentially a permit) from the conservation commission of the city of Waltham (commission). See G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40. As part of this permitting process, the Dufiys were statutorily required to notify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>all abutters, including the plaintiff Jeffrey Buster about the proposed work. Buster attended all four hearings the commission held to consider the Duffys\u2019 development proposals. At the hearings, Buster objected to the proposed development because, he asserted, the project would adversely affect the flood storage capacity of the Duffys\u2019 Waverly Oaks Road property and subsequently the trust\u2019s property. The judge found that Buster \u201cdevoted a considerable amount of time, effort, and money to persuade the [commission] to deny the [o]rder of [conditions.\u201d However, after conducting two site visits and hearing testimony from its own consultant, the commission voted unanimously to issue the order of conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Buster appealed from the commission\u2019s order of conditions to the Department of Environmental Protection (department). The department accepted the appeal and sent a letter to the Duffys ordering them not to commence their project until a superseding order of conditions had issued and all relevant appeals periods had lapsed. See G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40. The judge found, and the parties do not dispute, that the department appeals process would have taken approximately two to three years to complete.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Buster also filed a complaint in the Superior Court requesting that the order of conditions be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">(b) <em>Goffe\u2019s purchase of the promissory note and mortgage. </em>The Duffys were convinced that Buster\u2019s appeal was frivolous and an attempt at \u201ceconomic blackmail,\u201d although Buster insisted otherwise. At about the time that Buster filed the appeal with the department and the lawsuit, the Duffys received information that the plaintiffs\u2019 110 Beaver Street property was \u201cin trouble.\u201d They learned that Moore held a promissory note from Buster, as trustee of the 110 Beaver Street Trust, secured by a mortgage on the property at 110 Beaver Street, that Buster was in default of the note and his mortgage payments under the note, and that there were actual or potential tax, zoning, and environmental problems with the property. The Duffys, through the Duffy-held entity Goffe, purchased the note and mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>from Moore in November, 1996.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge found that, while \u201cadmittedly a close question,\u201d the Duffys\u2019 primary purpose in acquiring the note and mortgage was to \u201cinduce\u201d Buster to withdraw his appeal and his lawsuit. The judge also found, however, that the Duffys recognized that purchasing the mortgage was, in and of itself, a \u201csound business\u201d move.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In the judge\u2019s words, Buster \u201cimmediately recognized\u201d that the Duffys\u2019 acquisition of the note and mortgage \u201cwas not good news.\u201d After learning of the transaction, the plaintiffs requested a meeting with the Duffys to discuss the status of the property. At the meeting, the plaintiffs asked the Duffys for financing, and Buster initiated discussion about the appeal, proposing that the Duffys pay for a dam on Federal property across the street from 313 Waverly Oaks Road as a way to resolve his flood storage concerns. The Duffys told Buster that, although they did not own this property, they would look into the idea of a dam. They also requested that the plaintiffs put together a business plan detailing their plans to cure the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">At a subsequent meeting, however, the plaintiffs, represented by Buster and McGinty, put forward no such plan. When it became clear to the Duffys that Buster did not intend to offer a settlement proposal, the Duffys presented Buster and McGinty with two options. Under the \u201cbuy-out\u201d option, Buster would execute a deed transferring the property to the Duffys and would withdraw both the appeal to the department and the Superior Court action. In return, the Duffys would pay Buster and the trust $100,000 in three instalments, with the last payment of $50,000 due \u201csix months after the foreclosure if there were no further challenges to the Duffys\u2019 plans for the shopping center development.\u201d Under the \u201cforbearance\u201d option, Buster would keep the property, sign a forbearance agreement, enter in a payment plan crafted by the Duffys, and withdraw the department appeal and the Superior Court action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Buster and McGinty rejected both options. The Duffys decided to pursue foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>(c) <em>Foreclosure, bankruptcy, and inspection. </em>The initial foreclosure sale was scheduled for February 7, 1997.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, on or just before that date, the plaintiffs filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts, thereby triggering an automatic stay of the foreclosure auction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Goffe subsequently filed a motion in the Bankruptcy Court to lift the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">While Goffe\u2019s motion was pending before the Bankruptcy Court, the Duffys met with the mayor of Waltham to persuade the city to inspect the 110 Beaver Street property for fire and safety violations, a request they had made in vain at least three months earlier to the city\u2019s deputy fire chief. In the wake of the meeting with the mayor, an inspection took place that revealed many serious fire and safety violations on the property and the fact that the property had been \u201cbuil[t] out\u201d and leased to tenants without the proper building permits and certificates of occupancy. On June 24, 1997, the city\u2019s building commissioner issued a cease and desist order, ordering Buster to stop all construction work and to cease and desist all occupancies at 110 Beaver Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">On July 23, 1997, one day before the scheduled hearing on Goffe\u2019s motion for relief from the stay, the 110 Beaver Street Partnership and Goffe filed a handwritten settlement stipulation in the Bankruptcy Court. In the stipulation, as the Superior Court judge found, Goffe agreed inter alia \u201cto reduce its claim on the outstanding [njote, extend the plaintiffs\u2019 payment schedule, and forbear from foreclosure in return for the plaintiffs\u2019 dismissal of all litigation and administrative proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>ings, and execution of a release of all pending claims.\u201d Soon after entering in the stipulation on behalf of the plaintiffs, however, Buster sought to repudiate it. On August 25, 1997, a Bankruptcy Court judge approved the stipulation over Buster\u2019s objections, subsequently finding that, \u201cMr. Buster knowingly and voluntarily entered into the [stipulation upon the advice of competent counsel and is now estopped from objecting to the [stipulation.\u201d On October 8, 1997, the Bankruptcy Court judge allowed Goffe\u2019s motion for relief from the stay. Against this background, we turn to the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">3. <em>Review of findings of fact. </em>During eight days of trial, the judge heard often sharply conflicting testimony from ten witnesses and reviewed more than 175 exhibits. His thorough consideration of the evidence is reflected in almost thirty pages of findings of fact. The plaintiffs dispute several of these findings as \u201cerroneous.\u201d Because the plaintiffs\u2019 challenges, if successful, might also invalidate the judge\u2019s conclusions of law, we review the findings as an initial matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We review the findings for clear error. Our review \u201cis circumscribed by the deference [we] must give to decisions of the trier of fact, who is usually in a superior position to appraise and weigh the evidence.\u201d <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Fordham, </em>420 Mass. 178, 186 (1995), quoting <em>First Pa. Mtge. Trust </em>v. <em>Dorchester Sav. Bank, </em>395 Mass. 614, 621 (1985). We recognize that \u201c[t]he judge\u2019s advantage in weighing the testimony is particularly evident in a case involving conflicting testimony, \u2018one in which widely differing inferences could be drawn from the evidence,\u2019 and the drawing of inferences cannot be separated from the evaluation of the testimony itself.\u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 509-510 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>428 Mass. 543 (1998), quoting <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>322 Mass. 247, 248 (1948). \u201c[W]e shall not \u2018review questions of fact found by the trial judge, where such findings are supported \u201con any reasonable view of the evidence, including all rational inferences of which it was susceptible.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep't of Mental Retardation (No.l), </em>424 Mass. 430, 452 (1997), quoting <em>First Pa. Mtge. Trust </em>v. <em>Dorchester Sav. Bank, supra </em>at 624. \u201cThe inquiry is not whether we would have reached the same result as the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>but rather whether, on the entire evidence, we are \u2018left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Source One Assocs., </em>436 Mass. 118, 124 (2002), quoting <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Fordham, supra </em>at 186. \u201cThe burden of proof rests on the appellant to show ... an error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Source One Assocs., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The plaintiffs contend that the judge was wrong to find that \u201cBuster and the Partnership were hopelessly in default, and there was no serious prospect that they could either remedy their default or cease further events of default.\u201d This finding was amply supported by evidence that, at the time Goffe purchased the note and mortgage from Moore, the plaintiffs were in default of payments under the note, they had not paid real estate taxes on the property for approximately two years, there was a suit pending regarding alleged zoning violations on the property that had caused the city to refuse to issue building permits, and the property required environmental remediation work. The plaintiffs\u2019 testimony that they had plans to work themselves out of their fiscal dilemma by increasing the revenue from their properties does not undercut the judge\u2019s finding, particularly where the evidence showed that the plaintiffs\u2019 plans were predicated on such contingencies as Moore\u2019s continued tolerance of the plaintiffs\u2019 nonpayment of the mortgage and increased occupancy of the building in violation of existing codes.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The plaintiffs also argue that the judge viewed the defendants\u2019 evidence with insufficient \u201cskepticism,\u201d and that, on the basis of his discounting some portions of the Duffys\u2019 testimony, the judge should have drawn the conclusion that the defendants \u201clied and lied repeatedly\u201d about everything.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>\u201cOrdinarily, \u2018we will . . . not disturb the findings of a judge who saw and heard the witnesses, who was free to make credibility determinations and to accept all, some, or none of then-testimony, unless there is a showing of clear error in those findings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mock, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 276, 278 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, 52 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 486, 491 (2001). See <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Ingalls, </em>271 Mass. 121, 127 (1930) (\u201cIt is . . . well settled that testimony may be believed in part and disbelieved as to other parts\u201d). The judge was free to credit and discredit portions of each party\u2019s testimony. We have carefully read the extensive evidentiary record in this case and conclude that the judge\u2019s credibility determinations are amply supported and consistent. We next turn to the plaintiffs\u2019 challenges to the judge\u2019s legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">4. <em>The act. </em>To establish a claim under the act, the plaintiffs \u201cmust prove that (1) [their] exercise of enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution or the laws of either the United States or the Commonwealth, (2) have been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with, and (3) that the interference or attempted interference was by \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of W. Boylston, </em>419 Mass. 548, 564, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 931 (1995), quoting <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ. </em>403 Mass. 713, 717 (1989).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As the judge aptly noted, \u201c[t]he crux of this case focuses on the third element \u2014 whether the defendants\u2019 conduct constituted \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion\u2019 under the [act].\u201d The plaintiffs claim that the judge erred in ruling both that actual or prospective economic harm alone can never form the kind of \u201cthreats, intimidation, or coercion\u201d actionable under the act, and that, even if such conduct were actionable under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>statute, the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence was insufficient to support such a claim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We consider each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Assessing the scope of the act is a question of statutory construction. Our \u201cprimary function in interpreting the [act] is to ascertain the \u2018intent of the Legislature, as evidenced by the language used, and considering the purposes and remedies intended to be advanced.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., supra </em>at 718, quoting <em>Deas </em>v. <em>Dempsey, </em>403 Mass. 468, 470 (1988). Because the act, \u201clike other civil rights statutes, is remedial,\u201d it is \u201centitled to a liberal construction of its terms.\u201d <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., </em>393 Mass. 819, 822 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The act is a product of that time in our nation\u2019s recent history when State and private actors often brought formidable, sometimes violent, pressure to bear against racial minorities seeking to exercise equal rights under the law. The Legislature enacted the statute \u201cto provide a remedy for victims of racial harassment,\u201d <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., supra, </em>quoting <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Chasdi, </em>400 Mass. 686, 694 (1987), and to redress \u201cthe derogation of secured rights [that] occurs by threats, intimidation or coercion.\u201d <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., supra. </em>See <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., supra </em>at 821 (\u201cThe Legislature passed this statute to respond to a need for civil rights protection under State law\u201d). Although the act reaches private actors, <em>id. </em>at 821-822, it was not intended to create, nor may it be construed to establish, a \u201cvast constitutional tort.\u201d <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Mazza, </em>394 Mass. 176, 182 (1985). See <em>Bally </em>v. <em>North</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>eastern Univ., supra </em>at 718. The Legislature \u201cexplicitly limited the [act\u2019s] remedy to situations where the derogation of secured rights occurs by threats, intimidation or coercion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Legislature intended that even a direct deprivation of a plaintiff\u2019s secured rights would not be actionable under the act unless it were accomplished by means of one of these three constraining elements. See, e.g., <em>Swanset Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>423 Mass. 390, 396 (1996), quoting <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of W Boylston, </em>419 Mass. 548, 565 (1995) (\u201ca direct deprivation of rights, even if unlawful, is not coercive because it is not an attempt to force someone to do something the person is not lawfully required to do\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The act does not define actionable \u201ccoercion.\u201d However, we have had previous occasion to consider this term as used in the act. We have held that actionable coercion is \u201cthe application to another of such force, either physical or <em>moral, </em>as to constrain him to do against his will something he would not otherwise have done\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>417 Mass. 467, 474, cert. denied, 515 U.S. 868 (1994), quoting <em>Deas </em>v. <em>Dempsey, supra </em>at 417. It is \u201cthe active domination of another\u2019s will.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, supra, </em>quoting <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Wareham, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 409 (1989). Thus, we have recognized that coercion may take various forms, and we have not limited its scope to actual or attempted physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>cal force. See <em>Swanset Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Taunton, supra </em>at 396 n.11 (assuming \u201cwithout deciding the point that coercion which does not involve physical force might violate the [a]ct\u201d); <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of W. Boylston, supra </em>at 566 n. 18; <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, supra </em>at 474. For example, we have suggested that coercion may be found where one party deprives another of rights due under a contract, see <em>Redgrave </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., </em>399 Mass. 93 (1987), or makes it impossible, due to sexual harassment, for another to continue her employment, <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Chasdi, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The history of the struggle for civil rights that prompted passage of the Massachusetts act, see <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., supra </em>at 821, shows all too clearly that economic pressure may be deployed in any number of commercial settings in the absence of actual or threatened physical force to coerce individuals to forgo the exercise of their secured rights. See, e.g., <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Stechel, </em>510 F.2d 1162, 1164 (9th Cir. 1975) (section of Federal statute making it unlawful to \u201ccoerce, intimidate, threaten or interfere\u201d was applicable where employer allegedly fired employees for renting apartments to members of minority groups); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beaty, </em>288 F.2d 653, 656 (6th Cir. 1961) (threats to evict tenants-sharecroppers and to refuse to deal with them in good faith if they exercised their right to vote would constitute coercion); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>738 F. Supp. 604, 605 (D. Mass. 1990) (bartender\u2019s alleged use of racial slur directed at patron sufficient to state claim under act). Had the Legislature wished to confine the remedial reach of \u00a7 111 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>actual or threatened physical acts, it knew how to do so. Compare G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H and 111 (civil violation to use \u201cthreat, intimidation or coercion\u201d to interfere with secured rights) with G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 37 (criminal violation to use \u201cforce or threat of force\u201d to interfere with secured rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">We conclude, then, that in certain circumstances, economic coercion, standing alone, may be actionable under the act. However, we agree with the judge that the injuries claimed by the plaintiffs in <em>this </em>case go far beyond any that the Legislature reasonably could have intended the act to redress. Cf. <em>Redgrave </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., </em>399 Mass. 93, 99 (1987) (\u201ccases within the reason, although not within the letter, of a remedial statute are embraced by its provisions\u201d). The judge correctly reasoned that the defendants\u2019 conduct could not \u201cbe deemed \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion\u2019 under the [a]ct because the plaintiffs were not pressured to withdraw their appeals as a means of preventing the [njote and [mjortgage from being purchased or the foreclosure complaint from being filed.\u201d The defendants were lawfully entitled to foreclose and it made economic sense to do so. Although they were willing to \u201ctrade\u201d foreclosure for a deal involving Buster\u2019s voluntary dismissal of all appeals, the offer to negotiate on those terms could not be deemed \u201cthreats, intimidation or coercion\u201d where the proffered deal potentially put the plaintiffs in a better position than they would have been in relation to a more \u201cdisinterested\u201d holder of the mortgage. In the judge\u2019s words, \u201c[wjhen a debtor has \u2018one card left to play,\u2019 it is not a violation of the [ajct for the creditor to be willing to trade something to obtain that card. Nor, if the debtor is unwilling to make that trade, is it a violation of the [ajct for the creditor to pursue his legal rights.\u201d \u201cGenerally, by itself, a threat to use lawful means to reach an intended result is not actionable under \u00a7 111.\u201d <em>Sena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>417 Mass. 250, 263 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">We have found no violation of the act in cases analogous to this case, where a plaintiff\u2019s own conduct provided independent grounds for the defendant to terminate its bargained-for obligations to a plaintiff, thereby causing the plaintiff an economic loss. See, e.g., <em>Korb </em>v. <em>Raytheon Corp., </em>410 Mass. 581, 585 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>(1991) (\u201cno improper interference with secured rights when an employer fires an at-will employee who has become ineffective\u201d by reason of his speaking out against his company\u2019s interest while he was employed as company spokesperson). See also <em>Willitts </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 202, 210 (1991) (\u201cno improper interference by the defendant with a secured right\u201d where school merely \u201cexercised its discretion under the terms of employment it chose to offer its teachers\u201d and declined to renew teacher\u2019s contract). Although we must await subsequent cases to determine more exactly the actionable bounds of economic coercion under the act, economic loss occasioned by a plaintiff\u2019s own conduct, such as when the plaintiff defaults on a note and mortgage, is beyond these bounds.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The judge did not err in entering judgment against the plaintiffs in their claim pursuant to the act. We turn to the plaintiffs\u2019 consumer protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">5. <em>G.L. c. 93A. </em>The plaintiffs rely on our holding in <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>433 Mass. 1 (2000), for the proposition that the Duffys engaged in unfair or deceptive business practices in violation of the consumer protection act, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, by purchasing the note and mortgage from Moore and foreclosing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>on the 110 Beaver Street property.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The plaintiffs also argue that the Duffys violated G. L. c. 93A by instigating the mayor of Waltham to order an inspection of the 110 Beaver Street property without disclosing their motives for the request. We agree with the judge that, the <em>Kattar </em>case notwithstanding, the plaintiffs\u2019 c. 93A claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demoulas, supra, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he relief available under c. 93A is sui generis. It is neither wholly tortious nor wholly contractual in nature, and is not subject to the traditional limitations of preexisting causes of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, quoting <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 693 (1975). \u201cLegality of [the] underlying conduct is not necessarily a defense to a claim under c. 93A.\u201d <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demoulas, supra </em>at 13. The <em>Kattar </em>case involved a contract to forbear foreclosure that the defendants breached in retaliation for the refusal of one of the plaintiffs to testify on an unrelated matter. We held that the foreclosure action, lawful in itself, was not only circumscribed by the terms of the contract, but also was prohibited under c. 93A because it was undertaken for motives against public policy \u2014 as retribution for the refusal of a witness to testify. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Here, no contract to forbear foreclosure existed, much less a forbearance contract that was breached in bad faith. That the Duffys initially sought, acquired, and utilized a legitimate competitive advantage to weaken Buster\u2019s economic position does not lead to the conclusion that the Duffys acted unfairly or deceptively, particularly where, as we have seen, the plaintiffs\u2019 business vulnerabilities were so clearly the result of their own conduct. It has long been noted that the market is a rough and tumble place where a competitor\u2019s lack of courtesy, generosity, or respect is neither uncommon nor in itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>unlawful. See, e.g., <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>390 Mass. 604, 616 (1983); <em>Melo-Tone Vending, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sherry, Inc., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 315, 319 (1995) (\u201cFor competition and for the rough and tumble of the world of commerce, there is tolerance . . . even though the fallout of that rough and tumble is damage to one of the competitors\u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Nor do we conclude that the instigation of regulatory action against the 110 Beaver Street property implicates c. 93A. <em>Id. </em>The record fails to support the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the mayor would not have ordered 110 Beaver Street inspected if he had been made aware of the Duffys\u2019 intention to foreclose on the property. Cf. <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 777 (1980), quoting <em>Lowell Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>377 Mass. 37, 51 (1979) (conduct \u201cmay be \u2018deceptive\u2019 if it \u2018could reasonably be found to have caused a person to act differently from the way he otherwise would have acted\u2019 \u201d). There is no dispute that the 110 Beaver Street property was in violation of the fire and safety codes when the Duffys went to the mayor, or that the resulting inspections were proper or accurate.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As mortgagees of the property, the Duffys had an obvious, independent, and legitimate business interest in limiting their own liability. They chose a traditional means to do so \u2014 having city inspectors determine whether the mortgagor was complying with applicable safety codes. As the judge stated, \u201c[I]f it were a violation of [c.] 93A to solicit governmental action without disclosing all of one\u2019s reasons for doing so, the scope of [c.] 93A would be expanded exponentially.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demoulas, supra, </em>we stated that, whether an act is unfair or deceptive \u201cis best discerned \u2018from the circumstances of each case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCotis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>366 Mass. 234, 242 (1974). A judge\u2019s determination whether something is an unfair or deceptive practice is a finding of fact and must stand unless clearly erroneous. <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demoulas, supra </em>at 16. We conclude that the judge\u2019s dismissal of the c. 93A claim was fully supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">6. <em>Interference with contractual and advantageous relations. </em>The plaintiffs allege that, by purchasing the note and mortgage and by inducing Moore to initiate foreclosure, the Duffys intentionally interfered with the trust\u2019s contractual and advantageous relationship with Moore. They argue that Moore was contractually bound <em>not </em>to foreclose on the property because he was in breach of contractual obligations to remove certain inventory from the building and that Moore had, in essence, guaranteed the plaintiffs continued forbearance on foreclosure while the plaintiffs sought additional tenants. We affirm the entry of judgment for the defendants on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Claims of intentional interference with contractual or advantageous relations require a showing that the defendant knowingly and for an improper purpose or by improper means induced a party to breach a contract or not to enter into or continue a business relationship, resulting in damage. See <em>Swanset Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>423 Mass. 390, 397 (1996); <em>G.S. Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Falmouth Marine, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 262, 272 (1991); <em>Riseman </em>v. <em>Orion Research Inc., </em>394 Mass. 311, 314 (1985).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Neither tort is implicated here. First, Goffe\u2019s purchase of the note and mortgage did not, as the plaintiffs argue, interfere with any contract between Moore and the plaintiffs. If, as the plaintiffs claim, Moore was in breach of a contractual obligation to remove inventory from the property, the plaintiffs were free to pursue a breach of contract claim against him or to raise the alleged breach as a defense to a foreclosure action. Moore\u2019s alleged defalcations did not prevent him from filing to foreclose. Second, it is of no legal consequence that, as the plaintiffs claim, \u201cone of the ways plaintiffs\u2019 relationship with [Moore] was advantageous was that [Moore\u2019s] tolerance, for the time being, of plaintiffs\u2019 debts allowed plaintiffs to pursue their busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>ness plan.\u201d Moore\u2019s patience \u201cfor the time being\u201d created neither a contract nor a \u201ccontemplated\u201d contract between Moore and the plaintiffs, much less between any successor to Moore and the plaintiffs. Judgments on Counts VII and VIII were properly entered for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">7. <em>Discovery rulings. </em>Finally, the plaintiffs contend that the judge erred in denying their pretrial motions to compel production of twenty-one documents withheld on the basis of the attorney-client privilege or the work-product doctrine. The plaintiffs argue that the disputed documents were not protected by either privilege, or, alternatively, that the defendants waived any privileges with respect to these documents. Additionally, the plaintiffs argue that all of the documents were discoverable or at least should have been reviewed in camera pursuant to what the plaintiffs term \u201cthe crime-intentional tort exception\u201d to the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In general, discovery matters are committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. See, e.g., <em>Symmons </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keeffe, </em>419 Mass. 288, 302 (1995). We will uphold discovery rulings unless the appellant can demonstrate an abuse of discretion that resulted in prejudicial error. <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., </em>399 Mass. 790, 799 (1987). Under these principles, .and for reasons we detail below, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments with respect to the judge\u2019s discovery rulings are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The plaintiffs challenge the judge\u2019s rulings concerning three separate groups of documents: (1) documents authored by the Duffys\u2019 corporate counsel; (2) documents discussing wetlands issues; and (3) a letter between the Duffys\u2019 corporate and outside counsel. As to the first group, the plaintiffs argue that the documents were not privileged because they did not concern legal work. However, the judge relied on a detailed and item-by-item description of the documents in the Duffys\u2019 privilege log, as well as on an affidavit of the Duffys\u2019 in-house counsel, which provided further particularities with respect to the documents, to determine that they did concern legal work. Such reliance is within his broad discretion. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">As to the second group of documents, the judge correctly concluded that four of the six documents were prepared by party representatives (a surveyor and a consultant) and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>were not discoverable by reason of the work-product doctrine. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3), 365 Mass. 772 (1974). The plaintiffs argue, however, that any privilege pertaining to all six documents was waived because \u201cthe Duffys affirmatively placed their assessment of plaintiffs\u2019 flood storage objections at issue.\u201d They claim that it was unfair \u201c[t]o permit the Duffys to testify orally to their alleged analysis, without requiring them to produce documents that might have undercut this oral testimony . . . .\u201d We agree with the judge that the defendants\u2019 statement in the pretrial memorandum that they were confident they would prevail in the department appeal \u201chardly constitutes a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine.\u201d To abrogate the attorney-client privilege merely because of a litigant\u2019s invocation of a legal position or theory in a pleading \u201cwould pry open the attorney-client relationship and strike at the very core of the privilege.\u201d <em>Darius </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>433 Mass. 274, 280 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">As to the third \u201cgroup\u201d of documents, a letter between the Duffys\u2019 corporate and outside counsel listed on the defendants\u2019 privilege log as \u201cLetter with handwritten notes re: City of Waltham Violations,\u201d the plaintiffs argue that the letter was not privileged because it did not pertain to a matter about which outside counsel represented the defendants. We see no reason to disturb the judge\u2019s finding that the subject of the letter plausibly related to the foreclosure sale, a matter about which the outside firm represented the defendants, rather than the purchase of the note and mortgage only, a matter about which the outside firm did not represent the defendants. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Finally, we conclude that there is no merit to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that all twenty-one of the disputed documents fall within what they term the \u201ccrime-intentional tort exception\u201d to the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine. The flaw in the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that the judge found that the Duffys\u2019 actions were motivated by sound business purposes, and thus were neither criminal nor \u201cintentionally tortious\u201d in nature. See part 4, <em>supra. </em>Thus, even under the unduly expansive interpretation of the crime-fraud exception urged on us by the plaintiffs, the documents would remain privileged. Cf. <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Investigation, </em>437 Mass. 340, 357, 361 (2002) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>(\u201cthe crime-fraud exception is a narrow one\u201d and \u201c[w]ithout evidence of a crime or fraud, the crime-fraud exception is inapplicable\u201d); <em>Purcell </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>424 Mass. 109, 113 (1997) (\u201cThe applicability of the exception, like the existence of the privilege, is a question of fact for the judge\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">8. <em>Goffe\u2019s counterclaim. </em>In the Superior Court action, Goffe\u2019s counterclaim alleged that the plaintiffs breached a contract and violated G. L. c. 93A by repudiating a settlement stipulation entered in the Bankruptcy Court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See Part 2 (c), <em>supra. </em>Goffe sought an order enjoining the plaintiffs from maintaining any of the claims covered by the stipulation and awarding it money damages, including attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Among his reasons for allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim, the judge stated that \u201cequity\u201d prohibited him from enforcing the stipulation. Because we agree that awarding damages to Goffe would have resulted in an unfair windfall, we need not consider Goffe\u2019s challenges to the other bases of the judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">On determining that Buster had reneged on the settlement stipulation, the Bankruptcy Court judge gave Goffe the opportunity to choose between specific performance of the stipulation and relief from the automatic stay. Goffe chose the latter; it requested and received relief from the automatic stay. As a result, Goffe was able to foreclose on the 110 Beaver Street property and, as the Bankruptcy Court judge noted, avoid the additional expense and time that pursuing specific performance of the stipulation would have entailed. Now, Goffe seeks to recover additional damages based on Buster\u2019s breach of the stipulation. We agree with the Superior Court judge, however, that Goffe \u201ccannot have it both ways\u201d \u2014 Goffe cannot choose to avoid the settlement stipulation and then seek damages for breach of the stipulation. See, e.g., <em>Coggins </em>v. <em>New England </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>Patriots Football Club, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 525, 539 (1986), <em>S.C., </em>406 Mass. 666 (1990) (once electing to pursue independent claim, plaintiffs could not intervene because they had \u201cchosen their remedy and should not be permitted to undo that choice\u201d); <em>Dalton </em>v. <em>American Ammonia Co., </em>236 Mass. 105, 107 (1920) (\u201cgeneral principle of law that... if [plaintiff chooses] to treat the contract as ended or rescinded ... he could not thereafter consider it subsisting and recover damages for its breach . . . [H]e must accept the consequences of his assent to the repudiation of the contract by the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We are unpersuaded by Goffe\u2019s argument that, when the Bankruptcy Court judge stated that Goffe was entitled to use the stipulation \u201cdefensively in State Court,\u201d she \u201cclearly intended\u201d to give the Duffys \u201cas much protection as they would have obtained if Buster were ordered to execute notices of dismissal.\u201d We agree with the Superior Court judge that the Bankruptcy Court judge\u2019s statement did not promise the Duffys any particular outcome in State court, nor did it anticipate the possibility that Goffe would use the stipulation offensively to recover attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Goffe\u2019s reliance on <em>Ward </em>v. <em>American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 98 (1983), and <em>Aerostatic Eng\u2019g Corp. </em>v. <em>Szczawinski, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 141 (1973), is also unpersuasive. In both cases, the defendant was held to have materially breached a contract, thereby relieving the plaintiff of its own duties to perform under the contract. See <em>Ward </em>v. <em>American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 101 (employer materially breached employment contract and, thus, former salesmen were no longer obligated by noncompete clause and were entitled to damages for breach without setoff); <em>Aerostatic Eng\u2019g Corp. </em>v. <em>Szczawinski, supra </em>at 145 (where defendant materially breached construction contract, plaintiff was permitted to cease performance and receive damages without setoff). In this case, Goffe was entitled not only to cease performing its obligations under the settlement stipulation (forbearance, extension of terms and the like), but also to pursue the equivalent of damages without a setoff, that is, foreclosure. The judge did not err in concluding that foreclosure adequately made Goffe whole by, in effect, returning it the very option \u2014 foreclosure \u2014 that Goffe had bargained away in an effort to end all litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>9. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the judgment with respect to Counts II, HI, VII, and VIH of the plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint and affirm the orders denying the plaintiffs\u2019 reconsideration motion, motion to compel, and two motions to make additional findings of fact and amend the judgment.

The testimony of Robert Duffy and of Buster about the incident differed sharply. The judge credited Buster\u2019s recollection of the incident as \u201ccloser to the mark.\u201d He found that, as Robert Duffy drove away from the sale, he drove by Buster and a group of people and \u201cmade some sarcastic comment to the effect that it would be too bad if he could not stop his vehicle in time to avoid hitting them.\u201d The judge concluded that Robert Duffy did not intend the remark to threaten physical harm, that Buster did not understand it to do so, and that the remark could not \u201creasonably . . . have been understood in the circumstances as a threat of physical harm.\u201d The plaintiffs ask us to determine that that remark was much more ominous than the judge found.

See, e.g., <em>Willitts </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 202, 210 (1991); <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., supra </em>at 719. See also <em>Carvalho </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>140 F. Supp. 2d 95 (D. Mass. 2001). Sometimes the <em>Redgrave </em>case has been characterized as involving a component of actual or threatened physical confrontation, see <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>417 Mass. 467, 473-474 n.8, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 868 (1994); <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra </em>at 333, but we have not by that characterization previously limited the reach of the act to economic coercion accomplished only by violence or threats of violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b671-6\"> Nor does the \u201clanguage and mode of analysis\u201d of <em>Brunelle </em>v. <em>Lynn Pub. Schs., </em>433 Mass. 179 (2001) <em>(Brunelle II), </em>aid the plaintiffs\u2019 case, as they maintain. In <em>Brunelle </em>v. <em>Lynn Pub. Schs., </em>428 Mass. 512, 519 (1998) <em>(Brunelle I), </em>we held that the school committee\u2019s refusal to approve the plaintiffs\u2019 home schooling plan violated their right to educate their children at home pursuant to G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1. After <em>Brunette I </em>was decided, the parents filed a motion under the act for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Brunelle II, supra </em>at 181. The main issue in <em>Brunette II </em>was \u201cwhether [the] interference [with the parents\u2019 secured rights] was effected \u2018by threats, intimidation or coercion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182-183. We acknowledged that \u201cthe statute\u2019s coercion requirement is satisfied \u2018where the <em>natural effect </em>of the defendant\u2019s actions [is] to coerce [the plaintiffs] in the exercise of [their] rights\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Redgrave </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., supra </em>at 100. Nonetheless, we held that the school committee\u2019s actions in filing a criminal complaint against the plaintiffs did not constitute coercion within the meaning of the act because, among other things, the criminal complaint \u201ccould not, and did not, have an impact on the plaintiffs in the exercise of their right.\u201d <em>Brunelle II, supra </em>at 183. Nothing in our holding or \u201cmode of analysis\" permits that case to be read so expansively as to encompass the Duffys\u2019 conduct in acquiring the note and mortgage, attempting to negotiate a settlement with the defaulting plaintiffs, and then lawfully filing to foreclose once negotiations broke down.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\"> General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 11, provides, in pertinent part, that any person engaged in trade or commerce may state a civil cause of action against any other person so engaged who uses \u201can unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice declared unlawful by section two.\u201d Section 2 declares unlawful \u201c[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\"> In connection with an acrimonious family feud, one side of the family had sought to persuade the witness to testify that the other side of the family had paid the witness to \u201cbug\u201d the former\u2019s headquarters in reckless disregard for whether such testimony was true. <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>433 Mass. 1, 5 (2000).
