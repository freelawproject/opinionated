L. c. 208, \u00a7 28,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> authorizes a Probate and Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Court judge to order a divorced father to pay postminority support (support payable after a child\u2019s eighteenth birthday) to a third party appointed as his child\u2019s guardian and with whom his child is domiciled. It does not. A Probate and Family Court judge, however, does have authority pursuant to equity powers vested by the Legislature under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, to determine whether the father should be required to support his daughter financially beyond her eighteenth birthday.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We vacate the modification judgment and remand this case for entry of a support order under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the relevant factual and procedural history from the judge\u2019s memoranda and orders and from the undisputed facts. Cailyn Bankosky (Cailyn), bom on May 13, 1983, is the only child of the marriage of Paul Bankosky (father) and Kathryn Mulroy (mother). Pursuant to their divorce in 1990, the mother was awarded physical custody of Cailyn and the father was ordered to pay child support in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>amount of $171.31 each week. When Cailyn was eleven years of age, she was placed in the custody of the Department of Social Services (department) as a result of her parents\u2019 unfitness to care for her, specifically, the mother\u2019s alcohol abuse and the father\u2019s \u201cinappropriate touch[ing]\u201d of her. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23. The department first placed Cailyn in a foster home and then with maternal relatives, but by December, 1995, it had returned Cailyn to her mother\u2019s home. On March 13, 1997, the department petitioned to restore custody of Cailyn, then thirteen years old, to the mother, and a Probate and Family Court judge granted the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">But Cailyn\u2019s situation remained precarious. In December of that year, the plaintiff, Kathleen Eccleston, on behalf of herself and her husband, Joseph Bell, successfully moved for immediate appointment of temporary guardianship of Cailyn on the ground that the mother\u2019s behavior put Cailyn at risk for neglect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 14. In March, 1998, over the mother\u2019s objection, a judge made the guardianship permanent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 2. The judge transferred the father\u2019s child support obligation, which had previously been reduced to $75 each week, from the mother to the guardian and further ordered the mother to pay $50 each month in child support to the guardian.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge also prohibited the mother and the father from contacting Cailyn. Several months later, Cailyn\u2019s guardian filed a pro se complaint against the father for modification, seeking an upward adjustment of child support consistent with the child support guidelines. A modification judgment dated January 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>1999, ordered the father to pay $125 each week to the guardian in child support, payable by wage assignment through the department of revenue, pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, the first reference to that statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judgment did not specify a date for termination of support.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The father did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In April, 2001, approximately one month prior to Cailyn\u2019s eighteenth birthday, her guardian filed a second pro se modification complaint requesting continuation of the existing child support order beyond Cailyn\u2019s eighteenth birthday.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In his answer and his motion to dismiss, the father argued that, once Cailyn reached her eighteenth birthday, the guardianship ended as a matter of law,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Eccleston lacked standing to pursue the modification complaint, and the judge lacked jurisdiction under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, to order postminority child support because Cailyn did not \u201creside with a parent.\u201d The father also sought leave to counterclaim for termination of his support obligation as of the date Cailyn graduated from high school (about one month after her eighteenth birthday) and for a \u201ccredit\u201d toward arrearages for any child support paid to the guardian after Cailyn\u2019s high school graduation.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The case proceeded expeditiously. On July 20, 2001, following a brief trial, the judge issued an order and memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>granting the guardian\u2019s modification complaint. He also allowed the father\u2019s motion to file a counterclaim, but denied the father\u2019s motion to dismiss and his counterclaim. The judge reasoned that the guardian had standing to pursue the modification complaint on Cailyn\u2019s behalf because the complaint, filed prior to Cailyn\u2019s eighteenth birthday, \u201ctolled\u201d the operation of G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 4. Alternatively, he concluded, the guardian could proceed with the case as Cailyn\u2019s \u201cnext friend.\u201d See note 1, <em>supra. </em>The judge ruled that the guardian had proved a \u201cmaterial and substantial change in circumstances\u201d and that modification would be in Cailyn\u2019s best interests, see <em>id., </em>by showing that, without her father\u2019s continued financial assistance, Cailyn, an unemancipated child, would experience a \u201cdeficit in support\u201d that would have a \u201cnegative[] impact[]\u201d on her welfare.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, the judge held that the guardian was entitled to child support as Cailyn\u2019s \u201cde facto parent,\u201d see <em>Youmans </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>429 Mass. 774, 776 &amp; n.3 (1999), and ordered the father to continue to pay $125 a week in child support to Cailyn\u2019s guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The father filed two posttrial motions, one for reconsideration and the other for a new trial on the ground, inter alia, of allegedly newly discovered evidence that Cailyn was no longer living with the guardian.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After a hearing on the matter, the judge denied both motions in an order and memorandum dated September 14, 2001. The father appeals from the judge\u2019s decisions granting the guardian\u2019s requested relief and denying his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>motions to dismiss, for reconsideration, and for a new trial. We granted the father\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">2. <em>Modification. </em>On appeal, the father does not contest the judge\u2019s conclusions that Cailyn\u2019s welfare will suffer without his continued financial support and that his continued support would be in Cailyn\u2019s best interests. Nor does he seriously contest that he has the ability to pay continued support in the amount of $125 a week.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rather, the essence of the father\u2019s argument is that, because the guardianship was statutorily terminated when Cailyn became eighteen years of age, and because she did not reside with either of her parents as required by the postminority support provisions of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>she was an \u201cadult child\u201d over whom the Probate and Family Court lacked further jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">We agree that the judge erred in ordering the father to pay postminority child support to Eccleston pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, the divorce modification statute. Eccleston is not Cailyn\u2019s \u201cparent,\u201d and Cailyn therefore does not meet the statutory prerequisite that she be \u201cdomiciled in the home of a parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Nor could such an award be predicated on G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 40, which allows a support award to a guardian. The Legislature has specified that guardianship of a minor must end when \u201cthe minor attains the age of eighteen years.\u201d See note 9, <em>supra. </em>The statutory reference to an actual age precludes judicial discretion. See <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 576 (1991) (no question of statutory construction where Legislature\u2019s intentions expressly stated).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Nor may this statutory end date be extended, or \u201ctolled,\u201d as the judge held, by reference to general procedural rules regarding the commencement of actions, Mass. R. Civ. P. 3, as amended, 385 Mass. 1215 (1982), and Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 3 (2001) (same). See <em>Risk Mgt. Found, of the Harvard Med. Insts., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>407 Mass. 498, 505 (1990) (\u201cgeneral statutory language must yield to that which is more specific\u201d). Because her legal relationship with Cailyn ended as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>a matter of law on Cailyn\u2019s eighteenth birthday, Eccleston had no cognizable claim, as guardian, to receive support for Cailyn\u2019s care and maintenance, and, insofar as the judge ordered the father to pay postminority child support to her in that capacity, this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">3. <em>Postminority support. </em>However, the fact that the judge lacked authority under either G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, or G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 40, to order the father to pay postminority support to the former guardian for Cailyn\u2019s benefit does not, in our view, compel the conclusion that Cailyn was emancipated as a matter of law for all purposes when the guardianship ended on her eighteenth birthday, or that, as the dissent asserts, the father was then beyond the reach of the Probate and Family Court\u2019s jurisdiction in the matter of her continued support. The Legislature did not intend that emancipation \u201cautomatically occur on reaching the age of majority\u201d in all circumstances. <em>Larson </em>v. Larson, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 418, 420 n.3 (1991), citing <em>Turner </em>v. <em>McCune, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 864, 865 (1976).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To the contrary, since lowering the presumptive age of majority from twenty-one to eighteen, see St. 1973, c. 925 (\u201cAn act establishing the age of majority for certain legal purposes as eighteen years of age\u201d),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Legislature has acted repeatedly to clarify and reinforce its intent that a child\u2019s attaining eighteen years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>does not, of itself, terminate the support obligations of a noncustodial parent. In 1975, for example, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, to grant Probate Court judges the authority to issue \u201corders of maintenance\u201d for \u201cany child who has attained age eighteen years but who has not attained the age of twenty-one years and who is living in the home of a parent, and is principally dependent upon said parent for maintenance.\u201d St. 1975, c. 661, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In 1976, the Legislature further expanded the jurisdiction of Probate Court judges to order postminority support under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, by authorizing a judge to issue orders for payment of \u201csupport and education,\u201d as well as maintenance for children between eighteen and twenty-one years of age in specified circumstances. St. 1976, c. 279, \u00a7 1. In 1991, the Legislature once more enlarged the Probate and Family Court\u2019s authority over child support matters in divorce actions as to \u201cany child who has attained age twenty-one but who has not attained age twenty-three\u201d where the dependent child lives with the custodial parent and is pursuing an undergraduate degree. St. 1991, c. 173, \u00a7 1. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>\u201cThe Legislature apparently intended that children meeting the requirements set forth in [G. L. c. 208,] \u00a7 28 continue to be considered \u2018minors\u2019 at least for purposes of support.\u201d <em>Stolk </em>v. <em>Stolk, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 904-905 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The Legislature has not confined the opportunity for post-minority support to children whose parents are divorced. In language identical to the postminority support provisions of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, it has given Probate and Family Court judges authority to impose postminority support orders on noncustodial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>parents where the parents have never married each other, or have legally separated. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9, as amended through St. 1995, c. 38, \u00a7 167, and St. 1996, c. 199 (paternity); and G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 37, as amended by St. 1975, c. 661, \u00a7 2; St. 1976, c. 279, \u00a7 2; and St. 1991, c. 173, \u00a7 2 (separate support). The Legislature has also enacted laws to ensure that children who have \u201caged out\u201d of foster care on reaching the age of eighteen years receive postminority support to enable them to pursue opportunities for education, rehabilitation, and training. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23 (Department of Social Services may retain responsibility for former foster child to age twenty-one years, with person\u2019s agreement, \u201cfor the purposes of specific educational or rehabilitative programs\u201d). See also G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31 (widowed spouse of deceased employee covered by workers\u2019 compensation benefits may receive additional payment for each child, including child over age of eighteen years who is \u201ca full time student\u201d and qualified dependent under Internal Revenue Code); G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 1-101 (Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, defining \u201c[c]hild\u201d as \u201can individual, whether over or under the age of majority, who is or is alleged to be owed a duty of support by the individual\u2019s parent or who is or is alleged to be the beneficiary of a support order directed to the parent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In enacting such statutes, the Commonwealth has recognized that merely attaining the age of eighteen years does not by itself endow young people with the ability to be self-sufficient in the adult world.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Statutes providing for postminority support advance the Legislature\u2019s purposes to maintain children \u201cas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>completely as possible\u201d from parental resources, see G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1, to protect minor children of nonintact families from parental \u201cunderinvestment,\u201d see note 16, <em>supra, </em>and to encourage a skilled, educated workforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Yet there is a small category of children of nonintact families whose needs for postminority support the Legislature has not specifically addressed. It is the category to which Cailyn belongs: namely, children who, prior to turning eighteen years old, have become wards of the State because their parents are found unfit to care for them and who, after reaching eighteen years of age, continue to make their domicil with a custodial adult who voluntarily provides for them. As to such children, insofar as they are found to be \u201cunemancipated\u201d (that is, financially dependent), the equity powers granted to Probate and Family Court judges in G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, are broad enough to permit a judge to impose a postminority support order on the child\u2019s financially able noncustodial parent or parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In so holding, we act to close an unintended gap in the comprehensive legislative scheme providing postminority support to children of disrupted families that is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s directive to construe child support statues \u201cliberally\u201d to secure the welfare of children. G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1. Contrary to the dissent, we do not agree that an interpretation of the Probate Court\u2019s statutorily authorized equity jurisdiction that would disadvantage an especially vulnerable class of children is either required or proper under our laws. We have previously recognized that the general equity jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court, conferred by statute, may be invoked to order a divorced, financially able noncustodial parent to contribute to the support of a mentally or physically incapacitated adult child. See <em>Feinberg </em>v. <em>Diamant, </em>378 Mass. 131, 134-136 (1979). In conferring general equity jurisdiction on the Probate and Family Court, the Legislature intended to \u201cassure that the interests of justice are served,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 137, in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>circumstances as were present in <em>Feinberg </em>and that are present here. Rather than a \u201cdangerous\u201d act of superlegislation, as the dissent claims, <em>post </em>at 440, resort to equity is both explicitly authorized by the Legislature and appropriate as the narrowest ground on which relief can be afforded to Cailyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Moreover, the conclusion we reach today is neither forbidden by, nor contrary to, the provisions of any other statute. See <em>id. </em>at 137. The record demonstrates that Cailyn is a child who in every respect would qualify for postminority support from her noncustodial divorced parent pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, had she a fit parent with whom she could \u201cdomicil\u201d during her college years. But the neglectful, or worse, behavior of her mother and father has deprived Cailyn of any opportunity to establish domicil with either of them, not by her own choice but mandated by the Commonwealth for her own safety. It would be inimical to the Legislature\u2019s command that Massachusetts courts safeguard \u201cthe long-term well being of the child,\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 1, including \u201cdependent\u201d adult children to age twenty-three, to deny relief to a dependent child who is bereft of her parents\u2019 custody in the circumstances present here. See also G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 28 (\u201cThe supreme judicial court or appeals court may, upon appeal, reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, any judgment, decree or order of the probate court... or make any order therein as law and justice may require\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Eccleston, Cailyn\u2019s former guardian, has agreed to provide a domicil for Cailyn, although under no legal obligation to do so, and she has performed her caretaking role, as the judge found, in a manner both appropriate and supportive. Having determined that the Commonwealth, for Cailyn\u2019s own benefit, prevented Cailyn from maintaining a domicil with either of her parents, that Eccleston continues to provide a domicil for Cailyn, that Cailyn still needs financial support, that Cailyn\u2019s father is able to provide that support, and that Cailyn\u2019s domicil with Eccleston remains in her best interests, the judge properly could have ordered the father to pay postminority support to Eccleston for Cailyn\u2019s benefit under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6. He \u201csimply should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>not have done so as a corollary to the decree nisi of divorce.\u201d <em>Feinberg </em>v. <em>Diamant, </em>378 Mass. 131, 136 (1979).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">4. <em>Other motions. </em>The father\u2019s motions for dismissal, reconsideration, and a new trial largely duplicate arguments we have considered and rejected. To the extent that the father\u2019s reconsideration and new trial motions raise factual questions concerning Cailyn\u2019s domicil, we note only that, on appeal, the father has addressed this argument peripherally at best, and we therefore need not consider it. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). See <em>Adoption of Sherry, </em>435 Mass. 331, 339 (2001). In any case, we find nothing in the record that would lead us to disturb the judge\u2019s finding on the question of Cailyn\u2019s domicil. <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>402 Mass. 406, 411 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the judge\u2019s denial of the father\u2019s motions for dismissal, reconsideration, and a new trial. We vacate the support order entered pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, and remand this matter to the Probate and Family Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. On remand, the modification complaint should be treated as a complaint by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Eccleston for equitable relief pursuant to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6. The judge should reinstate the support order and \u201ctake any other action consistent with general equity jurisprudence to assure that the interests of justice are served.\u201d <em>Feinberg </em>v. <em>Diamant, supra </em>at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-16\"> General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 28, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-17\">\u201cUpon a complaint after a divorce, filed by either parent or by a next friend on behalf of the children after notice to both parents, the court may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care and custody of the minor children of the parties provided that the court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>parties has occurred and the judgment of modification is necessary in the best interests of the children. . . .

Cf. <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., </em>429 Mass. 824, 830, 830-831, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1005 (1999) (finding de facto parent status where both adult parties \u201cdecided to have a child and to form a family,\u201d where they resided together as a family with the child, where the \u201cde facto parent\u201d supported the family financially, and where \u201c[wjith the [biological parent\u2019s] consent, the [third party] participated in raising the child . . .\u201d).

To the extent that the judge based his decision on Eccleston\u2019s status as her former guardian for purposes of recognizing her as a \u201cde facto\u201d parent, we also note that Eccleston\u2019s husband was appointed coguardian, thus, under that theory, making him an equally \u201cde facto\u201d parent. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>To date, this court has not addressed the economic ramifications (if any) of \u201cde facto\u201d parenthood, and we decline to do so here. Because the judge had a sufficient basis to order child support to Eccleston under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, we do not reach the issue whether it was error for the judge to order the father to pay child support to Eccleston as Cailyn\u2019s \u201cde facto parent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b462-6\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALq\">(dissenting). The court today holds that a judge of the Probate and Family Court may order the payment of post-minority support to the plaintiff through the use of that court\u2019s general equity powers, G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6. It does so despite its conclusion that the applicable statutory remedies, the \u201ccomprehensive legislative scheme providing postminority support to children of disrupted families,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 437, do not permit a probate judge to issue an identical order. I dissent because a judge may not act in equity in a manner contrary to statute, and because the court, in sanctioning such an action, has created a dangerous precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The court\u2019s holding violates one of the oldest tenets of equity jurisprudence: equity must follow the law. 2 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7 425 (5th ed. 1941). This centuries-old principle holds that, where the law (either common or statutory) provides a remedy bounded by restrictions (as the court admits G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, does here), a court may not act in equity either to extend or to supplement that remedy. See <em>Hedges </em>v. <em>Dixon County, </em>150 U.S. 182, 192 (1893); <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Chaplic, </em>388 Mass. 398, 406 n.15 (1983) (\u201ca grant of equitable powers does not permit a court to disregard statutory requirements\u201d); <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Stanford, 25 </em>Eng. Rep. 723, 723-724 (1736). The rationale behind this restriction is self-evident: if courts had the power to fashion equitable remedies for problems already addressed by legislation, they would be free to ignore any statutory remedies and restrictions that they deem inconvenient. They would become, in short, super-Legislatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The court has fallen prey to this temptation before, see <em>Adoption of Vito, </em>431 Mass. 550, 570-571 (2000) (Cowin, J., concurring), and does so again today. The court makes the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>holdings: (1) There is a \u201ccomprehensive legislative scheme,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 437, regulating postminority educational support orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) The applicable portion of this legislative scheme, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, cannot be interpreted to allow the Probate Court to grant educational support to Eccleston, because the Legislature intended to limit such payments to parents, and Eccleston is not Cailyn\u2019s parent. See <em>ante </em>at 433. (3) The Probate Court may, nevertheless, exercise its equitable powers to issue an <em>identical </em>order. See <em>ante </em>at 437. How, given the statutory command limiting postminority educational support to parents, does the court justify this final holding? The inescapable answer is that the court believes that it may ignore statutory restrictions when it acts in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The court apparently is operating in the mistaken assumption that G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, allows the Probate and Family Court to fashion equitable remedies that run counter to statute, so long as the Legislature has not explicitly forbidden it to do so. That impression is both wrong and disingenuous. It is wrong because \u00a7 6 states specifically that the Probate and Family Court\u2019s equitable powers are limited by the general principles of equitable jurisprudence, and the rule that equity follows the law is one of those principles. See 2 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 425. It is disingenuous because the court is well aware that the Legislature is not in the habit of prohibiting actions contrary to statute; it presumes that the courts will adhere to the restrictions its statutes impose. The Legislature enacts laws, not suggestions, and it assumes that courts understand this. The court has apparently failed to grasp that to act outside the bounds of a comprehensive legislative scheme is necessarily to act contrary to it:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in holding that a probate judge may award postminority support to a child pursuant to its equitable powers, regardless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>whether that child is domiciled with a parent or principally dependent on that parent, the court essentially eliminates two of the three statutory postminority support requirements contained in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28. Nor is there any reason to suppose that the third requirement is safe. Given that the reach of the Probate Court is now constrained only by \u201cthe long-term well being of the child,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 438, a probate judge could presumably grant a postminority support order to a deserving thirty year old \u201cchild\u201d if the judge found justice so to require.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Although the court justifies its action as a means of avoiding \u201cdisadvantaging] an especially vulnerable class of children,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 437, it ignores the fact that in this case Cailyn has been disadvantaged, not by fate, but by statute. Children over the age of twenty-three years, children who do not live with their parents, and children who are independent of their parents (all of whom cannot receive educational support under \u00a7 28) are equally \u201cdisadvantaged.\u201d Crafting an,additional statutory exception for the \u201cvulnerable\u201d is a legislative function; if the Probate and Family Court may fashion such an exception pursuant to its equitable powers, one wonders what purpose the statute itself actually serves.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The court attempts to minimize the import of its misuse of equity by stating that it acts only to \u201cclose an <em>unintended </em>gap in the comprehensive legislative scheme providing postminority support\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Ante </em>at 437. The problem, of course, is that the characterization of the gap as \u201cunintended\u201d is inherently subjective. Gaps in legislative schemes do not come with labels, so there is nothing to stop us from classifying as \u201cunintentional,\u201d when it suits us, a gap that the Legislature created by design. The rule that equity must follow the law was fashioned specifically to ensure that judges do not rewrite the law in this fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The true import of today\u2019s opinion lies not in what it does but in what it portends. From this point forward when the Probate Court acts in equity it may ignore statutory boundaries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>and the gaps that those boundaries produce. The vast opportunities for judicial overreaching thus created are, by themselves, disturbing. The court\u2019s inability (or unwillingness) to recognize the problem, however, leads me to believe that future abuses will go uncorrected and become increasingly common. I must, therefore, dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\"> The court makes no attempt to suggest that postminority support is an area where the law provides no remedy. It cites, in fact, no less than five statutes that provide for some form of educational support beyond the age of eighteen years. See <em>ante </em>at 435-436.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\"><em> Feinberg </em>v. <em>Diamant, </em>378 Mass 131 (1979), on which the court relies as support for its decision, is not to the contrary. There we held that a parent has a common-law obligation to provide support for an incompetent adult child, see <em>id. </em>at 133-134. Because neither the statutory nor common law of the Commonwealth provided a remedy for this right, we authorized the Probate Court to fashion an equitable remedy. See <em>id. </em>at 136-137. The <em>Feinberg </em>case does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>not, however, stand for the proposition that the Probate and Family Court may act in equity where, as here, a legal remedy <em>does </em>exist. See <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Chaplie, </em>388 Mass. 398, 406 &amp; n.15 (1983) (Probate Court could not award custody pursuant to equitable powers contrary to statutory requirements).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
