On January 26, 1999, the plaintiff, Howard Wong, brought an action against the University of Massachusetts alleging that it had committed a breach of his employment contract when it discharged him in May, 1993. A judge in the Superior Court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the action had not been commenced within the three-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>statute of limitations provided in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 3A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a brief, unpublished memorandum, citing <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>University of Mass. Med. Ctr., </em>417 Mass. 104 (1994), and an order pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court reversed the judgment. <em>Wong </em>v. <em>University of Mass., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 1108 (2001). The Commonwealth appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. Breach of contract claims against the Commonwealth must be commenced within three years, as provided in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 3A.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The narrow issue presented on appeal is whether the six-year statute of limitations contained in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2, governing contract actions generally,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or the three-year statute of limitations contained in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 3A, governing \u201cclaims against the Commonwealth,\u201d is applicable to a contract claim against the Commonwealth. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>A judge in the Superior Court held that the latter statute governed such actions; the Appeals Court determined it was the former. The issue is not definitively resolved by the language of either statute. We therefore examine the relevant legislative history, tracing to its origins the Commonwealth\u2019s consent to be sued for contract claims. See <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Nantucket County, </em>437 Mass. 430, 435 (2002) (employing legislative history to interpret statute in accordance with Legislature\u2019s intent); <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>DeVeau, </em>384 Mass. 676, 680 (1981) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>In 1879, the Commonwealth consented for the first time to be sued in its courts on certain claims. St. 1879, c. 255. That statute provided: \u201cThe superior court shall have jurisdiction of all claims against the commonwealth, which are <em>founded on contract for the payment of money . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis added). St. 1879, c. 255, \u00a7 1. The 1879 statute further provided: \u201cAll the existing provisions of law relating to the limitation of personal actions shall apply to claims against the commonwealth, and to the remedy herein provided . . . .\u201d St. 1879, c. 255, \u00a7 5. We take that to mean that the statute of limitations then applicable to contract claims generally, at the time six years for a contract not under seal, see Gen. St. 1860, c. 155, \u00a7 1, would be applicable to contract claims against the sovereign.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">For many decades the Legislature made no significant change to the Commonwealth\u2019s consent statute, although incidental amendments were enacted from time to time. In the codification of the Public Statutes of 1882, the provisions remained unchanged, with the exception that certain language relating to railroads was deleted. See Pub. St. 1882, c. 195, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 6. In 1887, the Legislature redefined the circumstances in which the Commonwealth consented to be sued, deleting the statutory language \u201cfounded on contract for the payment of money\u201d and substituting the words \u201cat law or in equity\u201d to describe such claims. See St. 1887, c. 246.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The provision relating to the applicable statute of limitations was not changed. <em>Id. </em>There the matter rested until 1943. During the intervening sixty-four years (1879-1943), the Commonwealth\u2019s consent to suit in the Superior Court for contract claims (claims \u201cat law or in equity\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>required that such claims be brought within six years. G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In 1943, the Legislature for the first time drew a distinction between the limitation period applicable to contract claims against the Commonwealth and the limitation period applicable to contract actions generally. Statute 1943, c. 566, both repealed as to the Commonwealth the existing statute of limitations for contract claims and codified a new three-year limitations period for claims against the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In short, with the enactment of the new statute in 1943, the Commonwealth consented to be sued for claims \u201cat law or in equity\u201d only, and the statute of limitations for all such claims was three years. The statute of limitations applicable to contract claims in all other cases was unchanged: six years for contracts not under seal and twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>years for contracts under seal. See St. 1948, c. 274, \u00a7 1; R. L. (1902), c. 202, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">As of 1943, the Commonwealth had not, of course, consented to be sued in tort. See note 6, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It did not do so until 1978.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208, 212-213 (1977), this court announced that, unless the Legislature acted to permit tort claims against the Commonwealth and other public employers, the court would abrogate sovereign immunity as to those claims. See <em>Morash &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 612, 623-624 (1973). The Legislature acted. In 1978, the Commonwealth\u2019s consent statute, G. L. c. 258, was repealed in its entirety, and replaced by a new comprehensive statute, popularly known as the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act (Act),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in which the Commonwealth for the first time consented to suit on tort claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 15, codifying the Act as G. L. c. 258, \u00a7\u00a7 1-11. The Act also abrogated any immunities that might previously have been available to public employers other than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Commonwealth.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Of relevance to this case, by its terms, the Act repealed the Commonwealth\u2019s consent to be sued on all contract claims. See St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 15. It is clear that that aspect of the reform legislation was inadvertent: there is nothing to suggest that, in providing for tort claims against the Commonwealth, the Legislature intended to abrogate the century-old consent of the Commonwealth to be sued in contract claims. Accordingly, in 1979, the Legislature promptly amended the 1978 Act and reauthorized contract claims against the Commonwealth: \u201cClaims against the commonwealth, except as otherwise expressly provided in [c. 258] or by any special provision of law, may be enforced in the superior court.\u201d St. 1979, c. 1, \u00a7 1. The preamble to St. 1979, c. 1, makes explicit the Legislature\u2019s purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201cWhereas, The deferred operation of this act would tend to defeat its purpose, which is to clarify the law relating to claims against the commonwealth not arising in tort, therefore it is hereby declared to be an emergency law, necessary for the immediate preservation of the public convenience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The 1979 corrective legislation was also made retroactive to the effective date of the Act, thereby ensuring that no contract claim against the Commonwealth had been extinguished by the terms of the 1978 Act. See St. 1979, c. 1, \u00a7 3. To make its intent abundantly clear, the Legislature enacted a catchall safe harbor provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cNothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as limiting or restricting any liability with respect to claims not arising in tort to which the commonwealth may have been subject prior to the effective date of this chapter or to which the commonwealth would thereafter have been subject if this chapter had not been adopted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-8\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">Notwithstanding some resulting confusion, the Legislature thus expressed in clear and unambiguous language that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Commonwealth would continue to consent to suit for contract claims in the same manner and to the same extent that it had given its consent prior to 1978. See P.M. Cronin, Contract Claims Against Public Bodies \u2014 The Applicability and Inapplicability of Chapter 258, 1 Mass. Gov\u2019t Liability Rep. 75, 75 (1987) (\u201cThe inadvertent repeal of a statute by the General Court and its belated insertion of Chapter 258 has needlessly confused the applicability of the provisions of that chapter to contract claims against public agencies\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The 1979 corrective legislation did not alter the three-year statute of limitations previously applicable to contract claims against the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 3A. There is nothing \u2014 no language, no legislative history, no legislative report \u2014 to support any such conclusion. Rather, in this, as in all other respects, the 1979 corrective legislation was intended to do no more than to restore the Commonwealth\u2019s consent to be sued on contract claims. See, e.g., <em>Perkins Sch. for the Blind </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>383 Mass. 825, 830 n.4 (1981) (applying three-year statute of limitations of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 3A, to contract claim against the Commonwealth).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> When the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>monwealth consents to be sued, it may define the terms and conditions on which it may be sued. See, e.g., G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (setting terms for tort actions). A statute of limitations is but one term that the Commonwealth may set as a precondition to suit. Chapter 258, as amended, provides for certain circumstances in which the Commonwealth (and other public bodies) may be sued. The Legislature has determined that <em>all </em>such claims against the Commonwealth be brought \u201conly\u201d within three years. G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 3A.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We may not amend or depart from the terms that the-Legislature has set.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b52-7\"> General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 3A, provides that \u201c[petitions founded upon claims against the commonwealth prosecuted under chapter two hundred and fifty-eight shall be brought only within three years next after the cause of action accrues.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\"> For purposes of the Commonwealth\u2019s consent to be sued, the University of Massachusetts and the Commonwealth are \u201cone and the same party, namely the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d <em>Hannigan </em>v. <em>New Gamma-Delta Chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 658, 659 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b52-9\"> General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2, provides: \u201cActions of contract, other than those to recover for personal injuries, founded upon contracts or liabilities, express or implied, except actions limited by section one or actions upon judgments or decrees of courts of record of the United States or of this or of any other state of the United States, shall, except as otherwise provided, be commenced only within six years next after the cause of action accrues.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b53-6\"> As revised in 1887, the consent statute thus read: \u201cThe superior court shall have jurisdiction of <em>all claims against the commonwealth whether at law or in equity\u201d </em>(emphasis added).

The court reasoned that the term \u201ccontract for the payment of money\u201d was amended to allow for remedies, such as damages, for the breach of any type of contract. <em>Id. </em>at 29-30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b54-12\"> The statute authorizing the consent to sue the Commonwealth was recodified in 1902, 1921, and 1932. In the course of recodification, the chapter was renumbered and minor, primarily procedural changes were enacted as follows. In the Revised Laws of 1902, the statute stated that claims against the Commonwealth should be brought in the Superior Court for Suffolk County. R. L. (1902), c. 201, \u00a7 1. In the Revised Laws of 1921, the text concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s consent to be sued for breach of contract was unchanged. See R. L. (1921), c. 201, \u00a7 1. In 1921, the text of the limitations section was compressed, but its import was the same: \u201cLaws relative to the limitation of actions shall apply to claims against the commonwealth and to the remedy herein provided.\u201d R. L. (1921), c. 201, \u00a7 5. In 1932, with the enactment of the Tercentenary Edition of the General Laws, the consent to suit provisions again were not changed, excepting only that the requirement that a claim against the Commonwealth be brought only in Suffolk County was deleted: claims were now authorized in all counties. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 258, \u00a7 1. In 1932, as before, the provision concerning the applicable statute of limitations was not amended. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 258, \u00a7 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b54-13\"> Specifically, St. 1943, c. 566, \u00a7 2, repealed G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 5, that previously had governed the statute of limitations for contract claims against the Commonwealth. The new \u201climitations on actions\u201d provision enacted by the Legislature provided: \u201cPetitions founded upon claims against the commonwealth prosecuted under chapter two hundred and fifty-eight shall be brought only within three years next after the cause of action accrues.\u201d St. 1943, c. 566, \u00a7 1.

The report discusses the history of private legislation, i.e., legislation enacted to permit a particular claim against the Commonwealth, generally and in Massachusetts specifically. See <em>id. </em>at 60-78. In summarizing Massachusetts law, the report noted that \u201c[b]y statute, the Commonwealth has consented to be sued in contract actions (G.
