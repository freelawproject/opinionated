Evans, </em>236 Or App 467, 236 P3d 848 (2010), in which we concluded that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of a CARES physician that one of the victims had been sexually abused without first holding a hearing under OEC 104 to determine the admissibility of the physician\u2019s diagnosis, which was scientific evidence. We also accepted the state\u2019s concession that the trial court should have granted defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on one of the counts of sexual abuse. We reversed the judgment on that one count and reversed and remanded on the other counts that were affected by the evidentiary error.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The state now advances two requests. First, it asks that we make clear that our disposition, which specified the counts that were reversed and remanded, does not affect other counts unaffected by the error, which should be affirmed. We agree and modify the disposition accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Second, the state asks that we narrow the remand to require only that the trial court hold an OEC 104 hearing with instructions that, if the court finds an adequate scientific foundation for the physician\u2019s testimony, the judgment should be affirmed. We decline to include the requested instruction to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Petition for reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; judgment of conviction on Count 6 reversed; judgment of conviction on Counts 1 through 5 and Counts 9 and 10 reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
