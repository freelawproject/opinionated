On appeal, defendant and the state raise the same arguments as those raised and resolved in <em>State v. Mazzola (A139257), </em>238 Or App 201, 242 P3d 674 (2010), with regard to the trial court\u2019s denial of the suppression motion. Further, the evidentiary record in this case is identical to that in <em>Mazzola (A139257) </em>because defendant and the defendant in that case, her husband, Frank Mazzola, consolidated their cases for the purposes of the motion to suppress hearing and for trial. Accordingly, and for the same reasons, we hold in this case, as we did in <em>Mazzola (A139257), </em>that the trial court erred when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
