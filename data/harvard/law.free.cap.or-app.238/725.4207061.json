For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the entry into the residence was justified under the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We take the following facts, which are supported by the record, from the trial court\u2019s findings. <em>State v. McDonald, </em>168 Or App 452, 459, 7 P3d 617, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 193 (2000). Deputy Brewster received a dispatch to respond to a domestic disturbance reported in a 9-1-1 call from an anonymous complainant. Brewster arrived at the residence five minutes after receiving the dispatch. Shortly after he arrived, two other deputies joined him as back-up; one of them, Marcellais, testified that the dispatcher had orally informed them that \u201cthe sounds the complainant heard were as if someone was being \u2018slammed around.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Nothing about the residence appeared unusual; there were, for example, no broken windows or damaged entryways. For seven or eight minutes, Brewster pounded on the door, identified himself as a law enforcement officer, and demanded that someone come to the door. There was no response and no sound indicating that anyone was at home, although two vehicles were parked at the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Believing that the anonymous complainant might live next door, Brewster went next door but was unable to contact anyone there. He was able, however, to contact the complainant by telephone. The complainant specifically identified the vehicles at the residence, told Brewster that the vehicles belonged to the man and woman who lived at the residence, and reported \u201cthat the sounds heard were not someone pounding on the wall, but were definitely sounds of one person hitting another.\u201d Neither Brewster nor the other deputies knew, at that time, where the complainant lived or was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Meanwhile, Marcellais continued to pound on the door and shout. At one point, he heard through a second-story window the sounds of people walking around inside, with no sound of a physical fight; he conveyed that information to Brewster when Brewster returned to the residence. Brewster continued pounding on the door, identifying himself and demanding entry. The deputies spent a total of about 20 minutes knocking and demanding entry before finally forcing their way into the residence. During the time that the deputies were making their presence known, no one inside the residence requested assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Brewster had 19 years of law enforcement experience, had received training in handling domestic violence cases, and had investigated domestic violence cases, including cases that involved serious physical injury and homicide. Regarding the situation as it appeared to the deputies, the trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">\u201cFrom all the information, Brewster knew that he was called to the residence for a possible incident of domestic violence, and believed that one person had been hitting another person, and that the residents of the duplex had not left and were still in the duplex. He believed that someone in the residence may have been injured, possibly seriously, and or that because of being injured or being held hostage, may have been prevented by another from answering the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\u201cBrewster testified that he eventually decided to force entry into the house (without a warrant) for the purpose to check on the welfare of the occupants and to cause to cease any violent behavior which may be occurring in the residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The deputies kicked in the door, entered the residence, and discovered certain evidence of crimes, which defendant moved to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion. In its conclusions of law, the court set out the legal framework of the emergency aid doctrine and then turned to the question \u201cwhether objective indicia of a true emergency existed at the time the officers entered the duplex.\u201d The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>\u201cOfficer Brewster received a dispatch to respond to a domestic disturbance. The CAD [computer-aided dispatch] stated that it was unknown i[f] the disturbance was physical in nature, although the complainant states that the sounds were as if someone was being \u2018slammed around.\u2019 Throughout their time at the residence, none of the deputies observed anything unusual about the residence (e.g., no signs of a forced entry). The complainant was able to identify the vehicles in the driveway and in the yard as the vehicles that belonged to the male and female who lived in the residence. While Officer Marcellais testified that he heard people inside the residence, he did not testify that he heard any sounds of physical struggle or an indication that an act of violence had occurred inside the duplex. Moreover, no occupant of the duplex requested assistance from the police, even though the deputies had repeatedly made their presence known.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\">\u201cUnder these facts, the court finds that the [state] fails to carry its burden of showing that \u2018exceptional emergency circumstances\u2019 existed at the time the officers entered the duplex. First, there is no evidence that any officer believed that entry was necessary to protect life. While Officer Brewster testified that he decided to enter the duplex for the purposes to check on the welfare of the occupants, and that he was worried someone in the residence might have been injured, the record does not show compelling evidence to support Officer Brewster\u2019s conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The trial court went on to conclude that, under <em>State v. Salisbury, </em>223 Or App 516, 196 P3d 1017 (2008), and State <em>v. Martin, </em>222 Or App 138, 193 P3d 993 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 690 (2009), defendant\u2019s motion to suppress should be granted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">\u201cIn this case, the evidence presented by the [state] was the CAD report, which stated that it was \u2018unknown if [disturbance] physical,\u2019 and testimony from Officer Marcellais that the verbal information from the dispatcher * * * informed officers that complainant said that it sounds like someone was being \u2018slammed around.\u2019 Officer Brewster did testify that when he personally talked to complainant, the sounds were not someone pounding on the wall, but sounds of one person hitting another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">\u201cThe testimony of the complainant in this case is similar to the testimony of the neighbors in Salisbury: testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>what outside witnesses heard coming from inside the apartment \u2014 an inference of a physical struggle. However, as the court stated in <em>Salisbury, </em>* * * while it could be inferred that \u2018there were no longer any sounds coming from the apartment, the screaming woman inside the apartment was unable to respond to [the police\u2019s] inquiries due to injury or restraint,... that inference is counterbalanced by the inference that what the police heard was evidence of a domestic quarrel that did not require their intervention.\u2019 [223 Or App at 524.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-4\">\u201cAs in [Martin] and <em>Salisbury, </em>there is no objective evidence that would indicate that the officers\u2019 entry into the duplex was required to protect a person from harm or risk of harm, other than Deputy Brewster\u2019s testimony that he believed that someone in the residence may have been injured and he wanted to check on their welfare. This testimony alone does not demonstrate the exceptional emergency circumstances required by the emergency aid doctrine. It necessarily follows that the entry into the duplex was unlawful and defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">(Second and third bracketed materials in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The state appeals, arguing that the deputies\u2019 entry into the residence was justified under the emergency aid exception to the Article I, section 9, warrant requirement. That exception applies if the following conditions are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">\u201c(1) The police must have reasonable grounds to believe that there is an emergency and an immediate need for their assistance for the protection of life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\">\u201c(2) The emergency must be a true emergency \u2014 the officer\u2019s good faith belief alone is insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-9\">\u201c(3) The search must not be primarily motivated by an intent to arrest or to seize evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-10\">\u201c(4) The officer must reasonably suspect that the area or place to be searched is associated with the emergency and that, by making a warrantless entry, the officer will discover something that will alleviate the emergency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number><em>State v. Follett, </em>115 Or App 672, 680, 840 P2d 1298, <em>rev den, </em>317 Or 163 (1992) (footnote omitted). The state has the burden to show that the circumstances at the time of the war-rantless entry supported the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Salisbury, </em>223 Or App at 524. To justify entering a residence because of an emergency, \u201cthe state must make a strong showing that exceptional emergency circumstances truly existed.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>300 Or 203, 229, 709 P2d 225 (1985), <em>cert den, </em>475 US 1141 (1986) (citing <em>Vale v. Louisiana, </em>399 US 30, 34, 90 S Ct 1969, 26 L Ed 2d 409 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Here, the only dispute concerns the first two prongs of the emergency aid test, which effectively require that \u201cthe police officer must subjectively believe that his or her assistance is necessary to protect someone\u2019s life and that belief, evaluated at the time of the entry and not in light of subsequently discovered facts, must be reasonable.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>222 Or App at 148 (citing <em>State v. Martofel, </em>151 Or App 249, 252, 948 P2d 1253 (1997)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state contends that those requirements were satisfied because Brewster subjectively believed that immediate entry into the residence was necessary to protect life and his belief was objectively reasonable in light of the report of sounds of physical violence in the residence. Defendant responds that the trial court did not find that Brewster had the requisite subjective belief and that we must presume that the trial court found, consistently with its ultimate conclusions, that Brewster did not subjectively believe that forced entry was necessary to protect someone\u2019s life. In addition, defendant contends that any such belief was not objectively reasonable, because the circumstances did not constitute a true emergency and because information from an anonymous call is insufficient. We conclude that the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>established the basis for application of the emergency aid doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">We begin by addressing the officer\u2019s subjective belief. As set forth above, the trial court expressly found that Brewster \u201cbelieved that someone in the residence may have been injured, possibly seriously, and * * * because of being injured or being held hostage, may have been prevented by another from answering the door.\u201d That finding is supported by evidence in the record. In light of that finding, we understand the trial court to have reached a legal conclusion about the <em>objective </em>basis for Brewster\u2019s belief, not a factual finding about Brewster\u2019s <em>subjective </em>belief, when the court later concluded \u2014 in the context of deciding that the state had failed to prove the existence of \u201c \u2018exceptional emergency circumstances\u2019 \u201d \u2014 that \u201cthere is no evidence that any officer believed that entry was necessary to protect life. * * * [T]he record does not show compelling evidence to support Officer Brewster\u2019s conclusion.\u201d In keeping with the trial court\u2019s finding that Brewster believed that a person in the residence might have been seriously injured and prevented from responding to police because of an injury or because of being held hostage, we conclude that the subjective belief portion of the test was proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">We turn to whether that belief was objectively reasonable. As we explained in <em>Martofel, </em>we consider the circumstances known to the officers at the time the warrantless entry was made, without reference to after-acquired knowledge; \u201c[although after-acquired knowledge might alter how the circumstances are viewed, that does not mean that the circumstances as earlier understood did not present a \u2018true emergency.\u2019 \u201d 151 Or App at 252 (where officers received a report of a man with a gun in a residential Portland neighborhood, the emergency aid doctrine justified entry into the defendant\u2019s backyard to locate the armed man, although police later learned that the man was simply a hunter waiting for a ride and had left the neighborhood before officers arrived). Circumstances support an objectively reasonable belief that immediate action is required to preserve life</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">\u201cif there are reliable, objective indicia of a potential victim of a dangerous circumstance or a potential perpetrator of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>dangerous act. Suspicious circumstances or \u2018gut instinct\u2019 are insufficient. The existence of an identifiable victim or perpetrator is significant because whether an emergency exists depends on whether immediate action is required (\u2018something that will alleviate the emergency), which, in turn, depends on the relationship between the gravity of the harm to be prevented and the probability that the harm will occur if action is not taken. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>741 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining \u2018emergency\u2019 as \u2018an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action\u2019). In the absence of either a potential victim or a perpetrator (or other objective indicia of an immediate need for action to protect life), both the risk and gravity of harm to human life are purely speculative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><em>State v. Burdick, </em>209 Or App 575, 581-82, 149 P3d 190 (2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We independently determine whether the circumstances presented objective reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency existed. <em>McDonald, </em>168 Or App at 459 (citing <em>State v. Toevs, </em>327 Or 525, 535-36, 964 P2d 1007 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The existence of an objectively reasonable basis is fact-specific, and we appreciate the trial court\u2019s conscientious application of our case law. Nonetheless, we conclude that, because the circumstances here included indications of physical violence inflicted on a person (as opposed to indications of a loud verbal dispute without signs of violence), the circumstances objectively indicated that a true emergency existed. That point is illustrated by several of our cases involving police responses to apparent domestic disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In <em>State v. Agnes, </em>118 Or App 675, 848 P2d 1237 (1993), we concluded that a true emergency existed. Police officers had received a report of fighting occurring in the defendant\u2019s apartment, with sounds of \u201cbanging, yelling and screaming.\u201d The officers knocked at the door; after a period during which a male voice told the officers to go away and yelled obscenities at them and a female voice said, \u201cJust leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>me alone,\u201d a woman opened the door a few inches. Although she said that she was fine, the officers observed that she appeared frightened and disheveled; the furniture was in disarray, with a television halfway falling off a counter; and the defendant appeared belligerent and intoxicated. The officers pushed the door open and entered. <em>Id. </em>at 677. We concluded that a true emergency existed because it appeared that \u201c[a] violent altercation had occurred, and the potential for further violence had not dissipated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">In <em>Salisbury, </em>on the other hand, such indications of a violent altercation were absent. There, a police officer, after observing the defendant appear to commit a traffic violation, approached the defendant, but the defendant walked away from the officer, entered his apartment, and locked the door behind him. 223 Or App at 518-19. The officer subsequently heard \u201ca female voice screaming, heard someone use a profanity, heard yelling and screaming with both a male and a female voice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519 (internal quotation marks omitted). Concerned that someone might be in danger, the officer, with assistance from back-up officers, pounded on the door and finally forced the door open after 15 to 20 minutes. <em>Id. </em>at 519-20. There was no evidence that the officers heard any sound of a physical struggle or indication of a violent act. <em>Id. </em>at 524. Although the defendant\u2019s neighbors testified that they heard \u201cat least one loud noise, a thud, that was not specifically identified, * * * that went on for some period of up to five minutes,\u201d there was no evidence that that information was communicated to the officers before their warrantless entry into the apartment. <em>Id. </em>at 519 (internal quotation marks omitted; ellipses in original). Under those circumstances, we concluded that the state had failed to prove that there was an objectively reasonable basis to conclude that entry into the defendant\u2019s apartment was immediately required to protect a person from harm. <em>Id. </em>at 524-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Similarly, a warrantless entry is not justified under the emergency aid doctrine when police are aware of only a loud argument, without any indication of a physical struggle or an act of violence. <em>State v. Fredricks, </em>238 Or App 349, 358-59, 243 P3d 97 (2010). For example, in <em>State v. Baker, </em>237 Or App 342, 240 P3d 735 (2010),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we distinguished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>between circumstances indicative of a physical altercation and circumstances indicative of only a verbal altercation. There, a 9-1-1 caller had reported hearing yelling and screaming from the home of a neighbor, Turnage, including Turnage\u2019s use of a prearranged code word indicating to the neighbor that she was in trouble and needed immediate police assistance; the caller also stated that a young child might be present. When police officers arrived at Turnage\u2019s house, they heard yelling, although they could not discern what was being said, and there was no evidence that they heard any indication of a physical struggle. The officers also encountered, on the front porch, a woman and a man who stated that they had been inside the house but gave no information about weapons, injuries, threats, or a need for police intervention to prevent harm. The officers started walking toward the back door of the house. Through a window, they saw the defendant and Turnage arguing but saw no indication of a physical conflict. <em>Id. </em>at 348. We concluded that, although the case was a close one, there were no objective indicia of a life-threatening emergency once the officers saw \u201cthat the couple was engaged in only a verbal, nonviolent argument unaccompanied by other evidence indicative of life-threatening violence[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349. We distinguished <em>Agnes </em>on the basis that <em>Agnes </em>had involved a report of \u201cbanging\u201d noises that were consistent with a physical struggle and the officers\u2019 observation of signs of violence. <em>Baker, </em>237 Or App at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">Here, the circumstances, like those in <em>Agnes, </em>indicated more than a mere loud verbal dispute. The circumstances here included sounds of a person being \u201cslammed around,\u201d that is, \u201csounds of one person hitting another.\u201d Although the deputies themselves did not hear the sounds of a physical struggle, they had been informed that those sounds had come from the residence, and Marcellais heard sounds of people inside the residence, indicating that the people involved in the struggle were still present. Based on the circumstances apparent from the facts found by the trial court, the state proved that there was an objectively reasonable basis to believe that immediate entry into the residence was necessary to protect life.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>We reject defendant\u2019s argument that, because of the complainant\u2019s anonymity, the deputies could not rely on the information supplied by the complainant who called 9-1-1. Nothing in our case law suggests that a caller\u2019s anonymity, standing alone, would so undermine the credibility of a 9-1-1 report as to render reliance on the report objectively unreasonable. To the contrary, we have concluded that a true emergency existed in cases that began with anonymous reports. <em>See State v. Torres, </em>201 Or App 275, <em>277-78, </em>118 P3d 268 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 308 (2006) (an anonymous caller reported that a man had broken the front window of a neighbor\u2019s house and climbed inside); <em>State v. Frink, </em>42 Or App 171, 173, 600 P2d 456 (1979) (an anonymous report that someone named \u201cTim\u201d was \u201cshooting up\u201d a child named \u201cJunior\u201d with drugs at a specified address).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Because the deputies\u2019 entry into defendant\u2019s residence was justified under the emergency aid doctrine, the trial court erred by granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-5\"> In <em>Martin, </em>222 Or App at 149, the pertinent facts were these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">\u201cAt the time of their entrance, the officers knew only that defendant might have been the driver of a car involved in one minor hit-and-run accident with a parked car, after which she drove home; that she bumped into her garage, touching it \u2018lightly\u2019; that she delayed responding to the officers\u2019 requests to answer her door; that, when she did answer, she was unclothed; and that, when she saw them, she ran to her bedroom. On those facts, any belief that defendant\u2019s life was endangered so as to necessitate immediate intervention would not be reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\"> In <em>Burdick, </em>we concluded that such objective indicia existed where police had received reports that a man with a knife had entered the apartment of a woman who \u201cwas always there,\u201d and police received no response from the woman despite repeatedly pounding on her door. 209 Or App at 582.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b780-6\"> Our decisions in <em>Fredricks </em>and <em>Baker </em>had not yet issued at the time that the trial court decided the motion to suppress at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
