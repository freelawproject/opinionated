J.</author>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Defendant was convicted, following a trial on stipulated facts, of a variety of drug offenses after the trial court denied his motion to suppress evidence found when a police officer entered defendant\u2019s motel room in response to a 9-1-1 call reporting a loud argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant argues that the trial court erred in concluding that the officer\u2019s entry into his motel room was authorized by the community caretaking statute, ORS 133.033,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that he was entitled to suppression of the subsequently discovered evidence under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state argues that defendant failed to preserve his argument under the Oregon Constitution and that the officer\u2019s entry was authorized by ORS 133.033 because the officer reasonably believed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>someone in defendant\u2019s motel room was at risk of domestic violence. We reject the state\u2019s preservation argument, and we conclude that the evidence discovered after the officer entered defendant\u2019s motel room should have been suppressed because that entry was not authorized under the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement of Article I, section 9. Consequently, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">We take the pertinent facts from our review of the record in light of the trial court\u2019s express determination that the officer\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing was credible and defendant\u2019s was not.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Officer Walker received a call notifying him of a possible domestic disturbance taking place at a motel. A dispatcher notified Walker that the call was made either by neighbors or the manager of the motel. Walker arrived at the motel within <em>\u201ca </em>few minutes\u201d and spoke with three of defendant\u2019s neighbors, \u201cwho said they had heard a loud disturbance inside the motel room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Walker then stood outside the door of defendant\u2019s motel room and waited for his cover officers to arrive. Walker stood outside the door for two or three minutes, and, during that time, he could hear a male voice and a female voice, engaged in a \u201cloud argument.\u201d Walker testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">\u201c[a]t that particular time my biggest concern * * * [was] that * * * it wasn\u2019t deescalating at all. It was just staying at this level and, like I said, it was just continuing, and so I had no clue at that point if anybody was injured or anything like that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">After his cover officers arrived, Walker knocked on the door and was immediately met by defendant, who opened the door. Walker told defendant \u201cthis is what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m here,* * * got a report from neighbors that * * * basically it\u2019s a possible domestic disturbance. I need to come into the room and make sure everybody\u2019s okay.\u201d Walker testified that defendant appeared \u201cfairly calm,\u201d and Walker asked defendant if he would \u201cmind stepping outside really quick.\u201d Defendant complied, and Walker entered the motel room. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Defendant\u2019s female companion, J, was inside the room, and J did not appear to be injured. Walker testified that he smelled marijuana smoke when he entered the room. Walker asked J whether she had been assaulted by defendant; she said that she had not, but that she and defendant had been having a loud argument. Walker told J about the complaints from the neighbors regarding the argument and told her \u201cyou guys need to keep it down.\u201d Walker then told J that he could smell marijuana, and asked her if \u201c[they had] illegal narcotics in the room.\u201d J said no. Walker asked her for consent to search the room, and J deferred to defendant. Walker then stepped outside the room, where defendant was sitting with Walker\u2019s cover officer, and asked defendant for consent to search the room. Defendant said, \u201cGo ahead. You\u2019re not going to find anything.\u201d Walker then searched the room, finding the controlled substances at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence that Walker found in the search. Defendant argued that \u201cthe search of defendant\u2019s [m]otel room was conducted without a warrant and without a valid exception to the warrant requirement in violation of Article I, section 9 of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\u201d At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the state argued that Walker\u2019s entry was justified under ORS 133.033, the community caretaking statute. Defendant replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">\u201c[T]he officer says * * * that he\u2019s responding to a loud disturbance, that three neighbors are concerned about a loud disturbance, and there\u2019s nothing more than a loud disturbance based on what the officer said as well as what both suspects say in this entire investigation. I think there was never a reason for \u2014 especially under ORS 133.033, for Officer Walker to enter without a warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: You think the facts don\u2019t support a conclusion under ORS 133.033, that it was reasonable for the officer to go in[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201c[COUNSEL]: Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">According to defendant, \u201cthere was [no] indication that anyone was hurt, harmed, or otherwise in need of aid, and that there\u2019s no evidence that \u2014 -I don\u2019t think this is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>issue, but that he entered in order to prevent harm.\u201d Defendant acknowledged Walker\u2019s testimony regarding his training and experience with verbal arguments, but pointed out that \u201cin this specific case the reasonable and articulable facts don\u2019t point to anything other than a verbal disturbance, so without reasonable suspicion of a crime, he entered, and without * * * a reasonable or necessary reason to enter the room, he entered.\u201d Defendant argued that he had been unlawfully stopped when Walker asked him to step out of the room and that his subsequent consent to the search of the room was invalid because of that prior illegality. The trial court pressed defendant on that point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, what does that have to do with the entry of the officer into the room pursuant to ORS 133.033 if the facts support that? I appreciate you don\u2019t think they do but the State\u2019s arguing that they do and if the facts support the reasonableness of the officer going into the room, is there any kind of \u2014 how are those things tied together, or not, those two separate things? One is an unlawful stop of your client, which is your argument, and the exploitation of that and the request to consent versus the officer being in the room, and if lawful, which you disagree with, but if lawful and smelling the smell of marijuana and then asking for consent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201c[COUNSEL]: That\u2019s the nexus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Go ahead. Okay. So your client wouldn\u2019t have been there for the cop to ask if he hadn\u2019t been unlawfully stopped, even though the cop had a right to be there. I appreciate you don\u2019t think he did, but if the cop had a right to be there, your client wouldn\u2019t have been there to ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\u201c[COUNSEL]: My client would have been in a different position while asked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: There we go. I\u2019m with you. I understand your argument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">In rebuttal, the state reiterated its argument that Walker \u201cacted reasonably within the bounds of the statute, but it wasn\u2019t just a general \u2014 he didn\u2019t say, T thought there might be.\u2019 It\u2019s like, T thought there [might be]\u2019 \u2014 \u2018what was your specific concern?\u2019 \u2018That someone was injured inside.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The court then denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">\u201cI find the facts consistent with the testimony of the police officer, whom I find to be credible. I find defendant\u2019s testimony to be less than credible because of the contradictions * * <em>x</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cSo the facts are consistent with the officer\u2019s testimony. The defendant consented to the search of the room twice. The defendant consented before the officer searched anything, at all, and the officer \u2014 I\u2019m kind of getting myself out of order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">\u201cFirst of all, the officer\u2019s entry into the room was consistent with ORS 133.033(2), in that \u2014 I mean, it was reasonable for the officer to think that he might need to render aid to an injured person because of the information that had been provided to him. That\u2019s not a probable cause standard, that\u2019s [a] reasonableness standard, so the officer was lawfully in the room. Although defendant was certainly not free to leave at that point and there was a stop of the defendant, the stop was reasonable, given the circumstances. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201cThe defendant consented orally to the search of the room. The defendant later reaffirmed his consent * * *[.] So I\u2019m denying the Motion to Suppress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">As noted, defendant was subsequently convicted of a variety of drug offenses. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">The state first contends that defendant failed to preserve his argument on appeal under Article I, section 9. According to the state, \u201c[i]n the trial court * * * defendant relied exclusively on the statute and made no reference whatsoever [to] constitutional limits on an emergency-aid entry or to any failure to establish that the emergency in question must be life-threatening.\u201d It follows, the state concludes, [h]aving made an exclusively statutory argument in the trial court, defendant did not preserve a constitutional issue for appeal.\u201d The state concedes that, if defendant did preserve a constitutional claim, the evidence available to Walker at the time he entered defendant\u2019s room \u201cdid not demonstrate that anyone\u2019s life was in immediate danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number> We reject the state\u2019s contention that the constitutional and statutory components of the \u201cemergency aid\u201d doctrine can be so cleanly separated. ORS 133.033 authorizes an officer to engage in \u201clawful acts,\u201d and, \u201c[wjhatever the meaning of lawful acts\u2019 in the context of ORS 133.033, that meaning must be consonant with the state and federal constitutions.\u201d <em>State v. Dahl, </em>323 Or 199, 205, 915 P2d 979 (1996). As we recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">\u201cORS 133.033 does not independently establish an exception to the warrant requirement. Rather, it provides legislative authorization for (among other things) a particular class of searches, subject to many of the same constitutional constraints that operate to limit other searches, including the warrant requirement. A lawful community caretaking search, in other words, must first be within the universe of police action described in ORS 133.033, and then it must also \u2018fall within one of the constitutional exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>State v. Martin, </em>222 Or App 138, 146, 193 P3d 993 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 690 (2009) (quoting <em>State v. Goodall, </em>219 Or App 325, 334, 183 P3d 199 (2008)). In <em>Martin, </em>we concluded that, because an officer\u2019s entry into the defendant\u2019s home did not satisfy the requirements of the emergency aid doctrine under Article I, section 9, it was unnecessary to decide whether that entry would be lawful under ORS 133.033. As we explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201c[o]rdinarily, we would undertake the statutory analysis before considering constitutional questions under Article I, section 9. In the present case, however, judicial efficiency requires a departure from that practice. The statutory question \u2014 whether the officers\u2019 entry in this case was authorized by ORS 133.033 \u2014 is a close and difficult one. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">\u201cAs did the Supreme Court in another case involving the scope of ORS 133.033, we move directly to the constitutional question in order to avoid a \u2018topic [that] would take us afield needlessly.\u2019 <em>Dahl, </em>323 Or at 205. That constitutional question is whether the officers\u2019 entry falls within the \u2018emergency aid\u2019 exception to the warrant requirement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>trial court ruled that it did not and, as we explain below, we agree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><em>Martin, </em>222 Or App at 146-47 (footnote omitted). We employed the same analysis in <em>State v. Salisbury, </em>223 Or App 516, 523, 196 P3d 1017 (2008), and concluded that, \u201ceven if the state is able to satisfy the requirements of ORS 133.033, it must also satisfy the requirements of the emergency aid doctrine.\u201d Indeed, contrary to the state\u2019s position that an argument based on ORS 133.033 necessarily does not include an argument under Article I, section 9, we have held that it is error for a trial court to rely solely on ORS 133.033 in upholding a warrantless search, because that statute does not establish an exception to the constitutional warrant requirement. <em>State v. Snyder, </em>227 Or App 544, 552, 206 P3d 1083 (2009). Thus, the determination that a warrantless search is authorized under ORS 133.033 implicitly incorporates a determination by the trial court that the requirements of the emergency aid doctrine under Article I, section 9, have been met. Without such a determination, the search is not a \u201clawful act,\u201d which is the only kind of act authorized by ORS 133.033.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Moreover, defendant expressly argued that the officer\u2019s warrantless entry violated Article I, section 9, and that the officer had failed to present \u201creasonable and articulable facts\u201d pointing \u201cto anything other than a verbal disturbance\u201d and that the facts did not satisfy the statutory requirement that there be an emergency. <em>Cf. Snyder, </em>227 Or App at 544 (rejecting the state\u2019s argument that the defendant failed to preserve his statutory claim of error by noting that he had specifically argued that the state had failed to prove that an emergency existed under Article I, section 9). The trial court was fully aware that defendant was making an argument under the statute and, as we have explained, that argument necessarily required the trial court to make a determination that the officer\u2019s warrantless search also fell within an exception to the warrant requirement of Article I, section 9. We conclude that defendant adequately preserved his argument under Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">As noted, the state concedes that the evidence available to Walker at the time he entered defendant\u2019s room did not demonstrate that a life was in immediate danger. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>agree. In <em>State v. Follett, </em>115 Or App 672, 680, 840 P2d 1298 (1992), <em>rev den, </em>317 Or 163 (1993), we held that the emergency aid doctrine applies if four conditions are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">\u201c(1) The police must have reasonable grounds to believe that there is an emergency and an immediate need for their assistance for the protection of life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\u201c(2) The emergency must be a true emergency \u2014 the officer\u2019s good faith belief alone is insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">\u201c(3) The search must not be primarily motivated by an intent to arrest or to seize evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201c(4) The officer must reasonably suspect that the area or place to be searched is associated with the emergency and that, by making a warrantless entry, the officer will discover something that will alleviate the emergency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">(Footnote omitted.) Moreover, in <em>State v. Burdick, </em>209 Or App 575, 581, 149 P3d 190 (2006), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">\u201c[A] \u2018true emergency\u2019 exists if there are reliable, objective indicia of a potential victim of a dangerous circumstance or a potential perpetrator of a dangerous act. Suspicious circumstances or \u2018gut instinct\u2019 are insufficient. The existence of an identifiable victim or perpetrator is significant because whether an emergency exists depends on whether immediate action is required (\u2018something that will alleviate the emergency\u2019), which, in turn, depends on the relationship between the gravity of the harm to be prevented and the probability that the harm will occur if action is not taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Here, the evidence in the record shows only that Walker overheard a loud argument that, in his words, was \u201cnot deescalating.\u201d The record does not contain any other objective indicia of a \u201cpotential victim of a dangerous circumstance or a potential perpetrator of a dangerous act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where police overhear a loud argument, unaccompanied by any sounds of \u201cphysical struggle or an indication that an act of violence ha[s] occured,\u201d a warrantless entry into a defendant\u2019s residence is not authorized by the emergency aid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>doctrine. <em>Salisbury, </em>223 Or App at 524.\u00ae It follows that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-5\"> Defendant was convicted of felony unlawful delivery of methamphetamine, ORS 485.890(2); felony unlawful possession of methamphetamine, ORS 475.894; felony unlawful possession of cocaine, ORS 475.884; and felony unlawful possession of a controlled substance schedule two, ORS 475.840(3)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\"> ORS 133.033 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\u201c(1) Except as otherwise expressly prohibited by law, any peace officer of this state, as defined in ORS 133.005, is authorized to perform community care-taking functions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">\u201c(2) As used in this section, \u2018community caretaking functions\u2019 means any lawful acts that are inherent in the duty of the peace officer to serve and protect the public. \u2018Community caretaking function\u2019 includes, but is not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">\u201c(a) The right to enter or remain upon the premises of another if it reasonably appears to be necessary to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">\u201c(A) Prevent serious harm to any person or property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">\u201c(B) Render aid to injured or ill persons; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">\u201c(C) Locate missing persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-13\">\u201c(b) The right to stop or redirect traffic or aid motorists or other persons when such action reasonably appears to be necessary to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-14\">\u201c(A) Prevent serious harm to any person or property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-15\">\u201c(B) Render aid to injured or ill persons; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-16\">\u201c(C) Locate missing persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-17\">\u201c(3) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of a peace officer that is inherent in the office or that is granted by any other provision of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-18\"> Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-19\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure; and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"> The trial court made few findings of fact, and we are bound by those findings to the extent that they are supported by evidence in the record. <em>State v.
