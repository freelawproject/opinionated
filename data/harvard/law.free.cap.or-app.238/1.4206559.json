J.</author>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Oregon Supreme Court, which vacated our prior opinion, <em>State v. Pratt, </em>227 Or App 364, 206 P3d 273 (2009) <em>(Pratt II), </em>in light of <em>State v. Lennon, </em>348 Or 148, 229 P3d 589 (2010). <em>State v. Pratt, </em>348 Or 461, 234 P3d 983 (2010). <em>Pratt II </em>was also before us on remand from the Supreme Court after that court vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Pratt, </em>205 Or App 559, 134 P3d 1053 (2006) <em>(Pratt I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). In <em>Pratt II, </em>we concluded that the trial court\u2019s imposition of a durational departure sentence on the basis of judicial factfinding was plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct that error because we could not say that there was no \u201clegitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found the same departure factor identified by the trial court. <em>Pratt II, </em>227 Or App at 367-68. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s overriding analysis in <em>Lennon, </em>we now affirm the trial court\u2019s imposition of the durational departure sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Defendant was convicted of four counts of robbery in the first degree and one count of assault in the second degree. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 144 months\u2019 imprisonment on one of the first-degree robbery counts, 90 months of which were imposed pursuant to ORS 137.700. The court gave the following reasons for its decision to impose a departure sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-6\">\u201c[0]n the Rob I, I am finding grounds to depart. Persistent involvement in behavior that continues to be assaultive, that\u2019s when we see [defendant], * * * The level of violence is escalating \u2014 of actual damage and injury is escalating. That is of course concerning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-7\">\u201cHe was on supervision at the time this event happened, and not only was he on supervision, but he was on supervision for another robbery. And he\u2019s shown himself so far\u2014 and I\u2019m talking about behavior, not expression of willingness to change \u2014 he has not been receptive to interventions. And I have got to say I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to get any more help from the penitentiary than he had available through the Juvenile Court system, and that hasn\u2019t worked. So there are departure grounds. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u2021 # <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-4\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: * * * Your Honor, [defendant] mentioned something that I should bring up. When the Court went through the departure factors, would you find that those departure factors, each of them, would be sufficient to support the departure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: I listed the ones I thought about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-6\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: You listed four, persistent involvement in assaultive behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-8\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: That alone. Escalation of violence, on supervision for attempted robbery and not receptive to treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes, I think they all are.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">Because we considered it to be dispositive, we confined our analysis in <em>Pratt II </em>to the departure factor of defendant\u2019s probation status at the time he committed his current offenses. Relying on our opinion in <em>State v. Allen, </em>198 Or App 392, 396, 108 P3d 651, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>202 Or App 565, 123 P3d 331 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 46 (2006), we explained that an upward departure sentence based on a defendant\u2019s supervisory status \u201crequire[d] further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his [supervisory] status to serve as an effective deterrent.\u201d We concluded that, on the record before us, we could not say that there was \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a trier of fact would have drawn that inference. Accordingly, we remanded the case for resentencing. <em>Pratt II, </em>227 Or App at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-11\">As noted, this case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court for reconsideration in light of that court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lennon. </em>There, the court rejected our conclusion, based on <em>Allen, </em>that the record must establish that there is no \u201clegitimate debate\u201d that a trier of fact would draw the inference that a defendant possessed a \u201cmalevolent quality.\u201d <em>Lennon, </em>348 Or at 157. Although the court did not consider as a departure factor the defendant\u2019s supervision status at the time he committed his current offense, the court\u2019s analysis of the \u201cfailure to deter\u201d departure factor illuminates what we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>now understand to be the proper analysis for the \u201csupervision status\u201d departure factor. As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-4\">\u201cTo find a failure to deter, the factfinder must infer that a defendant\u2019s prior criminal sanctions should have deterred the defendant from committing the current offense. Whether that inference follows from the defendant\u2019s prior criminal sanctions will depend on such factors as the number of past convictions or sanctions, when they occurred, and the kind of crimes that the defendant committed. A finding that those past criminal sanctions have not deterred a defendant from committing further crimes thus requires something beyond a conclusion that a defendant <em>has </em>one or more criminal convictions in his past. But a finding of a \u2018separate malevolent quality\u2019 is <em>not necessary. </em>If the record supports the factual inference that a defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions or sanctions should have, but did not, deter the defendant from committing his new offense or offenses, that factual finding can, in a proper case, support a departure sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 157 (first emphasis in original, second emphasis added; footnote omitted). Applying that principle in this case, we conclude that the dispositive issue is whether defendant was on probation or supervision when he committed his current offense. Here, defendant testified that he had supported himself while on probation for two prior attempted robberies by selling marijuana in downtown Portland; defendant also committed his current offenses \u2014 violent robberies \u2014 while on probation. We conclude, in light of defendant\u2019s testimony, that there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a trier of fact would have found that defendant committed his current offenses while on probation. Accordingly, although the trial court erred in imposing the durational departure sentence on the basis of its own judicial factfinding, we decline to exercise our discretion to correct that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">That is not the end of our inquiry, however, because, as we explained in <em>Pratt II:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-7\">\u201c[T]he trial court did not explicitly state that it was relying on the departure factors that it found, either singly or in combination, and therefore we assume that the court did not consider each factor to be independently sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>support a departure. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>111 Or App 147, 826 P2d 1010 (1992).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">227 Or App at 367.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As noted, the trial court identified four departure factors: (1) persistent involvement in similar offenses; (2) defendant\u2019s supervision status at the time of the current offense; (3) defendant\u2019s escalating pattern of violence; and (4) defendant\u2019s not having been receptive to treatment. As explained above, there is no legitimate debate that defendant was on probation at the time of his present offense. We also conclude that there is no legitimate debate that defendant had been persistently involved in similar offenses. With regard to the \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d factor, we apply the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis set out in <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 724, 160 P3d 983 (2007). There, the court held that \u201c\u2019[p]ersistent involvement in similar offenses\u2019 presents a factual issue that * * * a defendant may insist that a jury find beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">\u201cIn determining whether the record establishes \u2018[p]er-sistent involvement in similar offenses,\u2019 a sentencing court must do more than find that a defendant has two or more prior convictions for similar offenses. The trier of fact must infer from the number and frequency of those prior convictions whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in those offenses is \u2018persistent\u2019; that is, the trier of fact must determine whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in similar offenses is sufficiently continuous or recurring to say that it is \u2018persistent.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-6\"><em>Id. </em>Here, defendant testified that he had two prior convictions for attempted robbery, both of which occurred in October 2000, and for which defendant was on probation when he committed his present offense \u2014 a violent robbery\u2014 in January 2002. On this record, we conclude that there is no legitimate debate that a trier of fact would have drawn the inference of persistency required by <em>Bray. </em>Accordingly, there is no legitimate debate that a trier of fact would have found that defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>As to the final two departure factors, defendant\u2019s escalating pattern of violence and defendant not having been receptive to treatment, we do not have a controlling analysis from the Supreme Court, nor have we previously set out a framework for analyzing departures based on those factors. However, the court\u2019s analysis in <em>Lennon </em>does indicate that we need not conclude that a trier of fact would have drawn any inferences beyond a finding of the departure factor itself. <em>See id. </em>at 157. Thus, in determining whether there is a legitimate debate regarding whether a trier of fact would have found the same departure factors relied on by the trial court, we examine the strength of the evidence supporting that departure fact. <em>Cf. State v. Martina, </em>227 Or App 13, 16, 205 P3d 87, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 590 (2009) (finding no legitimate debate that jury would have found that defendant was under supervision at the time of his present crime where the defendant committed multiple violent assaults and manslaughter while on probation for an assault conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">We conclude that there is no legitimate debate that a trier of fact would have found that defendant\u2019s prior criminal acts and convictions demonstrated an escalating pattern of violence. Defendant committed his present crimes at age 19; at age 15, he threw a brick at the head of another child; and at age 17, he committed two attempted robberies. Similarly, the record here also establishes that there is no legitimate debate that a trier of fact would have found that defendant had not been receptive to treatment. The trial court explained its reliance on that sentencing factor when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-5\">\u201c[H]e\u2019s shown himself so far \u2014 and I\u2019m talking about behavior, not expression of willingness to change \u2014 he has not been receptive to interventions. And I have got to say I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to get any more help from the penitentiary than he had available through the Juvenile Court system, and that hasn\u2019t worked. So there are departure grounds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The pertinent evidence in the record with regard to that factor came from Dr. Colistro, who evaluated defendant in order to ascertain whether defendant was a \u201cdangerous offender\u201d under ORS 161.737. At defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, the prosecutor engaged Colistro in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u201cQ In reviewing the defendant\u2019s history, did you note whether or not he had been given opportunities to address his anger issues and his substance abuse issues and his cognitive difficulties with treatment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">\u201cQ And was there anything in those records regarding the defendant\u2019s amenability to treatment, his willingness to engage in treatment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">\u201cQ And what was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">\u201cA His attitude generally has been that he is not going to participate because he does not view himself as needing that kind of program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-9\">\u201cQ Have you reviewed the defendant\u2019s performance while under supervision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-11\">\u00abH? Hi * * Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-12\">\u201cQ And what was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-13\">\u201cA He consistently acts as if he\u2019s not under supervision. As soon as he\u2019s back in the community, he resumes the same lifestyle that he assumed prior to incarceration. He associates with the same sorts of people, use of drugs and gets involved in the same sorts of crimes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-14\">Defendant presented no countervailing evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From the foregoing, we conclude that there is no legitimate debate that a trier of fact would have found that defendant had not been receptive to treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-15\">In conclusion, there is no legitimate debate that a trier of fact would have found each of the four departure factors relied on by the trial court. Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b26-7\"> The state argues that this conclusion is erroneous, relying on the same language from the sentencing colloquy set out above. We need not address the state\u2019s argument in light of our conclusion below that no legitimate debate exists as to each of the departure factors identified by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b28-17\"> Defendant did testify that he intended to obtain treatment in the future; however, that testimony did not contradict Colistro\u2019s testimony regarding defendant\u2019s <em>previous </em>receptiveness to treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
