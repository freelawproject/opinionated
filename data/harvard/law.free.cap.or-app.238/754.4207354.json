We write to address only his contention that the trial court erred in admitting two experts\u2019 diagnoses of child sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence supporting those diagnoses, <em>see State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), and reject his remaining contentions without discussion. Specifically, defendant asserts that, pursuant to the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Southard, </em>the trial court erred when, in the absence of physical evidence, it admitted a diagnosis of child sexual abuse by a CARES nurse and a provisional diagnosis of child sexual abuse from a clinical social worker. Although defendant did object to the admission of the diagnoses on various bases, it is unclear that any of his objections were sufficient to preserve his current argument that admission of the diagnoses was improper for the reasons addressed in <em>Southard. </em>However, regardless of whether defendant\u2019s assertion was properly preserved, the trial court\u2019s error in admitting that evidence is plain error and, for the reasons expressed in <em>State v. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App 515, 522, 228 P3d 666 (2010), and State <em>v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 513-14, 228 P3d 688 (2010), we exercise our discretion to correct it. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
