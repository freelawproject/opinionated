Ultimately, after a series of particularly unpleasant encounters, petitioner sought a stalking protective order (SPO) against respondent under ORS 163.732(1). After a brief hearing at which neither party was represented by counsel, the trial court ruled that \u201cthe statutory criteria for this [stalking protective] order have been met.\u201d Respondent appeals. Under ORS 19.415(3)(b), which went into effect before the notice of appeal was filed in this case, we can choose between reviewing the court\u2019s findings <em>de novo </em>or applying our usual standard of review. Neither party requests <em>de novo </em>review, and we do not choose to exercise it. We therefore review the facts for any evidence and the legal conclusions based on those facts for errors of law. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Respondent raises three assignments of error: (1) Petitioner failed to establish the two or more alarming, unwanted contacts which are a necessary predicate for obtaining an SPO; (2) The court committed several procedural errors, including failing to inform respondent of his right to counsel and failing to allow him to present witnesses on his behalf; (3) The SPO is unlawfully broad, in that it would prevent respondent from continuing to live in his home. We agree with respondent\u2019s first argument, thereby obviating the need to address the other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\"> Under ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B), a court may enter an SPO if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">\u201c(i) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">\u201c(ii) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">\u201c(iii) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Thus, to obtain an SPO, a petitioner must establish, at a minimum, that, on at least two occasions, the respondent contacted the petitioner while subjectively \u201caware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d that the contact was \u201cunwanted by the recipient, and then consciously and unreasonably disregard that risk.\u201d <em>Delgado v. Souders, </em>334 Or 122, 133, 46 P3d 729 (2002). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">\u201cUnder Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution, unwanted contacts that involve speech are subject to a heightened standard of proof. To qualify as a predicate unwanted contact, any contact that involves speech must be a threat \u2014 that is, the sort of communication that \u2018instills in the addressee a fear of imminent and serious personal violence from the speaker, is unequivocal, and is objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.\u2019 <em>State v. </em>Rangel, 328 Or 294, 303, 977 P2d 379 (1999).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\"><em>Jennings v. Gifford, </em>211 Or App 192, 196, 154 P3d 163 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">With those standards in mind, we review the contacts in this case, presuming, as we must under our standard of review, that all of petitioner\u2019s accusations for which there is any evidence are true \u2014 despite respondent\u2019s testimony that he did not \u201cknow anything what the hell she\u2019s talking about and basically I think it\u2019s all hogwash.\u201d <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487, 443 P2d 621 (1968) (we presume that, absent express findings, the trial court implicitly found disputed issue of fact consistent with outcome). Petitioner accuses respondent of \u201clooking in [her] windows,\u201d appearing at her workplace (a restaurant), mowing her front lawn without her permission, appearing in her driveway to talk about an incident of vandalism (petitioner does not accuse respondent of the vandalism itself), and meeting with her ex-husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">We can imagine circumstances in which such contacts could support an SPO. However, in order to do so, petitioner would have to present <em>some </em>evidence that, at the time he made the contacts, respondent knew or should have known that they were unwanted. Petitioner did testify that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u201cat one point,\u201d her fianc\u00e9 told respondent not to come on petitioner\u2019s property, and that she posted a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign, apparently with respondent\u2019s name on it. She also testified that, in late 2008 or early 2009, she had a friend who is a former police officer warn respondent to avoid contact. But the only evidence that would place the contacts in the context of the warnings is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And since that time [when the officer warned respondent to stay away], have you had any contact with [respondent]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">\u201cPETITIONER: Just \u2014 nothing\u2014-just some whistling across the street, nothing major in that area until about a week-and-a-half ago when he showed up in my driveway, talking about the [vandalism] situation * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Thus, the record is not clear as to whether more than one unwanted contact occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Even if the court could have found that two unwanted contacts occurred, the court could not have inferred that <em>any </em>of the contacts were coercive or caused petitioner any alarm. There is no testimony to that effect. We therefore conclude that, although it was clearly in the parties\u2019 best interest to avoid each other, the facts as related to the court do not establish a sufficient basis for issuing an SPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
